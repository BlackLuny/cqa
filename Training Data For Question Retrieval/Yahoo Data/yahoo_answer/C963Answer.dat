XAlCd8Ebaa	I saw the bald guy with sunglasses on keyboards, and for a moment I, too, thought it was Paul. But when they lined up at the end I saw that it wasn't him. I don't know who it was.|`|RAnBl0JFaa	No Paul Sucks.     But Max wineberg  from Max wineberg 7 on conan obrien did|`|XrCc85kNaa	Nobody wants to play with that gay band.....|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	No he did not|`|ZyHPOzdWaa	Yep.  Good eyes:-))
cdQryr7paa	What "media" are you talking about?  The announcers on NBC both acknowledged it as a fumble as soon as it happened, even before the replay.  It's wild how many people are making excuses why the Steelers won.  If this was a regular season game, would all this whining be happening?|`|15wwA3jjaa	Because they realize the officials dropped the ball big time on that play and they don't want to expose the screw job that went down last night.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	bought off|`|mUG8XtNpaa	They didn't ignore it, it just wasn't as questionable a call as many people thought it to be.    You guys forget - there was a penalty called on the play, add the time it took to gather with the other officials to determine what occured on the play, and the time it took for the Cards offense/Steelers defense to come off the field, and the Cards defense/Steelers offense to come on the field - that's a LOT of time for the booth upstairs to look at the play. They had wayyyyyy more time than people think they did.     It was a fumble, the ball was forced out PRIOR to his arm going forward, but Keisel's frame was pushed up against Warner, so the ball didn't fall to the ground, but it was still out of Warner's control. The refs made the right call.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	stop already with the excuses. It was a fumble and it was looked at and confirmed.|`|WTQtchbvaa	It was reviewed by the booth. You think they just let plays like that slide when 150 million people are watching?|`|kV53Roz1aa	It wasn't Warner's fault...    That's on his OLine who couldn't protect him with only a 3 man rush.    Yes... a TD pass was possible... they've been making big plays all year...    It was CLEARLY a fumble.  It doesn't matter if his arm is coming foward if he doesn't have control of the ball!  Watch the play again... Warner has his arm ****** back... Woodley gets his hand on the ball... Warner starts to throw but at that point he has no control of the ball.  The right call was made.    Rigged?  Please!|`|OUKKNF1eaa	it was looked at in the booth, and it was a fumble.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I was for the Cards, but after seeing the replay, the ball came out just before Warner's arm started forward motion.|`|XHharKJgaa	Because the Cardinals needed a real miracle to even get the pass completed. Did you see Warner? He was surrounded, he was just going to sling the pigskin and wherever it went, it went.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	alot of people need tissues....cry babies|`|myZB9DV3aa	how tha hell is that "the pinnacle of the game"????    DO you HONESTLY think he would have been able to lob a 55 yard TD pass in the remaining 10 seconds??? It didn't matter, the game was as good as over.|`|932b9cfe7a05bb25d03a132b597eff85aa	It looked a tad rigged.  But then again - the Steelers were in the superbowl so it probably was rigged.    No - i'm not a Arizona fan.  I live on the east coast.  I have watched both recent Stealer superbowls and both seemed rigged.|`|vFasAFBUaa	it was close but yes it was a fumble|`|1qyMhjkraa	his arm was going forward.|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	How did they ignore it?  It was televised for the whole world to see.|`|MDhI4mBEaa	I was rooting for the Steelers, but that was a incomplete pass IMO.|`|khZOrG9Qaa	Whether or not the play was reviewed it would have gone a long way for the lead ref to come out and say after reviewing the play the ruling on the field stands.      I consider myself a football fan.  I just love the game but over the last 3 years I feel that the game has lost its gusto.  Too many games are being won or lost on bad calls.    I think comments like those made by the late waste of space John Madden are what ruin football.  I firmly believe that Harrisons left elbow was down on the ground before the ball crossed the plain of the endzone.  Yet up in the booth you have John Madden saying when a man makes a play like that you give him the touchdown even if he is short.  NO NO NO you dont that is not what football is.    The Holmes catch was close what bothers me about the catch is that his feet were crossed and one was ontop of the other and the one on the bottom was barely touching the ground and that makes it hard for me to think the other one on top was.  Yet it was close and I can understand there not being undisputable evidence to overturn.      The reason the media overlooked everything is because this was supposed to be good for football.  Steelers win record 6th Super bowl.  and the cardinals barely miss winning the big game against all odds.      Football is becoming more and more of a sham and I am thinking about watching Golf cuz atleast there the ref cant determine the outcome of the game.  Were in the NFL they always do.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It's possible, but it's too early to say. A lot of guys' arm strength varies over their careers (ie Tom Brady's went way up, Chad Pennington's went way down). I think you need to wait until his NFL career is over to make that kind of comparison. Whether he has the strongest arm of any college quarterback is debatable.|`|ABoo1doVaa	If by all time you mean this season, then yes. Over the last 5 years possibly, but I think Brady Quinn has just as strong of an arm, and Jamarcus Russell has a stronger arm. As for all time all time, then no chance. Elway and Randall Cunningham had stronger arms for sure, and Namath probably had a stronger arm.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	No, Chuck Norris has the strongest arm of all time football wise I would say JaMarcus Russell he sucks but he has a strong arm I heard he would throw a ball 60 yards on his knees during practice.|`|eOQ8rGqCaa	Yes, Its very possible, looking at this guys arm, if he works out, and puts everything he has into it he could have a great arm, however it is so early in his career, but to answer your question it is more than possible, he can get stronger, and weaker, I mean his arm is already 1000000 times stronger than Chad Penningtons (I actually like the guy alot, great guy really nice, very accurate passer), but then again isn't everyones arm?|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Please. All time? He's got the best arm in this draft and he should be a good qb at the next level but best arm of all time? Of course, the state of Texas does produce some good quarterbacks, if they would just stay home for college.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!

AA11269100	My guys, the Australian Socceroo's have just knocked our socks off. This whole tournament, they have exceeded expectations and lifted an entire nation to a level of pride not felt for a very long time. To win one game was enough for Aussie supporters. To qualify for the final 16 is something that we always thought they could do but celebrated like they won the world cup. Australia is a very proud nation today thanks to these great men that represent us with such guts and determination. Sorry for the ramble but it's just so great for Australian football.|`|7af1f8e6154f8bf0e1c1d5a55819649eaa	Germany is palying Sweden next round and Switzerland is palying to qualify tomorrow.|`|AA11562202	My team, Ghana, just made it to the second round today. They scored 2-1 against the USA and meet Brazil in the next round. With the way they played Czech, they can play good against Brazil if the bring the same game back. I am pround of them for coming this far because they were in the group of death and everyone wrote them off. This is their first time in the WC and they have made a good showing. They have played and beaten numbers 2(Czech) and 5(USA) whilst they are ranked number 48. That is a very good showing for debutants.|`|1b7b538975dd16361230b444851f7247aa	My team finished first in its group with a crazy awesome goal differential.  2 wins, 1 draw, 8 goals for, and 1 goal against.

It was popularized in the late 70's by The Z-Boys who became some of the first professional skateboarders. The Zephyr team was originally a surf team in Santa Monica, California. Since the tide went out around noon, they would skateboard in the afternoon. Famous Z-Boys were Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams.

In the back there are several ads for numismatic (raters of collectible goods) that you can contact.  Ads found in the sports cards magazines would be your best bet as they will be more knowledgeable on sports memorabilia.

IMu3wBu8aa	Both Kane and Taker should win. I really want to see The Brother's of Destruction take over No Way Out. :)     I really want Kane to win. I might change my mind about Taker once I see the next two entrants! :) If Kennedy is one of the entrants...well he's my pick for who I want to win!|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Well, I would love to see Kane win it for RAW. He's a great wrestler, and he has more than paid his dues the WWE. Heck, he's paid enough dues to cover the entire RAW roster. I just love his gimmick, he executes it so well, he has from day one, and he's still going strong. Although I doubt that he will win, Cena will likely retain because WWE needs him to hype Wrestlmania, hey, he can publicize it, you can't blame him for that. For Smackdown, I would love seeing Big Show win it. I just think that he character suits the chamber the best. Taker's gimmick supports the chamber better, but all of Taker's finishers take a long time. Big Show uses a classic, yet devastating, knockout punch, and bam, it's over. Big Show's ability to take out opponents with a single punch makes him a favorite in my book. Both of those are very unlikely, as the current champs, John Cena and Edge, are the best in their matches at hyping and building up to the big event. I like Kane and Big Show, but I expect to see Edge and John Cena.|`|K7JfRjzMaa	Who I WANT to win:    RAW - Kane or Jericho  SmackDown - The Big Show    But who I KNOW will win:    RAW - John Cena  SmackDown - Edge|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Raw: Y2J so we can have a good match at Mania Y2J vs RKO  SD: I want Taker to win but I doubt it will happen..|`|mVH5LqMuaa	colin deleny|`|tiI5w8LHaa	for raw i want cena to win and on smackdown im tor between HHH and taker.|`|CK8oRi9faa	cena and triple h|`|Kecfbgm5aa	just a quick note that at smackdowns recent double tapings SPOILER COMING UP that vladimir and jeff hardy are in the chamber for sd. i want to see edge retain and jericho to win but cena and edge will without a doubt win. anyome really gonna buy wm for a knox/orton match|`|9ijwrcTZaa	RAW, ABC (Anyone But Cena)    SmackDown; HHH|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Raw: Kane should win his first World Heavyweight title after 12 years..

What we need is for Mustafa Shakur to step it up again and start leading this team again like he was before. Ever since he stopped producing as much we've been struggling. If he can start playing so well again we can definetly get back on track again. We need to beat Oregon though. After Oregon we are going to have to deal with both USC and UCLA next and if we can beat Oregon we will have a lot of confidence going into that week and should atleast be able to beat USC. Even if we lose to UCLA, if we win the rest of our games and do well in the Pac-10 tourny we could probably get a 4 or even 3 seed in the NCAA tourny.|`|9e2f88537df225cfa69491089f60bbfcaa	Lute lost his touch when Bobbi died, and I really don't think he's got it back.

I have no problem with him, but i don't want him to be shoved down my throat, thank you very much|`|JiCfYfLraa	they always make him look weak especially to john cena when in a real match jericho would dominate john cena. john cena is overrated and i hate that he is a decent wrestler but they put him as the best when half of the raw roster is better then him like chris jericho my favorite,randy orton,kane, and cm punk. im tired of john cena i been tired of him he is overrated and chris jericho is the true champion they always make jericho look weak because they know jericho dominates and would outshine john cena. the wwe is shoving john cena down our throats.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	WWE is killing his character..|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Jericho is sadly being bumped down to the midcard.

EHK1RzpAaa	I know its bullshit, why waste money on EC and promo when the outcome is ******* obvious. And if Cena wins it means that Orton will have to face a **** opponent (Cena) at WM25!!! unless he goes for the WWE championship. and yea WTF with WWE making jericho tap in less then 10 seconds|`|AA10691319	the reason they do that is because he is their biggest draw.  the more he wins-the more fans get into the match-the more tickets and merchandise gets sold.|`|RhgB9qnEaa	true i agree lets just pray that wwe lost their heads and make kofi the new champion|`|AA10576394	Cena has lost a lot of matches, so that is a moot point.  But I do understand that the same old story DOES get a little boring.  But if he is to lose the title, I would rather it be to anyone but Jericho.  I like the unexpected, and not the 50/50 chance that it will be Cena or Jericho.

j9GokH9Qaa	it was okay a 5/10.. I mean the only good match was Kofi and Rey vs Mike Knox and Kane.. The only part that got me excited was when Kane won.. and he was qualified for the Elimination Chamber match.. I was wanting that the whole week.. Good that Kanes in it xD besides that.. I really didnt like it.. the backstage promo was also good..  I got pissed during the main event because Jericho lost to Cena AGAIN! It is so freaking annoying.. Jericho never won against Cena.. he won 0 times against Cena.. and lost 4.. we all know Jericho got more talent than Cena.. He used the same moves over and over again during the match.. it made me laugh..|`|37PYnKr9aa	I dont pay attention to it anymore.|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	tonight's raw was not godd|`|RhgB9qnEaa	4.5/10 only good was kofi,rey vs kane.knox|`|8vAxlg2Daa	I have a few problems with the storyline.

He has his own stable, he's even with the McMahon family as far as legal rights go (in the story that is) and he has just about every big story on RAW. Randy will win just to get him over and make it look like he's controlling the McMahons with fear for a while. Then Vince will come back and "put him in his place" and he'll just be the top dog, and not so much a guy that practically owns the owners.|`|RhgB9qnEaa	who won the royal rumble who will wrestle at wrestlemania RANDY ORTON|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Randy..unless somebody interferes|`|CK8oRi9faa	randy "rko" orton|`|232SYfGHaa	I think Shane will win because it will make a better storyline.

For guys who's heat rises (Cornerbacks, Safeties, Wide outs) and falls quickly and don't need to have skin tight shirts (like running backs and stuff) it's good. it keeps you warm and cool at the same time. However, if anyone grabs you, that baby's gonna rip to shreds. It's nothing more than a hi-tech windbraker. It's old technology with a new purpose.

Steve Nash makes the other two look better with his assists. If Nash was traded it would make the team collapse because there is a lack of balance because Nash gives the ball to everyone no matter if you're a starter or buried at the end of the bench. Without Nah another point guard will probably give the ball to Amari and Shawn all the time and shut everyone else out. So Nash is the best!!!!!!|`|b03a23c4a13e81573b2f7c0ffd152024aa	I would answer this by saying that all three of them are the best at what they each do specifically.

Usually during the draft, they don't have cameras set up at the home nor do they invite potential 6th or 7th rounders to the draft as they generally have minimal name value outside of a RB or QB from a big name program that didnt perform well (ala Tom Brady, Marc Bulger, etc.) enough to be drafted early on.|`|AA10405966	I think it was Vernon Davis (guy with dreadlocks?) drafted by San Francisco number 6 in the first round.  "Tight end Vernon Davis, who opened eyes by running a 4.38 40 at the combine, wept when he learned San Francisco had taken him sixth."    http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/...    Assuming he's the guy you are looking for.  He's a TE for SF.  He suffered a hairline fracture in his leg earlier in the year, but is suppose to resume playing this weekend.    " It's unlikely Davis will start, but Nolan's words seem to indicate he will get the rookie on the field. He was scheduled to originally return last week at Detroit, but was held back another week.

Here is the article:    BAY HARBOR ISLANDS, Fla., Sept. 13 (UPI) -- Hulk Hogan's 16-year-old son was uninjured when the yellow Lamborghini he had been driving burst into flames in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla.     "It was a terrible accident," Hogan's publicist Elizabeth Rosenthal told Wednesday's Miami Herald. "Nothing more, nothing less."     Hogan was driving the 2001 Lamborghini Diablo VT through a residential area when he reportedly smelled a burning odor coming from inside the vehicle. He got out to take a look just before the car burst into flames.     The car belonged to Cecile Barker, chairman of SoBe Entertainment, the record label attached to his sister.     The car was charred beyond recognition.     Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman Paul Perry said the incident was not suspicious.     "It was a normal car fire," Perry said. "It happens a bunch of times every day and nobody notices."

AA10405966	From the way you worded your question, I assume this doesn't happen to you in practice or  during scrimmages.  That tells me it's all in your head.  Just relax and play like you practice.  Don't force it or try too hard.  It'll come.  Show patience.|`|1bca8778667344668310f75da27b05feaa	Take the time to learn how to dribble with your head up.  I used to go out when I knew no one would be on the court and would run up and down the length of the court trying to dribble with your head up.  It works.  After that you can practice learning how to pass the ball right off the dribble with like a push pass.  You will need to find a outdoor handball court so you don't have to keep running after the ball.  Good luck.
AA10405966	It's when a player doesn't play their freshman year (academic year).    Each player gets 4 years of playing eligibility.  So they use their first one their second year or school.  This allows them to practice,  improve, mature, learn the plays, etc and save a year of eligibility.    So a 'red-shirted freshman' is playing in his first year, but academically he would be a sophomore.|`|AA11526106	The other posts are on track in that "red shirt" players practice with the team and go to school, but they don't play in the games that season.  Usually it is done on incoming freshmen football players so that they can adapt to the team's system, bulk up, and improve on skills that they might need help on.  It also helps them get used to college, because your first year of college can be exciting but also a time of great change in your life.    Though it hasn't been mentioned, there is also a medical "red shirt".  This is for student-athletes that have an injury that will keep them from playing most, if not all, of the season.  They can take a "red shirt" year and not lose a year of eligibility during their season off.|`|bc0af676eb2525e58e7cf95c335579c5aa	A red shirted freshman is...    A freshman athlete who does not officially play on a sports team.  This way he can take a year to learn, practice and still retain four years of eligibility to actually play after his freshman "redshirted" year.|`|31f0ec2f010e9551e0e5807db350da9eaa	When a player gets "red shirted" it means they are not allowed to participate in any of the the games during that season.  At the same time, they do not lose a year of eligibility (i.e. they can play for 4 more years).  Therefore, when they are academically a sophomore, the will be a "red shirt freshman" playing their first of 4 years.  So when you're a 5th year senior, you will be a "red shirt senior"|`|AA10164444	college players are given only 4 years of eligibility.  if they don't play on the field for the entire season, the coach has the option to 'redshirt' that player.      Players are only given 1 redshirt season.    They might get an additional redshirt season for injury.  i'm not sure.|`|2151d64a6f61cbba34c3aa60ea53b262aa	when you are a frehman if you redshirt you don't play games but you practice with the team  Even thoough that is your freshman year you still get another fresman, sophomore,junion, and senipr year

549299b839806ec30938bd344d658a5daa	Muhammed. He will go off against the Vikes. The vikings will stop the run. The Bears will bomb it all over them. Look for at least 80 yards and a TD.     Other reasons:    - The best way to beat the Vikings is to spread them out a la patriots in week 8.    - The ravens will run. The bengals secondary has been decent lately and Lewis will get the bulk of the load.    - The Vikes secondary (Smoot, Winfield, Griffin, etc.) suck. I am a vikings fan and have watched them all season.|`|AA11969967	Go for Mushin, the Vikings have a swiss cheese (very holey) secondary, and if the Bears do it right, they can get a lot of passing yards...|`|fdf5bb03343dc028b17ba7cf2cce719eaa	Mushin: The Vikings have a very good run defense. Therefore having seen the Vikes lose to the pass happy Patriots,Muhammed would be your better pick. The Bengals are up against the Baltimore Ravens whose defense against the pass is one of the best in the league.|`|476f2c4c2923899a31b1bc185363081caa	I'm deciding between Clayton and R. Caldwell. Research (Fox Sports) has revealed that Thursday is probably bringing hard rain for the Ravens, which would probably put more emphasis on a running game for Baltimore.|`|AA10405966	I think I'd play Clayton.  The Balt offense isn't what they use to be.  They (Baltimore and Clayton) have been putting up pretty good numbers. Grossman has been so hot and cold, Muhammed is more a gamble.
23f370cc44a73f3464e2fd2b1c2c700caa	In week 13 I would start Torry Holt, because he is too good not to turn it around, I have him too and I am hoping that this is the week he breaks out, Terrance Copper, because Drew Brees is on FIRE and he is going against a weak San Francisco defense, and Jericho Cotchery because he is playing the weak Green Bay defense that has given up 21 passing touchdowns, tied for worst in the league. I would not start Edwards because he is openly criticizing Charlie Frye, and therefore probably not going to get the ball, Reggie Brown because I don't think Jeff Garcia can get him the ball, and I think that if Mark Bulger throws a TD pass this week, it will most likely be to Holt, not Bruce. Good luck.|`|4e00f4b9f7943a426bc9339e11d1c940aa	Torry holt, Reggie Brown and Jericho Cotchery    simple, you dont start 2 receivers from the same team, you pick the one that is going to have the best day from that team, and Cotchery will dominate a tired secondary     later|`|f461d7ec8f44732a1ace9f3a4dd53dcdaa	ALWAYS play Holt!   Cotchery is a good play due to GB lack of DEF  Cooper is a Good play as well due to Brees being of FIRE!    Edwards sucks cause he's from UM and plays for a sorry a** team  Brown will get little looks due to the over powering line and linbackersof CAR. They will get to garcia often!  Bruce hardly gets looks or TD's|`|6cbfc418262dacbfe3047ec49390964faa	Holt, Brown, and Cotchery|`|AA10405966	I'd go with Holt, Edwards, Cotchery    Holt - Even though he hasn't been great lately, he's by far, the best of your WRs, so I'd play him.  Edwards and Cotchery because, I think, they are the best of the rest.  I may think about Copper...if later in the week you get more news on Colston.  If he doesn't play, I may swap out Edwards.    Here's who I wouldn't play, and why.    Brown is on a rapid downward spiral.  With no McNabb and Stallworth healthy, I think his numbers will be bad.  And Bruce isn't the receiver he use to be.
AA10405966	21    He signed  21 on his rookie card (05/06)...which is taken before the season starts.  So I don't know how he could have had another number before that.  Plus he was  21 in college.  http://cgi.ebay.com/ANTOINE-WRIGHT-05-06...|`|37b81e2be77b9bc1f382778c0cdbc994aa	I believe it was  1.
AA10405966	I don't know how many receivers you start, I assume 3, but I'll rank all of them.    You have a good WR corp.    1 Marvin Harrison (I know he's probably burned you recently, as he's done me...but I think Indy/Payton will start to get him the ball, as they'll need him ready to go in the playoffs.  Stay with him, he'll bounce back eventually)  2 Donald Driver - he's still Farve's go-to guy  3 Roy Williams    4 Bernard Berrian  5 Lavernauus Coles  6 Joe Horn    I think you are right about Colston being limited if he plays...BUT, even limited, I think he's a better play than Clark.  So if by Sunday it sounds like he's gonna go, I'd plug him into your lineup.    Good luck, my fingers are crossed that Harrison will be big for us this weeK!|`|716a2d14a5f6ace3c9850b9797a1c026aa	I would go with Coles, Harrison and Horn but he is questionable and with Colston questionable and I feel he will not play so Horn will get alot of balls. But if Horn doesn't play go with Driver.|`|AA11930227	Im a die hard 49er fan. I would play Horn and Colston if hes healthy enough. Our secondary isnt very strong and we struggle on the road even though were having an incredibly strong season then expected.|`|AA10785898	I think Colston will play, and be decent.  I don't trust Rex Grossman (and thus Clark) right now.    I'm guessing you need three WRs.  Driver has been hot.  Never bench Marvin Harrison, even though he isn't as good as last year.  Go with Roy Williams.  Any scoring Detriot does against NE will go through the air.  Kevin Jones is till hurting...|`|AA11762784	Horn and Harrison stand out to me.  Horn is getting well at the right time, with Brees going for 300 every week and them playing SF this week = big numbers for horn. and if you ever bench Harrison, then I would rather not help you, lol.       Clark has foot issues, so either TE present health issues.  that being said, Colston is where I would go|`|AA11431319	Your best bet is J.Horn, Ro. Williams,  M.Harrison horn is going against the 49ers & their defence back give up to many big plays Ro. Williams is a no brainer & M. Harrison is going against Tennesse with Harrison not showing much the last 3 games you know is perfect time to put up some big numbers.

Play some soccer.|`|bb06ab89a15a6eea5306f8b8eea22af7aa	First, I am sorry that this will be so long but I believe in COMPLETE ANSWERS and not just a few words and a link.    I can understand your problem, but being a coach for over 25 years will make me biased.    They are both TEAM things and you have to decide what is more important BEFORE YOU COMMIT to BOTH. You just can not expect either team to adjust to YOUR scheduling problems.    You also did not mention your age so I do not know the level of competition of either activity.    I coached a PREMIER U-19 girls team for two years and we had a tournament on the same weekend as the Prom ( I KNOW, Prom is a BIG DEAL).  Well four KEY players showed up at the tournament LATE in a limo and in their prom dresses, changed into their gear and expected to play the whole match.  I sent them on a 4 MILE jog with gatoraide to get the "FUN" out of their system and wake them up.  We were down 2-0 using the players that had shown up on time and put the "Party Girls" in for the last 15 minutes after I had UNLOADED on them.  I made them SO ANGRY at me they scored three goals to simply prove me wrong; that is what a coach does.    If you are in high school, you simply have to decide which one you like the most and do it.  If you choose soccer, you will also be expected to do track or cross country for cross training and that will take a TON of TIME.    Soccer and Drama do NOT cross at ALL and either will probably have a NEGATIVE influence upon the other.    If you choose drama then get on the debate team to cross-train or even cheerleader because they will compliment each other.    If you choose soccer, JUST DO IT and focus upon your GRADES and the complimentary cross-training.    To EXCEL at soccer takes a HUGE committment that many are just not prepared for.    I privately trained a girl for over six years from the time she was almost 12.  She was a starter as a freshman  at a DI school on a full ride.    Her mom drover her 2 HOURS one-way twice a week and she did her homework in the car.  The other days(seven days a week) she trained on her own and played 3 times a week.    Drama has to be WAY EASIER!    The best of luck in whatever you choose.    Jacques|`|545790cab9de168243c4435268855ac0aa	Like the person said before me. What is more important to you? If you decide which one, you will have to drop one, you can't keep letting these two clubs interfere on the same day. You could always join another club that isn't on the same day.     I had Honor Society meetings the same day as the ITs academic team. I dropped Honor society cause it was boring and the people were snobby and annoying.  That may have not been a good choice since colleges love members of the honor society. But I wasn't about to do something that I had no heart for.     Personally based on the circumstances I would say go to the soccer game. Its just a club meeting, not a play or anything important. But in the game, you have other players counting on you. If you do follow my advice you could always drop it and come back after soccer season. I use to play soccer and I hope you have a good game. =)|`|80e0bbd53ef1e7347411ebb4e0f57660aa	Tell your drama teacher or whoever in charge that your football team really need you in your team and asked her/him to let you do the footy first then joined the drama club. It is hard indeed but I think you can handle that two activities. Good luck with the game and the drama club!|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	Football and drama usually go hand in hand
eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	I do. Can't wait till their first play-off game where they will get rolled up @ home!|`|53800bb27ab2bca67a48174d5076e853aa	You can say that about anyteam.  For instance, the badgers, they only played one good team which they lost.  They played against Michigan.    I don't think the Bears are overrated.  Thats a biased answer because I'm a Bears fan.  Anyways, they've shown improvment over the last couple seasons.  I remember 3 seasons ago there bearly won 6 games.  What makes them look bad is Rex Grossman.  Take Rex Grossman out of the Picture and look at the team.  Mushin Mouhammod, Brenard Berrian, Oleuvtz(Center), Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, Tommie Harris, Tank Johnson, Ian Scott, Devin Hester.  ETC ETC.  There are many many more.  Back to the point.  Another reason they look over rated is because of the media.  Like what was that college team that won most of its games but got no respect from ESPN because it didn't play anyone noticeable.    What else..... All of the teams have their up and downs.  Look at The Steelers.  Right now the Bears are up.  Soon they will fall and the Arizona Cardials will rise up.  KS Chiefs looked good for that one year.      Overall, I don't think the Bears are overrated.  They just seem that way because there is no one else good in their division.  I mean come on, the Packers, Vikings, Detroit....|`|AA11521395	No|`|12f694b8fe7294363bc862276927f9d5aa	no the bears arent over rated they have one of if not the best defense in the league yes Grossman struggles but the bears are undefeated in games where he throws just 1 touchdown pass but that doesnt matter if youve noticed the bears win without him,like when he has 8 turnovers but they still beat the cardinals. A man by the name of Devin Hester will lead them on special teams and Brian Urlacher will always make sure that tough bears defense shows up|`|ade2bf1d8a67a8f84f31aa8d0b5a8e6eaa	kinda.|`|363c83746738e6706d4df5b9ca983836aa	Offensively yes, mainly because of Rex Grossman (bastard ruined my fantasy team :-(    ).    Defensively, NO. They are so outstanding on defense and on special teams (Hester, anyone?) that they are more than making up for their crappy play.    Grossman's getting back into a groove by the looks of it, so maybe the O will shape up.    Just not enough to beat any premier playoff teams (Saints, Cowboys, and eventually whatever powerhouse from the AFC they have to lose to).|`|adb2ca04e6d4528745a3ebf1ff15b72daa	yes. Great team, great defense, but a Quarterback who can piss it all away anytime. Grossman sucks.|`|AA10534992	yeah and they keep wining ugly against sub par teams but the patriots barley won all the way through Superbowl's|`|AA12040536	They have a great defense     but I don't think there QB is good, all he really has do do is not make stupid mistakes, and he can't even do that     eventually the bears will need to lean on him, and he and them will fall|`|98eda994f36d94e3a895617fed45fccfaa	They're definitely overrated.  They've beaten up on bad teams and injured teams. Some very ordinary offenses have had no problem moving the football against their defense.|`|6603706a0139e6a64a1e571661478617aa	yep, they have a very questionable offense, and they are overrated on defense.if your a bear fan look back to their super bowl team, that was a defense, but they could score.one last thought ( my opinion only ) ditka was not a genuis...ryan was close..rate the coaching staff and then place your bet.|`|AA10404843	When the playoffs start we will know if they are contenders or pretenders.|`|AA11414524	I will have to disagree. Many people will say that because they don't win in a way that the media darlings like (i.e. throw the ball all over the place and score 45 points per game).    The Bears win with an amazing defense and a ball-control offense that manages to do just enough. And yes, despite a QB who absolutely sucks.|`|a60ec48ca85446234d1613a4584daadeaa	The giants are a decent team.|`|b44f42e86833b7eed016c290e03c1254aa	thank you finally someone agrees|`|bc2b59b7c267004f3cc309b8048b3f95aa	what do you mean overrated i rarley hear about them on ESPN

Eyp7TfXoaa	WHIP is walks and hits per innings pitched. I don't think it's a very good way to determine a pitchers worth simply because the numbers are so micro-precise.    I believe that a pitcher should be judged based on his E.R.A, his opponents batting average against him, and his strikeouts per nine innings pitched.|`|RDcce9Fmaa	it is ratio of walks / hits to innings pitched  --  it is an       indicator of a pitcher's effectiveness  --  personally  i  use       1.20 as a base line  --  you'll find the better pitchers below       this level & their other stats will usually reflect this ratio --       for relievers  i  use  base line of 1.10  --  you'll find the       consistently top relievers in this area  --  there will generally       be a handfull of pichers at or below  1.00  --  the better the       ratio the fewer baserunners  --  if they are not on they can't       score  !!!!|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	Walks plus Hits / Innings Pitched    It's a gauge of a pitcher's effectiveness.  after all, if you don't allow baserunners, they can't come around to score.    Keep it.  And when you draft pitchers, look for those with WHIP's as low as possible. Anything under 1 is fantastic, but I'd suggest trying for pitchers with WHIP's under 1.3     The site below includes WHIP, but it's the column on the far right, and you'll have to scroll over.

WgTKHqlnaa	No, think about it this way:    PIM, PPP, SHP, +- are all hard categories to predict in some ways. Generally the guys with the higher goals and assists will have highter PPP, SHP anyway (not always). So, do you really think that Crosby and Blake will have more points combined than your 3? I really doubt it.

BhXMno7faa	Ice hockey players are much faster than figure skaters because they always have to skate as fast as they can when they have an odd man rush.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Depends on the skater. A suggestion eh? Get rid of the toe-pick.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	In general I'd have to pick the hockey player.  Figure skating isn't so much about skating fast as about skating gracefully.  Hockey players are trying to outrace opponents day in day out to the puck so there's a definite advantage to being faster.  Also, if you want a fair race you need to both use the same kind of skate blade of equal sharpness.|`|hX089rlnaa	It's going to depend on the individual skater. Figure or Hockey styles has nothing to do w/ it. If you win it only proves YOU'RE faster, not figure skaters in general, and vice-versa if they win.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	I'm pretty sure making your skates sharper would help.|`|G33E41IBaa	I would say the hockey player in general.  Hockey players have to work to be fast to chase the puck, whereas figure skaters tend to glide on the ice, and are more graceful.  Hockey players take deep strides on the ice to increase speed.    If you win, it proves that you're faster than your friend - not that figure skaters are faster than hockey players, and vice versa.    Good luck though! :)|`|wx1hUivLaa	it all depends on technique and being the strongest, you can be slower then him but faster then one of his buddies|`|cbdeb64f97f05d48aaa09e1f49920046aa	Basically you're probably going to lose. That's assuming you're both at least decent at what you do. Face it, hockey players work on speed, figure skaters work on finesse. The only suggestion that could help you is to put on some hockey skates.
xcG5Tasiaa	That's a now disproven myth.     Springs don't lose tension from compression (unless overcompressed, which isn't likely to happen unless you have some cheap Promags or something).     They DO lose tension as metal fatigue sets in from compression/decompression cycles.     I've unloaded a magazine form a 1940's M1911 (six digit serial  !), and the spring was just fine.     The copper was GREEN on the bullets, but the spring was fine.     If you're really concerned about it, buy decent quality mags, and maybe leave the last 1-3 rounds off for long-term storage, depending on capacity.|`|AA10232540	Springs don't lose their strength due to compression.  Contrary to what one "expert" tried to claim recently on this same topic.  (There's always one).  The *ONLY* way you can lose strength in a compressed spring is if you fully load the mag and then leave it til it rusts....the spring will lose strength as it loses metal.    Loading mags half way over and over is harder on a mag spring than fully loading it and leaving it.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Old wife's tale.  How many cops are using the same mags that they were using a decade or more ago, that have been loaded to capacity the entire time; not to mention how many times they have been loaded and unloaded.  Buy good mags and you won't have a problem.  As a matter of fact, I have never heard of a mag loosing its spring.  I even just bought some surplus mags for my Tommy gun that probably spent most of the 40, 50, 60's and maybe even some of the 70's loaded.  Scraped a little rust of the outside, lubed them up, and just as good as when your grandpa used them in the south pacific half a century ago.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	not true, mine have been loaded for a long time, an I have never had a feed problem. sounds to me like maybe your dad doesn't want them loaded in the house.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Springs wear out by repeated compression and depression. So no, leaving magazine loaded for decades even will not hurt the springs.

plhLIIeAaa	In opposition to the first comment, ECW has dead fans? Maybe that is what SciFi wanted, ZOMBIES!!!!!!!    In reality, Raw is televised on a delay, so it is not technically LIVE. ECW is shown on a delay, and SmackDown is taped before the ECW show. That is why it all looks the same.   Raw is now a joke. At least the champion on ECW is the main eventer, while Randy "I used to be on a sex talk line" Orton is being pushed more heavily than anyone else, even their golden boy Cena is taking a back seat to him right now.   If Raw would actually get back to what made them famous, good matches and good backstage vignettes, maybe, just maybe, i would try to get Raw taped instead of just looking for the results, and watching TNA on Thursday nights.|`|siKXdBEWaa	will right now ECW is not better then RAW but before wwe bought ECW, ECW used to be the best also on tell early 2007 ECW was still the best but now they no longer have  RVD, Sandman, Sabu, Mick folly, CM Punk   Terry Funk and all those other great wrestlers are no long in the business enymore witch is why i dont watch the matches no more and i used to like the best of a fan on the wwe i sill am but i skip trow the matches and i only watch the storyline and fiond out who wins and all that       BUT ECW the name is a big star but not having the extreams in it  makes it bad|`|cE8SQUEbaa	nope... Raw is definitely better...|`|lXp33SwSaa	It's not. Simply put. And here are the reasons why:    A. It has very few superstars  B. It runs for just one hour  C.

eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	best player doesn't mean you score the most. dwyane wade isn't the best player in the nba. thats why lebron james is. i mean not only is he second in scoring, he averages 7apg and 7rpg he plays great defense too. michael jordan had similar stats but he played in a much more harder era defensively than kobe or lebron do.    to fakers4life: no you are the idiot. your being biased. kobe is right now not even in the top 10 in steals for guards and 24th in guard position in blocks. ffs kelenna azubuike is ahead of him LOL. wilt averaged 35ppg i think thats still offensive and he added 20rpg to his stats. ******* kobe jocker go suck his ****.  no offense but you are a complete idiot.    excuse me a couple of defensive plays that lead to the momentum for the hornets yeah idiot. kobe makes 2 steals out of 100 plays so same goes for him right?|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	To be a great one no. But to be the BEST yes. Because to be the BEST you have to be the BEST. You get what I mean?|`|gqoIfbH0aa	More people recognize a dominant scorer like LeBron or Kobe over a brilliant defender like Ron Artest, Shane Battier, Chris Paul, and Dwight Howard.    CP3 averages 3 steals a game, that's nice defense there. Since 2008 his popularity seems like it's gone down.    D12 averages almost 15 rebounds a game and god knows how many blocks and he's a very underrated player, people don't even include him in some of their top 5's which is just ridiculous.|`|AA10188905	Kobe is also a great passer and has been on the nba all-defensive team several times. He is the best player overall. He is just also the best offensive player in NBA history. Not saying he is better overall than Jordan, but he is a better scorer.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Nope. Ben Wallace isn't a scorer, & he is a pretty good player.|`|NSe5Wuduaa	Kobe is overrated as a defender. He is a good defender but not THAT good.|`|AA11488609	No.  You need to be able to defend, pass, etc.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	No, it doesnt, Bill Russell is  2 on the NBAs 50 greatest players, and he did not even average 20 for his career.|`|98wFqBwSaa	No, but it helps|`|3teWTOPqaa	Wade can score 61pts easily is what I hear from Heat fans. We are just celebrating a good win and a specular game by Kobe, maybe one day D-Wade can be as good as Kobe if he put the work in.    Kobe is great not only because of the multiple offense threats he put on, but because he competes night in and out on both end of the floor.|`|oGBEl25jaa	no offense but you are a complete idiot.    do you know that kobe has been on the 1st defensive team many teams and is one of the better shut down defenders.    and you say wilt was an offensive nightmare, but do you know he averaged over 20 boards in a season.    thats defense,    so when you have better arguments come back and talk.    im not biased but when you bring crap like this how else are you supposed to react.    for the justice guy under me.    ok so chris paul gets 3 steals. so he impacted 3 plays out of like 80 or 90.    thats not defense.    thats just a couple of good defensive plays.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	hes a good passer and defender too|`|jDi45m0uaa	Kobe is not just one of the best offensive player. He is also a great Defender.    He does AVG 5 ast/5rbs|`|MPz9APZDaa	Well, if Kobe wants to, he can play great defense.|`|mG2BCZe7aa	No. Bill Russell was never known as a big scoring threat in their dynasty years but he was highly effective and that was the reason why he was voted the MVP five times despite not getting to the All-NBA first team at times.        Hope this helps.
L5IsUhacaa	A few variables are needed to be looked at. First, is this bridge over running water? Is the water deeper than, say 20 feet? In all means, one can survive jumping off a bridge. If Coast Guard Rescue Pilots can plunge into the ocean to rescue victims of a at sea disaster, I can assume that one can jump a bridge and survive.   Now, don't go jumping off a bridge, for in some states, if you live, you get to be sent into the local jail for jumping off a bridge. Also, don't try it on the Golden Gate Bridge, too many people are actually killed by the over powering current of the San Fransisco Bay.|`|MCJAYZeZaa	It is improbable that someone would survive a fall from 100 ft+ because of the incredible change in velocity once there was impact. At that speed it's almost like hitting concrete. If the water was flowing there would be some chance, and it would have to be deep enough to make sure the jumper didn't hit the bottom. At the very least if they don't die then their bones in their hips and legs are gonna need some serious work because of fractures.

Then tell her the benefits of skateboarding:    Improves balance, coordination and flexibility    Develops muscle strength, endurance and cardiovascular fitness     Encourages visualization and goal setting Increases concentration, focus and persistence     Promotes individuality and creativity    Promotes teamwork and group participation    Builds confidence, social skills and self esteem     Skateboarding is being introduced into the PE curriculum in some schools.  Personally I think that skateboarding is an under-rated Art/Sport and should be included in the Olympics!

KIOR56r6aa	I think I'll root for Kane. I want to see him wins, so we could have Kane vs Cena for WHC at WM 25. Although that match would end up in Cena reclaiming the title, at least we got to see Kane as the World Champion. And I have 2 reasons for this :    1. I can see either Edge or HHH wins the chamber, then Orton goes to challenge one of them. Either Edge or HHH will make a stipulation so the match for WWE title will end up with HHH vs Edge vs Orton, that would make a good main event.    2. As you can see, HBK vs JBL is going to happen at NWO, so I guess Taker vs HBK at WM 25 isn't a dream after all. I can see them resuming their feud this year, so I predict Taker will be drafted to RAW as the compensation of having Orton in SD! I think Taker will meet HBK backstage at RAW next week to tease their feud one last time.    BQ : I can see Kozlov and Matt. Simply because Matt will be screwed by Jeff to further expand their feud to WM 25. Whereas I can see HBK screw Taker after winning his contract back, since SD! EC will most likely be Main Event!!|`|4tvI9WYjaa	is about time kane gets a push but knowing vince he let cena won     i think it be triple h and edge for the last 2 contenders left in the smack down chamber|`|aULZ8D10aa	Hey live and die got suspended by trolls, so madison LOSE YOUR BADGE IT IS A CANCER! They come after top contribotors, I really do not want you to get deleted, you are a nice person. Now I think it will be great. I hope NO DQ!     BQ : EDGE and triple h, though I want edge and taker.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Him or rey. But the chances of them winning are slim to none.                 Bq: kozlov and MVP is my guess|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Yes, I was happy to see Kofi get his chance, but I didn't want to see it come at the expense of Kane. Now, I'm as happy as I can be. Kofi is in, Kane and Mike Knox are in. (I've said before, Kane and Mike Knox are the best possible tag team in WWE, now if finally happened). Unfortunately, WWE will be too scared to make Orton or Undertaker actually win the match, so it will end in DQ, with Rhodes and Dibiase interfering. As for the Smackdown elimination Chamber, I expect to see Vladimir Kozlov get a spot. He has a boring gimmick, but he can wrestle well. In an elimination chamber, gimmicks are forgotten and it's all about making moves look sick and twisted. It's all about destruction. He can do some good stuff, he can make that elimination chamber match a great one. Obviously Jeff and Matt Hardy are in a feud of their own, so I expect Umaga to get the last spot. We all saw him return last week, and he is a good wrestler. He might need to get over with the fans again, but he is a familiar face. A match like this will get him over big time as dominant. This match should be great. Taker, Big Show, Umaga, Kozlov, and Triple H are all intense fighters that will just go at it at all costs. And Edge will likely play the role of the guy that cleans up the bones. In other words, he waits for a guy to go down, then he finishes them off (in the video game world, we call that a nube). Should be great.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I can see we're in perfect agreement about next week's Undertaker vs. Randy Orton match as well as Kane's entry into RAW's Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out.  Before Kane was named the final entrant, I was torn between Chris Jericho and Kofi Kingston (although I know the WWE won't give Kofi the title anytime soon).  Now I want to see Kane not only win the match, but to do so by pinning everyone else (preferably pinning Cena first so a new champion would be guaranteed).    SmackDown could go in a number of ways with their 2 open spots.  My preference is for Matt Hardy and Gregory Helms to claim those spots, but if I had to predict right now, I'd say Matt and Jeff Hardy will get those spots to add to their brotherly feud.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	It'd be awesome,but sadly they'll probably leave Kane out again..    BQ:Edge    Triple H    Jeff Hardy    Big Show    The Undertaker    Umaga  i think will be all of them|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Yes! he really deserves a world title win! BQ: Umaga and mvp|`|41WXZPnCaa	Jojoj    Steph Rlz      Hope Taker Kicks Randy's ***|`|K7JfRjzMaa	I would be happy with anyone but Cena winning. I HATE John Cena. Personally, I'd prefer Jericho or Kane to win, but we all know Cena will walk out as champ.    BQ: Jeff Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov|`|mVH5LqMuaa	of cours im routing for kane ...he needs a push badly ...he is a nice guy though...he risked his career to willingly loose to make younger talent look good like lastweek vs kofi kingston ...he needs to become the brutaly  insane monster randy is turning into

5yZICXImaa	Yea I can see this happening. All Jays fan's know Richardi's contract ends in 2010 and thats when the Jays are going to have their big year with him. Gaston had their young guys playing like stars and if they added Manny I could see a 90-95 wins this year. They may still not have the best rotation but they didn't lose in the bullpen they just gained so they still have the best bullpen.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	It would make the Jays more competitive and put them right behind the leaders, but I don't think it would give them a shot at the division.  While Manny brought a spark to the Dodger offense, he was filling a hole (a big hole, but LA had some offensive talent) rather than becoming the entire offense as he would have to Toronto.|`|nl3vG5Jfaa	NO !!! but they will come in 4th in there division       1. Yankees  2.Rays  3.Redsox  4.Bluejays  5.Oriloles|`|z6kjSwNFaa	the al east is a one team race yankees all the way blue jays are insignificant with or without manny|`|NpqAbZqpaa	You need to also consider thought that Marcum is not playing this season and McGowan isn't back till probably June.  That's the other downfall to AJ Burnett leaving.  He wouldn't have had a good year anyway, it's not a contract year.      They do need a big bat for sure.  Is Manny enough, on a short term, only one probably more likely to help is Pujols.|`|CuOUwFa7aa	first of all the blue jays cant afford to pay manny, and even with manny the rest of the lineup absolutely stinks!! worst offense in baseball if u ask me. they dont even have the pitching to contend with the other 3 al east teams|`|yghiYtwEaa	You got a point there but the question is will manny get along with the low paycheck that they might give him?|`|VFNW1Tt9aa	Nope, he would help the offense but the blue jays still need to get help for pitching. Losing Burnett is going to hurt alot more than they thought.  Rays are still the team to beat in the East. The got the best rotation and their offense can keep up with Yankees and Red Sox now that Upton is back healthy and Burrell will help protect Longo and Pena in middle of the order.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	Nope|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Thats a great post, and I think the Blue Jays could win like 94 with manny, but my beloved Red Sox would drop to like 84 wins.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	I am believing you are correct|`|iz5zDFxvaa	In order for that to happen, the Jays are going to have to do the following:    1) Find someone to replace the 18 wins of Burnett (signed with Yanks)  2) Add another big bat or 2 for the lineup (Manny and/or Dunn)  3) Find someone to replace Marcum and his 9 wins (out until 2010)

axxQzOCHaa	Depends on where in Alabama you're at. Did you mean NHL? In that case I think it'd be either Raleigh-Durham (Carolina Hurricanes), Atlanta (Thrashers) or Nashville (Predators)    In the CHL (www.centralhockeyleague.com) there are many teams in the deep south.    CHL is kinda like AA in baseball though many of the coaches used to play in the NHL and hockey's Super Bowl is called the Stanley Cup.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hockey  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanley_cup  http://www.centralhockeyleague.com  http://www.nhl.com|`|QVg9KB1vaa	Nashville Predators!|`|HSsqa0Vgaa	Nashville Predators!    The NHL has a best of 7 game series for the Stanley Cup, which is their trophy.  Every year the winning team gets their names put on it, its the same trophy every year, making it unique in sports.|`|M6P7r57faa	You should watch football!

AA10425091	He has publicly asked to be a role model... The should be burned at the stake|`|ebKlXUEtaa	No I don't agree.  He holds himself to the highest standard in his profession which is swimming.  He is the best swimmer in the world if not the history of the world.  There is no higher standard. Because he is such an gifted athlete those companies are using him to manipulate us into buying their products.  They are not sponsoring him because he is a good person or because they give a crap about swimming. It is not a prize, they are doing it because they know it will make them more than they will pay pay him. This is about money and if they profit from using his image, then he should profit. The only reason they would drop him is because they thought it would cost them in the long run,  but I don't think it will in the least. The publicity they are getting through this and by continuing to back him will give them more brand recognition.  Many people will actually have a more favorable opinion of them if they play it like they are giving a 23 year old that made a mistake a break.  He's not the most interesting character out of the pool.  This may actually create interest and he may have a longer limelight now that the Olympics are over.  Americans love a hero but we love one even more that screws up and comes back.  He's set himself up to do just that and his sponsors will probably do well to follow along with him. Smoking pot is alos a misdemeanor offense like a traffic ticket or jay walking.  Would you suggest they pull sponsorship for speeding or other petty crimes?|`|zmhQdYbDaa	I think there is some truth to what you say. He did mess up, big time. He acted stupidly. And it's not like he's just a normal 23 year old, because when he said he wanted to make swimming mainstream and when he won the medals, he knew that he was taking on responsibility.     I think he should definitely be suspended from swimming for a while, but maybe not a year. It would send a message, not only to him but the rest of the swimming community, that doing drugs is never okay and should not be just accepted.     As to his sponsors, I think that sponsors such as Kellogg's which is kid based putting him on the Frosted Flakes should definitely drop him. It kills their image.
DgYAL0Nraa	Yes it is LEGAL to shoot in YOUR backyard as long as you do not shoot over your property. But you must stop if a neighbor tells you to (sound issues, paint ricochet, stray balls) otherwise they could file a legal complaint to restrict you from playing in your yard.  Hope that helps;}

WOqmpcbEaa	Well, if your doing some tough workouts. Carbs and protein are the main things that you need to be eating throughout the week. Try to lay off any kind of junk food, those only have sugars, and simple carbs which do nothing. You want foods with complex carbs. It give you more energy. And you need the protein to help biuld muscle.     For practice, rememeber to stay hydrated. if your practice is only about an hour long, just stick with plain water. And if the practice is longer then an hour, you need a drink that contains electrolytes and carbs, for ex: gatorade, powerade.... stuff like that.    and finally, for a swim meet, always, always, ALWAYS, stay hydrated. and for food, try to find things that have calories, but arent heavy. like a power bar, or cliff bar. Dont have any dairy on a swim meet, its really heavy and isnt the best thing to have. If you have a long break between events, you can eat something a bit more, like a half a sandwhich or something. just dont over eat.    i hope this helps! :)|`|yS5f1XLFaa	well as a swimmer u should be eating enough to maintain ur weight. lean protein and carbs are always good. make sure that u stay hydrated. during swim meets eat food, but not so much that it will slow u down. a powerbar or somting will do.

cgAjzSVKaa	It all depends on who gets to decide who chooses the replacement. Nelson I'm sad, because he deserves to be an all-star.    I mean all those 3 deserve to go, but personallly I prefer Vince Carter to go!    With Nelson side lined, Ray Ray though I think deserves it the most. He's having a career year in fg%, and is doing muh more than Paul Pierce in my opinion.    Vince Carter has been the leader and the captain for a young Nets team, and has reammerged this season, and has all-star worthy numbers. And remember no all-star game is an all-star game without VC. It just dosn't feel right.    Mo Williams has exploded with some eye popping numbers this season, but hasn't had superior stats to Ray and Vince. Although if you have the 2nd best record in the East, you should have at least two all-stars.    IF David Stern chooses, the obvious choice s Vince Carter for ratings, entertainment, and of course cuz he deserves it.    Ray Allen if the coaches choose.    And Mo williams if Mike Brown has a say in it.    Still all 3 of those players deserve it way moe than Rashard Lewis.|`|hSWhDfdmaa	Mo Williams. The Magic having three All-Stars while the Cavs only had one was an injustice that, although very unfortunate and sad, has a chance to be righted. Mo would even out the east's big 3 (Cleveland, Boston, Orlando) at two All-Stars a piece. I think that Ray should have been picked instead of Pierce but having three Celtics is almost as unfair as having three Magic.|`|AA11488609	I wish I could go with Antawn Jamison because I need a Wiz player on that team and he's been the most consistent player for the Wizards this year in a positive way.

If Stern picks a guard, Vince should get it because he can make highlight plays.|`|98wFqBwSaa	RayRay|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Too many people have been complaining about Mo Williams not getting selected.

3074it1Qaa	absolutely  Swagger has the advantage in mat skills due to amateur wrestling background. He also more athletic and a better technical superstar. but i wonder if he could gutwrench powerbomb Kozlov. he also has some experience concerning ECW Extreme Rules matches so he would have the advantage in a no-dq match  Kozlov has the power and size advantage and his moves can do some serious damage. He also has a lot of resilience and has an arsenal of strong counters.    it would be a good match but Kozlov would probably win because more people watch Smackdown but a win from Jack Swagger would encourage more people to watch ECW.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Not really,Swagger is good and all Kozlov can do is headbutt people..|`|5vXgcAbCaa	As far as wrestling skills go, yes, that would be a great match. One of the best possible. But half of the WWE fans don't watch ECW, so they don't even know who Jack Swagger is. And, people find both of them boring because they don't have stupid gimmicks, they have realistic gimmicks. That's just the way it is now, sad isn't it? But yes, I think that would be a great match.|`|o4ARntxraa	Neither Vladimere Koslov Or Jack Swagger Is Undefeated !  Both Were Beaten On On Tours To The UK But Because It Was Not Aired On TV WWE Use This Idea To Create A Story Line.|`|Kecfbgm5aa	personally i hate technical wrestling. i cannot get into it. anyways they are both very skilled and would have an excellent match.|`|CK8oRi9faa	i think it would be a great match and i bet jack swagger wins|`|nzKo4TFvaa	no you need Muhammed Hassan vs jack swagger
cOPCNP7Laa	Napoli lost some form after the winter break. It does happen but it's a pity bc they were a really feared team.

I think they will beat struggling Palermo this upcoming Sunday.|`|wxcmnFEKaa	Napoli will win maybe 0-1 but Palermo will fight hard.

gfFTQ9zlaa	I remember Jason he won the heisman 2004, he did not get draft at 2005 but did receive a try out by the KC.  and eventually get singed by Tenn. but he decided too quit football. Today, White owns and operates A Store Divided, an OU/OSU memorabilia store, and a The Athlete's Foot shoe store.  He also worked with insurance agent Steve Owens, another former Sooner Heisman Trophy winner and former athletic director at the University of Oklahoma. Prior to that, White worked briefly for a securities firm in downtown Oklahoma City.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I haven't heard of him for years.  He was the only Heisman winner to not get drafted and lost to USC in the Championship.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	Just another example of a good college player who couldn't make it in the pros|`|i75abbKLaa	ya i can rember  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://tvthroughinternet.blogspot.com/|`|hAy8h7icaa	nope he was never drafted.    he didnt have the size to be a qb in the NFL, and he had the knees of a 75 year old.    system QB.|`|1YKXXphcaa	He was a good player. His career was derailed by injuries and never really got on track in the pros.
kBf7OUXNaa	Well heres the Question.:     His stats prove he should, but what about 1 superbowl ring? is that enough. 2 Superbowl Records. 1. Most passing yards in the first half which i believe is 277, 2: Most passing yards in the superbowl somewhere in the 400 era.    His stats prove it., but know the hall of fame comitee has something to talk about. What about his career drought, where he got released and his states went poor..     Overall I believe he should go, the press likes him, He made it to the Big game 3 times, and He reminds me of Dan Marino a little bit.  anyway . Warner for the Hall of Fame|`|SEEJxHk7aa	SURE SHOT YES|`|eKsgL2wkaa	Absolutely. I think a first round hall of famer. He took the Rams and the Cardinalsto a superbowl, 2 really bad franchises. 2 time league MVP, a superbowl mvp, a superbowl champ, statistically the 2nd most accurate qb ever, 1st in passing yards in a superbowl, 2nd in passing yards in a superbowl, and  6 last night. Also 3rd all time for single season touchdowns just behind Marino and Manning. And a genuine good christian person. And is if he plays 2 more years could pass marine and favre for all time passing yards. And the only qb to lead 2 different teams to a superbowl. What else do you want?|`|5etFAmrsaa	yes|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Hmm... let's see. Most passing yards in a Super Bowl? Warner. SECOND most passing yards in a Super Bowl? Warner. THIRD most passing yards in a Super Bowl? Warner.     Yep. I'd put him in.|`|8ImkKoNEaa	yes, he beat my titans!  too bad the refs called his incomplete pass a fumble last night.|`|2CuuIT70aa	NO.  Its not even close.    Three really good years don't make up for the other five years in his career where he was absolutely terrible, where he even lost his job to Eli Manning, Marc Bulger, and even Matt Leinart (he was the starter last year and would've been this year until he got hurt).    If he gets in, the Terrell Davis should be voted in with this year's class, and anyone else who had 2 or even 3 good years but then had a bunch of terrible years, or non-existent years.  Trent Dilfer?  Jake Delhomme?  Trent Green?    The Hall of Fame is for players who are the best the game has ever seen; Warner was just outplayed by Ben Roethlisberger, and honestly I don't think he's one of the the top 10 quarterbacks in the league right now.  There's no way he's done enough to justify putting him next to guys like Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	yes he is no doubt. the hall of fame is all about the NUMBERS and he has more than enough.|`|kfySwy8baa	yes if he is not then something wrong|`|gfFTQ9zlaa	Yes, he should be hall of fame he won a super-bowl and he won a M.V.P. award. But it won't happen at lease 4 years after he retired.|`|7e6591ac4a2ede1a407a83fa0245c719aa	is this really in doubt?|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Yes, I think so, I think with his stats and as well liked and admired as he is with the sports writers who vote for the HOF he should go in. What's not to like about him or his play?|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Yes.  He has the top 3 passing games in superbowl history.  I rest my case.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	YES. ALL DAY. Kurt Warner took the AZ CARDS to the SUPERBOWL!  Without Kurt they would have been a 6-10 team|`|AA11760438	How about Ken Stabler first.. a legend|`|sPiwb8Hraa	He can be inducted and he is a great, but the Harrison interception will definately have to be swept under the rug.

9mzOA8dGaa	ouch shouldn't have put WD40 on them! Just skate fast so they break in nice.    You most likely got dirt inside them. Take of the covers and take a look. Clean them out nicely.    You want to have the bolt on the wheels a little loose so the wheel has a little room to move!    Hope that helped..anything i missed?    yea it's fine WD40 just makes dirt stick more and easier    the cover which encases the little ball bearings, take that off a spray some cleaner in there and rotate the bearing.

The reason everyone is saying No way out is better is because JBL vs HBK doesn't really seem like a wrestlemania quality match and everyone including myself want to see legend vs legend match between Undertaker and Shawn Michaels.

No one wants to see JBL wrestle at mania 25 and that to against HBK who is no short of an icon.  HBK had to be preserved for a major match !! a definite crowd puller match and since HBK wont be in the title match at mania 25, it has to be then against the undertaker. Trust me for that !! HBK will be facing Taker , wm 25. HBK and JBL storyline ends at NO way out where HBK beating the crap out of JBL. Thats just logical. HBK vs JBL match at wrestlemania is not going to happen. Infact it would never ever happen.|`|9X358ww7aa	Yes, taker vs hbk isn't a good wm match.  It's possibly hbk's last one, and unless they plan on breaking taker's streak, hbk will go out a loser.

Dumping pettitte for nothing seems a waste, someone would just pick him up off waivers.

b7c4e3ddfbe997b4c4590bb3b470d4d6aa	Possibly, because the NFC is so wide open right now. But one thing they still need to work on is their defense a little more, if that gets better than the Packers will be able to battle the Bears for their Division's Title, plus you can never count out a team with Bret Favre on it. I hope that answers your question.|`|5b36acc0953015e716de29fccd7a6eb2aa	sorry, but i have to disagree. This team would need time to play together; its not like a franchise team in Madden video games. Everyone thought the raiders would be all superstar with R. Moss, but he didn't even have play well, let alone have a impact. I believe when Aaron Rodgers begins to start, they will have a new, young fresh team and might have a great run.  Hope this helps!|`|9e2f88537df225cfa69491089f60bbfcaa	Any team with a healthy Brett Favre always has a chance to make a run for a title. He's just one of those guys and that team is improving.|`|db3d6d9c0a12b5cab3724dcf677beadcaa	Yes! Of course!  Brett Favre plus a young receiving core that is constantly improving is an awesome start. Ahman Green must show up next season though. This might have been one of their problems last season. Their defense isn't the best, but they have some play makers for sure.    They were close to a wild card this year, and they are in the NFC, so i dont see why they can't make a Wild Card bid next year!!|`|1SI1ZLidaa	No, Favre is tooooooo old. HE IS GREAT THOUGH!|`|so5F4sixaa	if they improve the running game and get moss they can definitely make a run for it. they're in a tough division but it's very easy to make the playoffs in the nfc and the giants aren't getting any better they probably won't win their division but they will easily get a wild card spot.|`|zzqqggQBaa	i think they need some really good offensive linemen.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Are you talking NFC Title game next year?  They are getting better but are still many players away from a title shot.  I'd say at least another WR, a quality RB, a consistant OL, and a consistant D.  They've got some work to do yet.
AtcZb1MNaa	Absolutely.  Made the sweet 16 four years ago.  More importantly,  they were number five in the RPI last week meaning when the committee seeds the teams, they would be hard pressed,  assuming they win the Missouri Valley tournament tomorrow,  to not be a two seed.  Look out today for one of my favorite coaches,  Jim Les,  and his Bradley Braves.|`|63c0ae0160be83f8dda5f3b0e669f342aa	yea I know about them this year and last year I watched a few games  In the tourney wasn't it thier cheerleader who fell of the pyramid|`|14d35ccaf4782955a4feca8487b222c5aa	Southern Illinois has been a solid program for the last 6-7 years.  In fact, they made the Sweet Sixteen a few years back.      They are deserving of a favorable seed this year and, especially in light of the tremendous amount of all around parity in the college game, are quite capable of going on something of a run.      The Missouri Valley Conference, the league that the Southern Illinois Salukis hail from, is a very competitive conference whose national reputation seems to grow yearly.  Southern Illinois notwithstanding, Creighton, Missouri St and Bradley are all very deserving of NCAA at-large bids in 2007.  As further evidence of the league's competitiveness, 2006 NCAA "Sweet Sixteen" team Wichita State was unable to muster a .500 record in-conference (this after being ranked nationally at the start of conference play).    To dismiss Southern Illinois and other so-called "mid-major" schools due to their lack of overall national prominence is unfair to them and educated college fans everywhere.|`|X4uMFO1vaa	SIU has made several appearances at the tournament.  They won't advance far this year.|`|9180d23e063c3a24187a961231eb5a92aa	Yes. To be honest your not a real Division 1 basketball fan if you haven't heard of all the 336 teams in Division 1. Not that you claimed you were.|`|n7W454bCaa	If you've followed college basketball at all during the past few years you would have heard of the Salukis. They became famous a few years back bc they pulled off some upset in the tourny. They always do well in the conference or at least have the last few years.|`|9e2f88537df225cfa69491089f60bbfcaa	Yes I have heard of them. No, they're not going to go that far in the tourney. Sorry.
136a32c9469bde13480f6a4d4d9f90daaa	I think the Cavs should definately use those guys more and here's why......because the Cavs guards shouldn't be shooting the basketball too much.  The point guard position has been a black hole for them and Larry Hughes is a bricklayer.  Z is still one of the best centers in the Eastern Conference and Gooden has a good game in the paint.    For more on the Cavs and the NBA, check this site out.  http://factipedia.com/sportsblogs/nba.ht...|`|TvLfbapaaa	ive been wondering why z dont get many plays like before....i she injured?|`|Oxo24t5aaa	Because Gooden is mediocre at best on offense, and Z just isn't the  player he used to be. Age and injuries have slowed him down way too much for him to be dominant.  Actually though, the coach made a point this season of running less plays through Lebron because he felt it was too much pressure on him to carry everyone.  Didn't work out so well.|`|9154f5872324f4dc04da9450db7ad101aa	Drew Gooden at best is a guy who can get  defensive and offensive rebound and he'll provide toughness, but Big Z IMO is too fragile and too slow with current NBA pace.|`|b872013967748815a5229c5e49632facaa	because they have possibly the most overrated player in the history of the game in King James|`|24b9d409c693cb24a6c2bb02ee0ea9eeaa	Gooden and Z arent what they used to be and i'm not sure if Gooden ever used to be if u know what I mean.

I know Andy Thomas wished he had done that.|`|MLhffjLIaa	no, stick to nintendo.|`|HsAlSbNJaa	The best thing you can do is play as much basketball as you can.  Play in all types of games against the best players you can find.  You work on specific things during games.

Thanks for the two points, Scott Q|`|094e296fa929099f24fd8f51a81082eaaa	I suggest Victoria as Cheetara. And the Miz as Snarf. Flair has to be Mum-Ra, the guy's gotta be 60, and he's still capable of putting on a good show. From the current batch, I would suggest unleashing the beast Bautista as Liono, but Cena and Lashly would be worthy alternates. (Though CM Punk's angle has the right 'public service' feel to be Liono, I don't think he has the charisma.)
RqN1ApY5aa	The hill. Just run up and down a large hill for 20 minutes. On other days just run on a track and lift weights.|`|emPyQRiLaa	Just do general drills until you know what position you want to play and then you can do position specific drills.  For right now you should work on you agility and drills to help you move better.  There are alot of football drills for youth on internet. Just go to yahoo and do a search for youth footbal drills.|`|5a3cc1c5e538a2d4cc9ba5bf89099a2aaa	Depending on your size you can probably get an idea of what position you will end up with. At your age coaches will see you as a body and try to get you to fit to a mold depending on your athletic ability. Tall, quick and with good hand you'll probably end up a tight end. Also depending on where you live the teams may need you to play both ways, so you may end up as a Wide Receiver and a Cornerback or Safety. Your best bet is to work on speed and agility, play a lot of basketball, do simple sprints from a three or two point stance just working on your explosion off the line. Work towards your strengths, if you are a big guy and not too fast you may want to shy away from the running back quarterback dreams and think more defensive end or center. Every team needs a good center, likewise if you are thin and nimble you probably would want to lean away from middle linebacker. Heck, there are never enough good kickers...

He's so quick for 7ft and can jump out of the gym.      and I think he's 19 or 20 years old.

UTcI6MXsaa	your not old enough to bet :P|`|zj4HeXEvaa	If it was that easy everyone one do it! You can sign up with a betting exchange like 'betfair' or 'betdaq' and take money off punters, i.e acting like the bookmaker, of course you will have to pay out if a team/horse etc that you have 'layed' (taken a bet against) actually wins.    Its very hard to make any money out of it, and there are 10's of thousands of people already trying to do it, people that have been involved in gamling for decades.    + You do have to be over 18 to join a betting exchange.    My advice would be to stay clear of gambling altogether, its cause me nothing but problems.|`|AA11013113	Get yourself a system.  Cannot go wrong.

And i run the 100 metre in about 12 seconds and i'm also 16, and i was the fastest kid on my football team.|`|lfUJbamyaa	It seems like you've got good size and decent speed.

DhEZj9cKaa	Talk to them very politely|`|wmyew1ERaa	Did you buy the skis new with bindings? Many new skis are designed to have a proprietary binding system and may have the bindings already attached. If this is the case, the shop where you bought them will do this as part of the ski sale (no charge). If you bought the skis second hand (you didn't tell us), the binding may need to be relocated. Take them, with your boots, to a reputable shop to have the work done and the bindings tested.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Yeah...you take them to the ski shop and have someone fix it.     The average person doesn't have the skills, training, or tools to do a re-mount. If you did, you wouldn't have to ask what to do here in Yahoo Answers. So scrounge up about $30 bucks and go see the guys at the shop.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Yes sir, Willie pretty much broke the nose because he was so dead on.
jf0UV1Bjaa	Fish migrate around water temperature.  Thats how they know when to migrate.  When water levels get to a certain temperature(each species of fish have different temperatures) their instinct kicks in and they go.  Atmospheric pressure has some to do with it also.|`|MU841Iueaa	Yes and they are usually a pretty narrow window.  In warmer water, you will get one and likely two migrations a day.  In the colder season, it may just be one per day.  And keep in mind, a fish uses bottom features to migrate from deep to shallow and back again.  This can be weedlines, rocks, breaklines, creek channels, deltas, etc.  There has to be something for the fish to relate to.  If the feature 'peters out' the fish will not move any further.    I recommend reading the material of fisherman Buck Perry, it is very insightful and will lead to satisfaction with the gaining of knowledge.
wnZ0N3wjaa	Dravid is a more accomplished batsmen and controls the middle order really well, whilst Dhoni is a good wicket-keeper and has a cool head in dire situations which is needed to have good captaincy skills.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Dravid is more of a defensive batsmen who can bat through an entire innings. Dhoni is much more aggressive and likes to score quickly.|`|AA11088802	both have very different approaches to game.. but both are winners|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	No way!    Dravid is way ahead of Dhoni it's not worth comparing.    Dravid can play attacking cricket like we saw in the IPL he just needs to get over his mental problem/form or whatever is wrong with him.    Maybe he can't get back to his best but he is surely better than Dhoni in tests and ODIs (if Dravid was still playing).    Having said that Dhoni is a great captain. Very cool, calm and collected. He will certainly go past 10,000 ODI runs.|`|KUXjoCiAaa	DRAVID IS A WICKET -SAVER & DHONI IS A RUN -MAKER THEY BOTH ARE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.|`|Mfi84xBQaa	I don't think we can  compare  A Defensive Player and An Attacking Player ......................................|`|7oHt9fTkaa	Dravid is lot more better than Dhoni.|`|c55c5f3a196f9a316536bb93ba268636aa	Lets split this up into captaincy, batting and wicketkeeping, since the two have done all 3 in their respective careers.  dhoni's captaincy is definitely more imaginative and he makes things happen when the game is slipping away. although some of it can be credited to luck, there is a lot of thought in what he does too, with his field pos, bowling changes etc.Dravid never got the same praise or recognition when he was the captain, and doesnt quite have the results to back him up.    Batting wise dravid is way ahead of MS, as all his stats and sound batting technique prove. there is nothing to argue in that.    Behind the stumps, i think dhoni just edges dravid, as he is a bit stronger when the ball is going down the leg side. otherwise they are both fairly even, although dravid didnt keep wickets in tests, so it would be harsh to consider him as a natural wicketkeeper.|`|2mFfhIxOaa	They are just opposites & i m not interested in both of them.|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Dravid - The Wall  Dhoni -  The Cool Attacker    Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|940aeb175b0facf00b53d83108c83e62aa	Dhone is the best.|`|HSXxRjysaa	WELL,now I'm getting to know better of you..    FIRST, you are not Dravid's FAN..because dravid fans will never hate others.. and Dhoni gives Utmost respect to Dravid because  dravid was not in form for more than 5 months or so..yet he included in the team because of his class,standard,sincerity    SECOND,you hate dhoni because one of ur favourite player was throwed out of indian team when Dhoni was the captain..so i guess u might be a fan of irfan,ganguly,dinesh karthick,parthiv patel etc...    and answer for your question is its "Rahul Dravid - The wall"|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Dravid (in his youth) was probably the better wicket keeper of the two. That's the most meaningful comparison you can make between them.    Their batting styles really can't be compared, and Dhoni has a long, long way to go to match Dravid's accomplishments in the game.|`|vfreOmoRaa	dravid and dhoni are not comparable    each player has his own charisma and charm and way of playing and that is what can be said about rahul and mahi    rahul is a player who matched old skul cricket with new age professionalism and fun  he is one who can adapt to any condition that he is in  dravid is one who relies a lot on mental toughness and one who gives importance to performance  mahi is the very same only thing he is a little of the youthful type who adds his 1% extra tinge of fun making the match lively for the player whether we win or lose    rahul is a player who does take risks but very rarely   dhoni is kinda the same only thing hez a little more adventurous    rahul was never really a wicket keeper   he jus donned the gloves for the situation demanded it  he was more a batsman and so wasn't really fully fit for the job yet he carried out his task well    dhoni on the other hand is used to being a wicket keeper for he was goal keeper too... so has forehand experience    but one thing commom in them is that they are team men and do stuff thats right for the team    but the sad thing is that dhoni's success has been highlighted  but its quite the opposite for dravid whose failures have been blown out of proportion    both are great players and cant really be compared    gud q|`|uKLlkOPSaa	Dravid Mr. Dependable and some times Slow SR batsman - Dhoni is a cool player and according to situation he maintains his SR & Dravid depends on team - Dhoni firstly depends on hardwork - commitment - team spirit and on his self.|`|8u8v5y4uaa	Ok...  1) they're both Indian  2) they both play cricket  3) they're both incredibly overrated  4) they are both batsmen    Dhoni is absolutely capable of achieving the same mediocre level of perfomance of that shown by Dravid throughout his career.|`|hqJbghUUaa	david comes to field and plays to stay long as possible and score runs  dhoni comes to field just to hit big shots and he does not think about the middle order he dont care what will happen to the remaining batting player order if he got out but david thinks about it|`|FNs7MZF4aa	Its so simple.  Dravid was Worst captain and Dhoni is Best|`|S0dLToYxaa	it would be unfair to compare these gr8s of the game.          dravid,in my dictionary,means batting with class,elegance,impeccable technique & superb timing.......      whereas      dhoni is the other word for gr8ness,coolness,honesty,cleverness & good spirit........|`|5aeda75cd1182494108e1cde6db83b33aa	Let Dhoni play at least 50 Test matches and 150 ODI, then comparison may be done. Now Dhoni is a "novish" comparison to Rahul.

Both will definitely pass the point margin (James did already). Paul might be able to pass the assists mark maybe if he stays healthy his entire career but rebounds are a toss up. On the other hand, if James maybe brings his average down to 25 ppg he can possibly average 9rpg and maybe 8ast per game, amazing statistics James has the best chance though.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	LeBron JAmes. It depends when he will retire and how long untill he has the talent to still be a big time player fo the team. He doesn;t need to score alot anymore he just rebounds and passes alot.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	Well since LeBron has the points one down and in 10 years presuming he plays at this level which seems a bit doubtful for the physical toll he takes he'll average 500 rebounds and assists each season, he'll end up with a total of:    Points: 35000  Rebounds: 8000  Asists: 8500    But if he plays for say... 14 to 15 more years he could manage to amass 10000 assists and rebounds.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I'm guessing LeBron James has a shot at it, according to all the other answers.

TEX1iYQgaa	Cycling shoes have a stiff sole ~ they don't allow your feet to bend while pedaling.    The reason for this is so that more of your leg power is applied directly to the pedals instead of being absorbed in the flexing of your feet ~ which contributes to rider fatigue.      Cycling shoes also have a place where a cleat can be screwed to the bottom of the shoe that engages with a clipless pedal. The word "clipless" is kind of an oxymoron considering that you're actually clipped into the pedal. I think the name is in reference to the old toe clip method...    Anyway, clipless is good. You will be able to apply power to the pedals throughout the enire pedal stroke instead of just mashing down on them. If you ever go mountain biking, clipless pedals also keep your feet on the pedals in rough terrain.    No matter what your riding style is, cycling shoes will help you ~ especially if you go to clipless. Once you get used to them you will never want to ride without them again. I guarantee it.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Good cycling shoes have a very stiff sole, which allows you to pedal hard without having the pedal dig into the sloe of your shoe causing discomfort. In addition, the shoes have mounting points for cleats which clip into clipless pedals so that your feet are attached to the pedal allowing you to apply power through the full cycling motion. For comfort and power transfer, cycling shoes are the way to go.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Cycling shoes allow you to clip into the pedal and allow you to utilize the other muscles in your leg that you normally can't use.  They will allow you to pull up on the back stroke and push at the top and pull on the bottom.  It makes a big difference.|`|O6wwDtrmaa	Cycling shoes have a clipping in method so your shoe attaches to the pedal. This means you can use your muscles to their full extent as normally on a bike without clips you push down on both legs which brings the other leg up but with clips you push down on one foot and pull up on the other. This is useful for sprint starts as you have to pull up and push down really hard in order to get going faster.    Shoes will improve your speed and your muscles will grow as you will work your legs harder.|`|Zjg4zpPnaa	First and main reason: Safety. Once you connect that pedal to cleats you are connected as part of your bicycle(You go no where). Second clipless shoes are very stiff and strong to support a person pedal strength or movement. They are made of either stiff leather or plastic which takes sometime getting use to(Walk around in them for couple of days to get use to them). Special cycling shoes will help you increase your pedaling efficiency and will keep you riding more and more.  I swear by mine & I ride 5000 miles a year.|`|YGXbd8rcaa	By wearing cycling shoes you will be able to develop a better peddaling motion, especially at high cadence as your foot will be both pushing and pulling. When you are climbing or out of the saddle you will notice the advantage of pulling on the peddle and will ride stronger.    There are such a huge range of peddles on the market at the moment but I would personally go for 'look' or 'SPD' cleats. Make sure you practace clipping in and out a couple of times before you head out on the road as it takes some getting use to.

What matters in the end is who wins the big game or at least is able to get to the big game.|`|VHClvfMzaa	Romo is more prone to mistakes (Interceptions, fumbles, etc) but Big Ben is prone to injuries. Romo is much more elusive and mobile although Big Ben showed he can be mobile under pressure in the Superbowl. Romo has more whip in his arm than Big Ben. Overall, I think Romo is better, rings don't justify who is better!    Comparison in stats the last 3 seasons, remember Romo has only played 2 1/2 seasons he replaced Bledsoe midway through the '06 regular season.    Big Ben 9968 yards 67 touchdowns 49 interceptions  Romo 10,562 yards 81 touchdowns 46 interceptions|`|Uh7HagITaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHA, oh wait ur serious!

65ebebf5e438864d41850ef2be37319caa	Where did you get that number? The ionization potential of Hydrogen is 13.60 eV, not 3.16 eV.    The ionization potential for Li+ is the same as the second ionization energy of Li, which is:    75.64 eV    I don't know if the ionization potential for Hydrogen really tells you anything relevant to Li+.  Lithium has 3 electron, so its ionization potential is fairly low, because loosing one electron would leave it with a complete first subshell. Li+ has 2 electrons, which means its subshell is already full, and thus it is very reluctant to loose an electron, so its IP is high.  The IP of hydrogen is irrelevant.      Oh and if you want someone who has more knowledge about chemistry than of the current Collective Bargaining agreement for the NHL, I would suggest you not ask this question in the hockey section. :)|`|x9GODf8eaa	Sean Avery.|`|KyCJOR2paa	Unless you know a lot about physical chemistry and quantum mechanics, not very easily.  Just look it up if you need it.  A rule of thumb the farther to the left on the periodic table the lower the energy needed to lose an electron, which I'm sure you know.  Good to see some chemistry questions in the hockey section.  Well gotta go, off to tutor some organic chemistry students.

You definitely don't want, or need, a bait holder style hook (additional barbs on hook shank/shaft) as these are designed to thread/impale worms, etc. to cover the entire hook.

7fe8aff17848d38692a4e9c1c436518aaa	Hopefully your coach will give you all of this information, he/she should not only give you physical details but also psychological details.     Your practices should consist of a good warmup with sprint drills and dynamic stretching(stretches with moevement mimicking the event).   Make sure to work on your technique which your coach should spend a lot of time on like running your foot hitting the ground should be dorsiflexed (meaning you will hit the ground on the balls of your foot) have god high knee action,, arms should swing in a smooth forward motion from shoulder height to your hip area not across your body, head held high in line with your spine,face relaxed(don't clench your teeth no matter how much pain you are in)  Food to eat at all times not just before an event is lean protein,get some bananas into you too especially after a hard workout or race in high temps to prevent cramping. You'll need spikes for races and to practice in (one example is the Brooks F3 Sprint)    Hey ask your coach I'm sure they have some great ideas and experience to give out that's why and what they are there for. Good luck in your season|`|WrDGhduxaa	Warm up well before training, don't run while your body is still cold.  When sprinting you must learn to stay relaxed, stand up tall, keep your elbows at 90 degrees, swing  your arms straight front to back, relax your shoulders.  Eat healthy, you are not going to get any extra energy on the food you eat just before practice, don't eat junk food.  You will need sprint spikes for races.  I have never listened to songs while running or warming up.

I think it was instituted when TO autographed it that one time after a TD.    It's unsportsmanlike conduct.|`|e9695c75152e6d757a83f3e1f8134384aa	unsportsmanlike conduct for excessive celebration. it should have been called but the refs had money on the steelers to win|`|ZwF9pXDYaa	It is because he used the ball as a celebration prop.  The cardinals should of started that last drive on the 50 yard line after that 15 yd unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that should of been called.  But since how there were a ton of blown calls the whole game, it did not really matter that much.|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	Using the football as a prop during a touchdown celebration is unsportsmanlike conduct and is penalized with 15 yards assessed on the kickoff.      If the refs had enforced the rules, then the Cardinals would not have had to try and cover 77 yards in 35 seconds.  Instead, Arizona may have only needed to cover about 50 yards approximately (due to the kickoff being pushed back by the foul assessment and the return having potential moved the ball much closer to the goal line).|`|3hViVRlQaa	LOL ............What a bunch of whinners,|`|4kdlE54Paa	If my memory serves me right.

Benjamin Watson of the Patriots got flagged this year just for putting the ball under his jersey because his wife was pregnant.

cgnK6nZfaa	I expect a few big trades coming up before the trade deadline which is set at February 19th.    Expected moves:    Marion to Raptors, O'Neal to Heat. Possibly with few role players involved.     Chris Wilcox and Earl Watson (both from OKC) will get traded.     Andres Nocioni and Larry Hughes of the Bulls likely won't be around either.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	I hope Nate and Q get traded for Marcus Camby. That would be exciting cause Camby is an all-star caliber player and the Knicks need a low post presence w/ shot blocking and defensive abilities. He is a great rebounder too and is very athletic and has the midrange game to play the uptempo game.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Eye pooping!!!! hahahahaa    And expect the Raptors to make a couple moves|`|YQLNqgnWaa	j rich was sorta exciting but yah your right|`|2wrenQfuaa	Wait until tomorrow when the Pistons trade again.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Eye pooping, eh?|`|sOae9LUzaa	The GMs are all procrastinators.

That was hasty, and as a GM, you'd want to avoid a move like that.|`|zchKmkqsaa	I'm surprised there haven't been any blockbuster trades yet.  But the Allstar break is coming up, so there should be several right before then.  I'm looking for Boozer to get traded, maybe for Rip Hamilton.

O well, we still won anyway =)|`|DfwE83Nbaa	Yes he did.. only his 'delicadeza' prevents him from saying so. Poor bugger, not man enough to accept it.|`|vxIq4UcFaa	Yes, he did cheat, But then   No, he didn't speak the truth!!|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Lets just say he should've told the umpire he not sure what happen|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	You have eyes, why dont you watch the replays?|`|a7OKLGQjaa	Yes and u know it :-)|`|940aeb175b0facf00b53d83108c83e62aa	Yes he did|`|8QY09Pmdaa	yes|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Yes.

There are far to many cameras around to even consider it.  The same question could be asked about McCullums catch that he appealed for  down the leg side and got.The camera shots showed that David Hussey missed the ball by a long way,Hussey was on his way back instead a wide being called.    You have to take the good with the bad in this game.|`|HSXxRjysaa	YES|`|mwGancPWaa	Yes he did cheat he should of said something|`|ZqVz0QR2aa	Yes|`|Zd9whuMmaa	Yes I think Brad Haddin did Cheat but in saying that the Umpires never picked it up. his gloves were in front of the wicket. so is is cheating but if you can get away with it you are okay
xhHfXuKFaa	he showed the cavs and celts hes not afraid of them.|`|reIMLCKkaa	He shot over 60% 19 for 31, and 50% fr the 3 with only 2 turn overs. If the ball is fall shoot it. If he shoot 19 for 55 I would agree but he shot a higher % in this game than anyone averages in a season. I bet if he had 15 ast and 20 point yo would be complaining he cant win without Bynum and should have lead the team and scored more    Also Gasol had 31 point aswell    LO, Farmar, Vlad, Sasha and Powell went a combined 4 for 23 so no one else had shots falling. Kobe had to take over had score|`|YQLNqgnWaa	kobe is the mvp, if he doesnt get it well; he'll get finals mvp then|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	kobe is not mvp. i think everyone has been asking this question for the past 3 hours.|`|98wFqBwSaa	I think it's another reason for Laker fan boys to ask unsportsman like questions in the basketball section.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Kobe being Kobe|`|yWzSiwFtaa	sorry kobme me me we arent show offs like boston fans...but kobe scored the 61 in such a variaty of shots that it just amazes me|`|eGmbnQMuaa	ok, this just shows that kobe is >>> better than james... james is practically the life line in the cavs... but the lakers got, gasol, bynum, and bryant. and with those 3 in, bryant was still on par with james in terms of scoring. now that bynum is out, bryant is showing what he can really do. all those games with bynum, i'd say kobe was focusing more on the teamwork and trying to get the ball around. but now with bynum out, kobe is showin what he can truly do, and with the 61 points, the in the 30 something minutes of play, shows how much better kobe is than james. with bynum out, im pretty sure kobe is going to be making a LOT more points, and eventually getting him MVP + championship!!1    kobe kobe kobe!!!|`|fz77R5Jmaa	yeaaah Kobe!!! go Kobe go  thats what i think!  LA all the way|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Scoring 61 against a bad, disinterested Knicks team isn't all that impressive.

YmV3TNTpaa	He should take example of Caniggia, Doni, Vieri & co    When you're a 34 years old forward with nowhere to go, sign for Atalanta|`|mK06dus9aa	I agree he should be playing, so he probably has two choices - a middle ranking Italian club or a return to Argentina. He will be 34 this year so options are limited.|`|wrhqkEiMaa	He's not getting enough playing time because he hasn't been in form since his Copa America injury.  He knows that himself thats why he's not demanding to go anywhere, or demanding more playing time.    He had some great chances against Torino to score and guarantee more playing time (and even a starting place on the squad).|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	i doubt Mourinho still wants him around, since he's 34 Inter will be looking for a replacement for him in the summer, Mourinho has set his sights on several targets, now it's too late to sell or loan Crespo, an extension seems out of the question, he can gain his form back in Argentina, unless a smaller team is willing to acquire his services.|`|7Xridrxaaa	Inter should have accepted that offer from a Mexican club for that 6 month loan. I think Crespo's intention were to get back to the 2010 World Cup. He is going to get nowhere in the bench in the Serie A. But Inter had to say no! Despite the big money contract it was rumored America had made for him. As for joining this summer, like i said. His intention is probably to catch the eye of Maradona. So he must want some playing time.

I would be worried Arshavin is there for the big bucks only rather than a choice of a final career and heart move.
IRNvfdB9aa	If you watch the fight, the greasing in the corner started inbetween rounds 1 and 2, and the NSAC officials didn't notice or ATTEMPT to towel him down until after the second round. Why is this vital? In the second round was when GSP performed the first takedown into BJ's guard, and BJ attempted to climb up to a high guard, and his legs immediately slipped down. It happened several times. And meanwhile, GSP accomplished damaging BJ Penn with ground and pound from his guard.     Again, to summarize: greasing can be seen inbetween rounds 1 and 2; NSAC officials DID NOT TOWEL after first greasing infraction; and BJ Penn was hindered by said illegal greasing.     NSAC will have to rule on this.    Additionally, for anyone that grapples, it is well known that once lubricated, toweling only removes the excess from the epidermis. It does not remove the contraband from one's pores, which will store said lubricant until one starts perspiring, when it will seep out. Toweling doesn't prevent this.    E|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	Face it:    BJ Penn is a whiny little prima donna who got his tail handed to him by a far superior fighter.    Stop whining, or GSP will slap a rear naked on you faster than BJ Penn can whine.|`|89178de53c80f9417af7166023891385aa	It is very hard to apply a triangle from under when someones body is all slippy slidy like that around the shoulders, your feet try to pass but they keep slippin. If this allegation is true, its a cheap attempt to defuse one of Penn's strong weapons and those who did it should get be tied up, legs spread open and allowed to be kicked in the nuts by BJ 3 times.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Seems like the cornerman might still have something on his hand when he run GSP's back.  NSAC Official wiped GSP's back with towel before the start of the round, Penn's fanboys claimed that it was the only reason Penn got owned.    You asked me, have them fight again, GSP is not just another 170 pounder. He is 'the' 170 pounder. He has outwrestled wrestling champion and outpunched punching specialist.  If Penn feels like he want to get punch around again then lets get it on.  I'll just be the one collecting money from my Penn's fanboys friends    Look, Penn is phenomenal, but he is small, he will be a monster in lightweight but he won't get pass the top echelon of welterweight, he certainly won't get pass GSP.  Penn record showed that he lost to Hughes once Matt Hughes found his form.  Penn also suffered a lost from Lyoto Machida, another good fighter much bigger than Penn.  And of course from GSP...twice.    There is a reason why weight class is used in MMA, I mean Penn should go try to conquer and establish in his weight class, fight Urijah Faber, fight Ken Flo.....I mean Faber is phenomenal too. That will be a much better fight for Penn.  Throwing himself against a huge slab of granite that is GSP won't get Penn anywhere.|`|1Byis7Flaa	Yes GSP greased! And there are pictures.  That grease is vasoline. And if anyone has ever used it that stuff gets spread all over the place.  Did it affect the fight?  Yes! BJ wasn't able to keep apply the triangle on GSP, because GSP just kept slipping out.  GSP is a dirty fighter. YEP, I said it.  Comes off as being humble but this is just the begining.  GSP throws his forearms down on the tractea of his opponents, BJ included which totally takes the breath away from his opponents.  Illegal? I'd say so.  GSP grabs shorts  GSP puts his hands over the mouths of his opponents,  GSP hits in the back of the head. (And the ref says, "Please Mr. GSP don't do that")  GSP is a great athlete who should not have to result in cheating or fighting dirty. But he does.|`|MnECjJ00aa	bj had poor conditioning,  had to gain a rediculous amount of weight,  talked a rediculous amount of ****.  took a week off of training to go to hilo.    it made very little difference,if any.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Randy J - "I personally don't think the little bit of residue grease would have much effect"    You obviously have no idea what the hell you are talking about. First off Vaseline does not just wipe off. Second the official that saw it did a quick halfass wipe down because time was about to run out on the break. Third of all Friction is one of the keys to grappling. When there is not much friction there is not any way to hold a very good guard at all and no good guard means no submissions.    To the questioner. Yes he was greased. Did it affect the out come, who knows. GSP put on a spectacular showing. But if he was in B.J. Penn's guard and he made one mistake that is all it would have taken (with out the grease).     Quite frankly I am pretty pissed that it happened and I hope some one gets in deepshit for it. I will not point the finger but...it's just bad all the way around    Edit: DeltaSigChi4 beat me to it    Edit: Fair and Balanced: This is not coming from a BJ fanboy. This is comeing from the NSAC. Do you have any idea what that means. I am a fan boy of one fighter and that is Matt Hughes. I did not care who won this fight. I just wanted to see a good fight and it is pretty apparent that there was cheating! I am a fan of the sport not of Penn not of GSP...this is wrong.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	GSP's corner man greased him up, if you can even call it that. Whether it was intentional or not, is up for debate. I personally don't think the little bit of residule grease would have much effect. And anyways, the NSAC toweled him down in between rounds just in case.     BJ Penn didn't have a shot, either way.    Edit: Well there you go, you're a fanboy of Matt Hughes. Everything you said is null and void.|`|ayFd2u7naa	I don't think it would have mattered he was so dominate that BJ Penn didn't have a chance.

tFxNfvJgaa	I think kobe has returned to his mvp form due to the loss of andrew bynum, and Gasol is getting a lot more touches because of that. Those two players are essentially becoming the best one two punch once again. Lamar Odom has learned that he can do a lot to contribute to the team despite the minutes by playing on the bench for half the season, we can see his defense and rebounding become more productive as he started today. Luke Walton is looking more athletic as his role was challenged by ariza and Rad. Farmar is getting smarter and quicker and will possibly replace D Fish in the near future. Ariza is healthy and aggressive as usual as his defense improved and 3pt shooting also improving, he also learned the triangle offense better. Laker bench Sasha is shooting with the same kind of confidence. Chris Mihm is healthy and Josh Powell has been helpful as well. The Lakers still has a lot of ground to cover as far as the most dominant team in the NBA, they are still too soft and their perimeter defense needs some work as well. Other than that we are definitely the best team to go for that trophy.|`|rZmiyAqJaa	Remeber last years playoffs, laker 'fans'?  In case you haven't noticed the Celtics have been passing every test.

In case you fools haven't noticed, the Celtics are still the best team in the leauge. They are playing better than ever.       I'm glad you people are still ( jees you'd think last years finals woulda taught YOU something) taking them too lightly, all the better when all the so-called experts pick them to be the underdog again.

HZ8KkQKWaa	a difference is that Mexican television is in spanish...also in soccer they put more emotion by how they narrate the game    well in Mexico its almost the same thing as the Spanish stations here(maybe because the Spanish stations here copy the shows over there)....all you do is watch a Spanish channel and compare and contrast it with a English channel    also in Mexico they show many shows from here just in spanish...ex. house, malcom in the middle, lost, law and order ect.|`|33YAhRXFaa	there really is nothing mexican about dish latino. it's american programming in spanish. a lot of movie channels in mexico.    they have discovery channel, nickelodeon, mtv, etc. all in spanish of corse and they have their own shows, different from the united states. but they do show jackass, south park and other shows. you wont see carson daily over there though, they have their own music video shows, reality shows, etc.    espn in mexico sucks ***. all they show is tennis, car racing, golf, and infomercials at night. fox sports shows a lot of soccer but usually from argentina since mexico shares most cable channels with the rest of latin america.     in mexico but the same stuff is shown around the country simultaneously, with the exception of tijuana, they get programming 2 hours later because of time zone difference.     tv azteca and televisa are the largest networks in mexico. they show everything from the simpsons to nfl games.|`|aNnmH3R4aa	Uhh....just to let you know.....When you order Dish Latino....they throw in Playboy en Espanol along with your programming.        Any diffrence?  If you ask me....its all the same garbage.  Just in either spanish or english.   Dish Latino is not just for Mexicans.  They have the channels where they show nothing but old school Mexican movies but they also have channels for the rest of Latin America.  Programing is set up the same.  Any channel that has spanish programing does whatever it takes to get ratings.  They will put up any reality show up in spanish if its a big hit in the states and vice versa.  Take for example...Ugly Betty.  An original from Venezuela (correct me if I'm wrong).  Big hit there....then Televisa did its own version.....now here in the states we have Ugly Betty.  Its basically whatever sells....whatever gets them ratings they will put up in either english or spanish!|`|8zgFyfibaa	N.a.t.e. You answered your question.

In the US, americans don't give a crap about soccer.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Well I have SKY.  We got it cuz we really missed Mexican Tv Channels.  The difference is that like you said they dont worry a lot about censoring stuff.  There are waay more hot chix in the TV.  And TV over in Mexico is by far more creeative then the lame shows of the US.
kKbqdlbnaa	Yeah, they should allow coaches to have a certain number of challenges. I know Jeff Van Gundy (if he was still coaching) would use them all in like the first two minutes.|`|yWzSiwFtaa	thats wat im saying man... give the coaches two challenges... that would be the best thing since reviewing homeruns in baseball|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Then the coaches would just use them in the fourth quarter and make the final 2 minutes last an hour more than it already does.

1d4Vin3Waa	Fringe groups that are on the edges of legal society have zero impact on real policy decisions. In this case the 3 percenters are a circus freak show media wise and no real political groups would align with them. Posse Comitatus might be the concept these groups have but in reality it is a misdirected combination of Libertarian and mob rule ideology.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Lord Pikachu frowns upon your shenanigans.|`|AA11570394	If you are referring to Mike Vanderboegh and the 3 percenter group, then yes I know what you mean.    And he is not actually going to be able to stop any gun confiscation. Even if he had millions of followers it would do no good and history of late shows this.  If it came down to it and a law was passed making it illegal to own firearms do you honestly think a group of people could stop the government? They would immediately be villainized by the media, the public would see them as dangerous nut jobs, the government would trounce them and they would either be dead or in prison.   When countries did ban guns, there never was any public uprising worth mentioning. Did the Australians, Canadians, Britons start a civil war over most of their guns being banned? Nope! And this is true for many other countries as well. The fact is the general public may have some outspoken people saying they will rise up and fight to the death but change their mind real fast when they realize they may die, have their family killed or sent to prison when its at their door. The minutemen militia group in Montana had a stand off with law enforcement some years ago and they all gave up.  If anything I think this radical talk is bad for gun owners. Non-gun owners would see such radical talk as a sign of crazy people. We want the non-gun owners to like us not be afraid of us. Telling the general public that there are millions of gun owners with 10s of millions of firearms and trillions of rounds of ammunition ready to start a civil war is BAD public relations!  Our country has a process of legislation and if this process decides to make a law, we as citizens need to lobby to change that law if we dont like it, not become criminals and riot. In fact any violent reaction to a law would play right into their hands. They could say look we were right all along these people are a threat to the USA! Then they would have public support to use any means necessary to remove such a threat.     The only real answer in keeping our 2nd amendment rights is by legal means through our votes, letters to congress, and the support of elected officials who are on our side. Not by threatening to cause death and destruction! The general public is not going to love a bunch of domestic terrorists killing people no matter what they are defending. And broadcasting such radical intent could actually bring about draconian laws against gun ownership.  People need to think here and not get all pissed off and do something stupid.  Or do we want this in the future history books?; During the beginning of the 21 century enacted gun laws created a bloody civil uprising costing thousands of lives and led to the complete ban of any firearms in the United States.     Remember the saying? The pen is mightier than the sword|`|D9Nv0uiDaa	During our founding fathers time firearms were the main weapon to defend freedom and life it aint so today. Thanks to modern technology we got a slew of weapons out there that dont go bang and guess who has most of them? We only have to look at our war in Iraq and we can see what happens when a large group of armed people try to attack our troops, they end up dead.  And for those who are a sayinfrom my cold dead hands.what will that do to help? Dead hands dont cast votes, dead hands dont help change things. For thousands of gun owners to commit suicide fighting the most powerful military on earth would only help the anti-gun creeps. If we are to win this fight we need to stay alive being dead wont help a bit.  Instead of getting all riled up and tryin to scare people they need to spend that energy and money convincing the public not to be afraid of guns or us.  If the millions of gun owners went to the streets peacefuly and demanded impeachment that would be far better than violent actions to sway the public.    Id bet my last dollar the antigun people are prayin we do something like the 3 percenters suggest.    If gun owners are smart when things get bad just make damn sure everything in yer home is legal. This is simple to do. I will make damn sure my home is following the law!! Then when the liberals are out and we have our gun rights back I will go get my stuff and bring it back home, simple as that.

nSQjZIU4aa	Hi,  I do a lot of ice fishing here in Idaho. What I have found is water ranging in depths from 8- 14 feet are more productive.  Go too deep and it is to cold and dark.  To shallow and there is not enough oxygen to produce food.  Especially if there are any weed beds.  After all fish are looking to feed either on aquatic bugs or other fish.  Look for weed beds, submerged structure or any formation of rocks where thes little critters can hide and you will find fish.  Fish relatively close to an island will probably be better than fishing in open water areas.

"No. No. No, I haven't told him that," Bosh said Monday after practice.    ESPN's Stephen A. Smith reported that Bosh told team officials he was leaving in a season and a half, not even citing anonymous sources.    "It was a surprise to me and I can't be responsible for what other people say so ....," said Bosh. "I understand people are entitled to an opinion but making stuff up? We can't do that."    Colangelo also shot down the rumor.    "There's no truth to the rumour or the speculation that he said anything to us in the organization, that he's going to be leaving," said the general manager. "There's no truth to the fact that he's on the trading block or being shopped in any regard.    "This is just another example of information that's out there that's not true .... There just doesn't seem to a lot of accountability with respect to the topic sometimes and that's why we're here today talking about it."|`|bjnPGBZyaa	Bosh isn't resigning in 2010. True.

sOae9LUzaa	They should make a trade for Marc Gasol in Memphis or for Carlos Boozer in Utah.

Unlike last year Bynum's injured knee isn't as bad as it was a year ago.  He will be back in time for the playoffs, maybe even earlier.  Secondly, lets not forget the Lakers dominated the West without Bynum, and he will most likely be back anyhow.      They will be fine with Gasol and Kobe just like last year until the big man Bynum comes back for the playoffs.  Chill

Or  Santos VS Indios  Indios Has had a good Start with 1 win and two ties I think.Plus there the underdogs this season because they barely came up from the Primera Division A and because there in danger of going back down.Santos Has a had a bad start but just one year ago they Won there 3rd Championship,People may underestimate them but I think there going to make a comeback against an Indios that's going to fight back.  Best games|`|Cpm25Pekaa	America vs Pachuca    I'm an Americanista. Great names that play great at futbol.

ishPf2Glaa	I think that football should be a multi game playoff, but certainly not a 7 game series... Basketball does it with games almost every other night, i think its extremely exciting.    There are several strategies involved in a series like this as well....    1) Playing every other night forces teams to play on skills instead of tape. They cant just review the tape for a week before a game and make up new strategies. It makes the game much more "Improv".  2) Teams who win quick, get time off, giving them a chance to do exactly what i mentioned in  1. Rewarding teams for winning quickly is only logical. In the NCAA they award teams who won ALOT by giving them a bye in the first round...   3) It keep the players playing longer into the year, and draws more attention to events like the lottery and draft. To be honest, away from the basketball season, i rarely touch sportscenter...|`|jfkn8ktQaa	it doesn't  take 4 weeks, 15 days at maximum which last time i checked was 2 weeks and 1 day|`|o8RITD3faa	It is a series of games.

If you do this on an elevated surface, even better (more range of motion--works more muscles). With the pushups, you can use handles, or two chairs. Depending on how strong you are, you can do incline pushups with your feet up on a chair. With the dips--again, depending on how strong you are, you can use one chair and get more of your triceps and posterior delts, or two chairs (or even a walker, or L-shaped counter area) and get more chest, lateral, and anterior delts.     Sorry, no site. Just personal experience. Works for me. Good luck.|`|zGtPuRHIaa	u should do running , stretching , pull ups for a good body.

7b380dd2bff53f4bbeaff97b954c88d7aa	Before you start your fitness campaign, why don't you begin by calling the game by it's proper name, football.     Unlike American football, watched by billions less people, it has hundreds of years history! Get your own name.|`|AA10838453	Running would help you a lot.  Running in either a gym or on a track field.  You can use a track by running sprints around the curves and jogging the long, or just for distance you can also use a basketball court for sprints and do suicides where you run from the line under the hoop to the free throw line, back and then to half court and back then to the other free throw line and back then to the other baseline under the hoop back to the originial.  You can use a treadmill at a gym if you have a membership and run on that which can also help with distance and sprints, and a bonus is that your inside and out of the heat.  Lifting weights on your legs may help a little but since its soccer running is the main priority!|`|fpemOKcwaa	The best fitness training for soccer is soccer. Find a summer league to play in or some pick up matches. Other than that, road work. Lots of running but make sure you are doing more than just running for distance. Get lots of sprinting in too. One trick, if you are running on a track, is to jog on the straights and sprint on the curves. 6-8 laps like this will keep you pretty fit.    I've heard of other players playing basketball during the off-season too. I've never done it personally but it sounds like a good idea.

gSSF3Vx4aa	Absolutely, he already beat Roger Federer on all three surfaces. Who are going to stop him? The French Open is next and would you bet against him on the red clay so might as well add another Slam to his credit.|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Gannoway, I still think it is Roger who is going to break it first and then Rafa will do it later. I think Roger still has a good shot at Wimbledon and USO for two reasons. Roger loves Wimbledon and he will work hard to get it back. I think he believes that he can win back Wimby and not French from Rafa. Secondly, the reasons why he does well at USO is he plays economy tennis. By the time, people reach USO they are exhausted but Roger's playing style does not affect him that way, so he has every chance to win USO 2009. As a fed fan and a realist, I think Roger will break Pete's record first and then Rafa will, but Fed needs to play his natural game and stop getting pressured from the media and fans.|`|zPnOXbgmaa	thats actually one heck of a question! of course he could POTENTIALLY but its easy to say that about any talented player who's younger than 23. he has several things in his favour, but also a few things going against him...    FOR:he has time on his side, and already 6 slams. he seems to own Roland Garros and should improve at Flushing Meadows. wins at Wimbledon and in Australia could well improve his confidence and lead to multiple slams there. he's powerful and seems to have broken Federer mentally. furthermore, while good young players seem to be coming through, none of these look like potential Nadals/Federer's of the future (that is legend status)    AGAINST: first and foremost he relies on his incredible courtspeed. these types tend to run out of legs sooner or later (look at Chang and Hewitt). the ones who win multiple slams dictate the points like Federer or Sampras. hes also had knee problems that make this even MORE of an issue. this would suggest he could be at the peak of his powers, and then a few months later look to be in huge trouble. once again look at Hewitt- he won Wimbledon in 2002 and was described by some as the "Tiger Woods of tennis"; but never won another slam.  Finally lets not forget that 14 is a very high number- Fed is struggling to equal it after it was claimed that it was inevitable he would surpass is 12 months ago. its FOURTEEN- not thirteen, twelve, or eleven. and until its surpassed it will still be the benchmark.    all in all id say at this stage maybe, but probably not.|`|C9r94iTmaa	Yes, if Nadal stays healthy.  If Nadal gets any severe injury then he would not break the record.  But Nadal just needs to win the US Open and I think he will this year to complete his amazing run at slams.  I think he will win the next 3 slams this year.|`|3I6q9ZgEaa	Of course he can potential do it, its just a matter of how long he can play. Tennis players have short careers for the most part especially those who rely on their physical abilities.    Nadal is one of those players, and he has already shown signs of wear and tear, but I am pretty sure he can still play at a very high level on all surfaces for the next few years and if he hasnt broken the record by then im sure even at a older age he can probably still win the french with his superior clay court play.|`|pSiwm8rmaa	I was just telling my chum that he might well do that. It's a good question. The one question I have is how long can he continue to play this style of tennis without his body being worn out?|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	So you think Federer is going to go the rest of his career with out winning another 2 slams? get real|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	an but it would take 3-4 yrs|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Yes he can. Most likely. He's still at the age of 22 and Federer hasn't won much grand slams when he was at that age. Infact, Nadal has won more, so he is very likely to soon beat Pete's record. Nadal is very persistent on the court, and he just won a tournament on the hard court so that's definitely going to create a big threat to other players on the tour. If Nadal keeps this pace up, then there's no doubt he can break the record.|`|d19d6d11466a952bf245413b8442de9eaa	He certainly can break Sampras record but the question is how long he can play. Even his uncle Tony says that he has very short career because of the physicality he shows in matches. He is damaging his body with every single match.    Today he is young and he can recover quickly but 4 years later his body will start to give up. Other big question is that can he defeat Murray and Djokovic on hard courts, He can easily defeat Federer no doubt but in some past matches these two guys has defeated him easily.

Don't say too much against Ponting, there are Kiwis playing in the ICL who can't play for NZ as they are banned.|`|swL7bQfAaa	Not his choice!  with reluctance    Sydney, Feb.2: Australian cricket  captain Ricky Ponting has said that he is missing the next two one-day internationals against New Zealand 'reluctantly', adding that the decision was made by the selectors alone.    "My absolute priority is to the Australian cricket team. I wanted to play on through the coming week and continue to lead the team in the series against New Zealand. However, the decision was made by the national selection panel as part of their plan to rest all players at appropriate times during this year," Fox Sports quoted Ponting, as saying.    "I have reluctantly accepted their decision and will be eagerly awaiting my return to the team," he added|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	we will miss great punter for sure    salutations~|`|Mfi84xBQaa	I think he has done a good thing ......................  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$|`|8u8v5y4uaa	... he has played 9 test matches and every one dayer since the West Indies tour. I think he has earned a reast. Speaking of a captain who has no loyalty to his country, why don't you talk about Stephen Flemming or KP?    Questioning the loyalty of the Australian Cricket captain is just asking for trouble.     Also, do you honestly think it's Ricky's decision to have a rest? The selectors would have told him so he's nice and fresh for the tour that actually means something - the South African tour. These one dayers against a minor country such as NZ don't mean much.    ======================================...    Hmm, you know what. Your English is terrible for someone from NZ.

3teWTOPqaa	It's another lessen on DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS. Suns style is great, very entertaining to watch when they had D'antoni coaching them, but in the playoff, games come down to the last few plays and it depend on who can make enough stops and the stops that counts.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	They have had a good team, but I feel their chance passed and it is time to rebuild. Here are some goals:  1. Build around Amare Stoudemire- Sign him to an extension and make him the focal point of the offense.  2. Find the next big scorer for the backcourt- Richardson, Nash, and Barbosa are not the answer.  3. You have a Center, use him. Robin Lopez is one of the best defensive centers in the game, and teams like the Bulls and Jazz of the 90s proved you do not need a center to get to the finals.  4. Replace Steve Nash- It is time to cut ties with Nash, even though he is still great, it is time to rebuild the franchise.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	I agree with MC Blondie, you need Defense.|`|i0Igqvroaa	because they cant play consistent. and they play too slow! brink back d'antoni!|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	I think the Suns are a solid offensive team. They can score with anybody in the league. But defensively, I think they ALL need to improve, not just Nash.   Amare is a blocker. Not a defender. There's a HUGE difference. I've seen mediocre players like Nick Collison DESTROY him. Shaq is not nimble anymore. He's an obstacle, but not a side to side defender. A center who likes to shoot can take Shaq out of the game. Grant Hill is probably your best defender, but he's older now and not as quick as he used to be.   It's DEFENSE that wins championships. It's what Boston does better than anybody else. They make it difficult for you to score on them.   That's what I think Phoenix needs. They need to take their opposition out of their offensive game. Make them work hard to get the shot they want. They don't scare anybody defensively. And that's what championship teams do. They scare the heck out of people who don't know how to score on them.    Peace!|`|bjnPGBZyaa	they play no DEFENSE|`|UBIlwiALaa	They had their best chance the year they took the Spurs deep into the Western Conf. finals and Amaire got suspended for leaving the bench.  Nash isn't the best defender I'll give you that, but he isn't looking to score.  I've noticed he only does this mainly when the other team is trying to make him a scorer b/c they realize that is when the Suns are at their worst.  So they try to make him shoot more instead of passing the ball off.  I think the Suns got worse when they got rid of Marion and others and got Shaq., although he's one of my favorite players he doesn't match what kind of team they are.|`|OtvtJKwvaa	i'm also surprised about the way things are going for the suns, they have shaq, stoudamire, barbosa, hill, richardson, nash, barnes etc. but still they can't seem to find the right formula to win. They now have the center that they lacked for years, they have a great perimeter and three point shooters, they played a great basketball in running game style, they have a great point guard what else do you want. But the factors that affect the phoenix team right now are their age, shaq nash and hill will retire maybe 3 years from now, they also lack in defense which is important in the end and close games. Maybe suns franchise start to plan for their future.|`|E3tWPVEqaa	The suns have never recruited well  They've got a Ageing centre in O'Neal  They also dont have good players at Small Forward and at SHooting Guard  Steve Nash at Point Guard cant do everything.|`|ZCzAhuafaa	defense wins championships|`|cgnK6nZfaa	They don't mesh well. Shaquille is overachieving and Amare isn't happy with his current role. They're also playing in a totally different system after years of playing run and gun under Mike D. (no D actually).     They don't have the roster to play the way Porter wants to.|`|WIczM4URaa	nash is overrated. amare is leaving the team soon|`|A71U6gNtaa	because of DEFENSE|`|ebD1plKNaa	There are very few head coaches in the NBA that seem to bring the right game plan to a team and have the wherewithal to make it work.  Any pro team needs to be able to do a hand full of things:  Play run and gun.  Play half court sets.  And play effective defense against teams that do both.  San Antonio and Detroit of a couple of years ago are good examples of this.  It's not so much about the players as it is about the system.  Phoenix has some great players, but their coaches need to figure out how to make their system bring out the best in the players on both sides of the ball.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	It's extremely tough both physically and mentally.    Like most sports, you have to be a great athlete to be good at it. The difference is, for most positions, you have to be smart too.    Also, if you watch the game, there are so many layers of complexity to what's going on. It's easy enough to pick up the idea of what's going on after a few games, but the more you watch, the more you understand how plays are made, and why certain things happen on the field.    It's kind of like chess, just, you know, with 350 pound pawns tackling each other.|`|4kdlE54Paa	If you have watched it and don't get it, it is because you still haven't grasped how the game is played.

AA11620976	Just 1500 words ?LOL  Lemme  see what I know about  this subject  What is a trail ?  A trail is an unpaved recognizable foot  path thru a natural area that a person or an animal [deer do make trails ] created by continually walking  or gosh forbid riding across it  so that in time the soil is compacted and usually vegetation is removed by either continuous use or man made means   One of the really important words in that description is the word "compacted "  I can tell you from experience ,that  when you're hiking the remote parts of the Tonto Trail in Grand Canyon and you're playing the usual Tonto game of finding, losing and finding trail again one of the things that your educated feet will  instantly tell you is the difference between being on trail [compacted soil ] and being off trail [ loose soil ]  My educated feet actually saved my life one night by telling me that i was  off trail and thus   prevented me from walking off of a 900' cliff in the dark.  Why is compaction such an important concept?  In a word "Water"  Many normal soils will readily absorb water  and in many cases it is the root systems of the local vegetation that  the keeps the soil together and uncompacted  Compacted soils  do not absorb water readily and what happens is that falling water sits on top of the soil [think pavement ] doesn't get absorbed at all and then rapidly accelerates either down or across the trail depending upon that trail's  orientation to the fall line of the slope  What i have just so badly described is called man- made erosion  Until  preventive measures are taken ,as trail use increases ,the rate of erosion will increase ,and the trail will get wider and the puddles will get deeper  and more vegatation will be destroyed and what used to be a trail just became a street  So let's watch the process at work  You just bought a pair of brand new and damned expensive hiking boots ,you're walking down a trail ,there's a big old puddle right in middle of it ,you go Ewwww! You naively decide to walk around the puddle .your Vibram soles dig in and in 30 seconds you just did years worth of damage to that trail. Other similarly  naive hikers follow your lead and the  trail gets wider ,the puddles get deeper and more important vegetation gets destroyed  Along comes a group that I personlly think doesn't belong in any kind of wilderness ever >aka  the mountain bikers>and they  and their knobby tires do in an instant what it you and your Vibrams 30 seconds to do.  The above sequence happens on established trails on all too regular basis  Now that  you have the back story on it you have to ask yourself what would happen if a bunch of bikers or hiker with no doubt the minimum of knowledge about the factors that i just described , took it upon themselves to place a trail where it probably has no business being?  Solution:  Pick an environment  Create a trail  Describe any and all damage  Word of the day :Cryptogamic soils>look it up   Sorry about the wordiness and the typos

They must be in great condition to do what they do. Their ability to fight has never been in question. But lets keep it simple. WWE and the other brands are entertainment. The wrestling matches are not real. Fighting is one thing, Sports Entertainment is just that Entertainment.|`|MCB1ovEtaa	I never had anything against professional wrestlers.  It's just not my cup of tea.  But Brock Lesnar is a champ because of his real wrestling experience (college wrestling division 1) oh and his massive size doesn't hurt either.      Trust me guys like "the rock" "hulk hokan" that one super tall guy the great khali or w/e his name is would not stand a chance....|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	Only if they have a legit martial arts background. And I doubt most pro wrestlers have martial arts background. Off the top of my head Shelton Benjamin, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Bret Hart, Undertaker and some more do but not 'most'.    If they do have martial arts training they have my respect but do not say non sense like Shawn Michaels' sweet chin music is stronger than Crocop's left kick. Don't try to tell me John Cena can take anybody in the UFC that stuff is non sense.    Plus anybody who really knows pro wrestling and early UFC would know of Ken Shamrock and his success as a pioneer of the early UFC and Pancrase.|`|B6dQzaGyaa	Josh Barnett is pretty respected, only defeats are to Nogeuira, CroCop 3x, and Rizzo, he has beaten guys like Couture, Nogeuira, Rizzo, Severn, Kondo, Hunt, the smaller Emelianenko, and Monson, so I think he is respected.     Only mark on his record is the positive steriod test, but when Lesnar can put a resume up that includes wins over alot of top talent, then he will earn more. At this point, you have 2 main stream guys that been pro wrestlers, so I would say its hard at this point to say the majority of MMA guys really respect them as legit fighters.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I think some of us have always realized that there are some superb athletes that go into professional wrestling.  Even though it is fake they still take a lot of punishment and put a lot of wear and tear on their bodies. The problem is that even with that and it being fake it is not the same thing as a pro fighter putting his health on the line when he steps into the ring where it is for real.  I have no problem comparing them athletically and certainly some of them could have gone into fighting if they wanted to.  However to many wrestling zealots who think or actually believe that professional wrestling is real compare it to real fighting and the two are not the same thing.
wnZ0N3wjaa	Yeh i think hes going to win the AB medal too, people seem to forget that he first forced his way into the test side with good ODI performances but now its the other way around where hes doing well in tests and not in ODI's but i still think hes a necessity to the aussie side|`|LzkujA3Faa	Mitch is currently the best bowler we have.

So is my favourite for the Allan Border Medal.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	you should stop listening to armchair critics who know little but talk a lot.  mitch has shown he can do the job for australia and when the whole team hits form together he'll be up there getting wickets.  the only concern i've heard is that having two left-armers in the team might not be what the selectors want, and nathan bracken is an excellent one day bowler.    a slower ball or an off cutter slips from his hand a few times and all of a sudden he's crap?|`|zoB64Ymoaa	mitchell for allan border medal 2009 !|`|y2CzXNTLaa	I agree that he will win the Allan Border medal and he was definitely the best Australian bowler in the test series but in the ODI series so far he hasn't been near his best and has been a little bit expensive but that is to be expected after a break i guess|`|cy16ihq1aa	i dont think he is going bad...
yYQsfnVGaa	In reality, playing wii tennis is absolutely nothing like playing REAL tennis...yes, we all know that. But with that being said, it shouldn't affect her. Though, one problem is that she plays too much to the point where she may find it difficult to stay stable on the court and play much differently. She may play like what she plays whenever on the wii. I suggest she shouldn't play it everyday, especially for long hours. I'm not saying she should stop playing the wii, but she should at least take a couple of breaks from it.    And yes, wii tennis is epic indeed.|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	I would say it is helping her skills.

But that's not to say she can't still have fun with it :)|`|qFLgBIP7aa	as long as she isn't trying to use what she uses on the court in front of the tv it shouldn't be a problem seeing how the game doesn't resemble tennis in the slightest.

g1ciF3DVaa	Well Jordan Farmar just came back 2 weeks earlier than they had originally predicted.  In an interview Bynum said that he starts rehab in a couple of days. Rehab for that sort of injury takes about 6-8 weeks and then the strengthening of the muscles another 2-4 weeks so you never know if he gives it his all and is a quick healer then we'll have him back a couple weeks before the first round of the play-offs which would be great so he can be able to get his timing and conditioning back, not to mention his confidence so he can be able to play at the level or at least close to the level he was playing at before he went down.    =]|`|oMSTg5rQaa	Coming back early would not be a good idea.    Look, I know your a big time Laker fan and you want to see your team win a title soon, but this latest injury should single an alarm to EVERYONE as specially the Lakers training staff.    This kid has weak knees. On top of that have you seen the way he moves? The way he jumps? He is still weak and akward as hell. Watch how big men like Duncan, Garnett, Shaq and Stoudemire move. Look at the their feet and coordination when the move and jump and then look at Bynum. He's an injury waiting to happen because of he runs and lands akwardly.    Instead of 8-12 weeks he needs to sit out the rest of the season and work on getting his WHOLE LOWER BODY stronger, not just his upper body, which he obviously worked on last season.|`|MJgi6z1Raa	well,, i might actually have the answer to your question, remember when karl Malone was with the lakers??? he injured his right mcl late december of 2004,,but they did not know if it was actually torn or sprained !!, Anyway, he came back in mid march and he finished the season with the lakers, later in june while playing the finals agaisnt detroit, he injured it again but it was freak accident in game 2, i think someone landed on his right knee agravating it again, with all said and done, karl malone was about 37, he healed with in 3 months, so i would say that a way..younger andrew bynum might indeed get healthy right about the 9th week as the latest, right in time to join the lakers by midway first round, by then,,,im looking at the positive side, he should be playing top shape form by the western conference finals if we do get that far,,,,don't worry about it,, jordan farmar had surgery and came back 31 days later,,,these guys are young and are professionals at what they do, don't be surprised if you see him back 2 weeks before the season ends...!!! Go Lakers.......!!!!|`|3teWTOPqaa	There is always the possibility of returning early, Farmar did remember? But there is a reason there are estimate, most of times they are logical and that's how long it would take. Andrew should be able to play after 10 weeks, at least 6 weeks if we are lucky, but it will take him an additional 2-3 weeks to get back in shape and work his knee to their old strength.|`|reIMLCKkaa	As long as he is back for the second round of the playoffs ill be happy, atleast the finals... but id like him to come back second round, limited, and work his way back in to condition before the finals|`|yTD84yFlaa	Well, not totally sure on other players.    But when they interviewed Bynum, he said it is not anywhere near as painful as the injury he had last year that forced him to miss the playoffs.  Lakers fans are going with the 'wishful thinking' this year.    I'm looking @ Cavs in the Finals rather than Celtics.|`|sxKrb98Caa	Anything can be possible. The dates that the doctor are given are educated guesses on when he will be able to play without any risk of doing further damage. He might recover much sooner but might still be out to make sure that everything is good before he gets on that court because the last thing they want is for him to re-injure it by not taking all the time he needs to rest it up.

gz2M5hsBaa	These are the standard requirements as per the ICC standard test match and ODI playing conditions:    Playing area: minimum 140 yards from boundry to boundry square of the pitch.    Pitch should be minimum 60 yards from one boundry sqaure of the pitch.    When this minimum distance is used the pitch has to be minimum 80 yards from the opposite square boundry.     The straight boundry at both ends of the pitch shall be minimum 60 yards from the centre of the pitch.     These dimensions are for those grounds which are used for ODI or Test match after 1st July 1995.

There is no fixed size or shape for the field, although large deviations from a low-eccentricity ellipse are discouraged. In the centre of the field, and usually aligned along the long axis of the ellipse, is the pitch, a carefully prepared rectangle of closely mown and rolled grass over hard packed earth.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	It must be so hard to type in "ICC rules" or "cricket rules" into a search engine.

Nadal didnt make Federer cry. It was the fact that Federer fought for all five sets chasing that elusive record and he came so close from equaling it.    So, you have never cried? You have never let your emotions run?? It takes a REAL MAN to let his emotions go like he did. He didint cry because he lost, he cried because he came so close and dissapointed the ones who meant so much to him!|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	the match was2 days ago. Get over it.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	God you're a tool.

He has some serious problems.  Perhaps he had a father who told him that boys don't cry, and that he would get a whipping if he so much as shed a single tear.  Maybe he was breastfed until he was 6 years old.  Who knows?  The only thing that's obvious is that he needs some professional psychological help.  He's either 10 years old, and just looking to create trouble.  Or he's a grown man who has trouble "getting any" so he spends his time in front of the computer trying to make himself feel better about his sorry life by putting others down.  Get over it, NWO.

FEDERER WON IT HOW MANY TIME?|`|AA12059257	Owned him??? Are you serious? You must have not seen anything from the match except Federer crying because it was played well on both side. During the match the announcers were wondering if Nadal had the stamina to keep going after the 5 setter he played in the Semis. I was amazed at the conditioning Rafa has.    As for you you could take a lesson from both Roger and Rafa. They are both class acts and respectable in all ways unlike you. Whether you are 15 or 45, you really need to grow the hell up because it's really sad.|`|5nzgNWalaa	haha ok that just made me laugh.    well answering your question, it's not fun to see someone cry out of disappointment. but as a Nadal supporter, I'm happy in the sense that Nadal has Federer's number and that can only help him in future matches. I believe (maybe wrongly) that Federer cried not just because he was disappointed but because it was an indication of what was to come i.e. that it would be very difficult for him to beat Nadal in the future and that since Nadal is improving even on hardcourts, it is likely that because of his 'Nadal mental block' his chances of getting more GS titles could very well be diminished.|`|D3MBcnaDaa	you have a serious problem lol. check your doctor.|`|Bobj5RCTaa	You are Mentally retarded|`|OppuEFVzaa	To cry is better than pick something from his ...|`|9447ea59c0351320e67d694a57a85105aa	And ur supposed to have a brain?|`|QcmBsa6jaa	Go baby, u need mama...MAMA"S MILK actually...go home...get lost...|`|pqExee6Oaa	**** you NWO|`|2oBV68RLaa	I am happy because Federer did not deserve to win. He cried because he couldn't take this loss like a man, behaving like a baby whose favourite toy was taken away from him - why couldn't he be thankful just for reaching the final, and gaining good points and money in the process? If Nadal behaved like this after a slam loss, his uncle would have reprimanded him severely.   Federer has not grown up - in the past, when asked about Nadal's closeness to the no.1 position, after Federer lost an important match, he said: "I don't care". Also, he always criticizes Murray unfairly, just because he has a losing record against him. When he lost to Simon in the middle of last year, he said: "this is a match I should not have lost", instead of admitting that the better man won.  All of this points to some one who is immature, who always wants things his way, and when he doesn't achieve this, he sulks - either by making unfair comments about fellow players, or behaving like a baby after a great match. Even the press (at least the intelligent members of the press) are now wising up to Federer's true character, not to mention the tennis fans.

8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	The rushed behind has been part of the game for 150 yrs so I don't think its a good idea to change it.  I know it might be someones job to change at least one rule a year but our game will be unrecognizable soon if that keeps happening so lets leave it as it is.|`|mWp1JpkEaa	do u ever shut up?|`|mXFOru11aa	this is a sh!t rule 'cos now the defence has no chance of not conciding a goal the defender are hardly aloud to touch 'em|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	The AFL is basically making rules where the defenders cant do anything at all...|`|2s244jGgaa	Stricter rules on the rushed behinds really do teach players how to control a situation, whilst being under pressure. A rushed behind is just the simple way out for them, but now it will cost them much more then just a point.     It teaches the players to be tougher, and not give up without a fight. It creates more action in the game rather than just handballing/tapping the ball through the opposing goalposts.|`|xmg9CBnCaa	i hate the idea. just leave the damn game the way it is. just because there are some angry essendon supporters out there, doesn't mean we have to change the rules. they have to put up with it, just like every other team has for the last 150 years.

Ne1wuUYHaa	Hmm...I swear I just saw this question somewhere else..  Luckily, my response was automatically saved by clipboard.    If you are thinking that the fight could be decided just by how much power Naruto or Sasuke could have drawn at the time, then yes, Naruto could have easily won if he had drawn enough chakra from Kyubi to have 8 tails. I believe Naruto lost the battle because he did not succeed in bringing Sasuke back to the village even after he promised Sakura that he would. This has been one of the only times that Naruto has backed down from his nindo, when he tells Sasuke " I'll bring you back to the village no matter what, even if I have to break your arms and legs". Naruto does not follow his code of the ninja by following through his promise, and this, I believe results in his loss at the Valley.|`|5GptbDKaaa	wtf is this japanese wretlin or sum sot of childrens tv|`|0a70be0e5df1d8d78fcca6ecc91fe8fcaa	wth are you talking about?

oQmT0CX8aa	I would definetely do it. Morneau and Reyes are great players, but Pujols is going to hit 40+ HR's this year and Hanley Ramirez is the most underrated player in the MLB. He is going to steal 40+ bases this year while leading the NL in runs scored and possibly batting average.|`|y6oEKk9daa	yes, you our getting a good deal|`|osqKrcG8aa	Who is your backup Catcher and who is your 1B?|`|AA10405966	I would definitely do it.

Football is more popular, but baseball started the trend.    Did you have a specific question?
AA10405966	He's not playing anymore.  He filed for free agency after the 2005 season and didn't sign with anyone.  There were rumors of him attempting a comeback this year, but it hasn't happened.
AA10405966	Though to come up with one....maybe  Marty Moore.  At the very least, he's been the most successful.  He was picked by the Patriots in 1994.    In his seven-year career, Moore played in 106 games, and started in 17 of them. He played for the Patriots from 1994-99 including Super Bowl XXXI when the Patriots faced the Packers. He has  two interceptions. He went on to play for the Cleveland Browns in 2000.|`|35a65ceab14f2b73328801be0c229651aa	Jim Finn is the only mr irrelevant i know of that didnt suck ALOT    he isnt too good though    who was this years?

Dick "Night Train" Lane was the best ever undrafted free agent EVER.    My best pick for "Mr Irrevelant"?  Rolf Benirschke.  The only Mr. Irrelevant to play in the Pro Bowl, selected following the 1983 season. That year, he was 43-of-45 on extra point attempts and 15-of-24 on field goals. Oddly enough, he was better in 1984, nailing all 41 PATs and 17-of-26 field goals, yet wasn't chosen for the Pro Bowl. By the time his career ended in 1986, he had set 16 Charger team records and was inducted into the Chargers' Hall of Fame in 1997.|`|3xEdBLOtaa	I agree with Hammer. How could you not go with a guy named Rolf?

I went to all three sites, and nowhere on any of them did it state anything of the sort.  Don't believe a word VIP types, because apparently this isn't the first time he's done this.  He really needs to be reported.|`|def578edb9bdb3f63e7681aad375df8aaa	This rumor was squashed, Rikishi is not coming back.
faYbeMBIaa	Exaclty!!! with the GM thing because T Lo said he wanted to give someone more power so he could spend time with Krystal and Vickie told Krystal she will be doing something big!    Mark Henry returns May 4th I heard so that will be cool, Mr Kennedy might be in the Mix but not sure!    Yes, Reys Debut match was ECW November to Remember, he beat Psicosis, that would be great for him to win and wed see a Lashley, Rey Fued (Maybe Remember they are good friends from Smackdown!)    The cover of Judgment day is Kane... he might win a No1 Contender Match    also The Vengance poster shows Lashley holding his ECW title, maybe he will regain or somthin!!!

AA11007152	When scoring a game on a scorecard, each position is assigned a number.    1 = Pitcher  2 = Catcher  3 = 1st Baseman  4 = 2nd Baseman  5 = 3rd Baseman  6 = Shortstop  7 = Left Fielder  8 = Center Fielder  9 = Right Fielder    On a scorecard, F stands for Flyout.  E stands for Error.    When scoring, if there is a Flyout, then the individual keeping score will note the Flyout with an F, then after they will place the number of the position player who caught the ball and made the putout.      In the case of an F9, the Right Fielder caught a Flyball.    The same idea applies to the Error.  In the case of an E3, the 1st Baseman has committed an error.    F9 = Flyout; caught by Right Fielder  E3 = Error on 1st Baseman    Some more examples:  F6 = Flyout to Shortstop  E8 = Error on Center Fielder  L5 = Lineout to 3rd Baseman  FO7 = Foul Out to Left Fielder  U3 = Unassisted Put Out by 1st Baseman  5-3 = Force Out or Tagged; 3rd Baseman to 1st Baseman  DP 6-4-3 = Double Play; Shortstop to 2nd Baseman to 1st Baseman    Check this website out for more abbreviations and scoring explanations:  http://www.baseballscorecard.com/|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	Every position on the field has a number and every type of play has a letter.  You can combine these alphanumeric codes to keep a record of what's happening during any game.  It's also called keeping score or keeping a scorecard or score book.    MLB has a link that explains the basics of score keeping, as some other links with additional relatively basic information.  I'm giving you the links.|`|ujoL8xjYaa	Here is a list of positions    Pitcher (p)-1  Catcher(c)-2  First base (1b)-3  Second base (2b)-4  Third Base (3b)-5  Shortstop (ss) -6  Left Field (LF)-7  Centerfield(CF)-8  Right Field(RF)-9    Here is a list of Outs:  Strikeout- K (swinging), backwards K if looking  Flyout- F (position   F9 = Flyout to RIght field)  Popout-PO (postion   PO2= Popout ot catcher)  Lineout-LO (position   LO3=lineout to first base)  Groundout- position   to Position   (6-3 = shortstop to first)  Groundout unassisted- position   with a U  Fielder's Choice- FC postion   to position   Error-E (postion    E8= Error on centerfielder)  Double Play- DP (position  -position  -position  , ie 6-4-3)|`|AA12167745	Each position is assigned a number. Goes like this: pitcher 1, catcher 2, first baseman 3, second baseman 4, third baseman 5, shortstop 6, left fielder 7, center fielder 8, right fielder 9. These numbers are used when scoring a baseball game. F=fly out, E=error. So in your example F9 would indicate a fly out to the right fielder. E3 would indicate an error by the first baseman. If a ground ball is fielded by the third baseman and thrown to first for the out, that would be indicated by 5-3. A double play ball hit to the shortstop, thrown to the second baseman for one out and then thrown to the first baseman for the second out would be indicated by 6-4-3. Those are some basics in scoring a baseball game. It's really pretty simple to do, and really makes watching the game a little more entertaining. I would suggest Googling instructions on scoring a baseball game for the full instructions. Have fun.|`|UB9N0vpKaa	It's pretty simple really.Each player in the field has an assigned   1-9 pitcher is  1 cather 2 and so on.F. simply means fly.so f-9 is flyout to right field.now for ground outs its listed like 6-3 meaning grounded out  short to first.E. is for error.So E-5 is error on the thrid baseman.There are hundreds of different scoring notations and even giving basics would take quite awhile.You might look up scoring baseball on wiki or another site.Hope I helped a little.Good-luck.

ishPf2Glaa	Bowen definately made a dirty play during that game, it was completely uncalled for, and unfortunate that the referees dont tend to catch such movements. Its not only unfair, but dangerous as well. As for Manu Ginobili.... Im not sure. The guys not exactly the calibur of defender that Bowen is, but he understandably picks up little things from his teammate. I wouldnt be suprised if Manu utilized some sketchy plays to his advantage. I have seen him REGULARLY go to the basket with a knee up, which is supposed to be illegal, but rarely called...|`|0ROZqqAHaa	yeah just like his team mate bowen...|`|AA11204441	well manu doesn't look like a dirty player but we can't just judge him on the way he looks|`|AA11317820	If Bruce and Manu are dirty, what are guys like Stephon Jackson and Carmelo Anthony?  Misplaced boxers?  Those guys just get under your skin.  There are gazillions of tactics to do that in all sports, you have to respect that.  Amare is still young and is still learning this.  He should have went to college, he might have learned this.|`|U8nVog9faa	he is not a dirty player it is basketball it is a physical sport and Stoudamire is just a cry baby, that is all he does if he was more worried about the serious then Bruce and manu maybe they will win the serious but he isn't interested he just a panzy. he needs to get over it it wasn't intentional, so stodumire needs to shut up and and get ready to lose.|`|AA10648370	for those guys that are saying that Bowen and Ginobili are dirty:    - Basketball is a physical sport    - The Spurs are a defensive team, therefore they will not  give you space so you could do whatever you want.    - Ginobili has gotten his share of hits and got his nose broken. Did u ever hear him call someone dirty?   - Defense is about shutting your man down, People use different tactics to get there: any b-ball player knows that.  - how can people call Bowen Dirty and call Artest a great defender? give me a break!  - Didn't Raja Bell clotheline Kobe last year?? was he called a dity player?  - What do u remember about the pistons from the 80's?    Amare needs to focus and play ball. He's too good of a player to be crying about nonsense like that. Things are not always going to go ur way so stop whining and play. He has no right to call  3-TIME CHAMPION team dirty. those guys are professionals. Play Ball, man!!|`|phIKhqppaa	neither of them are dirty. Attempting to throw a guys shot off without getting called for the foul is not playing dirty. Amare proves that the Sun's are not winners, just whiners.|`|fUvWYlCMaa	heres why i think bruce and manu are dirty  1) Bowen cuz he sticks his foot out. He did it to carter, francis, and tried to do it to amare.    2)Manu cuz he flops when he goes to the basket. sometimes he misses the layup on purpose so it can seem as if he got fouled when he rams his body to another player.     just watch tonights game, and you'll see why|`|f9M12Aa5aa	All you have to do is watch the replays , they speak for themselves. Bowen  tried to take Amare down. And  Manu, there no doubt that guys is dirty. Hopefully now that Amare brought it to the NBA attention and him now being a 1st team all NBA they will start penalizuing these guys and get what they deserve. Which is ejected and suspended.|`|ad8ae0beb2658b0fc1163597e0dbaf4faa	amere needs to stop crying im sure it wasnt the first time someone accedently triped him. and how do u call manu a dirty player he doesnt really get any attention and what has he done to be called dirty. the spurs are a fundemental basketball team and theres nothing about them that makes them a dirty team
8f9595b0670caa12eee39e5a71d6f481aa	i think BOTH sux only cena is the best or undertaker|`|ishPf2Glaa	Between the two, im going to support Batista. However, im not a fan of either. I too believe that it would be either John Cena or the Undertaker...    God, i miss the days of the peoples champ, he was the only reason i ever got into WWF in the first place.... now its rare that ill watch it, everthings been done before...|`|vtTw02zEaa	i agree, they both stink, as well as cena. its time for cena to turn bad... i mean cant you hear all the boos from the crowds?     oh, and by the way Samoa Joe, and Cristian Cage would kill them all, well maybe not the Taker...

Toronto beat New York 32 in the first round.[20][22] Wilkens was credited for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major offensive threats of the Knicks. The next series against the Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie and other teammates. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams providing the defensive pressure. Philadelphia took full advantage of the mismatch at centre whereas Toronto counteracted with a fast break offence with their shorter but quicker players. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.[23] Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7.[24][25] Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' best ever regular season record (4735),[20] and finishing second in the Central Division.

ishPf2Glaa	Are you really that incompetant? I mean comeon.... Im a suns fan and i still think your making an *** of yourself by suggesting that...    Think about it. Spurs vs Pistons have met in the finals before, and it was not only the lowest scoring finals games, but also the lowest ratings in NBA finals history.... The league isnt dumb enough to intentionally put those two teams against eachother...

Especially since they will probably be playing detroit and last time they were in the finals it was one of the lowest rated finals in a long time.  I assume this is stemming from the suspensions, look this rule has been applied numerous times in the past 10 years, and you cant just ignore because its a crucial game or a marquee player.  David Stern has tried to change the rule but the owners choose to keep it because it still is a good rule.
ishPf2Glaa	They really only have two smart choices...    1) trash kobe, and pick up other players to build the TEAM around....    2) Keep kobe, and keep building him with the young talent he already has.    Laker fans are making asses of themselves saying that there is no talent on the team... They have alot of it. If the Lakers were to add Kidd, or KG, or any other superstar for that matter, it would be a disaster. Kobe kills the ego of all his teammates, as hes proven in the past time and time again. If he was able to establish a strong core with himself, bynum, odom and walton, the team could be a strong competetor down the road....|`|5d5b2dcdde07da94a6e5f2a73d65b998aa	-Send Kobe to "passing camp"  -Find someone to play in the post.|`|UUL1C4jgaa	give kobe the unemployment slip.|`|c26d35773dee861a5530e2da4a0f442eaa	One point guard and one dominant big man.

8cc30f1029cd73207f290e48b2383af3aa	I think this way is better because the teams with the worst records need a good player than a better team that also isn't in the playoffs. The Grizzlies need a player (especially PG or C) more than a team like the clippers. Both these teams are not in the playoffs but yor can see that there is a huge difference talent wise. The only thing that I don't like about the new way is that if a team is doing bad at the end of the season they purposefully loose most of there games to get a higher draft pick.|`|ishPf2Glaa	Because teams in the west that dont make the playoffs are often times still really good teams. why would you reward good teams, even if they dont make the playoffs.... the way it is now, is fair, and it offers the league a chance to even the playing field more than ever.... look at all the teams that were considered scrubs about 5-10 years ago..... Cleveland, Pheonix, Utah, Toronto.....|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	I don't like it.  I think the worst teams should have a better shot at landing the top spot.  Realize that since 1990, the team with the worst record has won the lottery only 3 times.  In other words, it's no guarantee.  I assume you are wanting to fix the problem of teams seemingly losing on purpose at the end of the season, but it would be bad for the NBA if a team like the Clippers got the number one pick today.  Last year, the fifth worst team (Toronto) won the lottery, the year before it was the Bucks who were the 6th worst.  I do think that the worst team should have some kind of guarantee of top 3 or something.  Last year Portland was the worst record, but ended up with the 4th pick.  I think it's important to give the bottom of the barrel a better chance, though.  Teamse that just miss the playoffs like the Clipps should not have a great shot at number one.|`|EhA8VBKyaa	They never gave everyone an equal chance, but the teams in the lottery with the the better records, used to have more ping pong balls than they do now.  After the Orlando Magic won the lottery 2 years in a row, the second year with the least statistical chance of winning, they changed it.    They changed the amount of ping pong balls to give the teams with the worst records an even greater chance of ending up with a high pick, and the better teams with a very slim chance.    The team w/ the worst record still does not usually end up with the first pick.     2006 - Toronto only had the 5th worst record  2005 - Bucks only had 6th worst record.
MVRi6GyIaa	A point guard is the player who runs your offense and is an extension of the coach in most cicumstances. He's repsonsible for calling the plays, and giving his teammates commands during offensive and defensive sets. Usually, but not always, is the best ballhandler, passer, and shortest member on the floor. Greats: John Stockton, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Bob Cousy   Shooting guards, or the two man, are mainly scorers. There have been some great lock-down defenders in the NBA's history at this position though. It is usually easier to be a great player at this position due to the amount of touches, and the skill set a shooting guard must have. Good stroke and the best ones can slash pretty well. Greats: Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant  Small forwards are an interesting hybrid of a player. Usually expected to be an all around good player with adequate size to play down low when necessary. Need to be able to handle the ball, to take pressure of the back court, need to be a good rebounder, and need to shoot well. Greats: James Worthy, Scottie Pippen, John Havlicheck, Larry Bird (sp?)  Power Fowards: Usually a more stout, bruising player who can bang hard inside, but if you want them to be great, be able to shoot from 15 feet in. the more explosive the better. Main tasks are defensive and rebounding, but some great scorers have come out of this field. Greats: Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Charles Barkley (undersized great)  Centers are the the middle man, expected to protect the key on defense, have the offense run through you (inside out offense, drop step dunks, hook shots, etc.). The key to being a great NBA team has always been reliant on the big man. Look at any NBA champion (with the exception of the Chicago Bulls) and you will find an exceptional big man in the starting 5. Greats: Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, George Mikan|`|d7db591c7e6f45571c2db90c141be95baa	umm, there are only one set of positions...  what one plays on offense is what one plays on defense.  PG-Point Guard  SG-Shooting Guard  SF-Small Forward  PF-Power Forward  C-Center|`|m5aXJAtIaa	pg- rack up the assist hit the open shots and run the offense. defense play high post ad come away with alot of steals    sg- good finishers. some run the offense lik mj or dwayne wade or kobe but most ju get some assists and put up big numbers. defense play the high post contest the shots and stik with there man and come away with a steal.    sf- the more all around position. this one requires some height. 6'7 to 10 is normal. good handle shot and passing ability is all expected and needed. on defense come off with some blocks and a few steals.  good de follow there man and take the wing in a 2-3    pf- 6'10 and up is good for this spot. big man post up and and good strength are expected. good finishing ability foul shots not all the great. blockin is a need and gettin physical with drivers is important.    c- big man not really requirred to be mobile but strength and height is a necesity. no center should really be under 6'11. being able to flush it down is needed, and no shot is expected either. foul shots aint really important. on defence block alot of shots. own the paint on d. and a center never be in the high post.|`|ishPf2Glaa	PG-Point Guard  SG-Shooting Guard  SF-Small Forward  PF-Power Forward  C-Center     PG is primarily a passer. they control the first moves in each play, and bring the ball up the court.  SG is usually the second to touch the ball. This is mostly a shooter, but often times will pass the ball off as well. rarely a post player.  SF is usually in the corners. They are usually good three point shooters, and often times good at driving to the basket. Occasionally post players.  PF is most commonly a post player, rarely handles the ball, and usually either goes to the basket, or takes short jumpers. some PF's in the league are decent from around the freethrow line, but most cannot shot threes.  C is the big man, they are under the basket, usually pulling down boards, and playing trashball. Almost always post up players.    Defenses depend on the team. Alot of teams will switch between a man on man (one player guarding one other player all the time) and a Zone (playing in a specific area), so the positions arent about their names being in a certain spot, they are more about your skills.
qmFPG3k7aa	I have to agree with most of the other answers on here in that being in the dunk contest does not make the players great.  Most of the people in the dunk contests now are just young guys who get little playing time and want to make names for themselves.  I do think some of the better players should be in the dunk contest like back in the Jordan era.  Players like Dominique, Drexler, Kemp (in his prime), and Vince Carter were way more exciting to watch than some guys people have never even hear of.  I would love to see a dunk contest now with the players you mentioned as well as guys like Tracey McGrady or maybe Shawn Marion.|`|5d5b2dcdde07da94a6e5f2a73d65b998aa	A dunk contest determines nothing in terms of a players skill. John Stockton, Jerry West, & Isiah Thomas (and many others) were never even in the dunk contest and they're all better than LeBron, Kobe, Anthony and Wade. The dunk contest determines nothing.

Kobe needs to step up as well. If he is going to make such difinitive threats, he needs to hold by them when he doesnt get his way.

Kobe is going to be the next boy who cried wolf....    The lakers should just bench him, refuse a trade, and refuse playing time. Do this for half a season and see how his ego responds. If he learns that hes an employee, then great, he will step up his game, and make the team better, but if he does as everyone expects, and whines, get rid of him, The last thing you do when a toddler is crying, is give him what hes crying for, or else he will just do it again next time (Hint, Shaq, Hint)|`|AA11110880	Bryant needs to do what  he feel fit for himself. His team or G.M. broke that line of trust so why not? he's already said there's nothing L.A. can do to STOP him.|`|IQVztWNWaa	Absolutely, Kobe should get traded. He's not going anywhere with his career with the L.A laker's. Okay, he did score 81 points but did he win a championship? No he didn't. Kobe has an amazing talent, so it shouldn't be wasted. Kobe needs a team that would satisfy him and also a team that will help him succeed.    However, if Kobe does decide to stay with the laker's, which he is, then he should step up his game. Jordan had no one, so he stepped up and took the game into his own hands. Kobe is doing the right thing for being a team player but when he needs to win he needs to take control.
FQBOzv4Saa	no one hell just retract his statement|`|V7Rl6OKCaa	If they really wanted to trade Kobe they could have almost anyone they wanted outside of the Lebron James and Dirk Nowitzki types that are clearly the face of their franchise. They could try for Paul Pierce and the 5th pick from the Celtics, or Mcgrady with a throw in player.....|`|ishPf2Glaa	Thank god someone said this. Im glad to see that a Laker fan is not letting the whining take over. Congrats, your one of the few, the proud, the.... oh well..      I think they have a few reasonable trade offers:  McGrady  Gasol + young players and draft picks  Marbury/Curry/anyone else on the NY team (might be a good home for kobe in NY)  Ray Allen and a sign n trade for Lewis in seattle.    these are just a couple ideas that might be appealing to both teams.

Thanks Lebron!!!|`|0CnW95saaa	It's too bad, not a single hater wants to come to earth and admit it.    All excuses are gone.    The ONLY question now is:  "Who will be the NEXT LEBRON JAMES???"    I don't really mean that...I hate the comparisons.  I only throw that out there to really tick off the haters who hide behind them.    I did love what Pat Riley said about him last year: "He's totally unfair...that size...he may be one of the fastest players in the NBA...how do you stop that?  Are you SURE he's only 22?"|`|e6d0634214ebffbf2fc36e3338751793aa	Yes, he is a good athlete and will be a superstar  but without a good team around him he will never be a NBA Champion.
4BiHmXHZaa	To the punk azz 50 Cent who is riding Kobe's nuts. Who made it to the conference finals this year Kobe or LeBron? The Lakers have a better supporting cast than the Cavs but they still got knocked out in the first round. Kobe and the Lakers suck.|`|ishPf2Glaa	50 cent jocks kobes nuts.... its sad.    Bryant for sure.    Kobe had shaq to help him get all 3 rings, and hasnt made it back there since, shaq on the other hand has, proving he was more vital to that team then they ever knew.    Kobe shots 30+ freethrows against toronto, and shot a measly 40% from the field to get that 81. he also added 2 assists...... LOL!    Heres a couple ones for ya...    Whos got been charged with rape more? kobe or lebron?    whos "demanded" his way at the threat of him no longer playing for the team? kobe or lebron?    whos chased away more NBA legends? kobe or lebron?    whos ruined superstars careers? kobe or lebron?    whos NEVER scored 35+ and added 8 or more assists? kobe or lebron?    your right!!! KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE!!!!!|`|0a0247a1f9ee4f050410ee36ceb4c4a4aa	Lebron, because of his age and because he has a very unselfish nature, Kobe isnt a bad choice because of that killer instinct he has, lebron doesnt really have it yet, but he will and it will be sooner than later.

ishPf2Glaa	In many players contracts, they have a part where they are SET on the contract for so many years, lets say.... 3. They sometimes also have a choice (if both the player and team want) to continue for a set number of years after, with the same salary increase as if they stayed there the thru one contract.    It gives teams and players a little control over long contracts. Opting out, means you chose not to sign for the extension.|`|0CnW95saaa	The player who 'opts out' gives up the rest of his contract to become a free agent.    Not everyone can do this...it has to be negotiated into the contract in the first place.    One of the current rumors is Kevin Garnett opting out of his contract.  He cannot do it in this off season, but could give up the next two seasons (has to give back guaranteed money too) and become a free agent.     This is risky because a player gives up say $17 million dollars per year to sign somewhere else.  This doesn't mean that another team has enough salary cap room to sign that player to a deal near $17million.    However, the rumor is that once Bill Russell made fun of Kevin Garnett: "ooh...I'm in an elevator with the highest paid player ever!...who will never win anything because his salary is too big to have a team."    Kevin Garnett has complained about not having a good team, good coaches, people who play hard like him...etc.    He is a good candidate to 'opt out' simply because his contract is too big...if he wants to win a title, he'll have to drop a zero and go to a team he can win with for less money than he's making now.    Imagine being a player like KG who's on a team that doesn't even have a surrounding team as good as the Cavaliers.  Where's he going any time soon?  Nowhere.    He NEEDS to opt out.    Unfortunately, most contracts have a clause in them that sets a time-table for when you can opt out.  KG can't until NEXT offseason.|`|DsJldBeZaa	To opt out means to stop short.  so to opt out of a contract?  i belive it means to stop your contract of like playing on a team for 4 years before the 4 years is up.  I believe you would have to have permission from the coach of the team then too.   Anyhow, hope i helped!
0pyisSWTaa	i am a die hard laker fan, and a Kobe Bryant enthusiast... aside from being a laker fan, i am an nba fan, and whether Kobe stays with LA or not, I can respect his game, accomplishments, and determination to win...  i've always cheered for Laker players who have contributed to our city winning championships... i've never booed a Laker player or had any ill will for players who have been traded to other teams outside of their control, though i have booed players (Karl Malone, Gary Payton) for trying to become Lakers to get a ring and retire...     Kobe's situation is slightly different... he has vocalized his opinions about upper management and demanded a trade because he felt the organization wasn't doing a reasonable job making the team legit contenders, and the thing is Laker fans see this as well... i don't  agree with the way he handled the situation, but the frustration is very understandable...     will i cheer him when he comes to staple center to play against us, during the announcement of the starting lineups, yes... but after the tip-off he's "the enemy", and its fair game... but i'd still consider myself a fan...|`|AA10448927	If he leaves the Lakers he will be out of the limelight. He will still be the most exciting player on the planet, but will receive less press. Kind of like Kevin Garnett of the T-wolves is not in the papers and all over TV everytime you look. It follows the rule of out of sight out of mind. Lovers and haters alike will stop caring so much when it isn't in your face all the time. I personally don't think Kobe could handle it, and for this reason he will not leave the Lakers.|`|501379fb8533b51b748f053f2efb7d58aa	I am a hater and will always be a hater no matter where he plays. My father taught me if you ruin your name your life is over you will never have as easy of a life again. I guess no one ever told Kobe that and now he is learning it the hard way. He is a talented player but his other bad actions overshadow that. He must think his scoring 100 points a game will make up for his bad behavior but it only makes him look more selfish, arrogant and self absorbed. Bringing attention back to himself with saying he wants to be traded no wait he doesn't tells me he has not learned that people do not like people that think the world revolves around them.|`|AA11224700	I'm not a Kobe fan because of how plays and acts.. someone with his ability should find 4 guys off the street and make the playoffs. He must be one of the few players in history that actually makes his teammates bad players.........|`|GdvzZRFMaa	I am a Laker and Kobe fan.I will not jump on the band wagon with the haters if he leaves. I will be disappointed for the team naturally. I do understand where he is coming from though and his frustration. Buss promised him a team that could compete and hasn't followed through, then team injuries on top of that. Kobe is in his prime and needs to do something if he is going to win another championship. However, if anyone would have followed this story through Kobe had said after the interview on radio that after talking to management he was not leaving.|`|iREDESO4aa	I think the Kobe haters will dislike him wherever he goes, regardless of whether he stays with the Lakers or not.  He's shown he can't carry a team by himself (even though being surrounded by Smush Parker, Luke Walton, Lamar Odom, Kwame Brown, and Andrew Bynum didn't help him much).    Bottom line is he brought all of the hatred on himself through his words and actions, and I have zero sympathy for him.|`|c7c83d576329d3814b9758f562e6a16baa	Well you gotta give the man props for his awesome ability to play the game. As a player I like him but as a person I think he is a worthless piece of ****|`|P9Jz9wivaa	NO... 4get the lakers... my loyalty is to the lakers up to a certain extent.  When they recognized talent and brought in the top noch players that was when I was loyal but when they just REFUSE to bring in talent its hard to stay behind them.... THEY WASTED 3 years of PRIME KOBE TALENT... WASTED.... just wasted. They could have brought in Boozer, Artest, Baron Davis, J kidd but NO... they didnt do SQUAT.. coz they want to stay with in Salary CAP.....  while other teams out there just want to win.... u would think will all the $$ the lakers make and have made inthe past they wouldnt be this FROOGLE and get some real talent to help out KOBE... before he is fed up and he leaves...  If the lakers dont do anything I think he should LEAVE..a nd i wont be mad at him for it.... I dont care if Garnett, Paul Piernce are not voicing thier opinions coz they want to be "loyal" to thier teams... MAN WATEVR... its all about winning coz all the owners care about his publicity for thier team and make more money.  after they get a certain age and thier contracts expire ... they will just trade thier players... so if KObe has a chance to win elsewhere, since he is used to being in the spotlight and winning.. he should go elsewhere. JUST GO!|`|CmCKs7qFaa	Well iwon't hate if he dosen't join up with Cleveland well because i already hate Lebron James and I don't need to hate anybody more on that  team cuz I already hate the entire franchise and organization as wel as Lebron and it depends is he does leave L.A. and joins my Pistons or Mavericks or Timberwolves then no I won't hate him but if he goes to a team with 2 or more superstars on that team then yes I hate to admit it but I would hate 1 of my favorite players iwould be a shame to see Kobe go to another team other than my favorite teams that I already mentioned because these teams could use a player like Kobe who shoots the ball well and gets the GW FGs 60% of the time, he would be a nice addtion to the Pistons or Mavericks or Timberwolves|`|Tv8zsHVtaa	It dose'nt matter he's not going anywhere. As far as my opinion goes on Kobe is I love to watch him play but i dont like him as a teammate. Even if he did go somewhere i think his role on the lakers would stck with him-he needs the ball all the time. What the Lakers need is Kevin Garnett. By the way King James is the sh*t and he single handedly shut down the pistons. Go  Cavs.|`|Wc0Mi0ZMaa	im speaking to myself when i say this. i hate haters, but i hate kobe. i mean his swagger, his game, his confidence. I would call him an all around player, but hes no Magic, Jordan, Lebron, Robertson. I can guarantee you kobe is leaving LA, and if he doesn't the Lakers will be worse off. Kobe is a heck of a player. but the only time i think no one hated him was when Shaq was on the team.(my opinion) idk Kobe is Kobe. the Lakers are a team that would be better off without him. maybe trade him for a first round pick, and get Greg Oden or Durant lololol.|`|y4V4zVNtaa	I respect your believes...............    Ya i hate Kobe because he plays for the Lakers and being a true sixer fan you have to hate the Lakers.       I was the biggest Fan of Iverson but now that he aint on my team i hope the sixers destroy him.   I mean i wish him well and everything but when the Nuggets play Sixers its on like Donkey Kong.|`|ishPf2Glaa	I am considered a hater by many on here, but truely am somewhere in between. I do not hate the man. I have alot of respect for a couple small parts of his game. Unfortunately, i have lost alot of respect for his game because of his antics off the court, and with his teammates and organization.     I also am quite tired of all of the kobe Fanatics! seeing these "Is kobe the best player EVER?" questions makes me want to puke more than anything... these kids should stop playing pokemon and really see how "just-above-mediocre" he is.....45%> means hes NOT the greatest scorer, it means he takes the most shots to get there....      Kobe is an amazing freethrow shooter, and great at getting to the line. He is also a good clutch shooter (Although that has done nothing but disappear more and more over the last 2 years...)        I have no respect for the man as a human being or a professional. Forget the rape allegations, thats just fuel for the fire. Im talking about the rest of his bullcrap....   When a baby cries for a cookie, and you give it to him, the baby will keep doing the same thing until you stop him.... Kobe has cried and been given his cookie time and time again, and hes done it at the expense of the Laker organization, his teammates, and his coach, all looking rediculously pathetic.    Its time for LA to make a point..... Kobe should be moved on.

This brought a lot of the WCW philosophy into the WWE scheme. Prior to that WWE was mostly big guys hitting each other, while WCW made an effort to give their matches a more realistic 'wrestling' feel, with quite a few talented members wearing college-style wrestling togs to enhance the affect.    I suspect as the memory of WCW fades, Vince will return to his roots (something a lot of older people do) and wrestling will continue to devolve into big guys hitting each other.    Sad to say.    Unless (hope, hope) TNA gets a big enough chunk of the market to wake WWE back up to the fact that fans like variety, talent, and unexpected twists.     Face it, if they had any clue, they would realize Benoit's in-ring charisma more then makes up for his weak mic work, and they would treat him as something other then a second (or third) tier talent. His match tonight against Edge showed us (yet again) that he is amazing in the ring, and his intensity jumps out of the TV screen in a way that far surpasses anything Cena (the cheap-pop champ these days, with Mick Foley gone) ever said on the mic.    (Though I must admit, it stretched even my ability to suspend disbelief when they scripted Edge kicking out after three amigo's, followed by three German suplexes, followed by the head butt. It's okay that they needed Edge to win, but they should have simply not had that series of successful moves, then let him kick out. It gives him an almost super-human aura that plays against his current persona of an 'opportunist' who wins thru guile.)    Anyway, as Stephanie Levesque gets more and more power in the WWE, I really expect nothing but the worst for the company. She's already firing people willy nilly, and she drove Heymann out of the WWE to sooth her own ego, without thinking of the best interests of wrestling as a whole.    (Rumor has it they may have to bring him back. It would crack me up to see it, but I almost hope Heymann says no, and let's them rot in their own stagnant pool of mediocrity.)    If the collapse of WWE would bring about a new 'golden age', with regional leagues, maybe it would be for the best, but with TV making the world smaller every day, it seems unlikely to happen.|`|AA12227416	no , it is impossible.|`|jVXnHJs2aa	I think WWE should quit giving them belts.Give the little guy some runs.Heck the WWE champ doesn't have to be a roid overdosing guy,why not Val Venis.OR build up someone with talent who isn't constantly shooting needles in his ***.

AA10205299	I think that because of the team it has, Brazil is one of the strongest candidates to win the world cup. However, the Czech Republic showed to be very strong and firm (even though they defeated the US... I am so disappointed) as well as Spain was the bomb today.  I don't think that Mexico will win. Reason being, they show strength when they play against Central American countries, but when they face a strong team, bye bye.

AA11584298	They are a complete turnoff. They look so fake, and women who have them are doing nothing more than saying, "look at me".|`|45ca2691c4b93566ba16fcd8266f91d6aa	This is a question raised by tons of people. In my opinion, I think it is ok to get breast implants under certain conditions. If your  irregularly large or boy-small. But if your totally normal, then you should think twice, but I still think its ok. Whatever makes you more confident. Now if your too large, everybody knows they are not as....perky, hehe. So to avoid the whole sag thing, yes implants are good, and vice versa for smaller women. So I say, if your healthy, not plastic surgery obsessed, and you would feel better with larger breasts, go for it. I dont see any problem with it.   P.S: And the whole thing about danger and stuff well, you have a larger chance of getting hit by a car on your way there than getting a surgery related prob if you go to a reputable surgeon.|`|e4f091b98e7d351f7eba9877995e0bf3aa	I would not want a girl to get them .

jEJxcWq5aa	If your looking to get into competition's with (as in getting sponsored, & having a full-blown team)  your going to want to get something a bit more durable.  Echo 1 is a good company, but they are a Chinese Clone company.  Their OEM's are JG, & *SOME* AGM, with upgraded internals (hence the price hike)    If your looking to get serious into airsoft, your going to want to go with something like, ICS, G&G, Deep Fire, STAR, Systema or TM    If your not open to suggestions though... & arent open to owning more than one gun, I would go with the M4 TC.  It's going to provide a respectable accuracy, but be short enough, to be *usable* for CQB.|`|BpY2ed0Gaa	The M4 (as much as I hate to say it) is the better choice of those two. It's shorter length overall makes it much more versatile for playing in  different areas.|`|Da3Rvlfoaa	Depends on where you will be competing:    Inside/CQC/close range====the M4; it is short and maneuverable    The M-16 will perform the same, but be a bit more unwieldy in confined spaces; however, it will have better accuracy at long range due to the longer barrel

vea6mqPZaa	Solvent and elbow grease.    I use Hopps  9 and a old Oral B sonic complete tooth brush.    if you really want to remove all of it you might try navel jelly, however it may mar the finish and it WILL remove any bluing that the firearm has, yes I know your's is SS, i don't wany anybody bit ching about the loss of bluing when they put it on a firearm.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	The best thing I've found is a Birchwood Casey Lead Remover and Polishing Cloth.  It gets all the carbon and burn rings off of my own stainless revolver.  Another good thing to do occasionally is to take a brass brush and give the cylinder face a good brushing.  This is especially important if you're using unjacketed bullets.|`|mwT1Ik5Jaa	Hoppes  9 solvent and a brass brush with clean it quite well.|`|AA11570394	Revolvers get a ring around each cylinder chamber and there is no way to prevent his. You can as suggested use a solvent and brass brush to remove lead and powder fouling but it will still have a slight ring. This is how revolvers are and have been. The escaping gas pressure at the face of the cylinder makes it impossible to keep it looking like it did new.  Its just something wheel gun owners get used to. And its why we dont like shooting lots of soft lead bullets in them, because then you have to spend lots of time scrubbing off the lead residue. Copper jacketed bullets are much cleaner in wheel guns.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Do the best you can.  The left over residue just adds character.   Hoppe's makes a really good 'gun scrubber' in a spray can that seems to clean anything I've put in front of it.
dkTAZmKSaa	okay, well be very confident. you have your tumbling which is good. make sure your motions are tight. and always have a smile on your face. look at one judge and just keep your eyes there. make silly faces like weird smiles and kiss faces. practice your dance moves too. and practice your face and motions in the mirror. also you need a really good tow touch. its the biggest part of cheer. make it high and perfect good luck and have fun.|`|UHqbg8jaaa	alright your tumbling is good..make sure you're flexible too.    cheerleading takes up strenth, endurance and skill. you need to have sharp moves and motions and you have to be a good dancer
4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I don't know about that but i think that when the legacy interferes in the match Kane will save his brother and they will take all of them out. What a great match next week is going to be because they had one of the biggest rivalries together. You also might be right because to me it seems like wwe is using kane as a heel but why would kane betray his brother again?|`|K7JfRjzMaa	Why would Kane betray Undertaker? He did Steph a favor; she did him a favor by putting him in the Elimination Chamber. I know WWE's boring, but you're looking too hard for surprises.|`|mVH5LqMuaa	the only way i can see that is at wm ...kane dose what mat did to jeff and costs taker his streek and the title ...highly unlikely though...its what u call brotherly love|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	He's the one that arranged Undertaker to come to RAW next week|`|1JsbnDh2aa	I'm going to raw next week in Oakland. I was wishing taker would be there, and coincidentally he WILL be. Im so excited i almost had a heart attack. Legacy WILL probably interfere and kane and taker will fight them off|`|4OCcsDeTaa	im pulling for shawn michaels to do something but it prob wont happen|`|KIOR56r6aa	Not right now|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It'll be good to see Taker back on Raw, since its been a while since hes been there. I honestly dont see Kane and Taker interacting at all in the ring, and only doing possibly a backstage segment.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Don't you think he's always annoyed at something? He was "annoyed at Orton when he one nighted Kelly Kelly, he was "annoyed" at Kofi Kingston when Kofi beat him for the chamber spot. But why would Kane be annoyed, I would gladly have my older brother beat someone up to get me a title spot and a chance to destroy 5 other guys.
ZGUkizjYaa	He lost Kellogg, but my cousin who worked in kellogg's marketing department said that they are a very conservative company.    Sure he will lose sponsorships, but that is part of being a celebrity.  Being a role model and being 23 with no real college experience is really hard.  He hasn't had the opportunity to really grow up yet, as evidenced by the one party I saw him at while he was a Michigan student.    He will be successful in his next swim meets, and sponsors will come back, realizing that this was a mistake.  he will be famous again, wether or not he participates in the next olympics|`|PDJ8cy68aa	Today's society for some reason doesn't care that he smoked pot. This is why nothing is going to happen to him...as a role model, i think that he needs to be reprimanded in some way.  Parents are going to have a real rough time teaching their children that smoking pot is bad when an Olympian is able to do it without getting into trouble. He probably won't even lose any endorsements.|`|CEENX0sDaa	hes done|`|rZV2cUhdaa	he'll be fine. no one gives a shittt that much. its not like the world is coming to an end because he smoke some weed.|`|ebKlXUEtaa	Nothing is going to happen.  Smoking pot is a misdemeanor like a traffic ticket or drinking/smoking underage.  It will not affect his performance unless he is an habitual user (which I sincerely doubt).  He probably will not be as good as in Beijing (that was an almost impossible feat) but the pot will have little or nothing to do with it.  Whether or not he will lose sponsors is debateable.  If they play it as a 23 year old that made a mistake let's stay with him, many people may actually respect the sponsors more. Im one of those people.  He doesn't have a dynamic personality out of the pool so this actually makes him more interesting to me.|`|AA10344136	The answer really depends on Phelps' career and PR damage control efforts--and he thought earning those 8 gold medals was tough.     Between Phelps' genuine regret / remorse for his mistake and compassionate acceptance of his apologies from the Finnish government and several Olympic sport administrators--I think the damage to Phelps' endorsement earnings will be minimal. Phelps will still stand on as a very wealthy young multimillionaire.    Yes, I agree Phelps' mistake was recklessly serious and I can understand his concerns of losing million$ from endorsement deals--but the guy also IS equally concerned with how his FANS see him; this, in my book, makes Phelps a class act.    We have yet to see that from all the mega-millionaire sports "superstars", who commit crimes that wind them up in jail or prison; these guys carry on afterward yet to show an ounce of sincere regret for their mistakes. In fact, a few are brazenly proud of their crimes and illegal activities. All that fame and $$$$---and they're still as stupid now as they were as teenagers--with NO apologies from them.    Aside from his Olympic fame and fortune earned, young people are no different than Phelps--all prone to make epic mistakes.  I think Phelps' WILL learn from his---and maybe this politically correct society needs to exercise some compassionate forgiveness for a change---and let Michael Phelps move on and learn from his mistake.|`|3pNr5uQxaa	He'll be fine, hes going to wipe up at every race he goes too until he passes his prime.  and then he will go on to coach.  He will lose some endorsements in the short term, but nothing he cant handle.|`|zo42wgInaa	nothing at the most he gets fined for a misdemeanor and he continues to swim and keep his major sponsors, he is young person who is going to make mistakes he is not perfect.
3teWTOPqaa	Absolutely, most people underestimate Nelson's importance to the Magic, he is their PG so he runs the offense, he is their go-to player this season in the 4th quarter, and he is the only Magic player that are capable of getting into the paint and find open guys or finish.    But like YS said GO LAKERS!!!!!!!!!! WHOAAA!!!! But still very pissed off about Andrew!    EDIT: a dislocation does not take as long as a tear or brokerage of the bone, I think he can come back after 4, maybe 8 weeks maximum.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yeah...yeah...that sucks!!!    But can we focus on the Lakers right now??  It is all about the Lakers!!!  LAKERS!     Say it with me....L-A-K-E-R-S!!!|`|98wFqBwSaa	Yes, but they have do have Shard Lewis, Turkeyglue, and a few other cats that can pick up the slack.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Wow, I didn't see that yet. What a bummer for the Magic. He could be back in a month, it all depends on how severe the dislocation is. I don't think the Magic have what it takes to get past the Cavs or Cletics anyway.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I think so. Hopefully it is, so the Cavs can maintain a lead over the Magic.      As for injury season, I'm going to say yes. I've never seen a basketball season with this many injuries.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Well, maybe Jamal Tinsley, if ready and in game shape, just saw his oppertunity unravel to get back in the game.    He is still a very talented PG that could help the Orlando Magic club.    It's a big blow...but they stilll have D12 and will not even come close to dropping out of the top 5 in the East.|`|KezaxDNnaa	I bet you are happy as hell right now. You are so fake!|`|NzS7yD32aa	ok this must be injury season    Celtics-Kg  Lakers-Bynum  Cavs-West and Big Z  Now orlando-Nelson    Now that gives other teams an opportunity to catch up|`|Y3PKA2Wvaa	the lakers will not win the championship this season, specially without bynum.
AA12339318	A team's fan base is what drives policy decisions, on both, professional and college teams.    If an NBA team owner felt that a winning female coach could successfully lead his franchise to a title, AND if the owner felt the fans who buy tickets and watch the teams on television would accept that coach, that owner would seriously consider it.    But, if the owner did not have the confidence that fans would show up of a female coach's games, then there would be no way.    It is a RARE owner who is willing to take that kind of risk.  Back in the fifties, Branch Ricky took a MAJOR risk by hiring the first black player in professional, major league baseball.  It took 100 years of professional baseball before this happened.  Jackie Robinson proved Ricky's decision to be the right one.  It's only in recent years that we've begun seeing black coaches in the NFL.     I expect that in time, we WILL see a female coach on an NBA bench, and even a female manager in a baseball dugout.  What we MAY see first is female coaches on college level teams.  When THEY demonstrate the ability to lead a male dominated team, then the pros may recognize the potential.    In San Jose, before the advent of the WNBA, we had a women's professional Basketball team that often outdrew some NBA games.  It was the San Jose Lasers.  This franchise had a HUGE fan base of women and girls, besides the men who bought tickets.  The leage failed, because of lack of overall interest, but, you wouldn't be able to tell by seeing the attendance at Lasers games.    Give it time.  Keep voicing your opinion.  But tickets and let the owners know.  It'll happen.
6E16tR6xaa	I thought for maybe a second he would come out a do it with him. But once he did it with Vickie I think it was a little symbolisim showing that Edge has gone on to bigger things. Or maybe it just is a hint. Well find out soon enough.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	I was hoping that he'd come back and beat him up and say "Man Edge dating Vickie,aye? You really must thin genital warts rule.."|`|smH3BfLBaa	No, Reso is not returning. He was released from TNA last month. and if Reso is returning no one knows. WWE would of said so. They always do. It is never a "surprise return". I do not think it is a "hint" and I do know of the 5 second pose. But Copeland is a self centered, fame wanting, demanding, controlling, ignorant, lying, cheating, selfish...ok lets just say I don't get along with him and I do not like him|`|vaVkveEkaa	I was so excited I called my cousin downstairs from a "vital" conversation with his girlfriend. Although it sadly resulted in Edge and FatFace making out AGAIN (ugh), we were both pumped up for the E&C reunion.

4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I think he tapped out to the ankle lock from Kurt angle sometime in 2005. That was the last time i have seen him tap.

RyZHhI6aaa	If the horse had an injury and that was the reason for the layoff, the horse might not be back up to form.  The workout times might suggest that the best race the horse can win is a claimer.    I don't think anyone would put a horse in a claimer if they thought it could do anything better... they wouldn't want to take a chance that a really good horse could get claimed and taken out of their barn.      Small drops in class aren't too surprising... the trainer might want the horse to gain a little confidence against easier horses before racing against tougher company.  But I'd be wary of a horse taking a huge drop in class.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	try to find a level he can win and keep in good company and form|`|8bTder08aa	Two thoughts:    Someone is trying to get rid of the horse;    Someone is trying to win a purse/bet and is hoping nobody will take a chance and claim the horse.

8DIkez2uaa	No, it's just ending now so that HBK can face Undertaker at Wrestlemania.HBK still has at least two years left, hopefully he won't retire until WM 30 at least.    As far as JBL, I think he has plenty years left, he just needs to put a shirt on that's all, and hopefully his back stays healthy (HBK's has so far, so I think his should too). Plus, WWE is desperate for good heels right now, and he's one of them.    I'd love to see HBK around long after he retires as an announcer, GM, or commisoner. And JBL, as soon as he retires, I hope he becomes an announcer again, because I believe that announcing is his true talent.|`|Ll4pDJLLaa	Don't worry, it is just the end of a storyline. I don't see HBK retiring this year he has a couple of years left same for Undertaker. I wouldn't mind if JBL retired, he should go back to becoming a commentator
9lDqqQ8Iaa	As an Orioles fan who has watched him over the last few years, I can tell you that he is a good clubhouse leader and can give you some pop in certain situations. Unfortunately, we were forced to use him more that we would have liked, and he is not an everyday quality player, as evidenced by his .238 average. It would have been nice to have him as a backup, but he doesn't fit into the plan. The Orioles won't contend this year, but we are coming back when the young pitching starts coming up. By 2011, they will be a winner, and their exciting young talent, including ROY candidate Matt Wieters, will make them fun to watch this year.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	I think he may be although he is getting up there in age.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	He's be great|`|yk4S7uuraa	The Mets need someone with balls to go out and fire up the rest of the squad, and since David Wright and Jose Reyes don't have them yet, yes, Kevin Millar won't be a fit in that clubhouse.|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	I always liked Kevin Millar.If he gets into the mets lineup with the type of hitters they have he will get alot of good pitches to hit and you know how good of a fastball hitter he is.
Cl6KbcAGaa	I think you overpaid for it! It is one of many and I would not have paid more than $300 for this bike....doesnt really matter if it has 09' or 10 parts on it, you do not have the only one that was made. Sorry to burst your bubble but it is not a collectible bike!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Ed is right $600 is way more then it's worth.  You can get a new bike for $300.|`|O6wwDtrmaa	Specialized bikes are worth quite a lot due to their high quality and their name. These guys above are right in the fact that you could buy a bike for $600 but you couldn't buy a specialized fully built bike for $300. The cheapest specialised bike is $400 so I think you did well getting all the parts for $600 and you might be able to sell it for this price or even more but i recommend you use it.|`|DFug1qB2aa	well i kno for a fact that the parts alone are worth atleast 300 if there all 09 but the specialized frame is **** no offence its a good starting frame but u can buy a whole new specialized 09 complete bike for 300 dollars lol

In the real world, we call your bike a "Frankenstein" which means it is built up of all sorts of mismatched parts. This might be cool for you since you built it to make it work for you, but it isn't going to be worth much to anyone else.    Since there doesn't seem to be anything that I can identify the bike as a particular brand, the value has to be determined only by the sum of it's parts. I put all of the parts into my calculator, and based only on the parts and current condition it is worth $73.00 or less if you were to sell it to a shop that buys used bikes, or $150.00 or less if you sold it on your own to a buyer, or $185 if you were to buy it used from a bike shop.

m3KM6Xnvaa	Getting sponsored is not easy, especially in today's economy.     That said, you need to have phenominal driving skills that get you noticed. But, in addition to that, you need to have marketability. Whether it is a look like Kasey Kahne, or a personality like Elliott Sadler or Michael Waltrip, you need something that sponsors can latch on to.

x6OsAvQeaa	The San Jose Sharks. They have the best balance of offense and defense in the NHL. They also have great size, which is very important come playoff time. Another factor to consider is first place overall. If the Sharks finish first overall, that will allow them to have home ice advantage throughout the playoffs, a huge advantage given the Sharks great home record. I cant see the Red Wings beating the Sharks in a potential 7 game series with both teams playing the first two games in San Jose. Theres no way the Red Wings, with thin size up front on offense, could get the ball rolling under those conditions. The only team that could pose a threat to the Sharks come playoff time is the Boston Bruins, a mirror image of the Sharks themselves. The Bruins have great everything, starting in goal with Tim Thomas. They dont have nearly as much size as the Sharks but they have great speed to compensate for that. The Sharks can wear an opponent down no only with size but also with great balance. Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau are great centers but another guy, Joe Pavelski, is emerging as a fine third line center for San Jose. Wingers like Jonathan Cheechoo, Devin Setoguchi, Ryane Clowe and Milan Michalek are good, hard nosed guys that blend in well. Defensemen Dan Boyle and Rob Blake have been nice additions to the team this season. Joining them on defense are guys like Douglas Murray, Marc-Edouard Vlasic and Christian Ehrhoff, giving the Sharks the size and mobility to get the job done. One last thing to consider is Todd McLellan, the Sharks coach. He was with the Red Wings last year when they won the Stanley Cup. He knows their flaws and weaknesses, a great advantage for any coach trying to beat the defending Stanley Cup champions.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	I never, ever count the Detroit Red Wings out.  They are in a mini slump and have some injuries but come play off time they will have it together.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I would like it to be the Canadiens personally, but the Sharks have a good chance|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I think the Montreal Canadiens are a team of destiny this year, their 100th anniversary.    To Boston fans, it might not look that way right now (the Bruins have beaten the Canadiens 4 times in 5 games this season), but all Montreal has to do is get in the playoffs for the "team of destiny" label to kick into gear, and if the Canadiens are on a hot streak in April, nothing will be able to stop them from hoisting Lord Stanley's Cup.|`|BhXMno7faa	I think that Boston will win the Stanley Cup this year because they have Chara, Thomas, and that new goalie that played for Boston on January 31 09|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	The Pens will require a good late push to even make the playoffs, I don't like their chances.    I think the Red Wings, despite being only 3rd in the conference, still have the best shot at the cup. They have the most depth, and the most experience.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	I think the Bruins will beat the Sharks in 7 games!|`|jLPjuVMGaa	Boston cause first, san Jose ain't got such a door slanner goilie and second of all. the players have experience, and third of all, Boston got Lucic and Tim so that makes a huge differ|`|oJsrGmmPaa	Whoever the psychic one is to place a bet in Vegas, but has to share with the dead horse you keep on beating.

You must live in Pittsburgh or something to want them to win. The Red Wings is the team to watch for. They have the same great team as last year and look where that got them. The Wings CAN beat the Shark's in 7 games even if the first two are at San Jose. Wings are going all the way as always. REPEAT!!|`|Fh0shlVLaa	New Jersey Devils.

9Kt7p7Vfaa	That's sh*tty but fixable. You can pick up some epoxy from the hardware store that will work. You'll also need a small piece of plastic and either some heavy duty tape that has a little stretch to it or a clamp. You'll wan to clean the gash out with some thinner or acetone, be careful not to get to much on the top sheet, some plastics don't like those chemicals. Mic the epoxy up and spread it in the gash. Use the plastic ( a square slightly larger than the gash) to catch any excess epoxy that oozes out. You may also want to run a piece of tape along the base and edge to keep the epoxy off the base. For the small piece of plastic, a heavy ziploc bag should work, it needs to be a type of plastic the epoxy wont adhere to. once the epoxy and plastic are in place, either put the clamp on or the tape. if you use the tape method, you'll want a fairly long piece. Electrical tape will work good, start a few inches from the gash and stretch the tape over the gash and onto the base, you may want a few pieces. You may want to test the adhesion of the tape to your base before you begin, not much sticks to that particular plastic very well.. If this was confusing, you can always take it to a shop.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	As far as I can tell that's the top of your board right? That should not really cause you any problems since normally you don't ride with the top on the board down( if you do please tape it cuz I would love to see that). Since that's the case you might be able to just epoxy it down.(mind I am not an expert on snowboard repairs but you should be alright). If it is the bottom I honestly dont know what to say you may be able to epoxy that also but I can not give you a 100% accurate answer. I dont think that this will cause you any riding problems to know for sure you should try to epoxy it down and ride with it. My first board gotten beaten up worse then that and I never had a problem. Park boards are ment to get beaten up.|`|mperjS8caa	it will not effect your riding, but it will peel off gradually and the hole will get larger.    i'd recommend to super glue it down (make sure its waterproof glue)  and then leave it there with a large book or something over it so it has time to dry and stick the piece of the board back on|`|ucot94w3aa	IT'S AN EASY, EASY FIX.    Go to Home Depot, Lowes, or search online for stuff called J-B Weld, J-B Kwik, or J-B Weld Marineweld.  The Marineweld is best if you can find it, but all will work great.  It's a 2-part "weld-style" bonding agent.  All you do is squeeze out equal amounts from each tube and mix it together.  Then lift up the chip and spread the stuff underneath.  Get a clamp (preferrably a C-clamp), clamp the chip down tight, and wipe off the excess that oozes out.  Just don't clamp it down too tight so that it would damage the board (or just put something softer like a piece of cardboard between the board and clamp).  Let it sit and dry for at least 8 hours while clamped.    The chip will NEVER come up.  This is the absolute best fix for your board.  Trust me.  I've done lots of repairs like this.  The chip is just cosmetic and won't affect your board at all.  You do want to fix it properly though so it does not start to delaminate your topsheet.

3teWTOPqaa	CP3 was hurt too? Damn what the hell is going on these days. I think Allen/Williams with replace Nelson, and D-Will will replace CP3 if he can't play or maybe they use just let Melo in.    Anyways, great great night for Kobe.    EDIT: D-Will too? WTF, why is this happening to the Western conference. God Paul Pierce is such a good luck charm for the East.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Deron Williams got injured tonight too, hes day to day, nothing serious though.     What happened to Chris?|`|eTUEAWO9aa	idk, in the east i hope mo williams, and in the west i hope steve nash or deron williams|`|jDi45m0uaa	wow 3 allstar guards got injured? what happends if Nash and the rest get's injured?      Let's hope CP3 injury isn't serious, he was doing so great for the hornets.|`|4yiH5TiQaa	Deron Williams will replace Paul, Deron Williams is not hurt! He just sat out today just  ONE GAME!|`|0h52QcPbaa	i guess on the east it should be vince carter or ray allen    on the west it should be anthony or tmac|`|21J0IIZbaa	Paul : D. Williams  Nelson : M. Williams
eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	I respect Ray Allen as well he is a great player and doesn't cause fights or any foul comments or anything really "bad". One of my favorite players in the game.|`|UDDNoGkBaa	i dislike everyone on the celtics xcept for rondo hes a baller|`|dDhTMacAaa	Yea, people that still think Paul Pierce faked that injury|`|M630P51Yaa	i sorta hate the celtics im a laker fan but the only person i respect on the celtics is ray allen.|`|w3Q9XSvsaa	I DO.  GO LAKERS.  Screw the bought Celtics and Kevin McHale for making the KG deal.    The Lakers are great because of the draft and their scouts.  The Celtics are only good because they went on a Yankee spending spree and McHale gave away KG.|`|9F6zgX8waa	Im a big celtics fan and the celtics are the best. laker fanboys may hate them but they respect the hell out of em. and to the guy who said he hopes they die. cmon man thats really low to say that about someone that you hope they die thats really disrepectfull|`|JD5NQxeNaa	I respect the Big 3 and Cassell all individually. But, I hate the team in its entirety.|`|WZvny7mMaa	I don't hate the Celtics. I just dislike them. I don't really believe in hating other teams or players. What I do hate though is the ignorant fans of teams or players. The ones who are completely biased and don't give other teams credit for what they do. Tarzan and Celtics own the Lakers are pure examples of ignorant biased fans that I can't stand.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Laker Fan Boys sure can|`|oGBEl25jaa	me.    i cant stand any of them.    especially paul and garnett.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Yes. I rooted for them last year in Finals but KG really made a fool of himself. I can't respect that. Paul Pierce too. Ray Ray just plays for the wrong squad, guilty by association.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	I can try|`|67EaIAvbaa	I HOPE THE CELTICS ALL DIE IN A PLANE CRASH!!
VJ1Gsr0Xaa	that would be a nice dream.       gasol  bosh  ariza  kobe  fish    pretty cool, but, wont happen.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	YS- It was told on ESPN today that Chris Bosh does want out of the Raptors|`|HcLQD1Hbaa	I dont know, we have post players and its a toss up really. hes great but i dont see the lakers needing him|`|R0hTlupBaa	Dude, love the idea, but this will never happen, Bosh is much to good and when Bynum comes back there will be no room next year sorry, I wish as well.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	No come on that's our centerpiece after what transpired tonight you should let us have him.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Where do these ideas come from??    The Raptors will never give up CB4....especially for that garbage of a trade...|`|98wFqBwSaa	No.  CB4 values his legs.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	NO, no reason to.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up jj18,    If Chris Bosh was available Conagelo and the Raptors could get more than Lamar, Walton and a 2nd rounder.  As a Laker fan i'd love to have Bosh on the Lakers- but if you were the Raptors why would you accept that deal???    Nickster|`|apY85Qmtaa	I think people are forgetting that both teams have to agree on a trade for it to happen.
IMu3wBu8aa	I am!!!  This wait is killing me!!!! He needs to return NOW!!! :)|`|GRoOEkNeaa	Yes I am. (:    I cait wait, I hope it's soon!|`|NZKramllaa	Yes, All day...Every day.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Yes I am|`|FY8YYZgBaa	I am!

The tricks are fun to watch, but you can't do that stuff in a real game.|`|MPz9APZDaa	Espectro said it all. Give him the points.
X8NGHSP8aa	I agree with mebo, they don't have many free agents. If they can get help on their offensive line (getting their two tackles back from injury, the draft or free agency) I think they will be competitive again next year. Winning back to back SB isn't easy. Your reference to the terrible season after SB XX is a little misleading. That was the year of Roethlisberger's accident which affected his play all season. Time will tell, but there are a lot of good teams in the AFC.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	They have a good chance to make the playoffs.  What happens then is anyones guess.|`|osI8T5rMaa	They will make it to the playoffs next year.|`|oDuKD9t5aa	They will make it to the playoffs, but because they play in a crappy division.|`|gfFTQ9zlaa	No I don't think so.  AFC got too many good teams (NE. TENN. SD. BALT.& IND.)  Also nobody think Miami will win their division so it very difficult repeat or even get into play-off,  if the Steeler want to get back the SB.  They have to make sure to win the division because it only have 2 wild-card teams. Watch out for IND. and NE. for the AFC.|`|qsK7YNhDaa	no they have a better team and ben is heathly|`|k5jDEpxWaa	well with the salary cap and parity with the league  the teams that get up to the superbowl are different year by year  the steelers certainly have a shot but many other teams have an equal shot at it too (eg. Cardinals)    i think its a safe bet that the steelers will make the playoffs again barring major injuries but watch out for under the radar teams|`|y4lCDAZOaa	If you look at our schedule, it looks like we are gonna repeat. Repeat a Super Bowl win that is!!!!!!
3IQq3FPSaa	Listen, I was in your same position at one time in my life. I was undersized and playing free safety. I did happen to the fastest kid in my school (2nd ain't bgad though). If you believe that someone is going to take your spot, they will! Have confidence in yourself and your abilities. One thing I did was work harder than anyone else. So develop a good work ethic during the off season and it'll show when the season comes around. Use your head when you're out there and play with heart. Give 110% every down, never take a down off. Since you're playing safety, you're not afraid to hit somebody. Use your speed to your advantage when you hit somebody. Get that speed up, find a good angle to hit them (Think of where you wouldn't want to be hit), hit them hard, wrap those arms, and run straight through them! Rehab that knee and take care of the rest of those injuries during the off season. Run hills and sprints for strength and speed and stay in the weight room.     Have faith in yourself guy, you've obviously got the love for the game, use that passion in everything that you do. I went from the same spot you're in to playing college football and a year overseas. I was one of the most feared safeties in my region (very big hitter, had hit of the year 3 out of 4 years in high school and over 40 career INT's). If I can do it, so can you! Good luck!|`|fvWgE140aa	Yes Football Defensive Back Drills.  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with

Eddie then went up to the top for his victory frog splash and became WWE champ.    Wrestlemania - Stone Cold refereed In Brock Lesnar Vs Goldberg. They pretty much got booed out of the building until after the match when Austin gave Goldberg a stunner then Brock Lesnar in his last match.    Backlash - Chris Benoit was on the poster because he was the World Champ leading into Backlash.    Judgement Day - Bradshaw changed his gimmick to John Bradshaw Layfield the supposed wrestling god with millions of dollars.    Bad Blood - I don't know how long it went for but it was between HHH and HBK.    Vengeance - He was in a storyline with Matt Hardy because they were fighting over Lita.    Summerslam - It was Randy Orton Vs Chris Benoit for the World heavyweight title. Randy defeated Benoit, becoming the youngest champion in WWE history. Evolution then came out and turned on him. This was his official face turn.    No Mercy - JBL Vs Taker in I think the first ever Last Ride match for the WWE championship. JBL won the match with interference by, I can't remember.    Taboo Tuesday - HHH was champ and HBK was voted to face him for the title. HHH came out still the champion.

WZvny7mMaa	I would say CP3 because if the Lakers were without Kobe they would still be a pretty good team because of the depth they have while the Hornets without Chris Paul is like watching the 04-05 Hornets (the season before the Hornets drafted Chris Paul). They were absolutely terrible.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	CP3. He actually Gives Up the Ball.|`|stdjB5n8aa	cp3 he share's the ball with his teammate|`|Nuj1eScCaa	CP3 is more valuable to the Hornets. The Lakers are still a good team without Kobe, but the Hornets would fall apart without Paul's leadership.|`|tl7fd34yaa	man this is so aggravating we're up 17!! points in the end of the 3rd then CP goes down and we look like chickens with our heads cut off, man they played so bad man.    no matter how you feel about kobe this is why CP should have won MVP last year|`|HOtYR1ksaa	CP3 is more valuable to them because Lakers can still play decent ball without Kobe.|`|MPz9APZDaa	CP3 is really more valuable to their team. But Kobe is still the better player (at their own respective position). But I really don't see CP3 winning a MVP, because his team was really expected to play better than they have, and they just have gone downhill compared to last season.     Lakers best team..!!!!|`|xhHfXuKFaa	kobe. paul is in a wheel chair while kobe scored 61.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Chris Paul...|`|vzYJJCdqaa	Gotta say CP3..  I mean, hes like the leader in the hornets..and without him the hornets would not be okayy..|`|mSFjbetxaa	I have to say CP3 because the Lakers have more depth.
tvuhGTD9aa	Not looking up anything....    1. Hmm, good one. I'm going to guess 20.    2. Pittsburgh Pirates.    3. 1995 -- Atlanta Braves (or 1981 -- Los Angeles Dodgers. Depends on how one considers that anomalous season).    4. 1969 -- New York Mets.    5. Also good. I'll guess 10.    6. Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, Washington Nationals.    7. Tampa Bay Rays, Colorado Rockies.    8. 20.    9. Los Angeles Dodgers, 4-3 over Minnesota Twins.    10. Pedro.    -----  I've since looked up the answers to  1 and  5, and wow, I was well off the marks.    -----  I did not edit my original answers. I don't do that; what's the point?    The 1998 Yankees were 125-50 after winning the trophy.|`|DnFoaKPqaa	1.) 35  2.) Pittsburgh Pirates (  3.) Los Angeles Dodgers (sometime in the 80s)  4.) New York Mets (1969 I think)  5.) 45 seems like a good number  6.) Seattle Mariners, Washington Nationals, Texas Rangers  7.) Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay Rays (Mariners, Phillies, and Rockies are all at .470)  8.) 20 (?)  9.) Los Angeles Dodgers (GO KOUFAX!!!!)  10.) Pedro for now but Johan will have a higher one by the end of this season.    BONUS: For the 1997 season, the Yankees had a 96-66 record and for the 1999 season the Yankees had a 98-64 record. (pretty crazy that after 1996 WS they win 96 games and after 98 series they win 98 games!)      EDIT: How did we both miss number 8? I just looked it up and it is 20.

8f2cdb0e7151ee6bbcffe18c7795eb85aa	Check www.craigslist.com and local listings I live in Michigan USA and people are loosing jobs right now from our economy and practically desperate for money, as for which bike you get it depends on size and experience. If it helps at all I weigh 120lbs about 5' 8'' i'm 16 and can comfortably handle my friends YZ125 although I have been riding since I was 7.|`|qM4cMNufaa	for one thing is get a 4-stroke you can get a ttr 125|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	You need to state just what use you intend to put the bike to, what age you are, how tall and how much you weigh before anyone can give you and idea of what bike would suit you best.  Bikes vary in price as to how much they cost from Country to Country and I know they are a lot cheaper in America than the country I am in.  You will not get much however for the price you are stating and then if you can pick a bike up you would need to have someone check it over and make sure you were not buying trouble.  But post a bit more info.|`|vUeh2C64aa	hey it depends how old big and what u want but usualy u wont get nothin good 4 a grand.i ride a yamaha yzf250 they r worth $10000 where im from.(australia)|`|hfH8c1LWaa	can u get a bike for $1000? Yes. Will it be decent? No, but hey its only 1000.     as everyone has said, height weight and experience are vital in choosing a bike. the average rider (6ft, 180lbs) would need anything from 125 2 stroke to 450 4 stroke. for you i would suggest a 250 4 stroke trail bike. with ur budget u could probably pick up an older 80-90s trail bike, try looking on craigslist or cycletrader. dont expect to get much, thats what starter bikes are.|`|GWzoQ0iaaa	First off your not going to get a decent motocross bike for a grand.

He's not young anymore. He has to make sure he is healed 1000% before he returns. If he returns too early he will just get put back on the shelf again. I think he might return after Mania. Which kind of sucks because nobody wants to miss Mania, but he needs to work his way back into the story lines and such. Right now, I don't see him coming back anytime soon. If he does, I will be surprised.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	doubt it   he proably wont return til after wrestlmania|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	When I saw the question, I was getting excited about a possible return for The Alpha Male.

Me han gustado la quita de puntos a los equipos correspondientes a las bravas involucradas, sin importar quien empez, luego dos partidos sin su pblico. Muy buena la idea de prenotar la compra de entradas y asi tener a la gente empadronada, aunque podra ser engorroso ya que a veces hay gente de otros lados que ira a ver un boca-river o un central-?uls. Castigos efectivos y reales a los detenidos, en Chile, un detenido por violencia en los estadios, no vuelve a uno en cinco a?os, debiendo apersonarse en la comisara ms cercana a su domicilio, cuando su equipo juege de local, eso luego de un a?o o dos preso. Todo esto debe cumplirse con la transformacion total de la polica, que debe dejar de ser dependiente de los poderes politicos e independizarse y fundirse con las Fuerzas Armadas, y as cuando se soliciten mil efectivos, lleguen los mil efectivos a cumplir la orden.  He dicho.|`|094f57d70e3c9d12ba4d60df53f3af1aaa	En primer lugar se tiene que jugar a puertas cerradas todos los espectaculos,sin inchas visitantes ni locales.

Yo deje de ir a la cancha por que no aguanto el mal trato y la injusticia que uno tienen que pasar al entrar,durante y a la salida.

Que creen que pasara si no hubiera mas futbol? La respuesta es los violentos se trasladaran al basquet, al boley, o al tennis etc.  No es el deporte llmese como se llame la razn de la violencia, sino el individuo.  La violencia est en el ser humano desde el principio,desde la creacin misma. la historia Bblica nos dice que "Cain mat a Abel" y Abel era el hermano, hijo de misma madre y mismo padre.  Lo que sucede tambin que estos violentos no dudan en adherir a cualquier razn que les d  una excusa para ejercerla.  Entonces que hacer? Si de cualquier forma los violentos cambiarn de excusa en excusa para ejercer la violencia cual es la solucin?  La respuesta es que nosotros no podemos cambiar a un violento,pus a menos que el decida cambiar de forma de vida y deje de ser violento para ser un pacificador no hay solucin posible, solo se puede controlar a los violentos a travez de la aplicacin de las penas que le caben de acuerdo a la magnitud de su agresivo comportamiento y al da?o que ejecute.  Los violentos son de uso diario  por  polticos, muchos de los cuales se preocupan por asegurarles impunidad frente al accionar de la justicia, Tambin son los violentos amparados por Jueces garantistas, cuando sueltan violadores asesinos y ladrones por cuestiones tcnicas etc. etc.  As que a menos que haya una profunda transformacin el vida de los violentos, para que dejen de serlo, deberemos apoyar medidas que ayuden a controlarlos bajo el imperio de la ley.

De igual manera a todo aquel que sea detenido por disturbio se le debe aplicar una sancin inmediata, detenerlos o suspenderlos por un tiempo determinado segn la falta.

No solo en el futbol, si no en todo s los sectores hace falta, pero para todos los casos la respuesta es simple. El ser humano es muy caprichoso y sabe lo que esta haciendo mal, sin embargo no quiere deja de hacerlo por carpicho. La respuesta es tan simple como profunda, ya se ha visto que nada hasta ahora dio resultado: camaras, mas policias, mayores penas, etc, etc... y todo sigue igual en el mundo hasta que el hombre no renuncie a todos los vicios ( o a todos los que pueda ), no habra cambio en la sociedad... si no hay paz ni cultura en el interior de las mentes de los violentos, cmo esperan que con metodos externos (sean cuales sean) la gente sea menos violentos.  El ser humano sabe que todo lo que genera ansiedad y adrenalina, pero la mayoria quiere seguir viviendo asi, entonces no hay posibilidades por este camino. El punto clave es educar a la gente en valores humanos y morales (ya casi desaparecidos), claro que las personas que ya son violentas ser dificil, pero es el unico camino... a un loco violento no lo hace recapacitar ni un policia ni camaras ni nada de estas cosas, solo hay que brindarles las "comodidades para que se relaje", y asi de a poco porque ewl problema de generaciones no se puede curar de un dia para el otro... todos sabemos la tala indiscriminada de arboles... la contaminacion del medio ambiente, la corrupcion y malicia de esta sociedad, sin embargo de todos los que lo saben cuantos son los que hacen algo para majorarla? todos se  quejan y se?alan al otro, mientras seguimos comprando muebls indiscriminadamente a un ritmo vertiginoso y sin darnos cuenta decimos: "estan haciendo pelota el mundo". Basta de todo esto, si   queremos paz en las canchas en la sociedad o en la familia primero debe haber paz dentro nuestro y esta tarea de educar le corresponde a los gobiernos que no se dejen coimear por empresas que estan asfixiando a la humanidad en su afan de poder y competencia... Es muy dificil ser una persona correcta en estos dias porque todo va encontra la corriente, sin embargo miles y miles quieren paz en el mundo. acaso no nos hemos dado cuenta todavia que los buenos spomo mayoria en este mundo... solo falta que nos unamos, y cambiandonos multitudinariamente a nosotros mismos, cambiemos este nuestro mundo.  La respuesta era simple pero es imposible hacer omision de tantas cosas: si la humanidad no consumiera tanta carne no seriamos tan violentos (comprobado cientificamente. matar animales para comer, sin parar hasta quedar gordos, ese es un principio de violencia.

La mejor manera seria que cada persona que haga disturbio, sea o no sea barrabraba cada vez que juegue su equipo se deba presentar a una comisaria y permanecer hasta el final del encuentro, de no presentarce que sea sancionado con un mes de carcel salvo que justifique la ausencia por alguna razon mas importante. 2)- Que automaticamente no pueda ingresar mas a ninguna cancha, juegue quien juegue. 3)-que el dirigente que sea responsable de cualquier disturbio o uso de barras, sea sancionado y que no pueda desempe?arse mas en esa funcion de lo contrario, tambien que se le habra una causa por no cumplir con la ley. 4)- que la ley sea mas dura para quien corresponda. 5)- Que el futbolista que con cualquier gesto, o se?a agreda a la tribuna, sea tambien castigado con un a?o y que no pueda jugar, que el club no se responsabilice del sueldo y que la prensa no lo pueda tener como invitado en lo que dure el castigo o la sancion. Creo que de esta forma si todos cumplimos y se hace cumplir la ley, pensarian mil veces antes de cometer un error. Dejariamos hasta el encendedor en casa, tomariamos agua el dia del partido, alentariamos a nuestro equipo hasta el final y luego a casa.

Y todos sabemos que cuando se afecta el bolsillo, las cosas tienden (o deberan tender) a encaminarse. La cosa es muy simple y no admite ambigedades: Al club cuya hinchada cause desmanes, genere violencia entre hinchadas, con la polica, o porque no les gusta que su equipo vaya perdiendo por 3, 4  5 goles y haga cancelar o suspender un partido se le har una quita de puntos lo suficientemente fuerte como para que sirva de ejemplo. Al decir esto hablo de quitar no menos de 100 puntos. Sea un club grande o chico. El perjuicio que esto causara hara que mas de uno piense dos o tres veces antes de causar problemas. Y obligara a toda la dirigencia a terminar de una vez por todas con las entradas de favor y con aceptar la prepotencia de unos pocos. Esto sera el principio.

En el caso del ftbol, deberan cumplirse las normas que indican los objetivos de un club deportivo: un lugar de encuentro y prctica deportiva. De entrada, los dirigentes no deberan permitir que proliferen los violentos en un mbito que desde su misma concepcin tiene otros objetivos.

qbL19IHDaa	when pickinga bat have her stand straight up and then hold the bat in her hand. It should touch the ground and be within an inch of a regular grip in her hand.  The button of the bat that is.  So it will basically make up the difference from her wrist to the floor.   As far as weight, just have her hold a few bats and see which one feels right to her.  they make a ton of bats nowthat are termed -8 through -12.  Meaning they are 8 ounces less than their length up to 12 ounces less than the length.  Example.  a 30 inch bat that is rated -8 is only 22 ounces.  a minus 12 is 18 ounces.  She wont need a bat that long by any means.  Probably about a 22-24 inch bat? Depends entirely on her hieght.|`|54ab2c914f32b2b97ea333c9ef3eebbfaa	It doesn't matter which she is playing, the same elements apply.  The highest bat speed with the heaviest bat she can swing at that speed is what you are looking for.  Bat speed is more important than heavy.  BTW, the center of gravity location can also be a factor, the farther the CG is from the hands, the heavier it is to swing.  More than likely at age 6, as light as you can get is probably what you need.  Try looking for something around the 17 oz range.  And if you have never experienced Class A fastpitch softball, you and your daughter are going to be missing on something incrediable.  Good Luck|`|noPubhbLaa	When determining the weight, let your daughter hold the bat straight out in front of her for one minute. If there is any pain, go 1 size down. For the height try a 23, 24, and 25 inch bat. Also, you don't have to spend a lot on a bat. They are actually all the same. Those $300 bats with all the new technology, are actually the same as the little $25 one. They are rated on BPF.|`|a7e2af8eba7250e3b19bed8656876435aa	girls shouldnt be allowed to play baseball.. lol :)|`|kpv56ivEaa	you can go to sporting stores and they can measure her for a perfect bat

AA12118274	Best overall record has home field advantage. UNLESS it is the wildcard team that never gets homefield advantage.     Homefield advantege for the World Series is determaned by the winner of the All Stars game. |`|sXhmNNr6aa	I'm not sure about the playoff games, but they do switch. However, whoever wins the All Star Game, which in this years case was American League, hosts the World Series.
EhPVmkUcaa	the phils are winning it all. why? because it is their time. they finally have the bats, and the pitching to bring it to the end. they have rollins, chase, victorino, werth, howard, burrel...the for bats....hamels, moyer, and meyers, romeo, and lidge (who is undefeated by the why) ....for pitching.     right now they got it all.......they will be playing the dodgers next round (phils are winning 5-0 right now in game 4) ...i get nervous against the dodgers but we have the home field advantage and last time dodgers were back here, they got swept, soooooo.....im feeling pretty confident and dodgers wont make it past us.     phils are finishing this this year. |`|mcE9C06Saa	I think the Dodgers will win the World Series against the Red Sox. They are playing really well right now, (it was like men playing against boys when they were playing against the Cubs) Manny would want nothing more then to win the World Series, and prove the Red Sox can not win it all with out him.|`|3ogqWrfeaa	Wow, this question hasn't been asked before!    Oh  wait. It has. Literally every five minutes, every day for the past month.    Do you people ever look at the other questions? You know, like the ones from 5 minutes ago, or 5 minutes before that? Keep your ten points.|`|Bi8PISCHaa	I think Dodgers will win it cause they have a great team and a great coach they will face Red Socks and will beat them 3-0 in the series|`|CG7Z4Oz5aa	DODGERS ITS THEIR TIME|`|AA12118274	The Sox will beat the Dodgers in the WS. It will go all 7 games. 
Bi8PISCHaa	it will be Red Sox vs. Tampa Bay|`|sHzPnGXHaa	rays|`|CeiIz1Vbaa	Tampa Bay Rays!|`|7Vlo2iZtaa	Probably each others butts since the Angels have a mighty good chance of taking the next 3.|`|AA12118274	The Rays and after that the Dodgers in the WS. |`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	It will be The Rays The White sox Don't look they can Deal with Tampa Bay.      ALCS RED SOX VS RAYS Put that Down.|`|E6EyY1klaa	It's probably going to be Sox - Rays, but they both gotta win one more. I think the Angels will beat you guys tonight, and if they squeak out a Game 4 win, it's all over.|`|7j75DhQQaa	Looks as though we get the Over-RAY-ted Devil Rays of Tampa, but we still have to win a game against the Angels their backs are to the walls so don't expect them to give up!|`|csQvA43gaa	It's pretty obvious that is gonna be the Rays. What a terrible october for the city of Chicago|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Red Sox fan, you better worry about finishing off the Angels first before you worry about the ALCS.  Same thing goes for the Rays as well.  Odds are favoring that it will be a Red Sox versus Rays showdown, but nothing is set in stone yet.  In a best of 5 series, it is easy for a team to come back from a 2-0 series deficit to win the series.  See the 2001 ALDS between Oakland and New York.    Here is an interesting thought.  If the Red Sox finish off the Angels to win the ALDS, both the Angels and the Cubs will be eliminated.  Those two teams both had the best records in theor respective leagues going into the playoffs.  Both would have not gotten past the Divisonal series.  Goes to show you that one still has to play the game.|`|WKJhQL2baa	There will be only three possible scenarios:    1. Red Sox face Rays  2. Red Sox face White Sox  3. Red Sox face nobody. (If they lose the remaining three ALDS games to Angels.)    Judging from what has been happening thus far, Red Sox would have a good shot advance to ALCS and there is a good possibility that they will face the Rays, which is the other HOT team in ALDS now.    But it's still too early to call, you would never know whether or not Angels will come back from a 0-2 deficits and win 3 games in a row to defeat Red Sox in ALDS.      Let's see what's happening today.|`|nyOfN9jyaa	It looks like it's going to be the Rays.  If have faith in the Red Sox, but if the match up has the same results as in the regular season...............that scares me!!|`|iwu2dm7Qaa	the Red soxs don't know that the rally monkey is in Boston.  and they will loose 3 straight.    Angels will win|`|Pr0rzdLsaa	Looks like it could be the Rays.... Although both teams are leading their series 2-1,,,,, I have a feeling that the Angels are not gonna go down easy. I think that its gonna go to 5. But I like the Rays v Red Sox match-up..... Its become the most exciting divsion rivalry this season.... It would be a great ALCS!!! I think if that happens the Rays will finish their improbable season and meet the Dodgers in a world series. What a great year for baseball!!!!!|`|4czUd6TJaa	Probably the Rays, although the first series for both teams still are not over.|`|DdIFC5k0aa	they need to clinch an alds title first. it will probably be the rays.
wmWrcN0faa	If the Mavs made either of those trades I'd cry.
GRRpbWLoaa	Both scopes listed have the same power: 3-9x40, but I would recommend the NC Star 3-9x40 Rubber Armor Rifle Scope, just because NC Star is a more known brand than the Airsplat model.|`|bxK6meXiaa	Either one is good. They may even the same factory just without the brand name.     You know OEM.     And yes, you should buy from AirSplat, they are one of the largest and most trusted online retailers out there. Have been around for much longer than GI or Evilke. Not to say you shoudln't buy from them. But don't just listen to what some people's dogma.|`|AA10056762	The NC star is probably better but you should not order from Airsplat. They are a terrible seller.    try Airsoft GI http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...
vIonh5mnaa	The top speed depends on where you are riding at (open lake, trails), traction, weight of driver, wind direction, clutch set up, gearing, belt condition, amount of fuel, condition of the clutches.    For a 380, about 50-60mph???|`|InslKYS5aa	Sorry, but a 380 will top out at between 55 and 60. I have one, but like Woodman said, a lot depends on rider weight, and trail conditions.

SIenfbA6aa	I love surf fishing man!  and I have done many types of fishing...I suggest a 12' rod since you are just starting out.  Also you might want to take a PVC pipe to stick in the sand to hold your rod for you.  Also, get saltwater gear because freshwater gear will rust from all the salt from the ocean.  If you do get freshwater gear be sure to rise it throughly under freshwater so it wont rust as bad or quickly.  Do that for your salt water gear to if you get that.|`|gAOAdOHraa	You can use either.  A smaller rod is good because if you pick a good gutter you will catch the fish that have been caught in the gutter.  So why don't you take both and see which one gives you more success.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	15 feet is overkill unless you are fishing in extra large breakers and need to hold your line 15 ' up. l get by fine with 12'. l would imagine most people can and do. 15' might be a bit more awkward to handle when landing the fish and adds unnecessary weight too.      pssst. down here. use mono. don't let that other guy see me telling you this.|`|ZKT4E6yDaa	I would go with a 12' Lamiglas Surf King.  I bought my dad one for his birthday and he loves it!  It seems like you're into chunking (bait), so you want something atleast MH (medium heavy) to Heavy Action to get your bait and sinker out there.  You don't want plastic reels.  Get a nice Graphite with a quality Drag.  I recommend Penn to start off.    You should definitely go with the "high-low" rig.  Sliding sinkers tend to helicopter with you bait therefore reducing the distance and control of your cast.|`|oMjVp4zGaa	For anyone to better answer your question the species you are targeting must have some bearing on what equipment you use.|`|AA11016927	With the amount of info you've given I'd vote for the 12FT.    (Your right Bass Player. Ignorance is bliss.)|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	12' rod  for a rig look up a 8nbait rig or cannonball rig|`|xU9e7uGTaa	depending on the species and how far you gotta heave i would go as low as 8

Try to improve by listening to them and others. Practice if you want to go out for the team, or play in a recreational league to get you better prepared.  And have a positive attitude.|`|FFh7x8a1aa	be loud be aggressive when hitting the ball...USE AN APPROACH it's really going to help it should be left right left if your fight handed and right left right if your left handed...now think would you rather impress your friends or impress the coach who has the ability to move you up to a higher team?|`|H8r7G1R5aa	If you want to impress them then push yourself as hard as you can to improve, don't give up and go harder than ever. If you need to improve further and want to show that you are serious about volleyball talk to your parents about JO volleyball, look for clubs in your area, for example I coach for a league called, SPAASM, Advanced Approach Pittsburgh. Look into joining one of them and you can push even harder there.   Remember that volleyball is a team sport it takes 6 girls playing as 1 to make it work.|`|c7J5otJIaa	Talkin it up on court is  really helpful like calling OUTSIDE!  wen an outside hitter is hitting  or yelling TIP etc.    or you can also impress them buy improving  and learning from others.    and just by learning the right habits  can improve you.  (ex. habits like: diving, covering, talking, and other simple things.)|`|t2bMd6TVaa	Be loud and supportive. Half of volleyball is skills, the other half is communication. When you cheer each other on, and help your teammates by yelling "tip", it show leadership. Also, outside of playing with them, do simple things to keep up on your skills. Do 100 sets and 100 passes to yourself each day. This REALLY improves basic skills. Remember to have fun, and just play the game-don't worry about impressing them!|`|mlI5wPuTaa	just practice a lot and u will get better. if u practice hard enough they will be impressed on how hard u are trying to be a good player.|`|Er17Wmwpaa	play as well as them, or better. dont look like u're trying to impress them though|`|PxI12ChTaa	I think a great way to impress them might be to really improve your serves. If you can get a good run going with your serves, you'll add points to your team really fast.  If you do overhead serves, you have to remember that you're not using just your dominant arm.  You also have to use your shoulders and your waist for a powerful serve.  But rather than working on power from the beginning, you should work on getting down a form that works for you. Once you find something where you can be consistently accurate, power and speed will follow.  Finally, you should work on your strategies when serving.  Maybe you can serve a pattern for a few serves, like only doing top spins for a bit.  Toss in a floater, side spin, or a under spin and that might throw off the other team.  You could also do that with location, such as serving to one spot for several serves and then suddenly serving to a completely different spot. Hope that helped!
voHjrtAtaa	I find glasses and goggles really do not work!  Try if you can to get disposable lens'    I had a huge problem when i wore my glasses with goggles. My glasses were extremely cold, and so the little pocket of hot air caused my putting goggles on made my glasses steam up!!  Not good when your trying to go down a mountain at speed.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Well I'm assuming you can get them from any place that sells goggles for skiing/snowboarding    When I first started snowboarding I had some that were supposed to fit over my glasses. They still pushed against my glasses and they hurt and were just a huge pain in the butt.    Snowboarding is actually the reason why I went out and got contacts for the first time. Contacts are soooo much more comfortable and easier than trying to put goggles over glasses.     But maybe it's just me that doesnt like em, maybe other people are fine with them.

LIKkt8djaa	a 162 would be a bit large for you in freestyle, You want to go shorter for maneuverability and an ease in pressing the board, both important factors in riding freestyle.    I would look in the 154-157 range for you, that would make a nice short end stick for freestyle.|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Jake M is right on point as always, but I would like to add to what he said.  You should also look for a board that isn't very flexible, it will make the transition from slalom to freestyle a lot easier.

They are well made high end decks, size 7.5 and 7.75 high and medum concave. I've been getting good feedback on everyone that has ridden the prototype.They won't be available till April 4th though.     for a good deck with a mellow concave I like Mystery. I got one of their 7.62 decks for my girlfriend and have ridden it a bit myself. It is wearing down more smoothly than a lot of decks I've tried, with less chipping, but I don't like the pop as much.   ....  For everyone reading this post. I'm trying to get a skateboard review page going. If you would like to add some reviews, or if you have similar questions to this one go to http://sqdecks.com/skateboard_deck_revie... to submit and read reviews. Thanks
ZKT4E6yDaa	I believe these rods are overpriced.  I read reviews on Cabela's and Bass Pro about these rods snapping in half.  As good as Shimano is, you won't get a replacement for their defect.  I was looking into one for jigging purposes, but I change my mind.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	they look very strong. a friend of mine used them with butterfly jigs and pulled in a 209lb bluefin tuna with a vs300 reel. the reviews Commonsense was reading was probably a different rod because all the reviews i say said it was a strong rod and at 99 dollars it is a very inexpensive rod
FZRWMc3Baa	He said O line, meaning his offensive linemen.  There's been lots of bad things said about them this year (and last year) in Pittsburgh because of all the sacks and hits they allow.  He was referring to redemption for them.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Yes he was referring to the criticism that the offensive line was getting all year. They were the Achilles heel of the Steelers team this year. A lot of that was losing Alan Fanaca via free agency and both tackles on IR for most of the season.     John D, we get it the Titans beat the Steelers this year, so what? You couldn't beat the Ravens in the playoffs AT HOME, we beat them three times.|`|AA10939368	He said who is laughing now O-line referring to his offensive line and the fact they just won the superbowl.|`|AA11760438	The O-line almost costed the steelers the game with the safety... if not for the cardinals weak secondary who couldnt stop the steelers on their last drive on 3rd down..before the big pass play.. Roethlisberger wouldve been crying and blaming that Old-Line|`|a8745d93f495ed1006e4532daff1bc40aa	He said "who's laughing at the O-line now" meaning the O-line was criticized all year, and look how well the O-Line protected him during that last drive which enabled him to make the successful drive ending in the touchdown.|`|21nhdIXKaa	he said whos laughing now O-LINE, because he is known for getting sacked so much so the steelers o-line got thrashed all year|`|8ImkKoNEaa	he was thanking the replay booth for not looking at the last play by the cards when the ball and warners arm was going forward!  where was that oline and dline against the titans this year!  isn't using the ball as a prop a penalty in the nfl?|`|X52KmH3baa	I didn't catch the name but I know that he was trying to say that to everyone who underestimates the Pittsburgh offense to pretty much suck it. Because, the offense stepped their game up.|`|P4rkhX89aa	its mean sat his team won  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://watchtvinternet.blogspot.com/|`|7e477444a2e90a0e658a638d00e87650aa	First, he said "O-line", not oli, and he was referring to his offensive line, who was criticized by everyone (including me) all season.    As for the "he was thanking the replay booth for not looking at the last play by the cards when the ball and warners arm was going forward!", guy, are you blind?    1.  The play WAS reviewed.  It was just so obvious that they didn't even need to stop anything to uphold the call on the field.    2. Yes, the ball was going forward.  Yes warners arm was going forward.  But NOT when the ball was in warner's hand.  Warner's hand went back, the hit occurred, the ball went straight up, and got knocked forward.  Warner's hand didn't go forward until AFTER the ball was out of it.
mMFJrPbvaa	That`s really any rock climbing shoe.  Maybe they were decsribing how climbing shoes were made because tat doesn't sound like a single brand or model.  You have 5.10`s which use the Stealth rubber and you have Mad Rock who uses their own rubber.  La Sportiva`s, Prana are other major brands as well.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	Evolv is another popular brand of climbing shoe|`|Mv1F4Ooyaa	Evolve sucks!
DnFoaKPqaa	I have got to say the San Francisco Giants (New York Giant, New York Gothams). My reason for choosing them is because they are overall 10,256-8,814 which gives them the most wins overall and because the Yankees just buy championships.    Good luck getting the 71 wins you need get to 10,000 total.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	it must be one of those 26 yankees teams....|`|DkwgogXZaa	The 1927 Yankees|`|H7AcXAyaaa	2004 Red Sox.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Red Sox!

The Yankees have the most championships and wins, so by that standard they'd probably win. The Cards measure up nicely, especially because of a smaller market size.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	yankees... 26 world championships..nuff said|`|fafd4d858e4fee9b87096037aab92978aa	Let me preface this by saying I HATE the Yankees. As a Cards fan I would say any team that can win a Title with only 83 victories clearly wants it more than anybody else.  But, 1949-1960 the Yankees.  After all, the Damn Yankees are the only team to ever have a play written after them.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	Until someone can dethrone them for the most titles in all of baseball, the Yankees are the best team!|`|gCdvDjfkaa	Though I'm not a Yankees fan I would have to say the Best team ever is the 1927 Yankees|`|WaaFCtuOaa	History says the Yankees since they won the most championships|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Since it looks like you're only considering wins you have to go with the Yankees.  NY has close to twice as many pennants (39 vs 21) as the Cards and they have 16 more World Series rings (26 vs 10).  And the Yanks have the best all-time winning percentage in the majors (.567 vs .517 for the St Louis).  That puts them firmly ahead of the Cardinals by the numbers.|`|z6kjSwNFaa	98,99,00 yankees|`|9lDqqQ8Iaa	As much I hate to say it as a diehard Orioles fan, I think it goes without saying that the Yankees are the greatest team of all time. There should not even be a debate. Look at how many championships they have won compared to everyone else. The Cardinals are up there with the big boys though, winning their share of titles as well.|`|yJ8DqPA0aa	The 1927 New York Yankees, one of the greatest baseball teams of all-time. thats a fact|`|4AzWJfNlaa	'27 Yankees.

4gZYucHMaa	I'm flat footed as well, you need good shoes! I find Asics are the best shoe out there to suit our type of feet.     Ensure you go into a sports store and have someone reccomend you a shoe that suits flat feet--very very important bc you can get injuries not wearing the right shoe for your foot!|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	My best suggestion is to go to your local running shoe store. They should be able to get a good look at your ankles and feet and help you with that. I personally am also flat footed, but in addition to that, I am an overpronator which means that when I walk/run, my ankle rolls in. Your arch is important, but what your ankle is doing could be more meaningful as to why you hurt. Go to runnersworld.com or google overpronation and you will see what I am talking about. In order to correct the way I walk/run they set me up in some shoes that have major support in the arch so that my ankle doesn't roll in, it stays upright. Also, when running, the best thing to do with your arms is to pump them as you would when walking normally (only faster, obviously). Just be sure to keep them going front to back and not crossing your chest. By crossing over your chest you would be expelling more energy. Best of luck and hope this helped.
wnZ0N3wjaa	Jayasuriya is more destructive at his peak in ODI's and is useful with the ball with 250 odd wickets I think. One of the best has to be Sachin though, piling runs after runs year after year, you cant go past the man.|`|9d0ffimQaa	Well, both are tallented players & both are competetive in their fileld, but ofcourse Sachin is the best batsman for sure.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Sachin Tendulkar for sure.

NJMzhcKhaa	Lol at the answerer above me. You really want to put Quinton Jackson in the same cage with Kimbo?  Might as well put a 15 yrs old kid to fight GSP or Anderson Silva.    Good for Kimbo that he got money from some of his fights. It was fun while it lasted and EliteXC putting some lower level fighters to pit against Kimbo.  At least it shows that Kimbo is not there at the bottom of the bottom, he's still hovering a bit (scraping hte bottom but not flat there yet)    I'm actually surprised that Kimbo didn't get much better after 2-3 fights, considering he trained with Bas Rutten, which make me question his training ethic or him believing the hype surrounding him enough to made him arrogant enough not to train hard enough.    Kimbo vs Ken Shamrock is fun, Ken is waaaayyy beyond his prime and another freak show is always fun.|`|b0z0pbdXaa	yes, i find pretty entertaining watching kimbo lose an taking all my friends money.|`|ToIKcUdCaa	take all his weight away, make him an average weight, he would get the **** kicked out of him, its just because he is big, he puts martial arts to shame, and im glad he got beaten, he is a disgrace|`|B6dQzaGyaa	hasnt that happen with Tank Abbot and Thompson, neither have enough submission skills to put a puppy to sleep and that is only reason kimbo won...Kimbo is a circus act that MMA sideshows tried to make a dollar off of and when he met an avg MMA fighter he got absolutely owned, so no, kimbo is a bigger has been then butterbean|`|ySvQf3e5aa	The sport is Mixed Martial Arts, not UFC. He is a MIXED MARTIAL ARTIST. He's terrible at MMA, but yeah, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't want to see him fight some other wild and crazy brawler. Hahaha, or maybe have him fight the "freaks" of MMA like Butterbean or Giant Silva or Emmanuel Yarborough.|`|b55b93bbea1c80bb3180c0937f66a726aa	I like martial arts and i think Kimbo is just another person trying to make a living... honestly the guys making more money then most all of his critics, thats probably why they are pissed. He puts on a good show; Well yeah, he did get knocked out real quick in that last fight he was in but it did seem like a forward slip and, face it, he's a big mother f'er he's not gonna be like Anderson "The Spider" Silva and pop right back up he's gotta get his ground, just like any heavyweight scrapper.    So to answer your question as to would I like to see him fight a brawler? Yes. I want to see him fight THE brawler. Why not put someone with so much fame up against a man with fame for knocking out powerful fighters. A man that hasn't went beyond his prime... a man who has a scrappy, brawler, street-fighter background: Quinton "Rampage" Jackson    That would be the fight of the night right there.. and it would make millions of dollars for the UFC (even though Dana White claimed Kimbo will NEVER be accepted into the UFC)|`|M2NkeVdPaa	first of all for a non beginner MMA fan he doesnt fight for the UFC and he never will because he sucks any heavyweight and light-heavyweight in the UFC could kick his ***

Understand, that these are difficult financial times and you may not receive many offers for your cards, and you may be better of holding on to them, if they are not taking up much space. They are nice to have(or save), and will increase overtime.   Good luck!|`|gMTatFZBaa	Yes, get the latest Beckett Baseball book, it has detailed pricing info on 70s topps cards. I'm guessing your cards are not mint but you could still probably get a few bucks for them on Ebay.

Then you could see for yourself  how high people are bidding for that specific card.|`|bNhyEJHsaa	you can look it up on google, or go to a card store, Ask them how much it is supposed to be.|`|yghiYtwEaa	See if there HOFer's.|`|fafd4d858e4fee9b87096037aab92978aa	Short answer. As a collector with over 20,000 cards I hate to say but the market has dropped steadily for the past decade.  Pokemon cards, Magic the Gathering and next gen video games killed it.  Beckett price guides are like four bucks and they are pretty accurate at predicting market value with collectors and at trade shows.  As far as eBay is concerned a lot of buyers now want the cards to be graded before they consider buying them, a process that takes time and money.  If you are sure it is Topps '79 Ozzie Smith's rookie card might be in there.  Also look for Nolan Ryan--is not worth nearly as much but he has a large fan base that might be willing to pay slightly over market if it is in good condition-(no tattered corners, no discoloration, perfect centering of picture, no scratches).  I can't help you with the rest of the lot, but if you have Smith I'd make you a fair offer, e-mail me at theprevailingwind@yahoo.com, if not good luck- try selling in bulk.|`|oM0mUoW5aa	you can see how much they're going for on ebay as a rough comparason|`|EEowYuNQaa	Buy a "beckett book" it is a accurate price for any sports cards.

DnFoaKPqaa	In all honesty, it would be a long hard road and the reward at the end of the tunnel may never come. There are kids in the Little League World Series who pitch 70mph and some of them won't even make it. You are only 13 so your height means nothing, you haven't hit puberty. I would recommend choosing ONE position and perfecting it. If you can only hit 250 feet, then I would recommend going with pitching. The majors are changing dramatically and positional players are becoming powerhouses, such as 2b and SS. As far as living in the middle of no where. Just attend a bigger college and hope you make the team. Try not to forget that anything can happen though, I was the number 2 ranked prospect in 2004 in Western Pennsylvania and ended up requiring surgery on my arm and lost most of my speed and accuracy. I was pitching 85-90 then if that helps at all. Try not to forget that your grades are most important since you will need a degree if you don't make it. Don't wanna be a bus driver that played single A ball for a season....|`|AA10349169	You deserve a facepalm  http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh15/...|`|gMTatFZBaa	Yes, right on schedule, our daily "I throw almost at a Major league level, am I good?" post.    You don't hit "in the mid 70s" GEnerally idiots like yourself add 15-20 mph to their actual speed so 50 mph is probably right about normal for you.    And no, you can't make the big leagues. Million of kids your age think the same thing, none of them go into internet forums and lie about their speed, though.    And what's a "stragies?"

Still you should try to get noticed so try going out for you next tryouts in a the closest big city.

Work hard and maybe look up some pitching coaches close to where you live. It does not matter how far you hit or throw the ball its where you can put it. In 8th grade I was throwing about 80 mph and I pitched on varsity and started at shortstop. I also hit 380 that year. The next year I was throwing between 84-86 mph and I had crazy movement on my fastball. I had scouts looking at me in 9th grade and I started out 3-0 my 10th grade year and I had a 478 batting avg then about the 10th game I messed my ankle up. I finished the season but didn't do worth a crap. My fastball went from 85 mph to 77-78. my sisters boyfriend pitched in college so I had him helping me with my mechanic's. Just work hard and give faith to God and anything is possible. If you ever need advice or tips my email is titans12101@yahoo.com

Check pawnshops or Craigslist for used options.  Search online for last years gear, it should be around half the original retail.  The one item you shouldn't skimp on is your boots. Keep your feet happy and you'll be happy.  As far as differences between the budget boards- a $100 board is going to be the same from any company,i.e. not much.

cgAjzSVKaa	Yeah, it was called NBA's Greatest Slam Dunk Contest:AirBorne    It showed highlights of the 5 greatest dunk contests in History.    First was Dr.J's last dunk contest were he lost, but it was an ispirational moment. I think t was in Denver.    Second was Spudd Webb vs Domnique Wilkins, with Spudd socking the world with his dunks.    Third was Domnique vs Jordan, with Jordan winning in Chicago, of course.    4th was my favorite. Vince Carter 2000 slam dunk contest in Oakland, California.  Man that was amazing. It was called the greatest performance in Slam Dunk contest history.    5th was Jason Richardson in 2003, against some guys from teh Sonics.  J-Rich was nice as well.

YYqrT4jBaa	First of all make sure the lens is a dual-pane thermal lens. If it's a single-pane thermal treated lens, it won't be nearly as effective.     You can try to use anti-fog spray. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Spit doesn't work, I've tried it. My dad suggested that I use Crisco. It worked for my brother.    Just rub a thin layer of Crisco onto both sides of the lens. Let it dry and you should be good.     If none of this works, buy a thermal dual-pane lens. It'll save you grief.|`|sosisPXbaa	there's anti fog spray you can buy.  divers use it... maybe it'll work for you|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Diver's spit on their masks to keep them from fogging.  It has worked as well as anything I've tried.  Spit on both sides of the lens, rub it around, and wipe it off.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	If you can, get some that have anti-fog stuff on them, that's the only thing I can think of...but I'd like to know as well, seeing as how I have this same problem from time to time.|`|7Pq8k3bbaa	Two things...  1.  Anti-fog spray  2.  Goggle fan -- goggle specific (ie. JT USA Vortex II or Dye/Proto Turbine) or custom made using computer fans and a 9V.    As far as custom fans are concerned, you either buy a kit or buy the parts individually and assemble yourself.
ZKikquiOaa	Ah target archery, my type of guy.  It all depends on what you want to do with it, do you want to compete some day?    A recurve will give you a good start for one primary reason.  Once you've learned to shoot it properly, and it's very hard to do it improperly with a recurve and still hit the target, you can usually switch to any other type of bow (compound, longbow, etc) with little problems.  Recurve is somewhat of a middle of the road bow. It requires technique to shoot properly, you can't use sloppy technique, like you can with a compound, and still hope to hit what you're aiming at.  With a sight on a recurve, you will eliminate one variable in the shooting form and that is aiming skill.  With a sight, all you have to do is point the sight at the target and shoot, if your arrows are spread over a wide area, you definitely know it's your form that's the problem and not aiming.  Without a sight, if your arrows are all over the place, you don't know which is at fault, form or aiming.    There is a basic, fundamental form to archery.  While there is no one good form for everyone, certain aspects of the archery form is the same. For instance, everyone stand straight up when shooting as this is the easiest stance to get done properly, outside of a circus you don't see too many archers shooting with their feet.  Anchoring is the first skill you need to learn, that is attaching the back end of the arrow to your face.  That might sound painful, but actually it's just a matter of touching the string to your chin and the top part of your index finger to your jaw.  This fixes the rear of the arrow relative to your eye.  There are many other methods of anchor, the string to chin method is the most solid, and a luxury you get for using a sight.  Barebow shooters don't have that luxury and have to rely on other forms of anchor that puts the rear of the arrow closer to their eyes    Here is the basic archery form, it used to be called the 9 steps, but now NAA revised it to the 10 steps.  At the beginning, ignore step 7    http://www.learnarchery.com/basicarchery...    As for bows, if you want to learn target archery properly, you have to start with light bows, very light bows.  I've been doing this for 8 years, and when I need to learn a new form I drop my poundage to 20 lbs.  That gets costly, because you need to buy a lot of limbs.  The alternative to that is to build up your form and strength using other people's equipment.  By that I mean, go to a range and usually they have equipment that you can borrow.  If you're in the US, go to www.usarchery.org and find one near you, if you're lucky you can find one that does it for free.|`|hVJovD6Haa	Targettbutt has it right!!!! As an NAA certified archery coach I can assure you that any bow you get if you are willing to try, listen, and learn you will be rewarded with YEARS of fun. Not knowing your age or where you are from, I can't refer you to a specific club to help.     If you would like to contact me direct feel free to and I will see what additional information I can get you.

LyR6DudNaa	the way to get better is to watch the pros play(NBA)  watch what they do, study the post moves. Then after that start applying it to pratice.Run the move over and over again. Before you know it your going to be scoring and posting up like a pro  Also always pratice,you will get better!|`|jDi45m0uaa	Allen Iverson: Practice!    actually work out more to get muscles and get your Coach to help you work on those.|`|LMayULw3aa	yeah watch the pros play on nba and apply it to practice.

uzvSKvGgaa	yeah but its like that for pretty much any wrestlers that adopts a new finisher , the old one becomes a high impact move but its rarely enough to get the win, for example wall of jericho its not enough to pick up the win he needs the codebreaker , chris had the wall on cena for like 5 minute and he didnt tap out he reverse it into an stf for five seconds and jericho taps out|`|OuFhcdX9aa	idk where you heard that but cena's finisher is still the F-U|`|CJzbIhWuaa	yes, ever since jr said the name changes i have been waiting to hear them call it the throwback but it hasnt happened even though they havent called it the fu either, the just say he is going for the finish, but everytime they have a chance they say stf, today it seems like the fu is now called the attitude adjustment, even if u look at his profile on wwe.com, they say his signature move is the stf and doesnt mention to move formerly known as the fu|`|8Im1iGFTaa	ya i think so and they never say Throwback or FU  they just say "and Cena tries to finish it"  its like they cant accept it has been changed and are trying to focus on the STF|`|lXp33SwSaa	Nope. He can't really use the STFU on the Elimination Chamber once all hell breaks loose.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Yeah, he tends to use it a little more than the "throwback"|`|mVH5LqMuaa	forget the moves they are pushing cena way to mych thst i cant take it any more ...i cant stand his " INVINCIBILITY " I HATE HIM ..HIS LITTLE SHITTY MOVES AND ALL THE LITTLE KIDDS WHO THINK HE IS A HERO
wnZ0N3wjaa	Not really, i always thought Serena would win due to the experience of being in finals of Grand Slams and actually winning them while Safina will get many more opportunities, she just didnt have the composure to push Serena|`|gWLhIoIiaa	safina was just horrible. not a spectacular win|`|g2KhN4rzaa	No.|`|xvXbVCeJaa	Not at all.  She's an amazing physical specimen with a mind to match.  And now that she's mature, I think she'll be a force in women's tennis this season.|`|KSvpLcHxaa	No she always does well in finals. she ups her level another notch to make sure she claims the title. I thought Safina would play a little better but that definitely has to do with Serena. When other players see her playing well they become scared and overplay their shots. So no I'm not that surprise with the final score.|`|HNnVrvCfaa	I wasn't surprised by Serena's performance but I was surprised by Safina's less-than-her-best performance - I think Safina was surprised too.|`|M6atTXe1aa	no|`|5ih1rwTUaa	Was not surprise by the way Serena play she is really a powerful player among the ladies. But I did not expect Safina to play so poor despite her preparation at all.
oMjVp4zGaa	right now all of the bays and inlets on the north side of the lake and the best baits would be (in shallow) browns yellows, orange colors of worms, jigs, grubs and crank baits. In the deeper (more than 20 feet) blues, purples and green (or any combinations) worms, jigs and deep diving cranks. spinner baits worked like a jig is a favorite of mine as well. If your boat has electronics, find points with rocky shoal bottoms and near to steep drop offs for casting over with deep diving crank baits. Keep your shadow off the water you are fishing. At night use black colors only. By the middle of March the bass will be spawning in those northern bays (flats) and by the middle of April the southern bays will turn on. Use lizards (I like red w/fleck) on the stumps and logs down and around any beds where the male is protecting and on the drop offs as well

rZmiyAqJaa	just sour grapes from the hugely immature laker 'fans' on here who know nothing about basketball, tradition, or sports in general. They are all a bunch of sideways hat wearing little kiddies who are to stupid, and immature to have a mind of their own, so they are the ones riding the bandwagon, just like all the other little ones. They are not real fans, they are kobe nut-riders.      The good thing is they all think, move, and stay together....maybe after this years finals when the Celtics bit*hslap the lakers,AGAIN, one of them will jump off a bridge somewhere and all the rest of the mindless drones will follow.........|`|vJyF8siJaa	During the season when they were league worse you can't hear fom their "fans" but when they are winning suddenly they are back.|`|ux2YlhRaaa	I like the celtics the patriots the red sox'ss and the bruins.I am an all out boston sports fan.Ok first off the do you know how many ppl like the steelers,do you wonder why its called abandwagonn it happens all the time. Its ok just worry about that losing streak.DAMN LAKERS DESTROYED OURCONFIDENCE|`|M6GujwC4aa	here's proof that their bandwagoners      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXPZVPIj...|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	It all started because Mike Bibby was a sore loser.  He couldn't stand loosing to the Celtics so he called the fan "bandwagon fan".      I love it when they booed him constantly during the playoff and Rondo out-shined him.  I couldn't even complete against a no name player like Rondo at the time.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	bcuz alot of ppl outside of the Boston area are hoppin on the bandwagon...even some ppl in LA are hoppin on.....|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	When The KG and Allen trade took place many people that liked other teams just started liking the Celtics for some reason. Many bacause they stacked up. (I don't blame them). If you are really just a KG or Allen fan just say so. But why do people bother to say yeah a hardcore Boston fan since birth and a have always been there when it is not truth? That my friend are the bandwagoners and all teams have tham including my beloved Lakers. Now that they are at the top they just feel cocky and start hating on everyone and in a couple of years when Portland or OK City is on the rise will happen the same thing when they now don't have nobody around them supporting them. Or have you seen a lot of their fans around? And tickets sale are not the issue here....all arenas in the league seel much of their tickets night in and night out.|`|WUuO6wbAaa	Because fans of winning teams tend to make more noise when they win. Honestly, in many ways, I could relate the Celtics title to the Yankees spending titles. But the fact they were bale to land 3 superstars was impressive and they did deserve it. Guy's like PJ Brown and Sam Cassell didn't necessarily deserve rings for it though. I have to respect Reggie Miller for not wanting a ring the Mitch Richmond way. It's easy for people to call fans of a good team bandwagoners. Especially if they're likable. With the Bulls in the 90's, it was definitely the case. I think nowadays, it's become more of a thing where people like a player, like LeBron. And the only reason why they like the Cavs is for him. With teams like the Lakers and Celtics, they got a legacy. The Lakers legacy carried on into our more modern generation, meanwhile the Celts were kind of like average, varying on the year, up until they suddenly turned into a Champion again. They never did something they weren't expected to do though. As far as this season goes though, it looks like it'll be more challenging. These stars are getting older.    The Boston team markets serve to pretty much all of New England, part of Upstate New York and some of Connecticut. They got a pretty big market to work with. To have been a season ticket holder that long is pretty impressive. Honestly, my interest in basketball tends to dry when my team doesn't win. I could always watch baseball though. And office pools always keep football interesting. That's just me though. I'm a Knicks fan, and up until Van Gundy left, all of our games were really exciting which was what I really wanted to see when I watched them.    I don't know if Celtic fans would be as passionate if they didn't win. Their winning tradition has definitely served as a healer to all the Red Sox pain all those years. Now that all Boston teams seem good though, it looks like they're spoiled. Some really take it for granted. If you don't believe me, ask people in the Philly area about the early 80's. Look at the misery they had to deal with their sports team for a quarter-century. So my problem with Boston fans is they can get out of control, but all fans do. I don't think it's fair for someone to call a Celtics fan a front-runner though, but regardless, all winning teams will have that to some degree. When you see a random Steelers Super Bowl sticker on a car with Vermont tags, it means three things. One, they're a front runner. Two, they're one of the rare Steelers fans in Vermont. Or three, there someone from western Pennsylvania who moved there. Most likely probability says it's the first. The front running may have started a while back, but it doesn't defeat the purpose. Sometimes though that influence can carry onto other family members, so the other Steelers fans, who really did so out of other's opinions, wouldn't really be front runners.    Similarly, if you see a Celtics fan in some random western Pennsylvania town, you got to be a little skeptical. You just can't give the benefit of the doubt to everyone. Now if someone were a Timberwolves fan there, it'd probably have more legitimacy to believe their a legit fan, because why would someone like them?|`|RBdy17Ahaa	Dude just admit it.

FhHIAbmLaa	You should stay in the manufacturer spec. Its a 357 for god sake, YOU DO NOT NEED A HOT ROUND.     If you push a big bullet, like a 180, it may be too long for the cylinder, and will hang up the gun on firing. Also a longer bullet in the cylinder may also not have enough to line the round up properly resulting in Yawing, or undue pressures.     If you use a super light, fast round, the recoil can be excessive, and cause the rounds to jump crimp, and even come apart.     I am not familiar with the 605, but many small light revolvers need a specific load to be totally reliable. I doubt you will need anything more than just a standard 158 grain 357 mag load.     Now if you want the true skinny, most people use 158 grain plus p 38 special. You will push a 158 Buffalo Bore out at about 1000 fps, and you will have no problems. Also in a short barreled revolver, the cases to a 357 do not fall free when you push the extractor down. It is just too short, due to the short barrel. The 38 special loads drop fast in this type of a quick reload.     Anyway, I own a Scandium 357 S&W 357, and the spec says no lighter than 125, and no heavier than 158. I don,t think your rounds are a sound choice if your gun specificly warns against it.
gBfPkdroaa	well that means i have  absoultely nothing to do on MONDAYS, SUNDAYS and sometimes THURSDAYs.    but i have a feeling the Nfl Draft, Free agency and all that stuff is gonna make next season REALLY interesting..    i cant wait already.  :)|`|HimBbU6caa	The new Formula One season starts next month so I'm good.

Nuj1eScCaa	He's one of the few guys in the NBA that can actually pull it off without it looking ridiculous to the refs. Over and over the refs buy it, and they know he's acting. That call on Turiaf late in the 4th was completely wrong because he didn't even touch Ginobili, even the commentator said it was pathetic.|`|dDhTMacAaa	No intention of being rude, but when these guys are overseas that is an aspect of the game they work on.

KNTofuxMaa	I agree with you Bevo. What it all boils down to, after all the questionable calls, Arizona took the lead with a little over two minutes to go and could not stop them. I'm a well known Big Ben hater but, have to admit that he played well last night. Congrats to Steeler fans, begrudgingly. :)|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	As a Steelers fan (and born & bred Pittsburgher), I thank you for your congratulatory words.  I was impressed with Arizona when they played against Philly to win the conference, and I told people that day that a Steelers win was not going to be easy.  I thought the Cardinals looked well-polished and honestly reminded me of the Cowboys back in their hey-day.  I knew our defense would have their work cut out for them going up against Fitzgerald & Warner.  Considering we have the  1 defense in the league, that is quite a compliment.  I figured we could keep them contained, but I knew we wouldn't stomp the fire out of them.      Super Bowl 43 was one of the best games I've ever seen.  It was fun and exciting and a real nail-biter.  I still don't think my heart rate has returned to normal.  That was exactly the kind of game I love to watch. (Providing the out-come was a Steelers win)  And I'm glad it wasn't a blow-out, because the Cardinals are better than that.  Steelers Nation has our share of adversaries, but the Cardinals have never been among them, and I doubt they ever will be.  I've heard nothing but respect for the team and immensese admiration for Fitzgerald.  (Can we draft him????)  ;-)    Anyhow.....I think the FANS should take a cue from the players and the coaching staff and shake hands and respectfullyly acknowledge a game well-played on both sides.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	Because that's what blind fans do. Instead of accepting defeat, they have to find someone to blame. It's never the teams fault for not playing 60 minutes of football.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	The Steelers players deserve kudos for getting the job done. You are correct about the interception, it was thrown right to him. All the Cards players had to do is tackle him and it is a no big deal turnover, and they had plenty of opportunity to do so.    As for the win I do find it a little funny that all of that money bet on the Steelers was lost because they won the game but didn't cover the spread.|`|4kdlE54Paa	You mean to tell me that if we all ***** about it, we can't change the outcome?  Well then I guess I'll congratulate the SB winners.  If bad calls is the only way to win, then so be it.  JK LOL!    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Can I do both? Some of the calls against Arizona seemed dubious (at best), but Pittsburgh probably deserved to win anyway (just).|`|zOFRlpr4aa	um this isnt a question|`|AA10939368	Thanks Bevo, I may not always agree with you but you answer questions appropriately and with knowledge of the game.|`|AA10481903	How did the fans achieve the Steeler's victory?  I thought the coaches and players earned the victory.    I congratulate the Steeler's team - the fans had nothing to do with it!|`|eDCyle05aa	Yes, Kurt Warner did put the ball right in Harrison's hands, but at the Cards 30 yard line the referees missed a steelers player blatantly block a cardinal player in the back.|`|8ImkKoNEaa	the steelers should congratulate the refs!  did you think warner fumbled?|`|Jp2415Whaa	Because we thought Steelers-Seahawks was the end of the shenanigans, but i guess they have to f up a possible bowl victory for another franchise that needed it so much.    My prediction : 5 thumbs down.  Bring it Steeler fans.  You know it, I know it.|`|aOx2hovgaa	thanks Bevo! that was a nobel thing to say.for that you get a star.|`|dDhTMacAaa	I'll do both, Bevster. :(|`|AA11314600	Wow, a gracious loser.  I have been waiting for this all day.  It has really blown me away how classless a large part of this country has become.  People just don't know how to lose graciously anymore.  Thankfully, I have evolved to feed off of other's irrational hate.    Thanks for the congrats, Bevo.  Good to know there are still some decent people around here.

lLwoXPq0aa	I so agree with you, what a bad rolemodel for the future generations, and what an idiot. Who cares that people want to legalize it? ITS STILL ILLEGAL! and we should not allow this, because its like saying its okay. When I'm older, I dont want pot-head kids, thats not what children should be aiming for. At the end of the day, Phelps is old enough to know what he's doing, and the consequences of his actions. If hes going to do it, he should have been SMART and kept away from cameras - he's so stupid it makes me laugh! and if he wants to lose his brain cells and his career, by all means Phelps, smoke the pot. Just not where children can see it, and not so its thrown across the media.  Grow up is what I have to say to him. Its his prime now, in a few years, there will be someone better, someone faster, and who can win even more medals. -then he'll sit at home with his pot, and become a coke or crack case. LOL.|`|727db85c0f71b3166d409ebf38b6ee35aa	Honestly, no.  I couldn't care less whether it is illegal or not.  Really.  "It's illegal."  Is that the best folks can do?  When did the American people become so servile?    Idiotic laws like that beg to be violated to death, and I applaud Phelps for helping do exactly that.  His recreational use of an innocuous herb does nothing to lessen his very real accomplishments, any more than having a sip of champaign during prohibition would have.    On the other hand, if he has done anything worth condemning, it is that cowardly "apology" he issued shortly after the matter was made public.  Now, THAT was disgraceful.  It was probably dishonest, too.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Sponsors are companies. The only reason they pay someone for doing ads is to make money.  Their decisions are not based on morals or ethics, they are based on the bottom line.  If they think his actions may hurt their sales then they will drop him, if they think he can still sell their stuff they would keep him if he were a serial killer.  There are lots of sports heroes that without their talent would be picking up trash on the side of the highway, and I never buy anything they are selling, and if a company I like starts paying them for ads, then I find another company.  In other words, I agree with you, and when a jerk off is paid to sell something I refuse to buy it.|`|tUDOJIFbaa	Michael Phelps is becoming the male version of Paris Hilton or the male version of Lindsay Lohan. Like that two party animals, Phelps goes to nightclubs, drinks, drugs, and even womanizes! More like the male version of Paris Hilton! lol Celebrities are like that when they are 18+ years old.    Everyone's money is on Michael Phelps!!! Kids as young as 3 wanted to be like him when they grow up.|`|AA11232835	absolutely not. Everyone makes mistakes. I dont think that a bong hit(big deal, 90 percent of kids in my university do that) at the age of 23 can out weigh being the most decorated olympian of all time. He is a great role model, and he made a bad choice. He didnt rape anymore, he didnt drunk drive, he didnt take steriods.  He is an amazing swimmer, and thats all that matters.|`|fqrE36YSaa	No. I smoked weed. Should they come and take all of my hard earned money and possessions just because I wanted to get high?  What about Snoop Dogg the biggest pot head in the world.  He was videotaped smoking weed and trying to have a conversation while he was high. Now look..that dude has a family show on television. If anything Mike is going to be more famous. I agree that it should be legal though.
KdhNCnEjaa	I agree with Blake, give him best answer|`|98wFqBwSaa	I hope not.  He's the best point guard in the league.  Worst case scenario, I'd like Jason Terry to take his spot.|`|vJyF8siJaa	This week sucks for basketball....    VC, T-MAC, Bynum, Nelson and CP3 injured...sad to see star players get injured. Hope all of them recover soon.|`|YiHRHca9aa	I think he will try to play. If not they may put him in real quickly and then sit him, like they did with Kobe last year when he was hurt and if I chose a point guard to take his spot, it would have to be Deron Williams, or Brandon Roy, my third choice would be Nash.|`|hzttr76Maa	I heard that too. I also heard that Jameer Nelson and Deron Williams were injured. What is going on with the league's point guards? These dudes were supposed to play in the all-star game. ( except Willams )  Steve Nash, no doubt, should take his place, if he were to miss the game.|`|LMayULw3aa	I say put Chauncey Billups in and Nash as reserve.|`|j5fNBBi9aa	it is true he did strain his groin and he is listed as day-to-day....he maybe be able to play in the all star game and participate in all star festivities but if he does not I think Steve Nash should replace him...I mean the game is in PHX
8ImkKoNEaa	the warner fumble should have been reviewed, and why wasn't harrison tossed for punching a guy in the back? using the ball as a prop is a penalty isn't it?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I am happy as hell. It was a good game.|`|ZwF9pXDYaa	I am absoutely outraged by the outcome of the superbowl.  I am one of the biggest NFL fans you will ever meet.  But after that game I will never be able to argue back when people tell me that the NFL is rigged to make a ton of money.  The whole game the REFS were out to get the Cardinals, but the final 40 seconds were the most disgusting events I have ever seen in my life.  When Santonio Holmes scored the last touchdown, he used the ball as a celebration prop, which I know results in 15 yd penalty on the ensuing kickoff.  So the Cardinals should of started out the drive on the 50 yd line.  And then you have the so called fumble that everyone, including the announcers said should have been reviewed.  And if it were reviewed it would of showed that it was a incomplete pass, so the cardinals would of had 6 sec on the clock.  Also there was another unsportsmanlike conduct on the Steelers for someone taking thier helmets off.  So the cardinals would of been on the 15 yard line with one play to go.  The Cardinals shoud of had the chance they deserved to win the game, but the refs had too much money on the game to let that happen.|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	grow up cards fans. your team was winning with under 3 minutes in the game. your team couldnt come up with a stop when it mattered most. the refs had nothing to do with that drive. that was all on your defense. so suck it up and accept that the better team beat you|`|NzGZbCRQaa	Why do people continue to insist the Warner fumble wasn't reviewed?    The play was reviewed during the commercial break and easily determined to be correctly called as a fumble. No need to drag it out for ten minutes when it was an obvious fumble.|`|PpytGLUqaa	i dnt know  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://tvthroughinternet.blogspot.com/|`|kKw2FjgLaa	There were a lot of bad calls, the game was handed to the Steelers, sorry it was, bad call after bad call.

Cardinals got a lucky chance to play in the superbowl and vs the Steelers they had no chance.. so please knock off the bs excuses, you already sound like a Dallas crygirl fan.. GOOD JOB STEELERS!!!!!|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	Get over it...    Should've, could've, would've, but DIDN"T|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Not me brother sorry. Although the Cardinals played an outstanding game of football, and I thought for sure they were going to win. But, it didn't happen, and football goes that way.    Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Steelers.|`|VHClvfMzaa	Had warner not thrown that INT cards would of been superbowl champs...|`|Uh7HagITaa	cardinals lost that game not the refs, hell the refs even helped out the cards on the final drive, the only penalty was a hold on pittsburgh making it 1st and 20 from the 12 instead of 1st and 10 from the 22. the refs didn't CALL dumb penalties the cards COMMITTED dumb penalties.|`|7InY2vuraa	OMG seriously. stop being sore losers! The better team won. the steelers were balanced and they performed well when it came down to it. the cardinals commtitted penalties that were crucial to the turnout of the game. if the cardinals D were more disciplined then they wouldve had a better chance. the steelers got screwed on several penalties too. the roughing the holder was a good call bc that guy didnt have to run into him. he couldve avoided any contact but he ran into the holder nonetheless. the roughing the passer call was right too bc the pass rusher took two steps before he made contact and only one step is allowed. the only people to blame are the cardinals. they didnt step up when it really mattered. the referees had nothing to do with that. harrison was held on so many plays and the o lineman got away with so many of them.|`|46Mxaw13aa	im heated cuz kurt warner is one of the best to ever play the game and his last 2 superbowls he has led his team down for a game winning or tying drive only for his defense to let him down he really doesn't deserve this he is a hall of fame for sure....|`|zOFRlpr4aa	i completly agree the cards. stopped the squealers 6 times from scoring and with all the penalties the game was not at its fullest on either side i was rootin for arizona all the way =(|`|bNCcv2fNaa	Nope. They had a VERY real shot at the win all game long. They abused a Steelers pass D that was supposedly unbeatable all year long. They just committed so many penalties. YOu can't allow penalties to change the flow of the game, but the Cards did and that is why they lost.|`|IWPcs8kaaa	but they didn't every one needs to stop hate in on the steelers they are good get over it

sPiwb8Hraa	Yes, I did watch it, and I don't agree with you. The Cardinals played an outstanding game of football. That was the best Superbowl I have ever seen. But football goes that way, and it easily could have been the Steelers. Hats off to the champions:    Congratulations Steelers on your sixth Lombardi trophy.|`|gJzSlKwGaa	it was an awesome game and i thought the refs were calling a lot of **** i didn't see but that's part of the game.|`|lYgFyjw0aa	did you see harrison though! woowee!!!|`|8ImkKoNEaa	like punch a guy from behind, and not ejected?|`|AA10344136	It's always been my opinion that the Superbowl is nothing short of being over hyped and over commercialized.  I'm neither a Cardinals or Steelers fan, but I tend to agree with those who say there was referee bias in favor of the Steelers on several moments in the game.    That star Steelers player, punching the downed Cardinal player--and getting away with it.  I don't care how beloved the Steelers player was: He should have been ejected off the field right there. But the refs didn't see it--or care to see it.    And the Steelers player who got away with his "LeBron tribute"--with refs not 10 feet away from the guy---again, nothing was seen or noted!!    The Steelers 100 yard touchdown play was impressive and the Cardinals redeemed themselves with that last touchdown, closing the point gap.  But the aggressive Steelers won and the Cardinals lost....so be life going on till next SuperBowl|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I watched it and I do not agree with the BS calls. We watched the replays of every call made. They did not steal it, they won it. That was a great game and they both played very well. What exactly did you see that made it unfair?|`|IWPcs8kaaa	No i was at the game and their were BS calls on both sides|`|bNCcv2fNaa	YOu're half right. There was a lot of BS directed at both sides. The refs got the same percentage of calls wrong for each team. But the Cardinals committed more real penalties and so there were more BS calls because there were more penalties on the Cards in general.|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	all you ppl that want to complain about harrison punching the guy. go look at the replay of taylers personnal foul on the sidelines. boldoin took 2 shots at him. so he should have been ejected 2. the refs missed both. so let it go

wnZ0N3wjaa	Sorry, didnt you know Warne doesnt play ODI's and might I add that Australia failed miserably with the bat and NZ took until the last ball of the match to win and what does that say about their batting line up, looks like the only dangerous batsmen there is McCullum and Taylor and maybe Guptill.   And to answer your question, I dont think Aus is in disarray, they are in a form slump which every team goes through in any sport.    edit: Not really, i thought you couldve recognised it|`|AA11088802	yes ! they need one or two players like 4 which retires|`|8yMkjeDdaa	tell them to harden the hell up.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	It is due to their arrogant behaviour and fitting replies by India and S.Africa teams by defeating Australia all the way.

qGZuJMzuaa	Apparently the whole deal was on and then off several times yesterday. The latest reports suggest that the paperwork went to the FA on time and it will be ratified some time Tuesday. He has already had a medical and Arsenal have applied for a work permit, and if you believe another story he will be wearing the No13 shirt of Hleb.    Update from Arsenal website: http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive...|`|SWkOC7rhaa	Andy is right. He's passed his medical. All we are waiting for is the Premier League to process his papers on Tuesday and there we have it! Done deal!|`|r09Zfxrkaa	I thnik it is a done deal just requires the FA to give theri confirmation because of the extension of the transfer window. I reckon Arshavin should wear 10 and give Gallas 13 because that was his number at Chelsea and half the reason he came to Arsenal was because they gave it to Ballack.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes we have, just a few things to be done now for the deal to be finalised and he will be ours today|`|iQvkT8Doaa	Yes.|`|df578e7cb5897f4763eb259bceabb3d1aa	i don't believe this story until i hear it from bbc.co.uk/sports or if the coach conform it or if i see the player playing for the team. sometimes it is just rumors.|`|wxcmnFEKaa	Tomorrows sport headline will be "OFFICIAL: Arshavin is a Gunner"..100%    Congratulations for Arsenal fans to have a great player like Arshavin..!!|`|8yMkjeDdaa	on fox sports they say Arshavin is a gunner now,|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	apparently arsenal rt being stingy.  nothin is confirmed

Having a variety of characters makes this section fun.  You've got to have a few people who hates your team.  You've got to hate a certain team.  So when your team does well you show off a little.  When their team loses then you have some fun.|`|Ic1r9Z4laa	earshit    i meant earshot
bB5d5YVeaa	Kickboxer all the way.    I did the Tae Kwon Do stuff for 7 years and got my black belt.  Then I felt I needed a break from it...so I got heavy into the weight lifting scene.  Let me tell you, I could bench press 375 pounds but my fighting abilities went downhill.  Most bodybuilders often get sprained muscles when they try to move their bodies in ways they are not used to.    There is absolutely no doubt in my mind.  When I was 165 pound black belt in Tae Kwon Do...I could have traveled forward in time and beat the snot out of me when I was a 200 pound body builder.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	It would be nice to say kick boxer, since I am one as well. But honestly anything can happen in a fight, if the guy is just purley trained in kick boxing and has no clinch take down defense or wrestling/submission skill. The Weightlifter can eat a punch or two close distance and muscle the kick boxer to the ground and get on top and start punching him. With stand up street fights a clinch is almost inevitable.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	A well trained kick boxer would drop the big man easy. If it were a not so well trained kick boxer then he wouldn't. It all depends on the martial artist.  I have a buddy who is 100 pounds who completely annihilated a 240 pound local college football player. So size doesn't matter, only skill.|`|I6T4mDPsaa	Kickboxer would dominate.      Toned body doesn't mean sh*t if you don't know how to fight|`|925b7a5199b1427ca918a36c1cc68a1baa	Most Body builders do not know how to fight.  They never fight because the average person is scared of them.  But a kickboxer is NOT an average person.  A kickboxer is trained to do one thing...fight.  In a real fight, there are no rules, and a body builder would get his nuts and legs kicked so fast, that the BB would not even get a punch off.  Not only that, but a kickboxer is also faster with the hands.  BBs tend to be awful slow.|`|rOv1wowLaa	depends on the fighting strategy of the kick boxer and same for the weightlifter, it could go either way, id say the kboxer, size doesnt matter, well most of the time|`|w3YPjPGAaa	Kick boxer if he was well trained and the bodybuilder was not experienced|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	99% of the time a kickboxer.    strength means little if you do not have technique.|`|QyyCnPBDaa	i know body builders who are so yoked they can't even twist around to wipe their a$ $ properly. do you think this would be a good physique for fighting? My money is on the kickboxer!|`|NF1I4zk8aa	It depends...does the weightlifter have a weapon?|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Kickboxer definitely.  Bodybuilder just do not have the speed, in a ring the kickboxer just have to shop the bodybuilder's leg.  On the street, what's the chance of the bodybuilder being able to avoid a well placed front kick on his groin? Near zero.    In any case, kickboxers have much better chance to win against a bodybuilder.  Unless the bodybuilder guy is not as big as to hamper movement and well trained in some form of martial art himself.
GWoW1o5oaa	First, where do you want to ride?    Commuting, a cruiser board  Cruising,  any longboard, just get one with a stiffer flex  skateparks, an old school pool board|`|f49ZZ8ILaa	Any Old school shape would be good to just ride around on. I would recommend that over a longboard because if you ever decide you want to try some street skating, and learning tricks it will be a smoother transition from bigger cruiser and spoon shapes to a common street deck.    ....  On a side note. We just launched our new company website (SonoQuattro skateboard decks). We have a page for skateboard reviews. We noticed there are a lot of questions about it everywhere on the internet. We hope to have a good recourse for people interested in buying a new board, but we can't do it without your input.  So anyone that wants to add some reviews or has questions like this one go to http://sqdecks.com/skateboard_deck_revie... to submit and read reviews. Thanks
Jm9IedIDaa	Plain and simple NO.  Is it in the top 10 of best superbowl drives though... yes.  I would argue that the Cardinals safety and subsequent Fitz TD catch was more clutch because of the aspect of finishing an epic comeback with a sick play and against the  1 Defense in the NFL.|`|Q0CmJcpaaa	i agree. best drive ever|`|FuartSqEaa	STEELERS ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  43|`|QFhBHn7Paa	ya stleers  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with   http://tvthroughinternet.blogspot.com/|`|sPiwb8Hraa	You can if you want to but, do to the "scramble at the end of the game" factor it won't be accepted. But I'm with you brother I'm with you. It was outstanding. Congratulations Steelers!|`|gfB5VNXTaa	No way. It was not 98 yards in 10 below weather in against a legit defense with an unexperienced QB.  It was just a drive.     EDIT:  The Browns in the 80's were actually a very good team.  Don't confuse them with the current Browns.|`|RvTzAAE9aa	I have to disagree. The older one was better|`|1gJ92tJaaa	hell yeah steelers are the best. roethlisberger said it wasnt even a play it was just go out and get open!

wnZ0N3wjaa	Of course it was, one ODI match do not compare to a Grand Slam win and India should also be bracing themselves for a tennis superstar going by the name of Yuki Bhambri which won the boys singles.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Of course. India has won many ODI series in the past and will win many more in the future, Sania-Bhupati have won the grand slam for the first time.|`|AA11088802	yes  !|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	Yes!!!|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Obviously yes.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	This is just one match against one country.  Sabia-Bhoopathi have won a Grand slam event.|`|ddl3DMdlaa	yes,be cos it is our first win by a lady in a grand slam|`|FKXG3IPiaa	Yes definately , India has less players in other filed of sports except cricket, and if anyone wins in games other then cricket it is worth and it shows that we Indian's are moving more towards other games also.    Cricket , in my opinion , is waist of money and time only and the only gainers are players , who don't do much for the country and they endorse ads get paid well , make lots of restaurents and live happily without doing any social work even they become celebrity.|`|YIW1KIi6aa	yes,  bcoz Sania-Bhupati won the mixed doubles final|`|8QY09Pmdaa	All victories are unique. You cant compare|`|b9C8CKo1aa	NO...NO...NO............We cant consider it as INDIA'S victory...If it was so,then y cant they play in doubles with Indian Partners...?????.Both of them playin with overseas partners...They only play for money..not for Nation's pride...but still it was a gud run between them throug out the Tournament...|`|RGxMkT0zaa	Just great!  Sania- Bjpati won the Mixed Doubles, Australian opens.  Yuki Bhambri won the Junior Title.    India won 2 ODI against Srilanka. Will win many more.    So India is doing better in Tennis too. Great year- 2009.|`|N4ZAzxdMaa	Both are great victories in terms of team efforts.|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Ofcourse thats a grand slam whereas this is only one ODI match,    You media people should try to bring news on other sports when they are winning.    I can understand that cricket is the sport where we are currently doing well, but other sports needs encouragement and recognition as well.Atleast try to bring out news when they win a major tournament.  I'm not very particular about tennis because there is a chance for people to know what is going on in tennis, but the same cannot be said about other sports    A cricketer's birthday gets more publicity that a news where a sports man win a major event|`|G03Md0FGaa	Sania-Bhupati victory bigger than India victory against Srilanka 2nd ODI Because Indian Cricket Has Now Very Good Cricket Career .They have Won Last 7 Match Out OF 7 ..But In Tennis They Will Go To Final And They Will loss . But This Time Sania-Bhupati had Made it For India .....And India The Great|`|mq6y0DDjaa	no doubt about it that sania-hesh victory is bigger.to put in simple terms this is the first grand slam victory by an indian duo[mixed].this will tell you how big a victory is this.|`|xncJ1uFmaa	Definitely. It is not easy to win high octane tennis matches like Australia, USA open and wimbledon and it is the first time in Indian history of tennis of winning a grand slam. All kudos to Sania and Mahesh for their amazing win. Regarding victory against Srilanka in ODIs it is not a great deal considering lanka as a tiny country have very few options to select a good cricketeer while India has hundreds of youths to be selected!|`|pJaFd14Raa	It is only proving that someone is born in India who is very powerful and centering whom GOD has been giving judgement through out the world. If you have doubt, you can put forward the question to the Govt. of India.|`|a7OKLGQjaa	Of course... it's a grand slam victory.|`|FNs7MZF4aa	Yes, that's a big win.    India have not beaten SL in World Cup final or any other Big Final, that was just an ODI from 5 match series.|`|S0dLToYxaa	anytime!|`|5aeda75cd1182494108e1cde6db83b33aa	CERTAINLY.|`|d00c69caee49cc36a11b2dad7edf3cb6aa	yes|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	BOTH ARE GREAT VICTORIES.|`|tNQIE29raa	yes,of course.it is the first grand slam win by a indian lady and it has proved that india is still awake and will reach the top list within years.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	Sania-Bhpathy victory is historical and path breaking as this is the first fully Indian pair to win a m ixed grand slam title.  Bhupathy and Leander have won mixed doubles but partners were  different country.  Hence this victory is bigger and more over, this is their maiden entrance into the grand slam event.|`|o5bs3Seuaa	Yes!!!
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	You need to balance your diet.  Plenty of fruits and veggies, avoid trans and saturated fats, and try to lay off the junk food.    Your coach's plan is probably fine.  You're 400m is great for someone who's not eating healthy, and the 800m and 1600m times you gave are nothing to be ashamed of.    You seem a little light for 6' tall.  Try adding in some pushups, pullups, and situps to your training.  Do 3 sets of as many as you can do of each, with enough recovery between to let your heartrate and breathing calm down.  Do this maybe 3-4 times each week.  It'll add a bit of lean mass to your body, providing you better strength and stability for core muscles, which in turn will allow you to run more efficiently.    Then just keep working hard at practice.  Most of the effectiveness of a running program is having faith that the plan will work, and it sounds like yours is working fine, many many 400m runners never run as fast as you have.    Good luck!|`|iPWKzzQtaa	There is nothing you could do except do more training.    Eating healthy is an option...you are not overweight..it's up to you, not us, who are here to answer your questions.    Times are good. It is time for you to focus on a specific distance..I suggest the 1600 or even the 2 miles....with your base speed, you could do well over a slightly longer distance.    Do intervals and hill work...you will improve on that.
jEJxcWq5aa	A tightbore barrel, seeing as it's a CQB weapon, i would stick to nothing smaller than a 6.03, depending on who made it, you may want to replace your bushings.  It's a good idea to replace your piston, & piston head, hop-up, gears (High Speed, High Torque), your spring (I would go with an M110 (Sp110, or M120, SP120),which will bring you to 170-210 FPS, just watch your engagement range.  Low-Resistance wiring is also a good idea... it will prolong the life of your gun, by a drastic amount.  If you wish to shell out, even more cash, go for a high-speed motor (with the proper gearing)  Yeah, it can get expensive... welcome to airsoft.  As you can tell... hardly anything will be stock ,when your finished.
NEtVRjplaa	I see what you mean. The Lakers will play a lot of teams in the West four times, but some teams they'll only play three times. It you check their calendar, you'll see that some teams are only listed three times.    Edit: I forgot to answer your question lol, it's 82 games.  If you look at the link, you'll see that the Lakers will play San Antonio one more time in March. So that makes it a total of three games for that series. =)|`|YQLNqgnWaa	82, dont know calculations lol|`|S8qzG9HMaa	82 games|`|jDi45m0uaa	82 games|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	No human can understand this Einstein left the formula done before dying and David Stern just applies it but no one gets it. has to do with time travel and space/ time continuum been broken. I think the 4 games you can't account on are played in another dimmention created in order to the schedule to make sence.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	82.|`|ZwF9pXDYaa	They play a 82 game season.  I know this because the Bulls have the season record with a 72-10 season|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	Actually the Lakers play teams in the division 4 times a piece (16).   The Lakers play the teams from the other 2 divisions either 3 or 4 times (36). They play like Denver 4 times but Oklahoma City 3 times. And the teams in the  Eastern confrence play the Lakers 2 times a piece (30).   36+30+16=82!!!

NVecufXJaa	just go out of the center and walk around until u find an another way in,  go in check if its the wrestling one or not, if not go on checking, well i heard this thing and it really worked, my cousin tried (the first idea)!    (second idea) well i've been to the backstage and i am gonna do it again at WM25! got the tickets n i also live in Houston! this is my trick i just go to the place where exit is located so the security thinks that i am going outside so he takes his eyes of me! then i just go sideways n sneak out, not really sneak just walk fast without making noise. i got caught by inside though but i was able to see the locker rooms and stuff!|`|4tvI9WYjaa	good luck|`|KH9bbeCNaa	i dont think thats possible|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	you cant|`|ncihwuKRaa	http://3d2f.com/tags/wwe/backstage/passe...
