20090307080618AAjlQ6l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Not sure how to write this in a question so here is my situation .... opinions please?	I feel like the luckiest woman in the world finding my true love, and he is just perfect and we really want to have kids and have talked about it (my partner has had experience with kids before as his ex had two daughters, they weren't his though).      I am 22 and just coming to the end of my masters degree at uni and my partner is 29. I will be the highest income earner so we have decided that he will stay at home whilst I go to work (I will be a pharmacist) and he is always talking about being a stay at home dad and is really excited about it.       We have put off trying to conceive until i finish university, but then I decided to put it off till the end of the year as I will be doing a registration year and didn't think a child during that year would be that great, but now I am having second thoughts, I am really ready to be a mother and my partner so wants to be a father ... he is always talking about him and his little princess or little man doing stuff whilst mummy is at work.       I will have an final registration exam in june/july 2010 ... if you was me would you start trying sooner rather than waiting? Also we already know that my partner has low chances of conceiving unless he has an operation, but we want to give it a try before going down the operation route)

20090307084019AAjdMHA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ultrasound measurments VS LMP?	Ok this was my first question....      How accurate are ultrasound measurments?? Im 6 months now so I know it doesn't matter but im trying to understand it a bit better....      I was on the pill so I had a perfect 28 day cycle. And period that only lasted 4 days. But see my lmp dating is 12 days off from like 8 very early ultrasounds all done between 5 and 12 weeks. And they were done by different doctors/hospitals. So also different machines. And all of them are like 10 to 12 days off my lmp dating. So why could that be? And see now im 6 months and she is still dating the same... So from 5 weeks to 25 weeks she has dated 10 days ahead of my lmp..   BTW I got off the pill..right after my lmp.Im also asking WHICH IS MORE ACCURATE??      ********************NOW IM ASKING..if I could have ovulated later then we thought, or is it possible shes just smaller then "normal"      Thanks.

20090307082443AA8M2kd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this the End of me breastfeeding my 13-month old Daughter?	so two nights ago, I was putting my daughter to sleep (along with my son who lays in his bed and falls asleep while I breastfeed my daughter to sleep), and everything normal and then she decides to BITE me! She tried biting before but with a stern NO, dont bite Mommy and then I would put her on the floor and she would cry she didnt try it again...   This time, I unlached her from my breast and I did it quickly because it hurt and she screamed and pouted like she was scared and resentful.  I latched her back on and she BIT AGAIN!! and the same thing FOUR TIMES!!! then she was whining/crying she would look at my boob and cry and cover it.  Well  yesterday I breastfed her from the first side as normal and then when I tried to switch her over to the side that she bit she screamed and screamed until I stopped bedtime and pushed it off for another hour and she fell asleep breastfeeding.   Well last night I breastfed her from the first side and as I tried to switch over to the second and her favourite side, she screamed and screamed and I ended up carrying her and walking her to sleep...    during the night she didnt awake for her boob but I really dont want her to resent me and hate me!   should I just stop all together and create another bedtime routine, and now whenever I sit with her in out rocking chair she starts to freak out like if she was scared!

Today is day 15 and I have been late before because of stress but stress causes me to only delay for a couple of days I have never been 15 days late before my boobs are only a little sore and I am tired a lot but nothing really that's it and have been having spells of not feeling well, but I haven't been on birth control in about 2 years so I know that's not it and I haven't had any change in anything.

20090307082446AARBpGh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	...could your ovulation schedule stay the same even if your periods now were irregular?	I'm curious if anyone has the answer for this. If you use to have 28day cycles..very regular. And then after a miscarriage you have irregular cycles..could your ovulation schedule stay the same even if your periods now were irregular?      Another words, say your last period was 12/21/08 you ovulate between 12/31st and 01/10th. You still dont have your period on 01/18th. You ovulate again with out a period on 01/28th-02/7th.. You dont have your period again when 02/15th hits. Then on 02/24th it hits but your also ovulating between 02/25th-03/7th...is that at all possible/likely?

We offically ended it.. but lately it seems I would want for us to work things out and he would too. But he would say he doesn't want what I want at the min which is seeing eachother more than friends. Basically it would be like me waiting for him, which is something I think nobody wants to do. I asked him to let me go and he said he could but he doesn't want to b/c he still can see things that can be worked out. The thing is that I've been hurt and cried so many times & I don't think I can handle being hurt again.. & that he says things that get my hopes up, but he never acts upon his words.. How can I move on from him & how can he stop?? Things have been like this for 3-4 months. I feel like I'm so lost and I try to make good decisions but it's like a constant circle and I want to break free.

Also, I never have a father in the dream, I am just really happy to be pregnant. The most comforting part in my dream is when my belly grows, and I know it's getting bigger. In the end of my dream I never have the baby, I always wake up before hand. I am so confused.

20090307053347AAzUArU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	At what age would you tell your children about sex?	What if some one of the same age as your child told them before you? My eldest is 7, at 5 he was told how to have sex in graphic detail by a little girl in his class so I was forced to explain it properly to him and just the other day he was shown a picture of a women giving a man oral sex, again by another 7 year old girl. At what age do you feel is right to discuss these things with your children. I have an open relationship with my children and they can talk to me about any thing. I thought that around ten would have been a good time but i'm a bit angry that he has been exposed to way too much information too early. Why is it always the little girls handing him out the info. What is wrong with the world today?

20090307084555AAkB3i7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	9 month old baby's iron is a little low and Dr. wants her to eat cereal, but she hates it!  Does she need it?	My 9 month old daughter is breastfed, with about 5oz of hypoallergenic formula per day to make up for the shortage when I pump at work.  She just recently started eating solids twice a day (maybe in the last month) but she has always hated infant cereal.  She dislikes both rice and oatmeal, even with bananas added.  She will eat several fruits, and the orange vegetables.  However, she LOVES Cheerios, which is, in essence, cereal.  It looks like baby cereal and Cheerios have about the same nutritional values especially for iron.      At her appt they tested her iron level and it was just below normal.  She asked if we had started meats, and I said in the past week she had started eating turkey sausage, vienna sausage, and turkey lunch meat.  She told me that she needs the baby cereal and that's probably why she is anemic.  I tried again, mixing with other things, but she won't eat the baby cereal.  Is it even necessary?        She seems healthy to me, and she's eating the meat and Cheerios now on a regular basis.  She is a tiny little thing, only 16 1/2 pounds at 9 months, but she hits all her milestones and is very happy.  I eat a lot of red meat and take a prenatal vitamin, so I think my milk is okay.  Any one have experience with this?

Not only I gained a lot in the beginning, I had a really hard time losing the weight after I started to eat healthy, watch calories and exercise.

She is the sweetest person I know and had a short relationship with a person who is in the acting business. She has not informed him and she does want to either. he is in a relationship and it is a real mess I am afraid she might choose to terminate this pregnancy which would be wrong.   does anyone have any opinions and ideas she cannot possibly do this by herself but she would rather "give the baby up for abortion" than cause harm to the father's career or reputation.   why does woman always end up with the mess? I want to help her give her the right advice but have no idea what is the best option.

20090307054531AAji7nT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Who's mother drives them nuts now that you have children?	Ugh!! Sometimes i could just ring my mothers neck.       My mom and I always had a great and close relationship. Before i was pregnant with my first and with the exception of my teen years, she never ever annoyed me once, never got on my nerves, etc.       Now, all she has to do is open her mouth and i'm annoyed. She mostly annoyed me so much she would bring me to tears with her nagging during my second pregnancy. She always would repeat herself on things i already knew, etc. And kept on apologizing and said she didn't mean it, but yet kept on repeating her self. I felt as if she was enjoying making me cry.       And now, well ever since my daughter was born, she would tell me that i better do this, i better do that, etc. Just now, I told her that the redness on his cheeks may not be due to his teething, that we think that he has eczema and that we will be making a dr's app't on monday. Then later proceeded to say "well you better call the dr's" ugh!! I snapped right back at her.       Don't get me wrong, i'm open to suggestions and help, but it's when she tells me things i already know (common sense) or tells me what i should do or better do, (again common sense and i already know)      I feel horrible that i feel this way about my own mother, and especially when i still feel this way, when i have no reason too, i'm not pregnant and i'm sure all my pregnancy hormones are gone. But she still irritates me to the point i'm in tears. (we are under a lot of stress now, way far behind in our bills, in debt and now hubby is laid off)      SO, my question is after that long ramble, (sorry) now that you are a mother, does YOUR mother annoy you?       I just want to know that i'm not the only one that feels this way. :(

20090307060053AAxBZ17	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Which names, out of the top 100, do you dislike, and why?	 http://www.babynamestats.com/top100.html       GIRLS:   Madison, Alyssa, Makayla, Destiny, Trinity, Kylie, Mackenzie, Kaylee and Addison.  They sound very low-class to me.      Alexis.  Reminds me of dyslexia.      I hate the BR sound in Brianna, Brooke, and Brooklyn.      Nevaeh.  Screams low-class to me.      Taylor, Jordan and Riley are not 'cute' to me.  They are masculine.      I hate the sound of Aaliyah and Jada.         BOYS:   Christian.  I don't believe you should name your baby in faith.  I was almost given a name (Christina) meaning little Christian.  I was raised in church but became agnostic shortly after high school.  What if Christian grows up to become atheist?      Jayden, Brayden, Hayden, Caden, Jaden, Kaden.  Screams lower-class-and-unimaginative to me.      Caleb, Gabriel, Isaiah.  I guess I just don't like male Hebrew names most of the time.      Brady, Cooper.  Two very ugly last names.  Why make them first names?            I'm not here to hurt anyone's feelings, by the way.  I'm just taking a poll.  Soon will come one of names you DO like.
20090307072703AA4hStX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Pronunciation for Tricia?	I love how this name looks on paper but I can think of two ways to pronounce it.      Trisha?   or   Tree-see-a? (if you get what I mean)      I'm actually more fond of the second pronunciation, but I wouldn't want to change the spelling.      Think of it how Alicia has two ways to be said.

20090307064808AAYjBd5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What would be some reasons my daughter has a temp of 102 and not have any symptoms of illness?	My daughter was fine and active as usual all day yesterday. She even stay up a bit later than normal. My husband and I were up till 2am watching a movie, when it was over my daughter came out to us. She wasn't crying or anything, she crawled up into my lap and she was burning hot. I took her temp and it was 102. I called the nurse line and they asked me is she "vomiting, diareah, stuff nose, runny nose, congested, sick in any way" I said no not really shes fine other than burning hot. Shes not even crying. They said kids get fevers often and that it wasn't that big of a concern that if I want to bring her in I can. I opted not to cause she was so sleepy. I gave her children's motrin and the fever is down to a 100 but she is in a pretty good mood. Still no symptoms of illness like a flu or cold. Just a little subdued but still playful and cheerful. She's almost 2 years old now.
20090227133103AA1yOqh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents how do you "cut the mattress tags"?	For those of you who watch "ER" (which I finally got to watch on the TV last night *YAY*), how do you "cut the mattress tags"?       Okay, for those of you who are totally lost: Last night's episode of ER featured a couple who drove their car into Lake Michigan because their GPS told them to (silly, I know...but I do know people who will listen to their GPS even though they KNOW its giving them wrong directions just because they don't question anything). Dr. Morris encouraged them to think freely and "live a little", which he demonstrated by getting the wife to cut the tag off one of the mattresses. Yes this obviously lead to behavior that landed the husband right back in the ER, but it gave me this idea for this question.....      What do you do to question authority &/or bend or break the rules? How do you live "dangerously"?      *I'm really interested in hearing how some of you parents live it up!!*         Okay WTF?!

20090307064553AAiB4XD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I Need Help... My Husband sleeps with our baby!?	My husband sleeps with our 3-month old baby laying on his chest in the bed, on the couch and where ever he lays his head. She was born as a preemie and is a bit small for her age. He sleeps very strongly and does not manage her well while he sleeps. I have found her with her head hanging off the side of him, I've mistakenly rolled unto her in the bed once because she's fallen off of him during sleep...      I am very concerned for her safety and he WON'T stop sleeping with her. He likes to cuddle with her (it's our first child) but I don't think that he is being resposible. I've cried about it, I've begged and he won't stop doing it. He just told me to my face that he will keep doing it. What should I do at this point? He keeps telling me it's safe and I know it's not safe... I've heard of bad things happening and he always says that it won't happen with him. I have asked several times. I don't know what else to do.
20090227133647AAyOLH3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Will a Silvercross car seat fit in a ford sport Ka?	So I'm taking my friend and his 16 month old boy to the zoo next week and we are borrowing a car seat from his mum as he doesnt drive but she looks after the baby sometimes so she has one.      So anyway, I've been nagging him to find out what make and model the seat is so I can find out if it'll fit as I know not all seats fit all cars, but all he's managed to find out is it's a silvercross.      Any idea if it will fit? or where I can find out if it will?

My daughter is on a gymnastics team of 11 girls and one of the girls invited 7 of the girls to her party and left out 4, which of course resulted in the 4 left out being very upset. Well the mother approached me and said that she would have invited my daughter but her best friend on the team she felt would have a hard time affording a gift and she didn't want to put any stress on the family. At this point I asked her what she was talking about and she stated that she knew her father was a "mexican" working at at equine clinic.. At which point I became enraged and said" you are one dumb ********* he doesn't just work there he is part owner.. dumb *** he is a Doctor and I would bet He makes more in a month then your husband makes in a year, they just don't find it necessary to flaunt their wealth."  Was I wrong? I'm just so pissed I can't see straight And no I usually don't cuss but I feel It was warranted.
20090307064803AA7mEec	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	When will my kids (preschool age right now) start wanting to sleep later?	I have 2 preschoolers (2 &3) as it is, no matter what time I put them to bed, they always want to get up at 6 am. I've tried putting them to bed later, I've tried earlier (think maybe they're just over tired) nothing is working. It's not such a big deal during the work week since my husband leaves for work at 6, and I'm up anyway, but come the weekends, we'd like to sleep at least until 7 (wishful thinking I know). Also, the 3 year old takes NO naps, and my 2 years old will sleep for about 1 hour during a nap from like 1-2 in the afternoon. How late do other people put their kids this age to bed, what time do they wake up, and at what age can I expect them to sleep in just a little longer (or is that not going to happen until they're teens...)?

This morning, I was getting something out of my younger childs room while he was asleep.  I quietly opened the door and tried to sneak in.  Just then, my older son SCREAMED at his sister becuase she took something away from him. 7:00 in the morning.  I can't take it anymore!  I'm a single parent and I NEVER get a break.  I love my kids more than anything but no matter what I do...spank, time out, ground them....it doesn't get through.  They WONT mind.  I feel like a total failure.  They push me and push me until I lose my temper and we all yell at eachother then it starts all over again.  My oldest son is the most stubborn person I have ever met.  I'm beginning to wonder if he will ever mind.  I'm worried about what's going to happen to him.  Everyone says you just have to make him mind but I do and he wont. I'm at my wits end!  I feel hopeless in this situation!  He’s involved in sports, church and school.  He has friends.  We have our own apartment.  For a single parent family, he’s got things pretty good.  He’s always saying how he hates his life and hates his younger sister.  Is this normal??? Help!

We are very dissapointed that you let yourself get rapped. We should disown you." meaning they wanted me to get an abortion and are blaming the whole thing on my. (i was at my bff's house while her parents were gone having a sleepover. her parents knew i was going to be their and my parents knew that her parents wern't gonna be home. her bf and a whole bunch of people  came and partied. he rapped me. After i left and to the hospital.) I was all for the abortion at first. I have plans in life that don't include a baby. But then i missed all the appointments my parents set up. I want this baby. I talked to my older sister, she is in Med school and her husband is a dr. she said she will help me in every way possible. I approached my parents about keeping the baby. They said." No way in hell!" My little sister was listening and said, "I won't have a crying snot nosed rape conceived baby in my house!" My older sister said I could live with her and keep the baby do online schooling and get a job. btw i am 16. she is 22. her husband is 25.

I've also tried Norah Nicholle, Catherine Nicholle and Lilian Nicholle (other favourite names of mine) but nothing really clicked.      It's a family name (my sister to be precise) so I'm not changing the spelling.  The whole meaning behind the name is lost if you change the spelling.  Having grown up with that name, I happen to think it's prettier anyway.      I don't like masculine names - so please don't suggest them.  I'm not a big fan of anything too wild and crazy either.

20090307085105AA0CL7I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do you think about this? Is this depression or what?	I'm 14 and I think I might have depression. Although I did realized before that I suffer from on-and-off blues, my friends, my Mom and even my teacher think that there is something wrong with me.       Sometimes I just feel so sad, lonely and misunderstood. I'm always unhappy with my life and myself. I feel as if there is nothing special about me. And I'm not pretty, I'm not skinny and I'm feel like I'm no fun to be around. Worst of all, next year I have to go high school and I don't want to go because of these two boys that a year older than me always used to harass me last year (touching me, saying bad things to me) and it wasn't as big of an issue back then, but now I feel so scared because I feel as if there isn't anybody to help me or defend me at all if I ever encounter them again. And only a few of my friends know about it, and I always used to play it off like it was fine because I was embarassed to come out and say how I really felt about it.    And I'm also fed up with school because whenever I try to do good, I always end up doing bad. I'm just fed up.       I know that usually there must be a big event in somebody's life that causes them to be depressed, but really, for me it's just like the small things add up to make me feel so bad and sad about myself. Do you think I really have a problem or what?

20090307082728AAyuXzv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Social workers for CPS.....?	I hear a lot about people who foster for the stipend.  I went to my first foster care class Wed night and was told the stipend was less than $500 per child (we will consider taking 2 if they are siblings), so fostering is hardly a way for us to make a living (and not our reason for doing so).  My question is, does social services or CPS question foster families that take in a large number of children, especially if they are not a sibling group?  Is there a limit to how many you can foster at one time?  Just thinking about the Gravelles, it seems like a huge tragic oversight.  I know there is a shortage of families, but it would seem like to me, these kids need some individual attention and I don't see how a family that fosters a bunch of kids can provide this.  I understand physical needs must be met first and foremost, but how far of a second is meeting emotional needs?

Also she has started passing stool on alternate days.  Earlier it was everyday. We follow all the advice regarding positioning for acid reflux but nothing works.

20090307085319AAW1fc4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My mom has become an overbearing Grandma?	When my mom initially found out I was pregnant, she was anything but excited for me. She simply wasn't "ready" to become a grandma. 9 months later...she's overly obsessed with this new title. My son is now 8 months old and she seriously acts like she's his mother. It drives me insane. She even sometimes says, "Come to mama...I mean grandma!" She doesn't exactly tell me what to do, but she hints at a lot of things. She stops by without calling to see him, teaches him naughty tricks because it's apparently "in her title" and lets him do WHATEVER he wants. It worries me sometimes because I worry he's going to eventually gravitate towards her more than to me, his mother. I've told her a couple different times how I've felt and she always apologizes and says, "I just love him so much." So then I kinda feel bad. When we're out and about she's the one taking him up to other babies and talking with their parents while I am left in the background. Is it just me, or is something wrong with that? I feel like she just runs over me to get to my son. My sister is getting married this summer and she's made it clear on MANY different occasions that she's going to have him with her all night long because they're going to be dancing partners. I want to say, "No mom, he will be with his mother." She's a lot more aggressive than me and I somtimes thinks she takes advantage of that because she knows I'm not going to get in her face about it. Anyone else going through this with a new grandma? Any helpful suggestions?
20090307074943AAJi7sn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am so scared. I need some people to answer honestly without judgement. What are my chances?	Long Story.       Feb 8- I took Plan B because i was scared that when I gave my bf a hand job that he could have gotten cumon me.      Feb 13- I got a really long heavy period      After that my bf and I still pleased eachother but i was really cautious of where he came, and i always cleaned myself immediately after. I know there are still risks with that though if *** got on his hands.      We just started having sex a week ago Feb 28th, we have been dating for 6 months. I have been on birthcontrol for over a year now and he always used a condom (without it breaking)      I just went to the GYNO 2 days ago and everything was normal on my pap, but now i am scared i might be pregnant. My nipples are really sore and when i woke up this morning i had light pink bleeding. my period isnt due until thursday! Can Plan B cause my period to come early the following month, or could the pap cause late effects.      What are the chances i am pregnant?

I have been on the pill and told him, so we have not been using protection. I forgot a few days of pills and didn't tell him. We had sex and now im pregnant. He is pissed at me and calling me a liar and saying I snuck around and did it on purpose.     I have wanted kids forever and he doesn't want kids.

I have never really used it..      Since my baby is only 2 weeks old i want to make sure Im using the right technique & the best bottle to eliminate bubbles.      Right now i am giving her 2 ounces of similac. 2 oz water with one scoop then i mix it with a small spoon. The lightly move the bottle around. Then wait a couple of minutes.      Im using the Soothie bottle w/the green nipple because its big & round so i can mix it better. Im not sure if that bottle takes out bubbles or not.      Can any recommend a good bottle to use that takes out the bubbles.   Do those smaller bottles mix easily using a spoon or is it not wide enough? Im stressing myself a little because i dont know which one to use.      Would shaking the powder & water together really hard be the same thing if i let it sit for 15-20 minutes?..       & if u mix it, about how many times do u mix it? I count to 30-40.

I tend to over-react when she gags on food, and I almost immediately assume she's choking. Technically I know the differences between the two..but I think when I see my daughter do something I immediately freak out and assume she's choking or will choke. What exactly should I look for and when should I worry? Is it OK if she gags on food repeatedly, how long should her gagging last....ect ect. I know this is all a normal process of babies learning how to swallow and protecting themselves from food that is too large, but boy-oh-boy it makes me nervous!!

But when she hit 9 months or so she started waking up through the night.    She goes to bed at 7pm wakes up at 1am, then 5am then 9 she gets up. Sometimes she wakes up more than that and she only wants the bottle once at 5 am, any other time she isn't hungry.      The thing is she will wake up, is obviously tired but will just cry until shes out of bed...I thought it maybe teething but she does it even when shes not having a teething period....

Her mom (my sister) just had surgery on her arm so she can't work......(she is a single mother too,of 2 girls). My niece says that she wants to try to get a job to help her mom out but there really isn't much she can do. She doesn't have a car, and she has to go to school from 7;00am-2:30pm. She wants to babysit and i think it's an awesome idea because she is awesome with kids. She has watched my 3 year old twins (me supervising). She has checked on craigslist to see if they're are any job openings but they are all want the babysitter to watch the kids in their home, she is not comfortable with that and i don't blame her. Do you have any suggestions? I find this really sweet but i don't know what to tell her.   So here are the questions:   1.) Moms with children (or anyone) would you let a 13 year old babysit your children?    2.) Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated (and most likely chosen as best answer)      Thanks in advance....   Autumn<3

20090307092415AA9oXyR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	A question about fathers and how they raise their children?	I would love to get perspectives from women and men on this one. I have a six year old step-daughter. I've been the only constant mother-figure in her life for about two years now. I'm a stickler about making sure she eats healthy, takes regular baths, and has clean clothes. Well, lately Daddy has taken over a lot of these tasks in an effort to get me to relax because I've been over-exerting myself and I'm 33 weeks pregnant.       This morning they let me sleep in. When I got up I asked if my step-daughter had eaten breakfast and he said "She's eaten." Then she started saying her stomach hurt really bad. After hearing her complain about it for a little while I asked him what he'd fed her and he said "Pie dough and pudding." He buys pie dough and eats it raw as a snack.       I was shocked. How could he think that's a healthy meal for her? He kind of laughed and said "What do you expect? I'm a dad." That's his excuse for so many things, why her hair doesn't get brushed before bed, or why it's okay to let her wear a skirt to school in 30 degree weather. It's as if he thinks just because he's male he shouldn't have common sense!      So my question is what do the father's in your lives do when it comes to children? Do they seem to have common sense or do they play the "dad doesn't know what he's doing" card?

20090307092607AAKHzd8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it normal to feel my baby kick so low in my belly ??? HELP. 18 weeks pregnant!?	I am 19 weeks pregnant on Sunday and have a very active baby. S/he moves throughout the day but mainly at night. But the thing is that I feel the baby moving very low. Sometimes I feel like it's poking my cervix? It's like an internal feeling. But most of the time, I feel him tapping and rolling around just above my pubic bone. Shouldn't I be feeling the baby move towards my belly button since I'm almost 20 weeks???      I'm scared the baby might be breech! Help! Any stories or advice would be nice!      Thanks in advance!
20090307091706AAkShMY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do you think happened to her? And is there anything I can do?	My best friend went to walk her dog four days ago and never came back. The first day she was missing, no one cared. Not even her parents. The second day, they just said she ran away. Which is stupid. If she ran away, she wouldn't have taken her dog with her. And she would've taken her old phone. not her current phone. A lot of people still think she ran away, but me and her best guy friend know better. Something happened. She's not answering her cell, and the police can't track it. The police aren't even investigating it much! They're just shrugging it off as another teen runaway. But today, I got two texts from her from a number I don't know. One said, "its meg im okay but he'l" then it got cut off. So I think someone...whoever took her, came in. So she had to press send. The next text said a few minutes later, "whoever you are, you better give up." I took it to the police, and its untrackable. They can't frickin track it! She could be anywhere...I'm so scared for her. Is there anything else I can do? At all? I have to do something. I can't just sit here and wait for the crappy police to find something.

Hey ladies... first off i'm on CD 18, and this is my first month charting my BBT, my temps are always pretty low, like mid 96's, and yesterday and today they were lower 97's, which my chart says that is coverline. I know you actually ovulate before your temp peaks, but i'm experiencing slight ewcm. I started taking EPO this cycle and i'm pretty sure its helped because my ewcm is none to a little bit. So... is this mornal to have ewcm during peak temp? Could i be ovulating now? If it makes any difference i had a yeast infection this month, and am taking medicine for it, could this be causing the ewcm? Thanks ladies and tons of babydust to all those ttc'ers! :) xo

This teacher knows some really personal things about me and I can talk to him when I need to but now I feel like it's going to make things really awkward because he'll be my brother-in-law. And at school I'll have to call him "Mr -" but then at home it'll be like "hey (name)".      I've tried talking to my sister about it but she thinks I'm being too much of a drama queen about it.

Now don't think i am a horrible person but my wife is 6 months pregnant and we found out that our child will be retarded. I asked the doctor if the baby will ever have a normal life. He said no that the child would never be or act normal. And it would be expensive to have him as a son. I've told my wife that i don't want the child and that she can have him but we should give him up for adoption. My wife doesn't want to! I don't want to leave my wife but i just can't have this kid! I never felt comfortable around retarded people. I just can look at one every day and know thats my work. Someone help! what should i do! I am not a bad person its just how i feel!!!

20090307093955AAkCv3o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Positive & Helpful Suggestions?? The AF has arrived once again:(?	Hi Ladies:)      Once again to my surprise, my AF has arrived right on time:(    As I have answered many other TTC questions, what could be the problem:(? (As I should know this answer to this question? right?) We did everything right this time around.    This was even my first time using the Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor. We TTC/BD on both HIGH PEAK DAYS.       Do you think we should try before the High peak days too? I thought that the best times to TTC is waiting for the two high peak days which is supposed to maximize your chances.   Pls share any experiences that you had using the fertility monitor.      Once again, I had blood work done tested my levels & for diseases-which all came back GREAT. Just one time I had borderline low progesterone &  than was retested again the following month & was great. So, is this a probelm?   My husband also had a semen analysis done too, came back excellent.    My OBGYN has me on prenatals since last year. My weight is great & I eat healthy, dont smoke nor drink.       I guess it is just not the right timing yet? My husband & I have been married a year n a half now & we both are soooo excited & cant wait for a baby. All of our friends are pregnant either with their first or on their second. It is so hard. I am truly happy for all of them, but am getting slightly frustrated:( I also believe, my husband is getting a little frustrated too. Every month we are so hopeful than the wicked witch AF arrives. I guess all we can do is keep trying & hope the next month will be a lucky one:)      I am thankful for so many of you on here who always give great advice or helpful suggestions.    What would you do?       Sending TONS of BABY DUST & sprinkles to all TTC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I hope many of you will get your BFP....XXXX

He is really excited about us starting a family soon and talks about what he will do with his little princess / little man when the time comes ... he is 29 and very hard working but because I am the one with the career and significantly higher income I will be the one that carries on working.       I said he was excited about the thought of being a stay-at-home dad and got the response that it was just becuase he thinks it is an easy ride ... in my opinion I think that stay-at-home dads should be commended, not immediately doubted, I know my other half well, he is the sort of guy that does the housework before I have even said anything.      what are your opinions on stay-at-home dads?       i know it is more conventional for mum to stay at home but we want to provide well for our family and i would rather go to work and support and have my kids at home with daddy than in daycare

OK, I start my period on the 7th of every month. It is never late. I am trying to conceive and I took a pregnancy test 2 days ago and it said Negative so I assumed I would start my period today, however I didnt. So I began to get a little bit excited thinking maybe it worked. Then my friend said It would come on the 7th this month because last month was shorter than others. That it would come maybe around the 9th?? So my excited quickly faded! So my question is if that really happens. If my cyle would come later because last month was shorter or If I would start on the 7th as usual regardless of the days in the month. PLEASE someone help me with this! I just want to know if There is a chance or if I will probably just start late. Thank you!

20090307094421AA93IEM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Do PAP that ask strangers if they can adopt their baby think they are helping the baby?	I am just wondering what people that walk around stores and other places think they are helping a baby by offering to adopt it. I mean apparently the child that is with the parent doesn't intend to adopt the child out if they are buying groceries for the child or buying clothes for the child. I think that clearly shows that we are spending money on our children to provide for them.      Are some of these people already with an agency trying to adopt? Or is it that babies are so cute people just want to take them home. I mean do agencies plant these people or do they just really want a baby?      I hear a lot of people on here say they want to help babies by adopting them. Well what do you guys think about people that clearly see that young women are buying items their babies need like groceries, diapers, and clothes. Does that scream help me by adopting me. I don't see any neglect taking a baby to the store to buy things you need for the baby and house. Do you?
20090307091355AAeaiRb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I need advice??????????????????	Hey everyone!  My friend is really mad at me for something I didn't even do!  This is what happened.  So yesterday, I noticed that my friend had a huge chunk of gum stuck in her hair.  I told her, and everybody in the class started laughing(including me).  So she went to the bathroom, and I guess a teacher was able to cut it out of her hair for her.  But then after she came back, she started getting all mad at me and my two friend saying that we did it, we put gum in her hair.  Well, of course we didn't, so I suggested that maybe she took gum out of her mouth, and then forgot she had it in her hand, so she accidentally put it in her hair.  Now she won't talk to me because she said that I'm telling everyone she put gum in her hair!  I have told her that I am not telling everyone she did that, I just suggested maybe she did it by accident because no one else did.  I'm really upset amd I don't want to loose a friend over something so stupid as gum in her hair.  10 points for the best answer, and thank you in advance!

He has been doing it ever since people started accusing him of liking me. He always I-Ms me first, he talks to me everyday, tells me everything, and even invited me over his house once. Plus, i walked passed his house once with my friend and he ran passed 5 houses to give me a hug. I also found out that he talks about me to everyone. He definitely doesn't act like he hates me at all. But he wants me to think he does. And I'm almost starting to believe it. What do you think? thanks

20090307093457AAsaWzS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	7 year old girl problem!?	I overheard my 7 year, Beanie, talking about some boy in he class. She's only in 2nd grade and I know the teacher wouldn't allow it, it's a good school, but she was saying that she kissed this little boy in her class at snack time. She was with her friend and I was making them lunch and she started saying "He's so cute so I kissed him on the cheek and...." I pretended I didn't hear her but she's growing up so fast already and I don't think it's appropriate for her to be kissing boys, even if it's on the cheek. I told her that I don't want her to be doing that already and she said ok but when I was chaperoning for her school's Field trip I saw her with a little boy, holding his hand. When I was 14 I lost my virginity and I'm ashamed of what I did back then. I'm worried that the same thing will happen to my little girl when she's older. I want to stop this but whenever I talk to her she tells me she will...but she doesn't. Am I overreacting?

20090307090857AABxW2i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Today my period was supposed to start, it hasn't yet and I just feel prego.... When should I test?	About two weeks ago I started getting random light nausea and headaches, mostly in the mornings. For the first week I had the WORST time sleeping, I was exhausted but kept waking up every 30mins to an hour. The second week (this week) I have been able to go to bed early with no problems and sleep forever with no interruptions. I have noticed a slight increase in urination and vaginal discharge (white, no smell), had a couple days of diarrhea and my breasts are slightly tender to the touch, but only on occasion. I have also had a few days where my emotions were on a roller-coaster. My lower abdomen feels a little swollen inside and closed up(if that makes sense) I am 20 years old and my last period was Feb. 7-11. My husband and I were active before, during and after my ovulation. Could I be pregnant and when should I test?

On with the good stuff...my hubby and I bd on  February 11, 15 18, and 22. I ovulated on the 20th so I think I did good lol.

Last night I checked my cervix, and it was low but soft and my cm was a light brown and white color.  Is this normal?      Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Good luck and baby dust to all!
20090307091224AA0U9ca	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	We are still struggling with breastfeeding please help x?	Hi all, I have been breastfeeding my youngest since birth, now seven weeks old, we are still struggling to get her to latch on we have to use nipple shields to aid her to latch on and we have been supplementing her feeding with formula to up her intake whilst (we hoped) she got the hang of it, but she hasn't so far.       Now we need to make the decision to change over to bottle for the majority of her feeds. I want to try to keep my milk supply available in the hope that as she gets older she will improve her sucking reflex's and we will be able to exclusively breastfeed again.       Does anybody have experience in this or have any ideas of ensuring that I can keep my milk supply whilst using formula as a main feed. I wondered if it would be the same concept as when you wean and only breastfeed in the morning / evening??        Any help really appreciated  - i really dont want to stop feeding her myself x

The other night I was sniffling a little because I have a runny nose from a cold, next thing I know my mom knocks on the door and asks me what I'm doing. She said that she thought I was doing "bad things", like cocaine I guess. I would never do that though. She then said that she was worried about me and that she knows that I smoke pot. But she still lets me stay out till 12:30 on the weekends even though she knows all of this. I was never even aware that she knew, it's been going on for about 6 months and she's never said anything. We talked later and she said that she knows I'm smart and safe about it, so as long as I keep it in moderation, she doesn't have a problem with it. To me that sounds pretty uncommon for parents. So, parents, how would you feel if you knew your child smoked pot? What would you do?      And please don't get sidetracked and lecture me on smoking, just stay focused on my question please. Thanks.

I know I should feed my 2 month old for at least 40 minutes at each feeding but some times she will feed for 5 minutes and fall right asleep on my breast. Should I be waking her up and try to keep feeding her or should I just let her sleep and wait until she wakes up again?
20090307102029AAUgBlm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	12 month old throwing food.?	My 12-month old son has gotten into the habit over the last couple of days of throwing all of his food on the floor.  Up until two days ago, he was a fantastic eater..meat, vegetables, fruit, bread....he ate pretty much anything I put in front of him.  He got an ear infection and ever since he's been on the antibiotic (not sure if it has anything to do with it or not) he throws his sippy cup and any food I put in front of him onto the floor.  It is so frustrating!  I only put a small amount of food (one or two bites worth) in front of him at a time at every meal but onto the floor it goes.  I give him two chances.  I say "No" and if he throws his food twice, I take it away. I've resorted to spoon feeding him so that he at least gets something to eat but I certainly don't want that to be a habit.  Help!!
