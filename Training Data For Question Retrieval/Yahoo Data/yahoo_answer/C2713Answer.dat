wjwsFPMuaa	Well..haha...not so much. He has grown to love my dog but is very hesitant when a new animal comes into the house. He still hasn't adjusted to my new cat Angus..though he's getting better.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say he doesn't like animals though. He was just NEVER allowed to have any as a child. He had NO pets at ALL for his entire life. So it was quite a whirlwind when we got together 3 1/2 years ago. I told him we would have a dog and he whined about it but I only took it with a grain of salt because I knew that not even HE knew if he really liked animals or not. <br>  <br>  So far he is proving to be the typical guy...loves the dog but not so crazy about cats.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	My husband loves animals.  He even sits and feeds my goats cookies while I milk.  He willingly sleeps with several chihuahuas situated in bed with us each night, and pays for all the shots, tags, food, etc that comes with animal care.  He even smiles at the confused roosters crowing at 2am.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Thankfully, yes my husband shares my love of animals.  He too knew what he was getting into....LOL|`|ktC40jtXaa	Well i am very happy now that my husband does. He never did before, he never grew up with any pets or animals, and me on the other hand always had dogs and cats, also some other animals such as chickens, ducks,  raccoons, ya a bunch of animals. Anyways, he never could get why i was so attached to dogs all the years that we were dating; i mean he would pet our dogs and throw a ball for them, but never really cared much for dogs. Well since we got married 3 years ago, i told him that we were going to get a dog, and he would have to get used to it...LOL<br>  <br>  Well now, he tells me all the time that he doesn't know what he would do without our dog. He just loves him so much. He said he would always want a dog now. So that makes me very happy :)|`|uTIgyCCHaa	He loves dogs, but of course not *quite* as enthusiastically as I do =)<br>  <br>  Before we were living together I worked at a vet clinic and brought home a cat that was brought in as a stray (he is allergic to cats so it didn't go over so well).

Our love of animals also includes goats, we have 4 nubians including a 2 month old buck we just got today. Yep, we are pretty well evened out on the whole animal thing.

3d4XE1Keaa	What exactly are your work hours?  How long are you gone?  Puppies (as well as adult dogs) really benefit from a consistent schedule.  Going outside at the same time, eating at the same time, etc.  It *really* helps with house-training.  As long as you can keep a puppy on a consistent schedule, it really shouldn't matter that you work the swing shift.  If you have other people who can stop by to let the puppy outside, that would be a huge help.  As a rule of thumb, puppies can "hold it" one hour per every month old they are.  So a 4 month old puppy should be able to go 4 hours before it becomes an emergency situation and they *need* to go out.  Of course, this is assuming they didn't just drink a whole bunch of water before bedtime.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you want a dog but your schedule is a little funky, consider looking into Yorkie or Westie rescues and adopt one who's a little bit older.  House-training would be much easier and they might already be used to being alone for a little while during the day.  And adoption is much more rewarding because you're saving a life.|`|UW9Trvrpaa	If you do not have time to take care of a dog, please do not buy one. It would be quite un-considerate.

Puppies can't be left alone for more than 3 hours (small breed) to 5 hours (large breed) - MAX. How would you even housetrain it? A puppy can't go eight hours without going to the bathroom!<br>  <br>  If you really want a dog, then adopt an ADULT through a shelter or rescue. One that's already housetrained.|`|B1iJTtUbaa	i just read in a dog book that if you are getting a new puppy you should take a week off of work!!! this shows all of the time and commitment needed for a small puppy. maybe you should wait until your job will allow you to have more time for your dog.
0Ma01svvaa	is your puppy eating or drinking? if so, give him some sugar water or goat milk quickly. If you have an emergency vet, give them a call. This could be hypoglycemia, AKA low blood sugar. As surprising as it sounds, when a creature's blood sugar level drops too low, mild to moderate nausea is a symptom so even though they desperatly need to eat, they don't want to. The lethargy fits right in there as a main symptom. Does your Dog seem dizzy or disoriented? If so, just plain GO to the emergency vet right away. Even if not, get a quick start on fixing this. <br>  <br>  i wish you good luck, hope i helped, and i hope that everything will be okay. :]]] be sure to monitor him/her and observe any of continuous unusual behavior.|`|R3glUmwHaa	If he has played a lot today, that may be the cause because puppies need their rest as well as their play.  If I were you, I would just watch him for anything abnormal and take him to the vet if anything weird starts happening or if his activity level hasn't improved in a couple days maybe.
AA11962013	Yes, but I have worked as a vet assistant, and I have founded my own animal rescue - you see, I channeled my anger into something positive, and the experience that I gained as a vet assistant has served me very well.  I think you would gain more than you would lose if you go ahead and jump in there and learn everything that you possibly can.  Best of luck to you.|`|LURQBU86aa	I work at a vet's office and love my work. The only part that I don't enjoy is when an animal has to be euthanized. It isn't that hard if the animal is old and suffering, but it is still sad. Working at an animal shelter animals are euthanized because their time is up and I don't think that is something that I could personally handle. It is also terrible though when an animal from the local animal control comes into our clinic because it was hit by a car, or abadoned by its owner and is now suffering or starving. It makes me very upset, and I think that working at the actual animal shelter would be even harder.|`|0zriLTZXaa	I would feel the exact same way. I take in strays from around my house.

Guppies prefer water temperatures of about 27 °C (82 °F) for reproduction. The female guppy has drops of between 2-100 fry, typically ranging between 5 and 30. From the moment of birth, each fry is fully capable of swimming, eating, and avoiding danger. After giving birth, the female is ready for conception again within only a few hours. In fact, guppies have the ability to store sperm, so the females can give birth many times, after only once breeding with a male.<br>  <br>  Young fry take roughly one or two months to reach maturity. In the aquarium, they are usually fed ground flake foods, baby brine shrimp or unless they are put in a separate tank, the babies will eat uneaten food from the adults.

YnCUyvK7aa	Is there some reason you're only considering websites?  I know what you find in pet stores isn't the greatest quality, and not everyone lives within easy driving distance of a store.<br>  <br>  But without knowing where you're located geographically, I wonder if maybe there would be a fish club near you where breeders are producing some pretty good stock.  I've seen some amazing colors and sizes on the fancy guppies coming from the club where I belong, and they're almost always at the monthly auctions that coincide with the meetings.  And there's a yearly public auction, too.  For the price of a year's membership, you can get better guppies at about 1/2 the cost of stores and you don't have to pay shipping and handling.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you're a serious guppy breeder, you might want to join 1 of the guppy associations.  And the members of these associations that are breeders might also have their own websites where they sell their stock, along with selling on Aquabid and ebay.<br>  <a href="http://www.ifga.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifga.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.world-guppy.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.world-guppy.de/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.members.tripod.com/~ppga/" rel="nofollow">http://www.members.tripod.com/~ppga/</a><br>  <br>  This website has a list of other clubs and breeders and 2 other auction sites >>  <a href="http://guppyz.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://guppyz.tripod.com/</a>|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Well, you already listed liveaquaria.com, but they were a decent site.

kfrgLKX1aa	Judging by the information you gave me, I think your Gerbil has eye infection.( you can notice it when your gerbil has cloudy eye, gunk around the eyelids, or watery eye.  I'm not that good with gerbil sickness, I mostly do hamsters, but I think they are quite the same... Any ways. Eye infection should be  treated by mixing half a cup of sterile (boiled and cooled) water with a teaspoon of boric acid powder (available from a chemist or pharmacy) and using an eye dropper to bathe the eye twice or three times a day. If the hamster does not show improvement within a couple of days veterinary advice should be sought as antibiotics may help. What usually cause this is rusted cages and moist damp air.<br>  <br>  Don't worry If your gerbil loose their eye sight. ( I know hamster's eye sights are poor, and they can live without seeing, but I'm not so sure about gerbil).<br>  <br>  Age-ing Gerbils Sometimes also have this problem. This is a common sickness for all types of rodents. <br>  <br>  Story of my experience: I have 4 hamsters. 1 hamster had eye infection. It was also getting old. His eye was cloudy. I researched about eye infection and the description of eye infection was the same as my hamster's eye ( if you know what I mean). My family wanted to put him to sleep so he won't feel the pain. But we didn't. Later on, I learned that hamster's can live without their eye ( it would just be creepy...). I clean out the eye, the hamster lived for another year or so. It was ok, and he died recently ( the age a normal hamster would die at :B)<br>  . /\_<br>  (O.o 7<br>  (____)7 hope I helped, good luck with that gerbil :B|`|qlDV1OZwaa	sleep walking ???????
SzW9GmRsaa	At the moment not much is selling ... but usually horses don't sell well between November and March/April because everyone would much rather wait until the spring to buy a new horse!  I think good horses will always find a home and always be in demand - I don't know about the bottom end of the market, though...<br>  <br>  I've only heard of a few ponies who just wouldn't sell, and in both cases they were crazily over priced.  Even for two years ago the money the sellers wanted was just unrealistic and they never would have got it because anyone would have been able to buy a much better pony for the price.<br>  <br>  Feed and bedding prices have gone through the roof.  There's a big problem with hay, as last summer was so wet that the time for making hay was extremely limited and lots of farmers just don't have good hay.  What you can get hold of is often wet or mouldy inside, even if it looks and smells OK on the outside.  Bedding is much the same - straw has suffered the same fate as hay, and my shavings have doubled in price since this time last year.  A bag of feed is about a third more expensive than last year.  Tack etc, I haven't noticed a change.  The second hand saddle market is definitely a good place for a buyer - lots of people are willing to take less than they wanted to get rid of stuff.  I bought a nearly new show saddle for my step daughter's pony for ￡100 - it's over ￡600 new and didn't have a mark on it.|`|l9xD9nJzaa	i just bought a horse for a trade deal in training of another horse.

iXijnCxOaa	Depends on the dog.  Most responsible breeders I know do a temperament test on day 49 after birth (yes, it is important to do it ON the day they turn 7 weeks of age).  <br>  <br>  One of the crucial parts of this test is to do it:<br>  *at a strange place<br>  *with a new person they've never met administering the test<br>  <br>  Your breeder should be willing to share that information with you, as well as explain the nuances of the test.<br>  <br>  I don't believe the examples you're giving us can give me enough information to lend any true meaning to anything.. beyond --- I LIKE the PITA puppies.  I LIKE hard to train headstrong dogs because I have the experience to shape the behavior without breaking the spirit...<br>  <br>  what would make me hesitate is the "Cautious about it".  Cautious dogs are not my cup of tea.  It doesn't lend itself well to adapting to new situations (new show venues and in my circumstances, new places) and can take a lot of work to train the dog that life is ok.  I prefer not to have to spend the time doing that when I could be training other things.<br>  <br>  I prefer bold and intrepid dogs.  I prefer dogs whose outgoing nature I have to curb rather than having to encourage the dog into something new... I like a dog with the self-assurance to be ok being left on a down stay outside the dressing room when I need to try on clothes (assuming there isn't enough room for me to bring my Service Dog in with me).|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	>>>Do you think this would be a good obedience dog or a head strong dog that has a mind of its own?<<<<br>  <br>  BOTH...*IF* the trainer is a good one.<br>  <br>  I love working with dogs like this.

These are the guys that usually challenge their owners quite a bit all their lives.  However, these are the dogs I usually go for because they excel in dog sports (obedience .. yada yada).|`|TWfDAYK4aa	I have never had a litter, so really do not know, but to me, I would think this to be a really headstrong dog, that will need lots of training, but will also be a wonderful dog to own.  I would think it to be a good thing, not a bad thing.  Just means the pup is independent.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	I never put much credence in the Fist pup to do anything.  Usually it is just a coincidence and that's it.  <br>  I also very much agree with Animal Art works on temperament testing.  I would put much more reliability into that then who did what first.  With me and my Golden's the only thing I would take notice of is which pups or pups would gravitate towards the decoys I place into the whelping box.  I would scent them with a particular scent and the ones who would gravitate towards I would work with a bit more to see just if their noses were more inclined to pick up certain scents when it came to being a good hunting dog.  <br>  As far as who was first, well I never felt it was the most adventurous or anything.  It usually meant that pup just realized quite by accident that if it climbed on top of another pup it was able to fall out of the whelping box!  <br>  <br>  I'll stick to the testing before I ever label a pup more prone to do anything better than any of the others.  <br>  To me first just meant lucky!|`|mc59Y5vwaa	The bravest dog is often a dominant personality and this would generally equal to a dog that is slightly difficult to train, but it depends what you want them for.  The most cooperative would be in the middle--not timid, but looking for leadership and eager to please.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it just means that particular pup is the first to develop--if the other pups aren't able to do it yet, it may not be the personality so much as physical development.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I am a breeder of 10+ years, and have learned that the puppy that you have described, will usually be the pick of the litter.

I have constantly had a dog since I was a little kid. At many times having several at a time because I run a Rott rescue home. When picking out a pup I would go to the people's home selling the pups and sit down on the ground with the pups. I would watch them and see how they reacted to me. The ones that stayed away from me were off my choice list. The ones who approached me were on my maybe list. The ones who had the strong personality to actually come up to me and play, bite, and climb on me were in the running for adoption. These pups usually had a strong personality, and turned out to be very loyal to the human they bonded to. Infact, my last great companion, who passed away 1 1/2 years ago was the loyalist dog I owned. I picked him out from the litter because he was very independent and confident even as a puppy. While I sat in his play area, he was the only one to come up to me. He sniffed me, walked around me, and then, as if he decided he was the tougher of us two, he turned his back on me and pissed. I knew at that moment I had to have this pup. HE HAD ATTITUDE!! He gave me a little trouble as he grew and wanted to challenge me for the alpha dog position, but in the end we loved each other. He went through a long illness, in which I gave him constant care (I'm an RN). But eventually I had to put him to sleep at home. Dogs that tend to do things first are usually the smartest ones, the more assertive ones, and the most loyal ones. I'd keep that pup of yours, or at least make sure he goes to a good home with a wonderful human friend. That pup sounds like he has a lot to give, including a little bit of assertive trouble in his future. But in the end he will grow to be a wonderful friend.

That will help, too.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I had a dog do this once, and it turned out there was an earth quake 25 miles from where we live.

(:|`|9PlDaDzuaa	If you can't afford to pay anything for a puppy you can't afford a puppy. Do you realize that they are alot of work and responsibility? As well as they end up being very expensive. Even if you go to the shelter they make you pay for dogs so that you realize that it is the beginning of a hefty commitment. As well as they make you fill out a significant amount of paper work before they approve the adoption. They do all of this to make sure that the person adopting the dog has a clear understanding of the responsibility involved in owning a dog. They want to make sure that the dog isn't brought back to the shelter after the newness wares off and the person realizes that it takes some work. So I hope that no one helps you find dog because by the sounds of your question you are not wear near ready to take on the responsibility of a life!|`|qVdvwWUbaa	A free puppy? You do know that "free to a good home" dogs are more likely to be put in a shelter or left out in the backyard, don't you? If you're not willing to pay for it, you don't need one. They might be free to take home, but after that they cost A LOT of money.

Maybe ... it's your training method that having her dig her heels in.  It's not that I'm saying your a bad trainer, it's that I've found that, with the exception of a few breeds, that when dogs get "stubborn" on me, it's because I'm pushing them to learn to fast and they're getting confused, or I'm forgetting to have fun while training.  <br>  <br>  So .. maybe you want to take a step back and take a closer look at what you're doing  :D|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Maybe it's your lack of control of your dog and he is not focused on you and what YOU want him to do. Poodles are one of the most intelligent breeds out there.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Poodles are very intelligent.

rWGzVUxOaa	Do not buy the pre-mentioned glowfish please as they are not designed to glow naturally but are injected as an egg with a chemical to MAKE them glow which has a lot of repercussions on the health fo the fish.  Good choices might be neon tetras, cardinal tetras, guppies, mollies, platies.  General rule is 1-2 in per gallon.  Most community fish like the ones you mentioned are fine together but there are a lot of semi-aggressive that you should be aware of which can be found here. <a href="http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater_compatibility_chart.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratemyfishtank.com/freshwater...</a>|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	This is what I recommend:<br>  <br>  1 male Dwarf Gourami and 1 Female Dwarf Gourami<br>  5 Zebra Danios<br>  2 Platys<br>  4 Coryadora catfish<br>  <br>  And there is still a bit of space for them to grow and move!!|`|bD7Yaatkaa	neon glow fish they are so cool they are fresh water you can put in a (block) of food that they eat when they are hungry and the block lasts for 10 days or you can buy flake food.they are really small and cheap like less than 3.00 so you can get a bunch they glow in the dark and <br>  they are sooo cool. also if you put in bettas they will have to be seperated from each other and all other fish. bettas or not they will eat each other|`|ZupV4QNhaa	I wouldn't get female betas in that tank.

3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Strange, I answered this yesterday. Separation Anxiety. My dogs howl when I leave. They do not like to see anyone leave as they naturally are pack animals. Then again, it could be their way of communicating. No need to stop feeding him, because the behaviour will never change. It can however be controlled.<br>  <br>  It is best to have a command you use when leaving, so you prepare him. I tend to say, back soon. As a result, a lot of sour faces and not very happy. I drive off and wait. Sometimes it is too much for them and the howling starts, so I return home to comfort them and say, no, 'back soon'. I give them all a little hug and try again. It is rare to have to return three times, but it has happened. <br>  <br>  We do not know what goes on through a dog's mind. I have a dog that suffers from epilepsy and perhaps he is nervous when I leave. You are dealing with a pup still. He probably still needs his siblings around him and you are it. The shaking tells you that he may have experienced accidents of which he is not proud. He is scared he may make a mistake. Life's reality is that you cannot be with him 24/7 and he obviously needs to adjust. I agree with you, that you should be concerned and praise you for your consideration. <br>  <br>  If you could find out what bugs him when you are out, perhaps you are able to discovers way of reducing the stress. As he gets older, he will adjust quicker, but perhaps he is still too young. He definitely needs a lot of reassuring, if he even cries when you go upstairs, why is he not allowed to come upstairs with you? If he sleeps alone at night, that is a very big clue. <br>  <br>  I hope you can find ways to comfort him with quality, rather than quantity. Keep an eye on his underlying health, one never knows.|`|hySeWaGRaa	My husband has a husky that would do the same thing. I wanted him to bond deeply with my husband so I would pretty much ignore him, sad thing was my husband kinda did too. So I decided to treat him like my puppy and now the dog only pays attention to me. Encourage your roommates to have more interactions with the dog while you are around and not paying attention to him. If he sees you as his only master he wont care about the other people.|`|2349afcbac4c3a4a0dce26e0d170e44faa	Listen to Karalyn, she is right: separation anxiety. Do like she says and it will subside. Remember that if you console a dog if it nervous or scared then you are reinforcing that behavior because affection is a reward. Pay no attention to the pooch til he is calm then pet and hug him hello.|`|eb705150f06c6fb9be0036d29092dc55aa	There is a really good book called The Dog's Mind, can't remember who it's by but it explains things like separation anxiety.  Well worth reading and helps you understand your dog's behaviour.|`|AA10178659	Your dog is a one owner dog.|`|xoMtYuFLaa	its a puppy stage itl pass !! :) its just like a mommy and baby|`|7Sf8VD85aa	My dog was also totally fixated with me after we brought her home. She had recently lost her previous owner through death and transferred her insecurities to me. It got to the point where she howled whenever I left the house and drove my husband mad. <br>  I had to go away for a weekend and that was the turning point. After the first day she apparently started laying by his feet instead of the front door.(The last place she sw me go out of).<br>  If you can I would suggest you try to get away for a couple of days so that he learns that he can turn to others when you are not there. Also if possible let him see you go so that he knows you are not just outside of the door.<br>  He is young and he will get used to you coming and going. I know it is awful to see or hear any dog that is sad and whining but stick with it and you will both be just fine.<br>  Even now when I get home my dog greets me like I have been gone for weeks. Don't knock it, it is just the best feeling in the world to know that you have been missed so much and your dog is so thrilled that you have come home. (It beats a peck on the cheek by the hubby any day!)|`|tX27e0UFaa	This is totally normal. if you are the sole one taking care of the dog he respects you more. get someone to take him for a walk or feed him adn then maybe he will understand that everyone can take care of him. You must be the leader of the pack.. he knows it and loves you... Be very thankful you have him, My mini dachshund Angus is my Best Friend|`|wyAbkG3oaa	He loves you :) My dog used to be like this. He used to be so excited to see me that he used to almost knock me right over. I could leave him for about 5 mins and he would be ever so excited when I came back.

There isnt much you can do, he just loves you.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	Sounds like a good dog to me!  :)  Dogs are very dependant animals.  If you want one that has more of a mind of it's own get a cat  LOL|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Training.  Crate training is a good way to go.  Get yourself a trainer.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	sounds like your dog is starting to get separation anxiety. you said "whenever i come home he greets me like ive been gone for a month even if its only been an hour and it takes ages to calm him down". what are you doing to make him 'calm down' because you may be making it worse. you should make your coming and going a care free experience by ignoring the dog when you leave, and ignoring the dog when you get home until he calms down himself. once she is in a calm state, then you may greet him. get some interactive toys for when you leave, like a kong you can fill with food or treats to distract her and keep her occupied when you are gone. start leaving for short periods of time at first, like leave the house and come right back in, ignoring the dog completely. do this and increase the time slowly. you may want to consult a professional trainer before this gets worse, because allowing the behavior to continue, it will get worse
6SeWCfUfaa	YUUUP!  Bassets are a low energy dog.

Its called Canine Cognative Dysfunction.<br>  <br>  Staring into space, forgetting housebreaking, seem confused.  <br>  <br>  Of course, there are different degrees of these behaviors.

IuYekkPVaa	Cats are solo predators by nature, and except in the case of females with kittens, they don't share their prey with other cats. They are protective of their territory because its the source of all the things (food and shelter) that they need to survive.  To share it with others would jeopardise their own chances of survival.  <br>  <br>  However, when food supplies are plentiful, such as in the home environment, or around rubbish dumps, there is less competition so cats will be more tolerant of each other and the more sociable ones will even form strong bonds with other cats.<br>  <br>  All living creatures, including humans are territorial to some extent.  Nature is all about survival of the fittest, and that's why some are prepared to fight to defend their territory and it's resources.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	its not a cat thing its everything living. cats dogs sharks senaks etc..even people that's why the country's go by different names to mark territory.<br>  only thing different from humans than other territorial is that we are label happy. everything in existence must have a title if not one will be given.|`|vuF7bSwEaa	because of the plain and simple fact of females , if you own a  cat , the cat wil think your home, garden andd etc is it territory so if another male cat enters it , the cat becomes very threatened and territoral , its like wen someone comes in ur room with out asking relli , they just like there space to themselves to hunt birds and etc and for females|`|T5znNRjraa	It just comes in there nature, they are probably more territorial then most other animals, but thats no reason not too get a cat, lool. =) x|`|ezT7xruoaa	Yeah of course, just look at hippos. If you happen to walk into their territory they will kill you! And cats only scratch you and then run away. (well mine do anyways, when I walk into "their" lounge.)|`|nSa0ErC5aa	it's their nature, <br>  other animals are territorial,<br>  some birds are territorial.|`|4DonDdbvaa	We are territoral thats why we have bedrooms. Their cats its their nature to have territory otherwise they might think they don't have a bed.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	It's their nature|`|j5k0VRbPaa	there lik diva  to me they think  there all tht|`|tFAKwsv6aa	Get a dog<br>  lol|`|AnhoHRFTaa	Common domestic/European domestic cats, the cats that we usually have as pets, originated in the deserts of North Africa.<br>  <br>  The territory is very barren, and large areas were needed to support just one cat with food. So by nature they protected their territory with attitude. They had to, to survive.<br>  <br>  If you have more then one cat from the same litter you will see that they are happy to live together, sleep together all cuddled up, and play together. Then when they get older they find their own places to sleep, no longer share the bed you got for them when they were little kitties, and also they fight quite a lot.<br>  <br>  That is because in the wild, whilst the mother was feeding them and they were weening, they did not have a problem getting fed. But as they get older and have to provide for themselves, they drift apart. They only stay together in the domestic situation because they know they can get food in our homes, as we care for them.<br>  <br>  But basically they are so territorial because in the wild they had to protect their barren feeding land.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Kitties forever|`|VWvI5RyBaa	You're lucky you have a cat since they have different ways to mark their territories.  Usually they mark their territories by scratching since they have glands in their paws that release a scent.  Another way is by brushing themselves against you with their forehead and brushing themselves against furniture  with their cheek or chin.  Another way is by spraying with their urine which I have never seen although I'm a cat person and always had cats when I was growing up.  Although all living creatures might be territorial, the level is different.  You will see that a lot more with domestic and wild animals than human beings.  Like I said, I'm a cat person but my husband and three children love dogs so we now have our second dog.  The first one was a collie and died naturally when she became old.  Now we have a mix that is mostly Australian sheppard and terrier and being a male I suppose, his way of marking his territory is by urinating.  My older daughter and my husband are the ones who take the most care of Freckles and he urinated on both of them on their legs, hopefully he is finished marking his territory  LOL   As for cats, it's not exactly true that they don't share and are not loyal to each other.  I had a cat when I was a little girl who had 4 kittens.  Two kittens died and the mother was hit by a transport when the kittens were three.  My father felt bad for me and told me I could keep both which I fed with a bottle and a formula bought at the pet store.  They grew up together and always slept together in a basket which was funny since they were 25 lbs each.  They were not terribly fat since they were awfully long too.  The female was the hunter until the age of 5(our age) and always brought what she caught for the male.  They were well fed at home but it was the instinct.  When she was 5, she stopped hunting and the male took over and left his trophies on our steps every day.  The female wasn't interested, she preferred the food we gave her.  They slept together until the male died at the age of 13 1/2.  The female cried every night and I had to console her for an hour every night from 03:00AM to 04:00AM.  My mother called the veterinarian and explained our female cat pattern since the death of her companion.  Typical male answer, the veterinarian said:  What do you expect, she's like a woman who's depressed, she sleeps, she eats and she cries.  He added that cats didn't have a long memory and that everything would be fine in three weeks at the most.  Well, it took 6 months.  I hope I didn't bore you with my explanation but I love cats so much that my name "minou" is one of the French word for cat.|`|AA11595360	Cat's arent very territorial by nature.|`|67EaIAvbaa	just about all animals are..it's in their genes

wnnudNp5aa	Fish don't tend to be hyperactive or anorexic. Have you checked your water's parameters? Does it have a filter? What temperature is his tank? It should be between 76-78 degrees. If it isn't, gradually adjust the heater. You have a heater in his tank, right? Do you do regular partial water changes? What are you feeding him? <br>  The proper food for Bettas is Betta pellet food. If he is not too hip to that, try offering him brine shrimp or bloodworms. Those should get his appetite going. You can also pop a pea out of it's shell, cut it up into Betta-bite size pieces, and offer him some of the pieces. Most Bettas love peas, and they're good for them. Remove anything he doesn't eat within 15 minutes, you don't want to foul the water.<br>  If you have done all this and he still doesn't eat and act normally, I'd try treating him with Maracyn-two. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic especially for fishes that won't eat. You can get it at about any pet store. I'm not sure what is wrong with him, but that might help, it's worth a shot. A fish that isn't eating is most likely a sick fish. Good luck!|`|iVgtoyw8aa	let him do what he wants whats his water temp and they all have diffferent perasonalities|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Fish don't have eating disorders.

If your fish is lethargic and has lost weight it can be a sign of internal parasites or worms, try treating with a good quality anti-internal parasite medication, or medicated fish food, but it may have gone on too long to be treatable.<br>  <br>  Bettas need a tropical set up, with filter and a temperature of 75-80F.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	The water temp should be over 76 F, preferrably 78-82 F.

AoSeHXeQaa	It doesnt sound to me like this is a major issue.<br>  I would just correct the unwanted behavior with a NO, and maybe a firm touch, if he does not listen.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	I think since already know that he's like that in the first few hours that you just need to be aware and make sure you stop the behavior when it happens. <br>  <br>  Next time you are at someone else's house, feed him in a seperate room. Or stand right there with a leash on him until he learns that no other dogs are going to bother him while he's eating. I have one dog that is food aggressive and I just feed him seperately. I don't fight him with it. I make sure that I make him feel as safe as possible while he eats...don't force your dog to feel like he's got to protect his food. The one thing I do require of my dog is to always...ALWAYS give up his food to me if I want it. I do that with training...but I never use aggression.<br>  <br>  But with the toys...I always find that it's just better to keep the toys put away when you are at someone elses house. Dogs can play together just fine with out toys. Or make sure there are more toys than dogs, that way there is always something for all of them to grab and play with. <br>  <br>  What I do by leaving the leash on my dog at a friend or family members house is if my dog shows a behavior that isn't desirable, I take the leash and give it a light tug(never jerk the leash) and say "No".  My dogs when they are first learning usually took 3 times of that before they got the hint. If they didn't after the 3rd time though, I would take and bring him back to where I am and make him stay and miss out playing with the other dogs for about 15 minutes and then give him another chance to go play and show the right  behavior. If I am somewhere where the other people aren't or won't control their dogs, I don't let my dog interact with those dogs. It just causes problems.|`|5NPIHKxQaa	Dogs are very sensitive to what their human is feeling. A common mistake when meeting other dogs is to tense up and get fearful of what your dog may do. Stay calm and do not put continuous tension on the leash.<br>  As soon as you see that your dog is starting to get stressed, you should step in and interrupt before the situation escalates. A good way to interrupt is to give the command (e.g. Hey, Hey), move quickly away, and bring your dog with you. Treat and praise your dog if he follows you on a loose leash.|`|OTwAlWnZaa	I would strenuously disagre with your trainer.  It will not go away on its own, and will most likely get worse.  Your dog is showing dominance behavior around his toys and his food.  That's why he's fine with you, your dobie and other dogs he perceives as his superiors.  If you plan to have him around strange dogs a lot when toys and food are present (e.g. a dog park), you will want to work on this behavior now.<br>  <br>  In simplest terms, try to have him around other dogs when a toy is present.  (Definitely do this with dogs and owners you trust)  If he growls when a dog looks at the toy, take the toy away and give it to the other dog.  He'll quickly realize the more aggressive he is, the worse it works out for him.  When he shares his toys, praise him, and give him a reward.  You're lucky in the respect that it's an aussie mix.  They are very bright, and take direction well.  He should catch on very quickly.
8NSh1D4Maa	I have CareCredit for vet emergencies I can't afford to pay out-of-pocket, but don't otherwise have a special card for my pets.  I would just get whatever card you can qualify for with the lowest rate and most favorable terms.  The cards with 'perks' like double rewards and discounts on specific things generally make up for them by charging higher interest rates, annual fees, and so on, even if the initial terms look favorable, read the fine print as most will raise your rates sky high after the 'introductory' period.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	err no do i need one

v0RsFaAzaa	If your vet said that your dog has a Lung Tumor, then he's probably right. The reason that your dog is breathing heavily, is because of the Lung Tumor. If you believe the diagnosis isn't right, then take your dog to a different vet. If your dog is in pain, which he most likely is, he is not able to enjoy his life, and there is nothing that the vets can do to help him, then the only Humane thing you can dog, is to put the poor dog out of it's misery. I'm Sorry!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	If you believe he was misdiagnosed then go to a different vet.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	If he is breathing heavily,then he probably does have a lung tumor.Also,I have had dogs with cancer and sometimes they crave odd foods.This may be why he is getting into the garbage. As long as he is eating,I would let him enjoy his last days and feed him whatever he wants to eat.When he no longer wants food,or starts to have bad problems breathing,then it will be time to let him go,but please make sure that someone in your family stays with him so he won't be afraid.Stay until he's gone and talk to him and pet him as he drifts off. I'm so sorry about your dog.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Well, if they took x-rays and saw a tumor, then there's a tumor in there and its only going to get worse.  If he is already breathing heavy, it is already affecting your dog.  Do you want your dog to have to fight to breath?<br>  <br>  You are certainly entitled to a second opinion, but your dog has had a change in behavior, increased water consumption, difficulty breathing.  I haven't seen your dog, the x-rays, or bloodwork, but it might be time.  <br>  <br>  There is never a good time to euthanize a pet, but you can wait too long.  Don't let your dog get to the point that he is struggling to breath.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	The symptoms you're describing seems to go along with a lung tumor. Why makes you not believe the diagnosis?  Is there something else?|`|sfUUml0Daa	i agree try another vet for a second opionion.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi if you really feel he has not been diagnosed right go to another vet and verify it is always good to have a second opinion.  He might have a fever or infection on top of everything else if he's drinking excessive water.  If he is breathing heavily that doesn;t sound good honey.  Lung tumors can cause all kinds of difficulty breathing.  Maybe you are feeling so bad that you don't want to admit that your dog is really sick.  It's okay we all do that.  It's so hard when one's dog becomes ill and we feel helpless to make it better.  The thing to remember is if your dog really is very very sick don't let him suffer because you still want him with you.  And yes we all tend to do that to.  We still want them here on earth with us.  A person can let them live out the rest of their life with you and get meds from the vet to keep them comfortable.<br>  But if you do feel strongly that he doesn't have a lung tumor please get another opinion it will help make you feel better whatever the results.  Good Luck and take care.
IGfnrfGPaa	I would educate them. I will always stand up for what I believe in, no matter the consequences.|`|3giaPYe8aa	You know, they are going to do whatever they want to do anyway, no matter how you present this to them.

( I know, very immature, but that's just how some people are)|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	I kind of think you've answered your own question by stating that he would not listen to you anyway.<br>  <br>  Instead of making someone defensive by pointing out what they're doing (in your estimation) incorrectly, talking about what you think is important for responsible breeders to do might start a productive conversation. Telling him that you are interested in the subject and that you've bought a book that you'd like his opinion on... then loaning him or give him a good book on genetics and whelping and asking if he'd read it and discuss it with you... that might start a conversation.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that his dogs belong to him and his decisions about what he does with them are his, unless what it is that he does is a violation of the law. There is nothing wrong with making a profit on a litter.|`|52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	This is a subject very close to my heart, so, I don't think it's something I could let past.

I'd be more outspoken to a stranger :P<br>  <br>  For example, my boyfriend's parents have an un-neutered Pug that they got at a flea market.  They also have a Bichon who is spayed now, but they let the two have puppies (UGLY ones) before they got her spayed.  I've spoken my mind about it to my boyfriend and he knows, but I wouldn't dare to his parents.  The most I'll say is "you know, having him neutered could lower his risk of testicular cancer" and leave it at that - something that sounds a lot more kind than if I come across as judging them negatively based on their back yard breeding escapade and their failure to get the Pug neutered.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who got a free mutt puppy on a street corner and had big plans of her having puppies one day, and I was careful in my words to her too.  Sure, I wanted to point out that if a man had to beg people to take his free puppies on a street corner, she'd likely have to do the same, but I don't think I could have said that and kept our friendship :P  Thankfully she wound up spaying the dog even without my input ;)|`|6SeWCfUfaa	People are short sighted and extremely selfish.<br>  <br>  And I'm not talking about your cousin.  I'm talking about people on here saying they'd stand up for what they believe no matter what!  Well, you know what, that's your cousin.  And your cousin is part of your family.  And if you start up with family, it affects the ENTIRE family.  It drags your family into all your BS and .. they don't want it any more than your cousin would.<br>  <br>  It's nice to think we could politely educate a family member, but there is really no way to address this that isn't going get your cousin going.  So you know what, find another target.  If you really feel the need to educate someone, do it to someone that won't turn around and piss and moan to your family about how you can't mind your own business.<br>  <br>  Irresponsible breeders bug me too, but stirring up the family pot, isn't exactly a cool things to do either.|`|W02kTOqmaa	I'de cause a lot of drama in the family. Of course, I'm known as the drama starting one ;) AND, my family is rather small, so everyone is comfortable and knows everyone pretty well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't start out by berating them. I would calmy tell them why it was a bad idea and should not be done. I'm attending college to work with animals, so my family usually listens to me in these sort of matters. If that did not work, I would get downright nasty. Stupid people deserve what stupid people get.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	You answered your own question with "But I don't want to cause a lot of drama in the family, since I don't know him especially well and he wouldn't listen to me anyway.".  <br>  <br>  Seriously just leave him alone.  You know it's wrong, he won't listen to you, no since causing an uproar.  If you could make money doing something that easy wouldn't you?|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i am a lover of pit bulls and my family always have mean, uneducated comments to say about the breed. so i've started sending them articles in the mail and through email, or youtube videos that show the benefits of the breed. you could try something like this. send him articles about the risk of breeding, videos about animals dying in shelters etc. <br>  i would probably go nuts on the guy myself, but it may not help your cause. try the subtle way first and see what happens, if he doesnt catch on bring on the lectures!|`|KuUx34hCaa	may be you could get articles & either give to him or send to him anonymously though male it would be better then doing nothing|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Well, yes, I do disagree with breeding. I work at a vet clinic and though I see it done responsibly SOMETIMES, these people do not love their dogs and ARE doing it for profit. I especially HATE labradoodle breeders but I won't get into that. ANYWAY, I have seen more than my fair share of flea infested, scabby puppies and sick mothers who have been over bred. A responsible breeder (as responsible as they can be for bringing life into the world and selling it for profit without knowing where it will turn up a few months to a year later because the dog isn't cute anymore... or it got to big!!! I hate people.) knows that a female should be bred 2 or 3 times in its life then spayed. I'm not sure how many litters your cousin has forced upon his poor money maker of an animal but from the way you speak it sounds like more than a couple. This is what I would do... and you can if you'd like. Call animal control and/or lab rescues, tell them the situation. They will go out but because the animals are sheltered and have food and water they will most likely not do anything. Call everyday if you must... get people you know to call. You CAN do this anonymously! Just do something. I hate to say it, but unless these dogs are extremely over used and ran down... not much will happen and it saddens me to say it. Just do what you can and in the confines of the law.

O4jGlC2caa	I would find a Great Dane forum and talk to them about what to feed him since you don't want the puppy to grow too fast.  (Can be bad for large breeds.)<br>  <br>  I actually am not a fan of the raw diet.  I think meat should be cooked.  There are actual studies out there that show pets DO get sick from salmonella, E.coli, and certain parasites in raw meat.  Also, even if the dog doesn't get sick, it can still shed salmonella bacteria in its saliva and feces that could make YOU sick.  People are going to get on here and tell you b.s. about how dogs descended from wolves so their intestines can handle it.   We domesticated the dogs.  They may not be able to actually handle the raw meat in their system.<br>  <br>  Think this thing through before you jump on the raw food diet bandwagon.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	You should start feeding your pup 2-3% of her estimated ADULT weight: if she gets rolly, feed less, a little thin, feed more. DO NOT include veggies in her diet, except maybe as treats. Dogs don't need them, can't really digest them. Wolves/dogs do not eat the stomach contents of large ruminants (cows, deer, etc) so there is no need to include a "substitute" (pureed/ground/steamed) vegetables in their diet. And contrary to what the first poster said, raw is not more expensive than kibble, and in most cases it's actually less expensive. You don't need to feed organic, grass fed meat; a variety of store bought/supplier obtained meat and supplements of fish oil will be just fine. Personally, I buy most of my meat when it goes on "manager's special" ie. when it is about to expire. Actually, it just says "use or freeze by" so it would be fine for me and definitely fine for a dog (they do eat poo). I highly recommend joining the yahoo! groups rawfeeding and rawchat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfeeding/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfe...</a><br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawChat">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawCh...</a><br>  <br>  ADD: I have been feeding my two dogs raw for about a month. I have seen my 3 yo rescue akita fill out, get a better coat and be more satisfied with and excited by his food. My boxer mix sheds less, has a softer coat, has no doggy odor, and is very excited for her food. Both have fabulous teeth and NO breath odor. Before feeding raw, they were on a "high quality" kibble, Blue Buffalo.<br>  <br>  ADD 2: DO NOT use pre-made raw. It's not better than kibble in that you have no idea what's really in it. You don't know how much organ, bone, or meat is in it, you don't know how much vegetable matter they added or how much of each kind, and (if it's supplemented) you don't know how much supplement they have added. It doesn't work your dog's teeth, jaws, neck, or mind and encourages gulping. Let's not forget that it is often 2 or 3 times as expensive as feeding kibble or prey model.<br>  ADD 3: Kate C gave some excellent advice, but the one point I have to disagree with is the pumpkin. I know it is a handy tool, and I myself am guilty of using it, but if your dog has digestive upset, there is a reason for it! You need to find the cause, not cover it up. Especially if the dog is having runny poop, giving pumpkin just keeps in things the dog is trying to get rid of. A better option is slippery elm bark (SEB)or slippery elm bark powder (SEBP); it actually soothes any irritations in the dog's system and helps them recover faster. Even that is a patch though, and really just a way to make the dog more comfortable while you find the source of the problem.<br>  <br>  ADD....another: "There are actual studies out there that show pets DO get sick from salmonella, E.coli, and certain parasites in raw meat." Umm...no, actually. There are "studies" showing that raw meat contains these things, but none showing otherwise healthy dogs contract them from meat. They HAVE gotten them from kibble. These "studies" also used ground meat, which is KNOWN to have a higher bacteria load than whole. <br>  " Also, even if the dog doesn't get sick, it can still shed salmonella bacteria in its saliva and feces that could make YOU sick." Kibble contains these same germs and dogs shed these bacteria in their feces, not their saliva. Unless of course the dog's teeth are extensively covered in plaque (as in 99% of kibble-fed dogs), giving the bacteria places to grow. <br>  " People are going to get on here and tell you b.s. about how dogs descended from wolves so their intestines can handle it. We domesticated the dogs." Yeah, it's total b.s. that dogs are used as wolf analogs in scientific studies. And that EVERY evolutionary scientist, biologist, etc. accept that dogs are the same species as wolves. <br>  <br>  "Think this thing through before you jump on the raw food diet bandwagon." Yeah, it's a bandwagon and kibble isn't....only kibble hasn't been around that long, and what the hell do you think dogs ate before it was developed? Umm....yeah, that would be RAW MEAT! Unless you are suggesting major internal rearrangements have occurred in dogs in the last century, perhaps YOU should rethink jumping on the "kibble diet bandwagon"!|`|26PPwzrWaa	Well you actually feed the same amount you will feed when she is full grown. <br>  <br>  So either 2 to 3 percent of her estimated adult weight or up to 10% of her current weight. <br>  <br>  For a pup it is slightly different feeding raw, but not difficult once you get it. So your dog will eat anywhere from 2.2lbs or 35.2 ounces to 2.9lbs or 46.4 given the standard weight of a female dane daily. For a puppy, feed in separate meals. She is on the light side so I figure it will be closer to 2.2. 45lbs is the smallest she should be and she is only 5lbs heavier than that, so she will be closer to 110lbs than 145lbs. <br>  Now your job is to just decide on what you want to feed. Then divide that up into <br>  80% Muscle meat<br>  10% Bone<br>  10% Organ(half of which Has to be liver)<br>  <br>  When you first start, pick a cut of meat you will feed for the detox. I chose chicken due to it being cheap and easy access. I think for a dane, chicken quarters would be good for size. The bone is also the right amount. Remove the skin and fat until stool is solid, which shouldnt take long for a puppy. Not much to detox after only 4 months. Then slowly add the skin/fat back into the diet. <br>  Once stool is solid, slowly introduce organs into the diet. <br>  <br>  You can also follow the guideline for what the dog will need over the week. So just multiply the daily requirement by 7. Then divide it into the feeding guideline. Then you just feed the daily amount of whatever making sure the pup gets organs, bone and muscle meat amounts weekly. So instead of feeding organ, bone and muscle meat daily, you could feed a meal of muscle meat and bone(chicken quarters) one day, then feed organ the next day. (You will get it, its all confusing at first). <br>  <br>  Helpful things are: <br>  A freezer for keeping food(especially if you have more than one dog)<br>  containers to freeze separate meals(tried baggies, containers work better)<br>  mashed pumpkin for loose stool(only feed 1 to 2 tbsp's for loose stool)<br>  tongs to pick up the meat/organs.<br>  <br>  And no fasting a puppy. Not until 24 months of age.<br>  If you havent fixed already, please also wait until 24 months at least. <br>  <br>  If you need more help, this forum is a great place to learn about raw feeding: <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a><br>  <br>  How big were her parents weight wise?<br>  <br>  Add: Stay away from premade. It will end up costing you an arm and a leg. And defeats part of the purpose of feeding raw. Controlling what is in the food. <br>  And I feed fish instead of fish oil or flaxseed for omegas. Just a couple cans a week are good. Sardines, mackerel, salmon, etc are good examples of oily fish.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	Portions<br>  As a result of the increased digestibility of a raw food diet, you are able to feed your pet less food daily. Our suggestion is to feed your pet based upon the 2-3% Rule. Feed your pet 2-3% of their body weight daily. Our cups-per-pound recommendations are based upon a ratio of 2.5%. We recommend feeding your pet twice daily, so you should divide the total daily feeding weight in half and feed once in the morning and once in the evening.<br>  <br>  Factors such as level of activity, age, health, metabolism, and breed play a part in the necessary feeding quantities of all animals. Please be sure to monitor your pet’s dietary needs and adjust the feeding quantities accordingly.<br>  <br>  Use the table below to determine the appropriate feeding percentage based on your dog's dietary needs.<br>  <br>  Feeding Percentages<br>  2.0 %  Weight loss or non-active dogs<br>  2.5 %  Maintain Weight<br>  3.0 %  Slight Weight Gain<br>  3.5 %  Significant Weight Gain<br>  4.0 %  Puppies (8 wks - 1 yr)<br>  4.5 - 8.0 %  Puppies (4 wks - 8 wks) *<br>   <br>  Calculation Tips<br>  <br>  Weigh your pet on a regular basis so the feeding calculator will generate an accurate feeding amount.<br>  <br>  *Puppies: We recommend starting your puppy’s feeding percentage at 6% and adjusting up or down as necessary.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	if you do a google search for "raw dog diet" you will find some helpful information.

Its a "heat" or "estrus" cycle.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, dogs in heat may bleed a little, but it shouldn't be bloody urine.

uTJsoYzzaa	This is a VERY common problem with many cat owners, and can be fixed by using a few tricks and techniques. Yes, cats do tend to scratch the things you love the most and not their posts  but why? If a cat loves his/her owner; he/she will sharpen her claws on things that smell like his/her owner (couches, favorite books, bedposts, carpet etc.).<br>  <br>  One solution is to make the post smell like you until you get him/her used to using it. One way you can accomplish this is by rubbing your most used, unwashed, coat on the post. Maybe a little bit of your most common deodorant at the base. Or leave an unwashed shirt on it for a few days.<br>  <br>  The next step would be to encourage your cat in using it by first (this may sound a little silly) getting down on your hands and knees and clawing the post like you would want your cat to do. Once your cat has witnessed this a few times, gently pick up your cats paws and rub them on the post. If your cat resists this, don't force it, you don't want the post to become scary to him/her, just drop it and try again later.<br>  <br>  Last, you need to break any of your cat's old habits of scratching on your stuff. You can do this by keeping a small squirt gun handy and IMMEDIATELY giving your cat a little squirt and a large “NO!” upon scratching your stuff. (This may also work for any other cat no nos). If a squirt gun is not handy at any given moment you catch your cat scratching, blowing in his/her face will work.  Another way to repel you cat from certain spots is spraying the worst problem spots with a citrus scent (which they hate).  Just make sure the whole house doesn't smell like citrus or your cat will be miserable.<br>  <br>  One last thing to remember is to congratulate your kitty whenever you see him/her using his/her post. Though he/she may not understand your exact words, he/she will be able to tell by your sound of voice that you are pleased.  A loving scratch on the neck or stroke on the back will also speak the world to your kitty.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and God Bless.<br>   Jazmagirl|`|f1JS4QDyaa	SPRAY BOTTLE.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	get a cat stracher for the cat|`|9OekzhWbaa	they sell stuff at petstores and walmart that are anti scratch, u spray it and they dont scratch there because of the odar, humans cant really smell it, its kinda lik bitter apple spray|`|jxdMIAoBaa	A belt to discipline her every time she does it and tell her that that's not her scratch post while doing it.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	backfire.|`|RRChsxSKaa	First... if you sprinkle catnip into the carpet of her scratching posts she'll be more attracted to those.. and second there is a product called feliway that you can spray on your furniture or anything that is a citrus extract... cats hate the smell of these and will be more likely to stay away. check out the two sites listed as my sources :D

Take a preventative 1st strike for flea and tick control. Powdered 7 dust,sold at Walmart,Target etc garden centers,is the same as flea powder. Harts flea powder is about $5 for 4 oz. 4lb. bag sold in garden section is around same price. So safe you can use it up to the day of harvest on fruits and vegs.And being water soluble it won't accum.in fatty tissue.....canine organs etc.Dust yard and canine.Bath weekly if needed.Don't be misled by the so called "experts"Good luck and give your pet a pat and hug for me.|`|1cMugdkLaa	Yes, the drugs are safe to give together.<br>  <br>  -/\/\averick
YPLydxcXaa	With any regular stiffness or anything in his shoulders he shouldnt be doing events like barrels or keyhole,anything that requires pivoting movement with his shoulders under power,,its time to retire that one and get a younger ,sounder horse..I know of some that age that are serious competitors still, but once the shoulders start to bother a horse ,why try to force it to do something its past being capable of ? if you dont compete at a really serious level you could still use him a limitted amount ,but be sure to walk him out after and Id wash him down&massage him with DPHQ if you have any available..and make sure he is getting his supplements daily..tho a new horse is your best plan.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	I can pretty much gaurantee you that he will not win a ribbon at barrels - he has arthritis to the point of you having to STOP?!<br>   He needs a healthy shoulder to shift his weight as he comes around the barrel. You can't stop on course...<br>   So what IS the point in putting him thru it?<br>   You know the answer.<br>   You say you are leasing this horse...then WHY is someone else telling you what to do with him and THEY decide what meds and supplements he gets?<br>   Sounds like you are paying board for someone else - not leasing.<br>   Age is not the issue , HEALTH is the concern - I have a healthy 21 year old TB mare that still jumps a hunter course and loves it!<br>   Good luck !|`|B6zl0AJDaa	At 25 the Engish Pleasure would be fine for him, however, chasin' cans if he is NOT used to doing it could very well over tax him.<br>  <br>  You should know WHAT your horse gets food wise on a daily basis.  If all you do is just ride him, you really aren't learning much are you?|`|XX9pFFCZaa	i agree with Rosi M HPTS|`|G7CPY1Kuaa	There is a horse that shows at our local fair with an aged rider. He is deep into his twenties, I mean, he's old. He comes every year and does complex dressage maneuvers. There is also a 32 year old pony that comes every year, and that thing bullets around the ring.<br>  <br>  Age shouldn't be a huge factor. If you keep him in good shape, manage his arthritis, feed him well and make sure his dentistry is up to date, I'm sure he'll do fine.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi i hate to make you feel worse but 25 is getting up there to be doing some hard events like barrels etc.  Especially if the horse has arthritis.  Some horses that want to please a person so bad do not let their pain and agony show.  The only way sometimes to tell is maybe a slight limp or a groan that escapes out.  There are products out there for arthritis for horses, Glucosamine.  Check to see if this horse is getting that.  Again i can't stress enough that barrels and hard events on an arthritic shoulder can be bad and can be dangerous for you if that shoulder would fracture at all.  Arthritis has a way of weakening the bones.  I hope i'm not being too blunt just don't want you to hurt him and then you feel really bad.  Is there another horse you can lease that is younger.  I don't understand why this person or facility would lease an arthritic horse to u knowing you were going to be doing events that were hard on legs.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|7vnpJpE2aa	barrels are too much!! why cant you find a way for him to please you that is not painful/damaging to him? how about flat trails, or just riding bareback casually? sometimes just going for a walk together does the trick! there is SOOO much more to horses than showing!! there are no supplements in the world that can undo permanent leg damage that you could cause if you push him...|`|dBRxfRGqaa	i wouldn't push it especially considering his age. i would retire him, but if he feels good for his age the english pleasure would be fine.|`|UIRnNuqCaa	well considering how barrels is pretty hard on horses i dont think i would want to push him that hard especially if he has arthritis in his shoulder. its your choice i'm just sayin|`|CoAc5hS9aa	I wouldn't risk it. We have 3 horses from being barrel raced too much with bone chips. We pay $500 a month in supplements for them. Pleasure should be fine but I wouldn't go racing..|`|IMPvzBk1aa	If you love him to death, refuse to ride him on barrels.  Make it clear to the owners that it would be your idea of abuse to do so.  Supplements are not going to make this horse sound for barrels, and you have a choice to refuse to participate in forcing him into something he clearly should not be doing.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i agree with rosi that pleasure would be fine but i wouldnt stress him with barrels; to maintain the horse, i would give him some msm, you could also talk to your vet about giving him a cortisone shot in his shoulder
wLgGD63raa	It's definitely a Russian tortoise, here's a picture.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/stories/tortoise/Russian%20Tortoise%201.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/storie...</a><br>  <br>  Since he was outside for God knows how long you may want to soak him in some warm water, he is more than likely dehydrated.<br>  <br>  Anyways, here is some general information for you.<br>  <br>  Russian Tortoises are grazers and enjoy broad leaf plants. The best diet is a variety of weeds (leaves and flowers). Dandelion is a favorite. For detailed diet information:<a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/russiantortoisediet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/russianto...</a> for a list of edible plants: <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/edible_plants.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/edible_pl...</a> and <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/plant_photos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/plant_pho...</a>   <br>  <br>  There a couple of different things you can keep the tortoise in while you have him. The easiest for you would be either a rubbermaid storage container or an aquarium, as you would probably not want to spend a whole lot of time or money building your own enclosure. You can get a 50 gallon storage container for about $12.99 in Target, so this would be your best bet.<br>  <br>  As far as substrate go, you can use a 50/50 mix of play sand and bed a beast. It is critical that when the mixture in the enclosure dries you it's dampened again to keep the humidity level up. <br>  <br>  Here is a picture of what your finished enclosure should look like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/images/finished%20pen.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/images/fi...</a><br>  <br>  Temperature is critical for a healthy tortoise. The pen should have a cool end with the temps in the low 70's and a basking spot at 90-95°F. Night time temperature drops are needed. But since you live in Arizona I don't think your temperatures dropping below 70 will be a problem, but a 100 watt bulb should get you those temps just fine. You will need to get him a UV bulb, but you can get 100 watt UV bulbs so you wont need to have two different bulbs for heat and UV, that way you are not wasting money.<br>  <br>  Tortoises can recover from quite horrific shell injuries, they often damage their shells while mating in the wild. Minor damage will usually heal unaided after cleansing with Betadine, so I am sure he will be okay.<br>  <br>  I hoped I helped and good luck with the recovery process.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't know how anybody with general reptile knowledge can get a Russian mixed up with a Sulcata or Three-Toed Box. They look nothing alike. If someone were to get it confused with a Greek, that I could understand.<br>  <br>  Sulcata:<br>  <a href="http://www.cbwf.com/Gallery/images/Ivory%20Albino%20Sulcata.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbwf.com/Gallery/images/Ivory...</a><br>  <br>  Three-Toed Box:<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Articles/articlepics/Pic%204%20-%203-Toed%20Box%20Male%20-%20Acutus.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Article...</a><br>  <br>  Greek:<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Articles/articlepics/Pic%2014%20-%20Golden%20Greek%20Tortoise%20-%20Jan%20O..jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Article...</a><br>  <br>  Russian:<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Articles/articlepics/Pic%2013%20-%20Russian%20Tortoise%20-%20Jan%20O..jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Article...</a>|`|ld2vmypNaa	Looks like a land tortoise..try this site...<br>  <br>  ***Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles..<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/2816740940/in/set-72157614552292977/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  I wish you luck|`|TphsSOz6aa	Looks like a native tortise.  He'd like Opuntia catus leaves, which you can get at most grocery stores,  grape leaves, grass, dandylions and dandylion leaves, hybiscus flowers, day lilies,  watermelon , tomatos, and tortise chow softened with water.  Keep him warm, make sure he gets sun.  Take him to the vet to be sure his shell isn't fractured and needing gluing...then call a tortise rescue...and maybe they can get him rehabilitated.|`|1kmKtt9naa	Depending upon your state laws, it is illegal to take animals from the wild.<br>  <br>  You're going to need an appropriate sized tank (40 g or bigger)<br>  - Screen lid<br>  - UVA bulb ($40)<br>  - Basking light (about another ($25 for clamp and bulb, maybe more dependng upon the size & wattage you go with)<br>  - Substrate<br>  - Food (veggies & fruits since it is a tortoise)<br>  - Thermometer guage<br>  - Calcium dust<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically a lot of stuff.<br>  <br>  You're looking at around $200 minimum for a setup.|`|IntTij9Paa	u should put it back its not a good idea to keep a wild turtle but if ur goin to keep it u need lights uvb lighs and sand large tank etc u can find a lot of web sites on it night be a box turtle not sure
zv8QaMe1aa	It can vary.... usually they're trying to tell you something.... for whatever reason cats seem to think they can beam thoughts into their human's heads..... doesn't work, but they keep trying.  Check the food and water bowls to make sure they're full, check the litterbox to make sure it's clean... usually when one of mine is just staring at me like that it's one of those 3 things that are the problem<br>  <br>  Oh, and keep your cat indoors.... it's way to dangerous out there for them.  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/the-great-debate-indoor-versus-outdoor-cats/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/the-great-d...</a>|`|YraTwYqAaa	Cats are just like that.

It gets on my nervs too, but once i got used to it, i just left my cat alone from time to time. Now the staring part, im not too sure, because my cat used to do that to and it freaked me out. But usually when cats do that they are playing or consintrating.|`|acW9uiJZaa	Because she likes you ^_^<br>  No my cat does that too, she's pretty weird though. sometimes she gets the urge to be by me, then shes running out the door to be let outside.<br>  What can I say, cats are strange little fuzz balls...|`|8MTN47C9aa	She's telling you she wants out because your door is shut.

Go - live a little!|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	im having my first horse show it this horse i got this weekend! I saw like 3 horse shows where the show is gonna be before i started thinking about doing one..and now i am! Your horse should really trust u and know the basic listeing right away for transitions. The rider (you) should just sit back and relax with ur heels down and ur shoulders back!! Havea great time!|`|m1cAyExiaa	heey(:<br>  well first ur gonna wana make sure u have great eq and the trot( of course!) and you'll have to know switch directines properly! when i went to my first show it was just the basics walk trot switch directions then walk trot and line up in the middle. Honestly, groom your horse like crazy!! get the horse soooo shiny! you want to make a great first impression so also braid your horse and its tail and put black hoof conditioner on the horse!also bring someone who knows wat there doing at show if ur horse has any white a trick is to put baby powder were ever there is white and to have ur horse have a sleek coat give i some showsheen and the day of the show put this grand champion pepi spray in the horses tail to give it a golden clean sparkley look!<br>   <br>  hope this helps! and good luck!!!|`|jbvAwL0aaa	In a maiden pleasure class you will walk trot in both directions.  Be sure to be aware of your diagonals with the trot.  Minimal contact on the bit.
IJr0MR1Aaa	Large breeds often get these on their elbows.  Whenever I work with someone who has gotten a large breed puppy, I recommend they provide it a soft place to lay down.  <br>  <br>  To rule out anything serious, see a vet.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi first of all check the lump out is it a squishy soft moveable lump?  Or is it a hard nonmoveable lump that is firm and tight?  If it is a soft moveable lump it is probably just a cyst or a hematoma from an injury.  If this lump immediately occurred it probably is not cancer and just an injury reaction.  If the lump has been growing there for some time and it is hard and firm possibility it is a cancer but there is no way of telling unless you go to the vet first and get it checked out.  They will feel it possibly aspirate it and can tell you if it even needs surgery.  If it is a hematoma that will disappear over time.  If it is a cyst they can take those off without problems.  If it is a cancer they can probably still remove before it has spread so don't get too worried yet okay?   But take to vet to get it checked first.  Good Luck!|`|xWXCbRXkaa	I would definately see you vet asap and find out all the details .<br>  Good luck !|`|AA11887983	You will only be able to find out a cost when you get him examined by a vet.  It may not be anything serious, but you need to get him checked out.  Then you can get an estimate on the cost of the recommended treatment.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Calm down.  Dogs get all sorts of lumps and bumps as they age.  If this lump really concerns you, have it looked at by your veterinarian.  They might take an aspirate of it to see if they can identify it that way.  If removal is necessary they can give you an estimate for the surgery.<br>  <br>  P.S. Make an appointment on Monday, do not bother your vet over the weekend!  And don't waste $100 at the emergency clinic!  A lump is not an emergency unless your dog is in severe pain.
1WmDOPGtaa	It is likely an infection.  Chances are when he was licking it (before the incision closed) some bacteria got into the incision wound.  Not sure what made it suddenly flare up now, but that's just the way infections are sometimes.  You are right to bring him into the vet tomorrow.  They'll likely clear it up with some antibiotics.  Good luck!|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	I think the actual incision looks normal.  But there is something wrong with the scrotum, it shouldn't be swollen like that.  <br>  <br>  I don't think this is an emergency that needs to be seen over the weekend.  But, I also think you should just make an appointment on Monday instead of just showing up.  You can call up and just say "my dog has a swelling, and I'd like an appointment."|`|3eSzjwEhaa	my dog just got fixed and it is good for them to lick themselves because somehow their saliva helps their own skin. the vet was supposed to give you a paper saying that the dog cant run all the time it should rest so the incision wont open, don't get him wet so no showers, don't et him out that much because the dirt might get in and don't let him eat or drink too much my dog was well after two weeks its good that they lick themselves let him lick himself trust me please|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	Looks like a lick granuloma. Which I'm sure your vet said the same thing since he wanted to keep his tongue off of it.<br>  Lick granuloma's are extremely frustrating(not only to you and your pet-but also to your vet) <br>  So why does he lick at it? Most commonly lick granuloma's are caused by obsessive/compulsive behavior. (We have a police dog named Rico that we have been treating a lick granuloma for two months now-he licked it right down to the bone in one area)<br>  I would keep the e-collar on until you can get in to your vet.<br>  Also I recommend asking your vet about using a cortisone injection-(Vets differ on ways to treat them) We have had a lot of success at my clinic treating them this way. Since this area isn't  a place where bandage will work-again the collar will be needed until the wound is 100% healed!<br>  And typically antibiotics(for the infection) are used the whole duration the wound is there(usually 3-4 weeks time)<br>  Also to control the obsessive behavior meds like Alprazolam or Ace can be used(something you may want to ask about too)<br>  <br>  Pictures of them.<br>  <a href="http://www.my-pet-medicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/Lick%20granuloma.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-pet-medicine.com/wp-conten...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1369/750664220_a76ad8dabc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1369/7506...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.holisticanimals.co.uk/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/DSCF0429.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.holisticanimals.co.uk/sitebui...</a>|`|QGh1MpKIaa	it could be that it got reopened.. is your doggie a hyper pup!? if so talk to the vet about meds to calm him/her down .. i have a black lab and she reopened 3 times before i had to give her meds to calm her down .. the best thing you can do for him/her is bring her/him to the vet and have it looked at befor it gets worse! it could also be infected! it happens but needs to be treated!! good luck i hope all works out .. keep me posted!|`|c6b2982bff7b0fcfa2f93af1c57877c0aa	sounds like he started licking it again.  your going to have to take him back in.  If you can't get back until the weekend is over with you can give him a baby Tylenol for pain and inflammation and try to clean it up and but some ointment on it and I would put some underwear or shorts on him to keep him from agitating it until you got to the vet.  If you have any kids clothes laying around that would work and just cut a whole out for his tale and rear end so he can use the potty.  He could have gotten it infected or something.  My vet told me I could put an ice pack on my dogs scrotum to reduce the swelling.  He's not going to like it and you will need to wrap it in a towel so it's not too cold for him.  Good luck.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Its been a MONTH!  Wow, that looks really infected...your pup needs a round of antibiotics.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	infection possibly, or just irritation, but i wouldnt take any chances, if there is a small possibility that it is infection, because if that gets too bad, then it might spread to his brain, or another part of his body|`|2P5WRadhaa	It's obvious that the dog has developed an infection at the incision site. It could be from external sources that happened before you put the cone on him, or it could be surgery related.( maybe an infected stitch??) If your vet doesn't give you a good answer and positive response and take positive actions to treat this, you should get another vet.|`|339NqJ84aa	When I had my dog neutered, he is a beast (xl sized). My vet said I should have a scrotal ablatation (sp?) where the vet removes the sacks also, because it was a possiblilty that after his neuter his sacks could fill with blood. Maybe you should look into that, and have them removed.|`|RSJTy4cdaa	That looks awful!  It's a month later? If the incision healed and closed up, this should not be happening. I would definitely take that dog back to the vet and demand the vet to treat it properly this time!  Maybe you should put the cone back on again?|`|yrx6GxDcaa	It looks like the lower part has been bleeding and dried under the skin. It will go down over a period of time. I would do what you say and just show up at the vets but i believe it is not serious.
Ka3fbxszaa	I have a drinkwell in a house with 5 cats and one dog. Every single one of them stay away from it except for one. Now, the reason for me buying it was to encourage my cat with flutd to drink more. He, luckily took to it right away. He is also a cat that loves drinking from running faucets.<br>  <br>  If your pets have given you clues that they like running water than it may be worth the money. I went medium range with a $50 model. It really is something your pet has to decide...the rest of the guys just straight up avoid it like they are afraid of it.<br>  <br>  As far as the model itself goes, it can be used with a filter to help purify and declorinate the water, which a lot of cats prefer. You can also use it without the filter and just have the fountain going.|`|AA11736483	DrinkWell is reported to be the most popular. We bought one and none of the cats went near it. It ended up in the garbage.

3WD4ItHXaa	Betta doesnt need a whole lot maybe four or five daily (Squish them up though, because betta has a hard time with whole ones), but I would also switch the food around a bit. Add a pinch of flakes here and there, and maybe some frozen foods as well. Unless you tank has algae, dont add the algaecide, there is no need for it. If you do have algae, there is good chance your bowl or tank is getting sunlight, and would move it. At least that is what I found to be the cause. When you put fresh water in, you should only be adding water conditioner, or letting the water sit out for at least 24 hrs. this dechlorinates the water, otherwise there is a good chance the fish will die from the chlorine in tap water.

KEYgd73saa	I'm pretty sure I've got all you need to know right here: they get about three feet long and need a tank upwards of a couple hundred gallons.  That'll probably be the end to your quest for a pet Two-Spot...  Under the unlikely circumstances that you're actually a very skilled, dedicated aquarist (the kind of aquarist that would go to a real forum for help, not Yahoo! Answers), I'd suggest you look into smaller octopus species, and the hundreds of dollars you'll need to spend on the tank, filters, skimmer, sand, live rock, probably a chiller (particularly if you live somewhere that tops 80 with any frequency), and so many other things, not to mention locating an octopus in the first place.  I'd really suggest you start off a bit easier with something like shrimp and maybe some simpler corals (mushrooms, Xenia, zoanthids, etc.) before jumping into octopus care.
TuHfZdYGaa	My dog eats grass on a daily basis and never throws up.<br>  <br>  That is part myth about it being for an upset tummy.<br>  <br>  It is only true in some cases.<br>  <br>  The real truth is no-one even knows the reason for dogs eating grass. If you keep a patch of grass un-mowed like I do, theres a good chance your dog will chew on grass more often than you think.<br>  <br>  Those who have studies wolf behaviour and diet say it may be to replace missing nutrients. Whilst a dog cannot digest the cellulose structure of the plant, minute amounts of the juice may be digested and utilised.<br>  <br>  It is also said that the extra fibre may help flush the system of parasites and bone debri.<br>  <br>  Only on the odd occasion is it for an upset tummy.|`|AA10560304	Well first off all the dogs have an immune system which is suitable for meat. When they eat the grass the bacteria in the grass helps the dogs digestive system to flush all the unwanted bacteria in their system which will make them vomit or even purging for a few days.

YnCUyvK7aa	You use a feeding clip.  It's like a clothes pin on 1 side [for holding the cucumber] and a suction cup on the other [to stick to the side of the tank].  <a href="http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/cat/infoL3/22866/category.web" rel="nofollow">http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/cat/info...</a><br>  <br>  I've also read about people spearing the cucumber with a fork and the weight of the fork sinks it.<br>  <br>  There's a metal corkscrew type thing called a screwcumber that you can get too.  <a href="http://www.screwcumber.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.screwcumber.com/</a>|`|zqVDJxUIaa	You can place a smooth pebble on top of it and sink it to the bottom, or try covering up part of it with gravel.

I tried to so this, and it never sank, it just got stuck in the filter and continued to float, so I had to fish it out. They didnt eat it anyways. I would buy the algae disks.

Rw7gi86Naa	Because she knows that meowing at the door gets your attention, and probably only wants some petting. Cats love to plop on the floor in a very cute way, hoping that we say "Awww," and pet them.|`|0emslEdiaa	Sounds like it.  My cat, Gyoza, will smack the blinds and throw my glasses onto the floor and when I get up, he runs into the bathroom so I can turn the faucet on.  Sometimes, I get up several times a night to give him water and half the time he doesn't even want it.  He just wants to piss me off.
aeonmRR2aa	Tentatively:  No, it is not overstocked, and it can accept those additional fish easily.  But please keep reading.<br>  <br>  In an aquarium, people tend to consider that 20 gallons minimum and a total ratio of 1 goldfish (common) per 10 gallons is safe.  That's assuming 12" to 22" deep.  For a pond, it really depends on the depth - deeper ponds will hold fewer fish, since surface area is crucial.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the climate and filtration are important.  The warmer the climate (and less shade the pond gets), the fewer fish.  In a windy area, more fish can be supported.  The less aeration and water movement, the fewer fish.  Filter capacity in ponds is also typically not very good unless the person is an enthusiast who built a massive custom oystershell/lava rock/trash can filter, for example.  <br>  <br>  However, ponds have the advantage of massive algae growth.  Algae is somewhat beneficial, since it absorbs waste.  Floating plants like water hyacinths are excellent for cleaning ponds (of waste compounds like nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia).<br>  <br>  If conditions are ideal - strong filtration, shallow (20" or less), decent water movement (say, 4000 gph), and a cool, windy climate, with lots of floating plants...  you could probably stock 50 goldfish with no problems.  In a hot, windless area with little shade, no floating plants, no filtration, no bubblers, no forced water movement, and no water changes...  I'm not sure.  4 koi and 8 comets might be close to the limit.  For koi to goldfish equivalence, I would assume 1" inch of koi is similar to 4" or so of goldfish.

ctiKoGGfaa	Some areas in Mi have BSL, if you contact police and you have BSL and the breed is on that list, they would come take it away due to killing livestock.|`|PM23RDycaa	Talking hasn't solved the problem so everyone needs to take photos of the dog on their property and writ down the time and date. After each incident go talk with the neighbor. do this for about a week and then EVERYONE needs to talk with your local animal control. You will have proof of what the dog does the fact he's off his property ad the fact the owners have not done anything to prevent that. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately nothing can be done about your animal because it wasn't reported at the time it happened.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Yes, you certainly do.  Most places its illegal for a dog to be unrestrained like that.<br>  <br>  Call the police/law and get them involved somehow since they don't seem to be willing to do anything based on subtlety.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I would call animal control.  Most areas have leash laws.  The dog owner is lucky.  I live in a rural area and I have farmers for neighbors.  If my dogs killed their livestock they would shoot my dogs no questions asked.|`|Whj6KC6Jaa	i know right.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	For killing your pets/livestock you need to file a police report.  In most places you can shoot any dog that is on your property harassing livestock or killing. Simply call police & AC on them & file a complaint.  It would be best if your other neighbor does also so it isn't just one on one.  Once they get fined & have to pay for your killed livestock, they will keep him up or surrender him.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Call the police, and ask them what department you are supposed to report a nuisance dog to.  They may have an animal control department or a dog warden for your town.  <br>  <br>  You can sue when someone's dog kills your livestock.  It would be a trivial amount of money, but at least it would send the message "Keep your dog on your own *%$& property!"|`|6LoVKfOxaa	You have to find out what your local (Town/County) laws governing dog ownership are and then start documenting and reporting everything.  You have lived with this for 5 yrs and it could take a few months to get enough documentation to have the local law enforcement do something to help you and your neighbor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	Call the dog warden|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Ooooh, a livestock killer!  There's probably something you can do with that.  I would call the cops and find out exactly what your rights are in your area regarding that.  Most places that allow livestock are pretty harsh on dogs that kill livestock and pretty harsh on the people that own the dogs.  <br>  <br>  The trouble is ... if your neighbors are asses, they might respond to complaints in a negative way.  So, before you call the cops and get them involved as yourself if you think these people are waked out enough to go after the rest of your animals if you call the cops on their dog.  And if they are, I'd make sure to set up some video cameras after you complain and make sure the police know that you think they'll kick back that way.  You just never know what people like that will do.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I feel for you.  Having idiot neighbors is never fun.|`|rrCNaytvaa	Well, i live in Australia and in such instances I would go to the local coucil or contact the local RSPCA (You may also have this in America). They would be able to guide you on what course of actions you are able to take. What your neighbours are doing is irresponsible. If we are to keep pets we need to take responsibility for them and if we don't there are consequences. i lost my pooch in a dog attack  because the neighbours dog wasn't under control. And in another instant when he was younger, another dog entered my yard and attacked him, he was ok but was very injured - i did not take action but i wish i did. If this dog does damage to other animals on your property take photographs for evidence.|`|zituIhQ2aa	legally you have the right to shoot the dog..but I would not do that. ... perhaps just letting your neighbor know how you feel... let them know that the law says you have the right to defend your livestock. <br>  Contact the local animal control and let them know what is going on and that you are at wits end<br>  good luck and don't do anything you will regret
4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Your dog is very protecting of you & that's what you want. Don't scold her for doing what comes natural to most all dogs.

She's a very loyal dog & you should be grateful.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	well first, try with just one dog, let her meet this dog, and then when you see that she is friendly with the new dog, tie her leash to something, and let her watch this new dog come and greet you and show your dog that this dog means no harm, then gradually, dont tie her up, and soon shell be completly fine|`|mwVCFlLTaa	Jen has a good answer on resource guarding, though I don't think its all training and relationship related- some dogs simply resource guard more than others.  Jean Donaldson has a book called "Mine!" about resource guarding that I recommend and I think Patricia McConnell has a book out on this subject as well.<br>  <br>  However, it could also be related to going into season, as she is just about the age when some dogs will go into their first season (some go much later, my pup was 18months before her first season) and female dogs often behave strangely at that time.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	I, just wouldn't go to the doggie park.  They are dangerous places. You do not know  which dog has had it's shots....or which may  be incubating a disease that your dog will come down w/next wk...or which will decide to tear your dog up.<br>  Why can't you and  your husband just take your dog for a walk...why do you have to expose her to all that is in the park?   I would NEVER go there.|`|GKZPxAaPaa	Your dog has taken the roll of "pack leader".  She is in front and in charge of the pack which means she will be the protector and hunter.  Taking her in for training will help. It's good to do it anyway. If she's already been to puppy class go to an advanced trainer and learn how to become the pack leader.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	That is resource guarding ... and you're the resource.<br>  <br>  She's starting to grow up and this sort of behavior, unfortunately, shows where you've missed with training.  This dog needs some serious obedience classes or this behavior will escalate.  <br>  <br>  To put it simply, for the dog to be "protecting" you from other dogs, it doesn't view you all as strong leaders that don't need it's protection.  In other words, your dog thinks it's the boss.  Barking, growling and starting fights at 10 months does not bode well unless you're committed to training and socializing this dog properly.  <br>  <br>  You'll want to contact a behaviorist/trainer that works with dogs with aggression issues - not your local petsmart obedience classes.  This problem can probably be fixed pretty quickly, but ... petsmart and their all positive training on a gentle leader training, just doesn't cut it.<br>  <br>  Not being spayed, she has hormonal rushes ... think PMS lol.<br>  <br>  Soothing the dog ... wrong answer.  That's praising the dog for being aggressive and will encourage the behavior.<br>  <br>  I agree dog parks are not the greatest place for dogs.  They really aren't.  But, I still think the dog needs more obedience training.  Because if you are seeing this behavior at the dog park, you will also see this behavior when the dog is on leash walking around other dogs.  Do you really want your dog starting fights in the vets office when you go?  No, you don't.  more training even if you stop going to dog parks.|`|n0WnEIopaa	What kind of dog?<br>  <br>  Is she spayed?<br>  <br>  Unspayed animals, due to hormones, around other dog become more protective of their "pack." It makes a huge<br>  difference. <br>  <br>  The first advice any vet will give to owners with an animal that is showing signs of aggression, is to spay or neuter the animal, to eliminate the hormones that cause the animal to be protective, which turns into aggession.<br>  <br>  Right around 6-8 months if your animal is not spayed you will generally start seeing unwanted behaviours that are generally corrected by spaying/neutering.|`|xWXCbRXkaa	She is protecting you. My dog is the same sometimes. The thing you have to do, is show her the other dogs are no harm. Go up to the other dog and start petting it and telling that dog he/she is a good dog.

But don 't forget to give your dog some attention. <br>  Good luck !|`|xdN3G87Haa	my dog does that for 2 reasons he thinks the dog is going to us me <br>  or hes jealous<br>  all you can do is show him or her the other dog wont do anything wrong and just discipline your dog <br>  hope this help|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Non-altered (not fixed) dogs are usually more aggressive. Please get her fixed so she doesn't accidentally end up pregnant and add to the millions of other dogs being put down daily in the US simply because no one wants them. But as for the other dogs, find out what her favorite treat is and she only gets that treat when other dogs are around and she is being calm. Hold the treat up by your eyes and say "watch me". This command will help focus her attention on you and not the other dogs. If she behaves favorably, give her a treat and tons of praise. Get friends with other dogs to walk with you, have your dog follow. Other dogs are less threatening from behind. Sounds like she simply needs to be socialized more.  Get her to meet as many different dogs every day as you possibly can. This won't be immediate, but there should be improvements.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Sorry but you will just have to be patient. You can give him some soaks in nice warm water which help mine or you can buy a reptile product called shed ease and that helps too. Whatever you do DON"T pull the skin off. If you do you will injure the scales below the skin and you don't want to do that.|`|FVo3DJ3kaa	You can put him in a warm bath (up to shoulders) but make sure it can walk around and touch the bottom.

S6ie5HwBaa	Most people are surprised to learn that we have a very large pet overpopulation problem here in the United States. There are so many animals born DAILY that it boggles the mind! This is a nightmare problem that doesn’t ever seem to get better. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that there are over 70,000 puppies and kittens born every twenty-four hours. That is a whole lot of babies! To even attempt to place those numbers of animals is impossible. There are about seven animals to every human born. The sad fact is that just is not possible to place them all. <br>  <br>  Every year over 20 million animals end up in a shelter. Over 15 million of them are killed (euthanized is the nice term). Of those animals 61% of the dogs and 75% of the cats are killed. Very few of these are claimed and there are many more that die from disease, starvation, animal attacks and cars! Anyone who sees these facts must agree that not neutering an animal is contributing to mass cruelty and irresponsibility! <br>  <br>  Many people feel that neutering an animal is cruel, it isn’t. The fact is that it is actually much healthier and more beneficial to your animal. The terms related to this procedure "fixed" and "spayed" for the females ( Terms: "*****" for dogs or "Queen" for cats ) or "altered" for the male (Terms: "Dog" for canines or "Tom" for cats) are pretty negative but the procedure is a very loving and positive thing to do for your pet. <br>  <br>  Benefits to your pet after neutering mean that females have less chance of ovarian cancer or uterine infections if it is done before their first "heat". Each cycle they experience increases the chances of illness greatly, as much as ten times each! The other benefit is that you will not have to clean up the mess which happens during her cycle! The behavior benefits mean that your pooch or feline will be calmer and more reliable. You also won’t have to bat the male dogs or cats away and deal with the fence climbing, dirt digging, fence destroying mongrels or yowling, prowling, spraying and fighting tom cats! <br>  <br>  Neutering your pet is just as important! It takes only one escape to find a female and become a villain of pet overpopulation. One cat and her kits will produce over 420,000 cats in about seven years! Males who are neutered have less of a desire to roam, fight, mark and be destructive. They also have less problems with the prostate gland and testicular cancer. From a behavioral standpoint, neutered animals are more reliable, stable and have about sixty percent (60%) less problems than those left "intact." <br>  <br>  Veterinarians are now able to neuter animals at younger ages, some as early as two to four months of age! Traditionally, most veterinary offices will perform this procedure at six months. It is cheaper and easier to neuter the younger animals as many clinics will charge by weight.<br>  <a href="http://www.cyberpet.com/cyberdog/articles/general/overpopl.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberpet.com/cyberdog/article...</a><br>  <br>  Don't forget the dumbo website that make up stuff about spaying/neutering is bad & encourage people NOT to spay their cats/dogs!

Alot of people when they adopt a cat, figure the cat will never go outside, it will never get out, and its just an animal whats the harm. <br>  Most people don't have the connections to hear about how to get cheap neuters/spays. Call shelters, humane societys, they have coupons, they'll get it done for you, and so many other wonderful choices. <br>  Lately it's been hard with forclosure's, people feeling like they have "no choice", but to let their pets out and be "free". <br>  And sadly, there's no way to spay and nueter every single cat. The best we can do is support the trap neuter release program, and monitor cat colonies.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I hear you.

Most people don't know how serious the problem of overpopulation is.  Others just don't care.  Some are concerned with price.  Truth is, with the programs available, there is no reason anyone couldn't afford to have their pet fixed.  Most could cut out a few trips to McDonalds or the movies and pay for it.<br>  <br>  I think every potential pet owner should have to work in a shelter for a month and take pet classes prior to owning one.  Most have never been inside a shelter past the waiting room and can't imagine the horror behind the lobby doors. We desperately need more education on the subject of pet overpopulation and how to reverse it.|`|LURQBU86aa	I think there's multiple reasons. People get their pet and want to breed it because kittens and puppies are cute. Another reason is ignorance, people just don't know how many animals are euthanized each year, and the benefits of spaying and neutering. One more reason is people don't have the money for it (and they really shouldn't be owning pets if they can't afford it...) and don't know about the many low cost spay/neuter programs. Some people also think that's it's cruel and unecessary surgery.|`|EIxu1Gtraa	because there are not many people<br>  'like you' who take the time to educate cat owners<br>  on spaying and neutering their pets<br>  then they get stuck with new animals <br>  I believe we need to raise more awareness<br>  but hey thats just me.|`|mcmOslOFaa	I AM WITH YOU BOB!!!!!  what you said is what I think everday when people think it is cute cause their cat just had a 1/2 dozen kittens that will eventually end up pregnant again, dead on the side of the road or homeless somewhere!!

Those people are irresponsible, deliberately ignorant (stupid) and even mean because they're adding to animal cruelty by allowing their animals to reproduce unchecked, thereby adding to the number of animals that will be killed each year.<br>  <br>  As for the respondent who said if we neuter them all there won't be any kittens...... there is no way we could get them all spayed and neutered at this point, all we can hope to do is lower the number of animals who end up slaughtered at shelters each year because there are no homes for them.... that number is in the MILLIONS... so when you look at those kittens you allowed to be created out of your own lack of common sense, I want you to envision the kittens that died in their stead that could have been adopted instead and think about that reality.<br>  <br>  Maybe we need bumper stickers that say "Spay/Neuter... Just Get It Done Already" or "15 MILLION animals die in shelters each year, spay/neuter and don't add to it".
Wt61EclRaa	She NEEDS to be in a crate. Like it or not. Unless you are there all day to walk her and teach her to go outside then in the crate she goes. It is not mean at all and you shouldn't feel bad. Only if you kept her crated for hours and hours-that would be cruel. While you are not there crate her. She needs to be properly potty trained. This takes a lot of time and dedication. Get up before school and walk her. Don't just stick her out in the yard. Walk her and tell her how wonderful she is when she potties outside. Make sure she is emptied out. Bring her in and give her a small treat and some water. Put her immedietly in her crate. As soon as you come home from school walk her and make sure she poops and pees.....again PRAISE her soooo much like she is the best thing in the world. Let her see how happy you are. Play with her and you can leave her out of her crate while you are home and closely suppervising her at alllllll times. Don't let her out of your site. after an hour take her out again on a leash and if she pees-which she probably will PRAISE her. What a good girl. Feed her dinner...wait a little while and walk her again...PRAISE her when she goes outside. play with her....before bedtime take her out again....tell her she is the bestest doggy in the world in a really happy voice. Put her in the crate or keep her with you for the night. Get up the next morning and repeat. Clean up all the spots where she has gone with a really good neutrulizing cleaner. she should NOT have full access to the house unsupervised. If you are watching her at all times you can catch her before she has an accident. She only aims to please you and it is not her fault she is doing this in the house. She doesn't know any better. If you start this program of a consistent schedule she will start to behave herself. If you don't do this then eventually your parents might tell you that she has to go...and that would be so sad. If you wanted this little girl then you have to teach her what is expected of her. Good luck. Eventually she might be able to not have to be in a crate. But since she wasn't trained then this is what has to be done. Don't set her up for failure because you are too busy. She deserves the best and she will give it in return.|`|2P5WRadhaa	You HAVE tro crate train the dog if you want any peace and relief from her toilet habits. Why Crate train?<br>  1) The crate will be considered by the dog to be it's bedding area.<br>  <br>  2) By instinct, a dog will not normally soil it's bedding area, so<br>  <br>  3) Little by little it will learn to control it's bladder & bowels to where it can go 10 - 12 hours (without suffering any difficulties or pain or discomfort) without going potty. <br>  <br>  4) This will give you freedom to go to work or other places during the day with your dog crated so it won't be soiling your carpets, etc.<br>  <br>  **You mentioned "feeling bad" if you crate the dog????You'll have to conquer those feelings if you EVER expect to have any success with your dogs. The dogs do fine with the crate, if you'll just take the time to train it.<br>  <br>  A.  Start when you have  2 - 4 hrs or better (Make time if you have to) by crating the dog immediately after walking it for short (2- hour)  periods, or untilit potties in the crate. Note the amount of time it was crated, and continue the process day by day backing up the amount of time he stays next tme. Let him out and walk him immediately after uncrating him. (Do this more times on W/E and when you're home for extended periods of time. Slowly incrase the amount of time you crate him, say, one hour more every other day. Soon you can crate him overnight. You may have to walok him once during the night to begin with, but he will soon catch on to the schedule.<br>  <br>  The key to his training is your committment and consistency. If you'rfe not committed and consistent, He'll nefer train.Remember, it's a Chihuahua, and very hyper and tempermental. so work with him. I know it's a lot of trouble, but if you're gonna own a dog and treat it right you need to put your personal feelings on the back burner and do the right thing for the animal. Good Luck|`|5uOiZeLiaa	You should seriously do something about it quick. If the dog is nota affected by your teaching, it's habits could be permanent.<br>  <br>  I suggest a "doggy preschool" where instructors teach your little puppy. Or hire a trainer. Or call the Dog Whisperer. XD|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Chis be notoriously hard to housebreak.  Buy big bag of economy puddle pads at the pet store.  Close her in the bathroom or wherever you can confine her and put enough pads down to cover most of the floor.  Now comes the hard part.  Spend a lot of time in there with her.  Read a book.  Do homework.  Talk on phone.  Whatever.  Whenever she does her business on the paper, praise her lavishly but calmly.  A tiny treat can help at first, but the praise is the key.  She won't have any idea what she did, but that's where your hard work comes in.  If she starts to go when she's not on the paper, just say 'no' in a normal voice, move her to the paper and start the praise.  So you get a little pee or poop on your hands.  Big deal.  There's papertowels, toilet paper and soap and water.  I guarantee it will wash off.  This is all a matter of timing.  You have to be tuned into her rythyms.  Notice how long after eating or drinking she has to go.  Put her on the papers first thing when you wake up--no matter what the hour.  SLOWLY put down fewer papers.  Don't be stubborn.  She can only learn as fast as you are able to teach her--so guess who is the slow one . . . !  When she starts getting the idea, pick a spot where she has gone in the past in another room and put pads down there.  Don't get upset and don't make a big deal out of her 'mistakes.'  It really isn't her fault.  She is a tiny dog with a tiny bladder and intestinal tract.  She can't possibly hold it as long as you would like.  She will have to be confined whenever you leave the house--just make sure she has her puddle pads along with her water.  Take them with you everywhere you take her.  Some don't like to go when they are outside.  If she does, make an idiot of yourself telling her how good she is.  It's all about consistantly reinforcing good behavior and not setting her up for failure. <br>  <br>  Remember, whether you have meant to or not, you have taught her what she does.  Un-teaching is harder, but it's your job.  She's depending on you to make your life together a happy one for both of you.|`|TPWs85H1aa	Crate training is the best solution. Dogs are den animals and want to keep their den clean. Crates simulate a den and the dog will work it's hardest to not mess in the crate. Take the dog out regularly. As the dog goes to the bathroom, say a bridge word like poop or something you wont say in normal conversation. After a few weeks the dog will learn that word means potty and learn outside is where it's done. The crate is healthy for the dog too. He will have his own little room to be alone in and feel safe. It also will build confidence in him. It also will build his control over his bladder.|`|wbWm5Eswaa	i got this book and it said with little dogs that try harder that instead of enforcing what their doing bad by hitting just tap them on the nose and when they do what their supposed to pet them, or give them a treat. <br>  <br>  Training Your Pint-Sized Companion is a book that really helps and worked wonders with me and my dogs. you can check amazon if you would like to  purchase it.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|GEXxB6Sjaa	Don't ever hit a dog for any reason.  Talking to her in a firm voice is much better than screaming at her.  You can put her in a crate while you are gone.  She won't pee in her cage.  When she pees on the floor tell her no and take her outside.  Keep doing that and she should pick it up.  Show her how to go to the door when she needs to go potty.  Be patient and continue to work with her.|`|3eSzjwEhaa	i had the same problem when my d was a pup he always pooped and peed everywhere in the house until we gotsick of it so we started yelling at him that was the only way and also we would use our index finger and hit him in his mouth. we also waked him in his behind all the time and now he is all grown up and he goes to use so we could open the door to the backyard and he also just waits infront of the door so we could open it for him hoped i helped!|`|CeJrap6Uaa	The best way to stop a dog from peeing in the house is when ever you cache it make it site by the spot it peed for 30 hole minuets DO not let it lay down and DO not let it levee till you tell it to. Dog are a lot of work if you can’t be at home to supervise it for most of the day you will ether have to tack it to a dog daycare or get ride of it. Also keep it in a cage a night its better for the dog.|`|RdeoVdlIaa	well first of all you cant leave an intrained dog at home for 7 hours alone. how exactly are you traing your dog. it took me a while two but this  tecnique worked. first u pick a bathroom area for you dog. at first youll have to walk her their. while u walk her  call out a word like bathroom or something like outside. keep her in her area until she pees. reward her when she goes. if you catch her peein g somewhere else dont yell use like loud stern voice. just keep on repeating the words and keep taking her out. oh and she shoud go out a certain door. that way when she needs to go she goes to the door and cries or scratches(thats what my dog does) oh and ive heard of some pple attaching bells to their doors.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	The first thing to do is to ask your veterinarian.<br>  I'm guessing that she's having separation anxiety...she gets really nervous and scared when left home alone.  Dogs are pack animals.  They're not made to be completely alone for hours on end - especially when they're young.  They'll do all kinds of things like pooping, tearing things up, etc.  Chihuahuas (and some other breeds) tend to be a little high strung anyway. <br>  <br>  I got my wire-haired terrier a kitten to keep her company. She'd chew up my books, pull all the tp off the roll....just tear up my apartment while I was gone during the day. She was three years old and still not housebroken although I finally got her trained to go on a newspaper.  After the kitten came into her life, she was still hyper (most terriers are) but she didn't destroy anything and she only did her business outside.<br>  <br>  If a kitten isn't possible, the vet can prescribe medication for her.<br>  <br>  It's wonderful that you've made a commitment to your little friend's welfare but it's important when selecting a dog to get one that complements your lifestyle. Otherwise you both end up suffering. (I've never followed that rule much and always seem to end up with the "tough cases" that nobody else will take....but I've loved them all;-)|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Well, I'm glad you don't want to hit her or scream at her, considering that would be detrimental. You can't housebreak a dog solely through punishment.<br>  <br>  Someone else provided a great summary of crate training. For more information, please do browse these two pages:<br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/crate_training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.perfectpaws.com/crt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfectpaws.com/crt.html</a><br>  <br>  Okay, here are the basics of housebreaking. You take the dog outside very often (once every hour or two) is good, and you wait until she relieves herself. You then throw a party of praise, treats, cuddles and playing. You make pottying outside the best thing in the world because if she has formed the positive association that she'll be rewarded for going outside, she'll want to go outside so she can be rewarded. It's very simple. It's also why you should never get a puppy if you cannot be home pretty much all day to housebreak it. Puppies need to eliminate very often. Had you had the time to stay home and housebreak her two years ago, you wouldn't have this problem. As it is, as an adult, she is now able to hold it for much longer periods of time. She *might* be able to actually hold it the entire time you're at school, but you chose a toy breed. Naturally, tiny dogs have tiny bladders. Thus, she can't really hold it for too long.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should just use those puppy potty pads. You know, the indoors ones.<br>  <br>  Also, so you know, your dog is not a puppy. She is a full-fledged adult. Larger dogs mature slowly and are indeed considered puppies until two (and older for giant breeds), but you have one of the smallest breeds possible. (The Chihuahua, that is. "Mini" is a description of her size, there's no such breed as a Mini Chihuahua.) Your dog's been an adult since she was about a year old.

JLpuVudGaa	your dog is  just marking its territory|`|TPWs85H1aa	The dog may be not correctly house trained or may be marking it's territory, either way it has to stop. teach your dog correct behavior by taking him out often, when he is going, say a bridge word like let loose or potty, some thing that wont come up in normal conversation ( i use Los, the German word for Go) say the word as he is going. After a few weeks the dog will associate potty with outside and the word with pottying.

mwVCFlLTaa	feeding twice a day is a good schedule for dogs over 6 months, except for some small breeds which need more frequent feeding due to issues with hypoglycemia.<br>  <br>  Barking and going crazy over shadows is a bad thing, and may signal an obsessive-compulsive disorder.  JRTs do have a higher incidence of OCD than many other breeds.  Medication is often necessary, and if your vet is unsure about which medication or what dosage, the Univ of Penn vet behaviorists will do free consults to the vet.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	twice a day, have a set time at meals, so that his stomach doesnt get funky, and a like amount, you never know, you just have to kind of, like experiment with amount,<br>  and uhh pedigree is a trusted brand, and it happens to feed dogs nicely|`|Wt61EclRaa	Your vet can tell you how much to feed him.  We don't really know his weight and how much exercise he gets.  Does he get enough mental/physical stimulation.  This sounds like a bored dog to me.

This makes for well behaved dogs.|`|tvtZV32oaa	well, i'd give him a tiny bowl twice a day, (a good sized handful if he is a tiny dog) once in the morning when you eat breakfast, and once in the evening when you are eating dinner. <br>  dogs like routine, and this would be a great routine for you and your dog =D<br>  also, i find that my dog doesnt eat dry food sometimes also, when this happens, i add only a tiny bit of like chicken or meat from the night before to make it more appetizing, or add a tiny bit of water to his dish.<br>  well i guess for the shadow thing, try telling him its okay, and when he stops, give him a treat.  convincing your dog that everythings okay in a soothing voice and a treat should cure it, otherwise, call a pet trainer because this could be resolved with help from someone more experienced.|`|wJdAybRnaa	For the food issue, there are guidelines on the bag/can (on the back). All foods require different amounts based on protein and fat concentrations, calories, etc. If it's a concentrated food you feed less and vice versa. Also be sure to feed twice a day!<br>  <br>  But you shouldn't feed Puppy Chow or Pedigree they are horrible. dogfoodanalysis.com and dogfoodproject.com are good resources. Innova, Evo, Wellness, Orijens, Holistic Select, California Natural, Natural Balance, etc. are good. Expensive but better for the dog (they get their protein from meat and not from corn!). Look for a food with no wheat, soy, or corn (corn in small quantities might be okay for some dogs, but in the breed I have it causes allergies). Barley, rice, potatoes, and other things are good grains. I won't give you the raw food or grain-free diet info but you can look that up if you want.
uJBnZWtcaa	Kitty doesn't hate you.  Boy kittens and cats tend to be more aloof and stand-offish than girl kitties.  After many girl cats, I've got a guy now.  We play chase and hide and seek (I hide, he comes looking for me).  But he doesn't sleep on the bed unless it's a really cold night and he hates being under the covers.  My girl cats were always under the covers - even in the middle of the day.  Like all mammal males, boy cats and kittens produce a lot of their own heat from muscle activity so they rarely seek out warm places unless they're older.  My furry guy has gotten cuddlier since he's gotten older and settled down.  Make your bedroom the kitten's safe place.  Take some food in your bedroom and feed him there every once and awhile.  And keep your pesky brother out.<br>  <br>  A little brother is his big sister's nervous breakdown on two legs. (I had one.  I hated him when we were young but we became great friends once we were separated by a couple thousand miles:-)  He's gone now - an accident - but when we were young he drove me crazy.) He should go easy on the kitten while it's still a baby or there's a chance the kitty will grow up afraid of people. Four months old is still too young for rough play especially if you want a nice, loving kitty. Won't your parents speak up about his hassling it? <br>  <br>  Some kitties are born cuddlier than others.  Most don't get really cuddly until they're older. Just like people they've got their teenage years to get through.  Cats are active and curious. They're either asleep or busy, busy, busy doing cat things....especially kittens.  Spend a lot of time with your kitty.  This sounds stupid, but talk to him as much as you can.  Pick him up and carry him around talking to him.  If he wants down, put him down.  A few minutes later, pick him up again.  I take my cat to the window and talk to him about what's outside...just to bond.  All the talking has a purpose....the cat is used to my voice and responds to it.<br>  <br>  Just like people, sometimes cats can't be exactly what we want them to be but they'll meet us half way and we'll be OK with that.|`|UETAqR8Taa	He wouldnt hate you.

The cat is not getting enough nutrients from her food because the worm load is depleting her. Both your cats need to be spayed and vetted properly. If allowed to roam outdoors they need a fecal check and worming about every 6 months, or at least every year at the very least.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	Worms can depleted the cats of most of their calories and vitamins.

The intestinal parasites don't help, and some of them can affect the haircoat.

There may be more going on.
IJr0MR1Aaa	Potty training is easiest when you use a crate.  Use a crate that the pup can stand, lie down on side and turn around in easily.  A four month old pup will be able to go all night without needing to potty as long as you take her out last thing before bed time.  . <br>  <br>  Crate puppy at night.  In morning, let pup outside without other dog and say whatever word/s you want to use, such as "go potty."  She will need to go after holding it all night, so should soon comply.  Say "good potty" as she is going.  Then let other dog out and let them play for a while.  After feedings, repeat.  After any indoor play has been going on for a while, repeat.  After she tanks up on a lot of water, repeat.<br>  <br>  If pup won't go potty, for any of the above situations, put her in crate for anywhere from 1/2 hr to 2 hrs during the day.  When you let her out, repeat potty ritual.  If she still doesn't potty, back into crate.<br>  <br>  She will soon discover that pottying earns her play time with your other dog, and not pottying gets her boring time out in crate.|`|3eSzjwEhaa	when i got my german Shepperd pup he always peed and pooped inside so we started punishing him by yelling at him we didn't hit him because that is just abuse so we yelled really loud and with one finger the index finger we hit him in the mouth. now he is grown up he is 5 and he comes to us when he wants to go to the restroom or he waits by the backyard door so we could let him out. you could also just try whacking him with a little force on his behind so he could learn a little more hoped i helped!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Since Luna just wants to play with Ozzie, why don't you make that her reward for peeing outside? Don't just let both dogs out. Bring Luna outside on a leash by herself. As soon as she pees, throw a party! Treats, praise, and immediately let Ozzie out to come play with her. She'll learn that she doesn't get what she wants (treats, to play with Ozzie) until she just pees outdoors where she should. Now, the first couple times, it might take a little while for her to catch on. Do not be impatient, it'll probably take more than just a minute or two or waiting. But once she catches on (I pee outside = I get yummy food and lots of play), she'll be much quicker to pee. Eventually, once she's in the habit of peeing immediately when she goes out, you can try letting her out, and then letting Ozzie out a second after her, maybe on a leash, then without the leash.<br>  <br>  Do you bring her back indoors once she finally pees? If so, that may be contributing to why she holds it until she's back in the house. She knows that once she pees, the fun playing ends and she goes back inside. That's why the treats and playing should come after she relieves herself, to reward her instead of inadvertently punishing her.|`|1EroqHC3aa	Well, as much as they seem to enjoy themselves with each other, it is important to take the new puppy out by herself.  Other dogs will distract her and make the process of potty training so much harder.  Plus, you can use the other dog as a reward, in effect, by bringing her in to play once she has done her business outside.  However, it will take more than a couple of accidents before your new puppy is housebroken.  Go outside with the new puppy on a leash by herself.  When she pees/poops praise lavishly and give her a special treat.  At 20 weeks, she should be able to hold for a few hours, but you will need to walk her within 10-15 minutes of drinking water or eating and as soon as she wakes up.  Do not just put her out on a chain as she will want to get back to you and will not focus on doing her business.  You must go out with her by herself on a leash.  Good luck.
30GklpTYaa	The food depends on which brand you buy, I can't really say anything because I feed my both my dogs homemade food :P. But I recommend dry food such as "Puppy Science Diet" or "Iams Puppy Chow" something like that - You can buy them at PECO, Petsmart, Walmart, and maybe Monsterpet.<br>  <br>  As for potty training, let your pug out often like everytime it wakes up from a nap, when you finish playing with it, after it finishes eatting, etc. Whenever it pees/poos in the wrong spot tell it "no badboy/girl" but don't hit it because that'll just make it hide from you whenever it uses the bathroom. Instead, everytime it pees/poos in the RIGHT spot, encourage it, say something like "goodboy/girl" and reward with a treat or a click (if you have a clicker). Clickers actually make training a lot easier becaause when it clicks it's like translating to doggy language and telling the dogs that they did a good job :]<br>  ~Hope this helps :D|`|xQsMPtFGaa	take them outside constantly!!<br>  every half hour or so.<br>  when they go potty outside use praise! lots of it!!!<br>  give him/her puppy food.<br>  <br>  if you dont know what to feed dog, maybe you shouldnt get one.<br>  im an avid pug lover, so you better not hurt the poor little thing.|`|8aOTvtEUaa	As for food you feed it whatever the breeder was feeding it, you can change the food but you have to slowly do it by adding a little of the old food into the new food because switching their food will upset her stomach. I would recommend Wellness, Canidae, or Innova. Science diet, pedigree, iams etc they are all full of fillers and pugs have a tendency to become overweight, so I would really be careful about what you give it. <br>  As for potty training if it goes in the house just ignore it, clean it up. Yelling or hitting the dog will just make her scared to go in front of you and she will hide from you next time she has to go. Bring her out every hour or after she has eaten or napped and when she does go outside give her a treat and tons of praise. It takes a little while for them to get it but just be patient Don't use potty pads unless you want her to use them always, it will confuse them if they are allowed to go in the house, then all of a sudden they aren't|`|lFTynrRVaa	If your puppy is small than put a cartoon in the corner of the house where you want keep it  & put one old news paper in it at floor. Now put your puppy on it in the cartoon for some days & change the old news paper daily. Now put these soiled news paper & cartoon at the place where you want that puppy should do potty there in future.<br>   Now after giving food or milk give a walk to your puppy up to that place where you have put soiled news paper & potty & let it smell there & move it around this place. Give such walks after every one to two hours for one to two weeks puppy will not spoil in your house, Some times puppy will move in circle with some peculiar Noise, it means it want to go for potty & after some days you will also notice its activities about it.|`|rWGzVUxOaa	Potty training:  buy lots of pee training pads and place them in a corner so your puppy knows where it is ok to pee.  When it gets older, bring the soiled pads outside so that it gets the idea that it should still pee on the pads but they are outside now and slowly remove the pads.  Food is easy.  Just buy a healthy brand like science diet or beneful but make sure it it the one for PUPPY, not for adults.|`|yIm2tWryaa	my last puppy, i didn't use training pads and it worked better than my puppy before that<br>  <br>  to me, the training pads teach the dog where it's ok to pee in the house, which is essentially the idea, but what happens when the pad isn't there?<br>  <br>  It helps to keep the pup on a schedule.  He should eat everyday at the same time.  15 to 20 minutes after eating he should be taken out and told to go potty.  Every half hour i would take him outside and tell him to go potty.  When he went potty, I gave him lots of praise.  If you see him to start smell the carpet inside near corners, specifically, he probably needs to go potty.  Immediately pick him up and take him outside and tell him to go potty.  I kept the puppy in a crate for several weeks after bringing him home.  Dogs won't potty in their living quarters, so it helped train him to potty outside.  <br>  <br>  I would say my pup got the hand of going potty outside and were accident free indoors in about three weeks.  <br>  <br>  As far as food goes, you want to avoid anything that has the word "meal" in the ingredients list.  I have a shar pei and he has lots of allergies.  But using this website <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a>  I found food that was good for him and didn't give him outbreaks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4Z5GPuORaa	Take the puppy out quite frequently........feed him with dog food for puppies........ask the doctor every thing in detail...........be very careful abt the little fellows diet...........cause they are very greedy at this stage & can't resist from eating anything & everything.........|`|l6dXJu6Gaa	AISA KARO JUMP FRM THE TRAIN THATS THE GOOD OPTION
3sB49YNnaa	It is almost impossible if your doctor is correct and what you have is a virus.  Viruses are generally quite species specific and cross species barriers extremely rarely.  <br>  <br>  In any case, from the symptoms, it sounds like your pig had a bacterial upper respiratory tract infection which isn't what you have.<br>  <br>  There are all sorts of places people get viral infections.  Some are spread in airborne droplets from sneezes and can remain in the air even after the sneeze leaves the room.  Some are passed by direct contact between people and you can often get them from people who are not yet showing symptoms or who have such a mild case they never seem sick.  Some are passed from handling something that has been contaminated by someone who is sick.  Things like telephones and door knobs are good candidates for this type of transfer.  So, if you went to school or work you probably picked it up there|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	no its not likely. You got a VIRUS just like the doctor said. <br>  Pepper is likely dead now, Petsmart wont keep animals with Upper Respiratory. They Euth them. Pepper had a Guinea Pig UPI. Guinea Pigs dont get colds. Generally if caught early is easily treatable by a vet and medications.<br>  Colds from animals are not generally able to jump from species that are that far apart. These are called Zoonotic Diseases. There are a few diseases that Pepper could give you but its not likely. More likely they can give you parasites and that's about it.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	um... first of all you shouldn't buy pets from petsmart because they don't take care of their animals very well and that is probably why u and her got sick. it could possibly be her that got u sick because u were nosing her and interacting with her. but again plz don't buy pets from petsmart, it's better to go to petfinder, or adopt cause this will help someone else and it will probably be healthy. sorry im kinda off topic. good luck and hope u and pepper feel better.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	You can get salmonella from guinea pigs, but the symptoms the guinea pig is showing is pneumonia, not salmonella. But what you have has nothing to do with the guinea pig. You don't have to be around sick people to pick up viruses, you could have gotten it from anywhere, touching something that someone that was sick had touched. Simply wash your hands anytime you think of it, stay hydrated, and take any medications the doctor gave you and you'll get over it a bit faster. Be sure to give this guinea pig plenty of vitamin c to prevent it from reoccurring. But to reiterate, you didn't get sick from the guinea pig, you just both happened to be sick around the same time with two totally different things.
YraTwYqAaa	If the dog was nice and well behaved, heck yeah! Imagion if you were a horrible looking child and your parent didnt want you just because your ugly would make you feel like crying right?

AA11887983	I think that you should probably find other reasons to get a dog, besides as an accessory.  I realize that Paris Hilton has made this all the rage, but really, what is the point?

Why should a dog spend its outside time in a confined accessory to BE your accessory? <br>  <br>  And how is this a 'problem'?|`|VtHvcEtuaa	Dogs are meant to walk on the ground, not to get carried around in a purse.|`|wJdAybRnaa	You sound kind of young (from your "spelling" and the all caps). Do you have the money for a dog? They require yearly vet visits (and emergency visits), vaccinations, collar, leash, microchip, tags, bed, crate, training, premium (not grocery or petco brand) food, toys, monthly flea and heartworm preventive, any medications, dog bowls, and many other supplies. This can be 700 dollars + a year. Do you have extra income for this dog?<br>  <br>  No dog should be kept in a purse. Dogs are not an accessory. They are a living breathing animal and deserve love and a good life, not an owner who buys a puppy to put in a purse and gets sick of it three weeks later and leaves it at the shelter. <br>  <br>  As to the posted who said you should get a "teacup" dog, teacup is not a breed or even a type of dog. It is a made-up term coined by puppy mills and backyard breeders for sick runt puppies, who will cost you thousands of dollars in vet bills because you will invariably get a sick dog. If your dog when you get it isn't sick, he will have genetic and/or behavioural problems because the breeder does not care to breed well for temperament or genetics. They do not care if the stud or the ***** has a history of back/knee/hip problems. They will breed them anyways. For behavioural problems, these dogs are not socialised well as puppies and are usually sold to buyers before they are truly ready to leave the litter. They are not taught proper puppy behaviour, and invariably you will get sick of dealing with the dog's nipping, incessant chewing of household furniture, incessant barking, attacking other dogs or people, etc. etc. and leave the dog at the shelter.<br>  <br>  Please do not get a dog if you are not ready for the responsibility. They are expensive and they are time-consuming. Dogs do not belong in purses. <br>  <br>  Please do not buy a dog in a pet store, because you will be supporting backyard breeders and puppymills. Adopt a dog that fits your lifestyle, temperament, and activity level.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Buying or adopting a dog to follow a trend like this is stupid and irresponsible. If you are serious about wanting to have a dog as a companion, and are really willing to take on the hours of potty training, obedience training, the price of vet care, the time and effort (or price) of grooming, then adopt from a shelter. Even though it is small, it is still a dog and if left to do as it pleases, it will turn into a massive problem. You need to find a breed that will fit your lifestyle and something that you can manage.|`|rWGzVUxOaa	there is no such thing as purse dogs you paris hilton wanna be.

Pay special attention to characterists: both demeanors & physical aspects.This will enable you to make a good choice based on how you feel about each individual one. Remember that these pursies need extra tender care and they can be vey timid. Most of them don't tolerate alot of loud noises very well. It makes them nervous & could pose health related problems. Education will be your best bet. I also suggest going to a pound and saving one from being put down. Pound babies make better pets because they KNOW you saved them. You will be rewarded by them wanting you thank and please you.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I would help them both but I'd end up giving more help to the puppy. You see, people are lined up to adopt babies. The puppy would have a harder time finding a good home. The law would track down and prosecute whoever dumped the baby. Law enforcement doesn't "waste" alot of time finding puppy dumpers. The government will make sure the baby gets food and medical care. The puppy will depend on me to feed him and get him vet care because he's just a dog and the government doesn't have funds to care for him. I feel for both but in the end, the baby has plenty of people who care and want to help. There are far fewer who would do the same for the puppy.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	The baby. I'm pretty sure the ramifications of leaving a baby on the side of the road would be more severe than a puppy. The law's weird like that. Go figure. Plus, while I'd take a puppy over a baby any day, a puppy's chance at survival is much greater than a baby's. A human baby is literally helpless. A puppy isn't a crying lump of meat and bones, a puppy has much more chance of finding something to eat and getting out of the snow and whatever.

7SyCZnM9aa	You are right, constant breeding can be horrible for the mother's help. Breeding just because she thinks they're cute is very irresponsible. Especially if she has no one lined up to take them. Rodents are experts and making and having babies, so it could get out of hand very quickly. Pet stores have breeders they buy from already and wouldn't really welcome more if they have already bought what they are allowed (most places have limits). So she would most likely get wrangled with a ton of gerbils that just kept on breeding. Please do talk her out of it. I've seen some pet stores that take any "excess" gerbils and turn them into snake food. So please tell her she needs to reconsider.|`|ugi4aUZXaa	actually from owning rats i have learned that if ur goin to add other rodents add them asap or the one that was there first will kill the other one so if shes going to do it she should put the male in asap so they can get used to eachother
GMm5FMVhaa	Birds regurgitate for two reasons.  First they are looking for a mate, and they offer that as an offering.  It's something they do..feed each other.  Second, when a bird may feel threatened, they'll regurgitate, so the predator would leave the bird and take the food they expelled.<br>  <br>  I have a few parrots, and my one offers me her food all the time.|`|AA12272543	I would think not.

IrdZKYT3aa	Are you interested in tropical community?  You could do several healthy sized schools in a tank this size!<br>  A school of danio or glo fish, some cardinal tetra (a little more striking than their neon brethren), maybe some rainbow fish.<br>  For the bottom a school of cory cats and otto cats.  I love the little otto cats, they're Absolutely voracious eaters and very active.  They need groups of 3 or more and max at about 1.5 inches.<br>  You could also add a few gourami or killi fish for the top, or a school of hatchet fish.  Killi can be hard to find but are very worth it when you do!  Marbled hatchets and gourami are very pretty to watch floating around the top.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|1YNhKzeqaa	60 gallons? I would say do something fun, like cichlids! They come in many different colors.<br>  <br>  Or, you could do something with schooling fish, have a large school of cardinal tetras in your tropical, because your tank is big, you can have larger schools.<br>  <br>  If you decide on tropical fish (tetras, rasboras, etc..) you shouldn't put minnows in there because minnows are cold water fish. Tropical fish like water in the mid 70's (degrees farenheit), while cold water fish prefer mid 60's.<br>  With a large tank you could have goldfish, as they need large tanks (they grow really big!), and your tank is a decent size for goldfish. Minnows can be goldfish tank mates.<br>  <br>  I love live plants. Just watch out for plants that aren't truely aquatic, such as Mondo Grass, aka Kyoto, peacock fern and aqua fern. There are many more, but those are just a few off the top of my head. <br>  Be sure to get a good substrate for plants, such as eco complete or fluorite. Just wash your fluorite very well, or it will cloud your tank badly, and then you will have to wash your filter... also get a water column fertilizer, I love  Plant Gro by Nutrafin, it really does make your plants grow, and very well.<br>  <br>  I personally like crypts, cryptocoryne lutea and cryptocoryne wendtii are pretty leafy plants and I have had no trouble with them. Java fern is a nice leafy plant too, but you need to attach it to something such as drift wood.<br>  Micro sword will give you a nice lush "lawn" if you plant it in a very fine substrate.<br>  Java moss is hardy and grows fast.<br>  Anubias is a nice easy plant too.<br>  <br>  here is a very helpful link:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquahobby.com/e_aquarium_plants.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquahobby.com/e_aquarium_plan...</a><br>  <br>  It is one of the places I go to look up plants for my aquarium.<br>  <br>  Here is a bit of advice:<br>  Don't just buy a plant because its pretty, write down its SCIENTIFIC name and go home and research it before you buy it so you know what you are buying. Many pet stores sell non aquatic plants and claim that they are aquatic. <br>  <br>  I say use the scientific name because Ophiopogon japonicus is one non-aquatic plant that goes by different names, one is Mondo Grass, another is Kyoto. So pay attention to the scientific names...|`|nTnS6YS8aa	if it where me i would go with one severum, and like 12 odessa barbs, and a big school of cory cats, and some harlequins, or smallish cichlids like a firemouth and a cutteri or honderin red point, or even jewel, but of course if you go with the cichlids you cant have tetras, you would need very fast fish like barbs, or danios.  <br>  if you don't want them you could go with a big school of harlequins like 15 or so, some loaches like yo yos or darios, you also could get a school of rummy nose tetras i would say 8 or so,  rainbows are very colorful and active, even cherry barbs are a great idea, in this situation you could go with a small peaceful cichlid like 2 or 3 Bolivian rams, or 3 or 4 blue rams, or 2-3 dwarf cockatoos, or a medium peace full cichlid like a blue acara or golden eye, ( all the dwarfs would be fine with the above stocking, and the golden eye and blue acara)|`|kuPEYKbZaa	I would go with a cichlid tank.

AVidPBuwaa	It's hard to provide accurate assistance without details but 5-weeks for a hatch-ling ball python not feeding is a long time. Shedding is the least of your concerns, you need to get a meal in it on its own or assist feed it. A hatch-ling ball python can die if it doesn't have nourishment and it's reported that 2-months of non-feeding can cause death (reference to Dr. Steve Gorzula's ball python report for CITES). With respect to shedding, a healthy growing hatch-ling ball python should shed frequently so if it's not shedding then you have to read this a problem with your ball python. Again, without background information I cannot be of further assistance here but you may want to consult your vet since what you're describing is not that of a healthy hatch-ling ball python.|`|eBHsUiYOaa	i think its the winter, my leopard gecko (5 years old) does the same thing, its probably a hibernation like period.... it will eat when its hungry, and shed when its growing|`|niztxto9aa	It depends on how much your snake eats. The more it eats, the faster it will grow/shed. As for the not eating for 5 weeks. Sometimes bp's "turn off." It happens sometimes and isn't abnormal. Contine to offer it prey items every week and she'll "turn on" at some point. Just keep an eye on the ball to make sure it doesn't start loosing weight. Also make sure all the humidity and temperature requirements are met. Snakes sometimes wont eat if they aren't met. No worries though. I really wouldn't worry about it at this point.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	My ball python does not shed every month. He sheds about every 2-3 months I would say. I feed him a large mouse, he's about one year old and I guess like 2 ft long.<br>  <br>  Your ball python may not have been eating because the temperature in the tank is too low. Make sure you have a basking spot of 85-90 and a cooler side of the tank to about 80-85. When the temperature it too low the snake will not eat. I also heard it helps if you give your snake a bath before you feed it. It makes them feel good and will probably help your snake eat. My boa constrictor is sort of like your snake. Mine didn't eat for 2 months. So you shouldn't panic that it hasn't eaten for 5 weeks. Try feeding it every week. It will not starve itself and will eventually take the mouse. Snakes could also go months without eating. Make sure the snake isn't losing weight though. Nothing is wrong with the snake though. Don't panic and do what I told you and you might just get it to eat again.(:|`|o2ZWe0RQaa	my baby corn snake is shedding his skin every 6 weeks but as snakes grow they shed less often dont worry there shouldnt be anythink wrong with him my corn is shedding less often now. <br>  but if he isnt taking food there mite be somethink wrong but this happened to my 1 and he wouldnt take it because it was to cold so once u have defrost the mice make sure u run them under very hot water before u give them to him.
2hHRKCs2aa	1 cubic inch = .0043 gallons.  therefore your tank being 19 x 12 x 12 is 2736 cubic inches.  2736 x .0043 is 11.7648 gallons.

My dog does that.  He'll eat something he finds out in the field and ... whew, nasty gas.<br>  <br>  But, my initial guess would be that you're feeding him cheap food and his stomach just decided not to tolerate it well anymore.  Even if it's something he's eaten since he was a pup, the dog could have developed a sensitivity to it as it's gotten older.|`|sfUUml0Daa	most likely the dog food, our jack russell had the same issue, and we were giving er the old roy kibbles, we switched to the old roy origionaly and it worked wonders|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Stop feeding him so many beans|`|7SyCZnM9aa	You can check out this site, it's got very reliable information.

GVR9AjoQaa	If you want solid confirmation that she's in foal have a vet do an ultra sound on her.<br>  <br>  You can measure her girth & record it daily on a calendar- she should increase in diameter.<br>  <br>  Watch her bag- see if she is "making bag" yet- she'll begin just shortly prior to foaling.
F5vsY4rOaa	she may need a little help feeding them your local pet store should have every thing you need we use 'exact' starter formula and a syringe the instructions on bag are by species so you should have no problems helping her if you feed twice a day she should be able to carry the load and this will also help in the human bonding process for your chicks.<br>  Sorry for the loss of your boy and good luck|`|691YPESOaa	maybe, why don't you try it, but keep a close eye on them though.
tPGxPDvBaa	Sounds like ear infection but it could be a bad tooth or infection or inner ear imbalance.  W/o knowing what it is you can't treat it so you need a vet visit before your dog has serious or permanent damage & you end up with a huge vet bill instead of a small one.|`|2x2LYkj4aa	ask on the internet.|`|TPWs85H1aa	If your dog has floppy ears it is most likely waxy build up. Buy some dog ear cleaner.follow the instructions, clean the ears regularly (even pointed eared dogs need ears cleaned, just not as regularly) if there is no improvement, take him to the vet for a check up, he probably has an ear infection then, but try the cleaner first!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You mean he's tilting his head?  <br>  <br>  This is not a home remedy situation.  This could be as simple as an ear infection or the dog might have had a small stroke or some other neurological problem.  Or have some sort of virus ... <br>  <br>  So, to the vet ya go.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	It could be an ear infection or it could be a problem with the inner ear apparatus.  You should take your dog to the vet.|`|GEXxB6Sjaa	Probably an ear infection.  Take him to the vet.|`|hNUnr4Ytaa	My dog does that all the time it's most probably just an ear infection if kept clean they usually go away on their own. i usually rub his ear for him which he likes and clean it out with a tissue and he stops doing it. :) i hope that helps but it usually differs for dog to dog. if he doesn't stop take him to the vet. Oh and do you have any idea how to get lily pollen stains out of a dogs snout when its already wet and rubbed in? :S
UgIOVl1jaa	Heartgard Plus is for heartworm prevention, also controls roundworms & hookworms but dogs also need a stomach wormer every three months, typically "Drontal", you can get this in a chewable form from your vet or local pet supply store, you need to give the appropriate dose for your dogs weight so be sure to know your dogs weight when asking for the medication.  If you're still having a problem, see your vet.<br>  <br>  PS - If your dog is worm burdened the wormers can upset their tummy so I like to give my dog some natural yoghurt to help put the good bacteria back into their stomachs when I'm worming.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	That is kind of strange to be seeing worms pass a week after the medication.  But as long as they are passing that is good.  You might want to ask your veterinarian for a dose of de-wormer to be given 2 weeks after the Heart-gard.  But then be sure to keep up the heartworm preventative each month.<br>  <br>  I don't know what "Bess" is talking about "a stomach wormer every three months?"  These are intestinal parasites, and with your heartworm preventative you are de-worming every month at the same time.

FkunZ9q4aa	My dog had seizures and they were similar - he'd lose control of his back end.  He would either fall or he'd have trouble getting up and he would shake violently.<br>  <br>  You should take your dog in just to get checked.  He's probably fine but what we had to do with my dog was keep an eye on him, and they said if he had more than six seizures in a year we would have to put him on medication.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	it was most likely a seizure.  My labrador has those sometimes|`|3eSzjwEhaa	well its could have been a charlie horse but if he was getting a seizure he would not have been able to walk his head would have been turning in circles like if he was dizzy but you might want to take him to a vet just to make sure or it could be the start of paralysis at an early stage. i hope your dog will feel better!|`|PLZfk1qDaa	this is not for shure, i am no vet so dont go by my answer<br>  i had a boxer that had a simular problem with his head, it turned out to be a nurological disorder<br>  <br>  BUT dont frett<br>  <br>  you have a chihuahua and they shake, they shake and eat, then they shake and poop, they are always shaking, its just something they do, so dont be scared just yet, TAKE HIM TO A VET! but dont worry till the doc tells the story|`|JCNEP903aa	This could vey well have been.

If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle. ** When I got these two girls 37 yrs ago all we had to feed them back them were brown worms, tadpoles I caught  and goldfish. And my girls are still going strong and  just turned 37 yrs old this month.<br>  <br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes  from lack of Vitamin A.  Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up.. <br>  <br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.<br>  <br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow. <br>  So they need a turtle basking dock. <br>  <br>  Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.<br>  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot. You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank in a 60 gallon my girls were in one, I used two double sided marine or penguin filters…It really helped keep it cleaner! <br>  <br>  They will bite very  hard.  Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you should wash after every handling ANY size turtle or reptile anyway.<br>   ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their  is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ year’s plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And  are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across.<br>   Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Mating dance happens all year long with my 5 !<br>  <br>  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory  sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies.<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  Hope she gets an A+  !!|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	You'd have to ask them. Whoever has to clean the tank will prefer neither. Bare tanks are easier to keep clean.|`|29sUhuULaa	They prefer sand but you will prefer rocks, i promise you that. With sand they may actually choose to hibernate for a while (especially if your water is not warm enough), which will freak you out and you'll think you lost a turtle. Also, since your set up should have a water area as well, the sand will make the water that much dirtier and harder to keep clean.|`|09fdLaeIaa	they prefer rocks<br>  i own two<br>  rocks are better for them because they need a lot of exercise like climbing on rocks<br>  plus the rocks will cut their toe nails <br>  red ear sliders have long toe nails<br>  and they're also sharp|`|IntTij9Paa	u cant put small rocks in tanks they will eat them and then they cant digest them but u can lager ones in there sands ok
Dkb2ZR3Daa	Since you will be distance running you need a dog that is built for it(medium sized dog -Light bone structure).<br>  People keep recommending greyhounds-that is the worst pick, Greyhounds are sprinting dogs and do not have the stamina-they are not made for distance runners!!!<br>  Labs have to heavy of a structure and I don't recommend them for distance runners either.<br>  <br>  My recommendations for distance and protection...<br>  Viszla<br>  Siberian Husky<br>  Spaniels<br>  Rhodesian Ridgeback<br>  Jack Russel Terrier<br>  American Staffordshire Terrier|`|LURQBU86aa	Go to the shelter and pick out an athletic adult dog. Puppies aren't a good choice because they're still growing and running can damage their bones and joints. Although greyhounds are famous racing dogs, they're not really built for long distance running, they're more built for sprinting and most of them are just big couch potatoes, in face their nickname is "the 40 mph couch potato."|`|y9M5XMhZaa	I'd check around the shelters and ask if they have any dogs that would be good for a jogging partner. At any given time, there are dogs being given up because they are too energetic for their families. <br>  <br>  As for being protective, any dog will be good. Dogs pick up on signs that you are distressed and will react by protecting you instinctively. <br>  <br>  Have fun with your knew best friend!|`|xWXCbRXkaa	Greyhounds are racing dogs. Adopting one of those would be a good idea, and since they are very fast, they could keep up. Plus , they also need exercise to keep fit.

Then he will mix it with a secretion that makes it waxy and whitish and then pssssst it all over. Use vinegar and a grease cutting liquid to clean it.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	It's a substance they use to mark territory and show ownership of an object. The only way to stop this is to get him neutered.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	It is pee. If it is over 4 1/2 months, get it neutered. Also, litter train it. Just buy a litter box and only put the bedding (aspen) in its box.|`|UeOtjPP5aa	It's urine. Rabbits spray to mark their territory.

Plain boiled chicken breast cut into small pieces is a great treat and so are small cubes of cheese.No rawhide,it is hard to digest,the pup can choke on it and it can cause intestinal blockages.|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	If your pup is eating solid food, starting at four weeks, it can eat treats.  German Shepherd Dogs (GSD) often have problems with soy and corn, so look for ingredients.  A very good thing to get them to chew on, is raw bones, especially raw knuckle bones.  Don't get the smoked bones found in pet stores, as these are not as healthy or as good for their teeth.  Raw bones won't splinter as cooked bones will.<br>  <br>  Besides treats, which can double as training aides, kongs are a good chew toy.  Training can start at 7 weeks if at home or privately.  Don't join a puppy class or socialization class until pup has its shots.<br>  <br>  GSDs are wonderful dogs but need both physical activity and mental challenges due to their high intelligence.  If you don't provide them, they can become very destructive or other anti-social behavior will start.  Obedience classes or puppy classes are a good place to start.  Puppy classes can be started after pup has at least two of it puppy series of shots.  Ob classes can be started at four months for GSDs.|`|RDjUl06Oaa	By 2 months about|`|ugi4aUZXaa	whenever it starts eating hard dog food

EtqjIWX3aa	I stopped in my vet's office to pick up an Rx and noticed a paper on the counter listing all of the pet insurance carriers that they will accept. I am in the process of also researching the best policy for my pets.<br>  <br>  The main question to ask yourself is if it is really worth it in the long run. Far too many people put a price tag on their pet and when the vet bills start piling up, they consider euthanasia, a cheaper alternative.<br>  <br>  However, if you are the type of pet owner who will willingly go into debt to save its life, then pet insurance might be the answer!<br>  <br>  I can not recommend one particular insurance company. It is best to research and find the one that meets your pet's specific needs. Some companies cover pre-existing conditions and hereditary diseases (such as hip displasia) while others will not.<br>  <br>  galtech.com reports the following review:<br>  <br>  VPI Pet Insurance - they offer a number of different priced options; their VPI Superior Plan ($50 ded. per incident, max. annual benefit of $14K, pays 90% of cost) for a 3 year old Huskie was about $30 bucks a month. They offer free online quick quotes for pet insurance premium estimates. Things covered: Accidents and Illnesses, MRI, CAT Scans and X-Rays, Surgeries, Cancer Treatments, Prescription Medication, Hospitialization, Vaccinations, Heartworm Protection, Annual Exam, Prescription Flea Control, Spay & Neuter.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pets Health Plan.com - their pet insurance policies pay 80% of all allowable vet expenses and medications, with no per incident deductible ($100 per year flat deductible). They have the same policy for filiing claims and reimbursements.<br>  <br>  <br>  Petsurance.com - full insurance coverage for cats and dogs, including a senior care plan for older pets. They also offer free online pet insurance quotes. From their website: "We provide the best value possible for your insurance dollar. Routine care (e.g. vaccinations, parasite prevention) is a budgetable expense. When this budgeting is done through a pet insurance policy, the cost to the owner is greater than if he/she would have paid for this expense directly. "<br>  <br>  <br>  Petco.com - Petco has partnered with Pet Care Pet Insurance and offer full lines of insurance beginning at less than $10/mo.<br>  <br>  <br>  PetPlan.com - the worlds largest provider of pet insurance, PetPlan's PetMedic plans provide coverage for the most common accidents (removing swallowed objects, hit by car, allergic reactions to bug bites, fights with other animals, fall, etc.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Pet insurance is not for eveyone, but if you are concerned about the rising costs of pet care and veterinarian bills and pet medications, do a little research into a policy, see what it costs, and compare it to what you spent out of pocket last year on your pet - see if it doesn't make sense to switch to a pet insurance policy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Embrace Pet Insurance offers a comparison guide on its website so that you are able to check off which services would be best suited to your needs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sgUq207Daa	When I was researching which plan to get, I found this site very helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pet-insurance-information.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pet-insurance-information.com</a><br>  <br>  They list several top plans and you can get free quotes right there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I do believe the benefits of having pet insurance outweigh the drawbacks.<br>  <br>  Steve|`|AA11887983	I know that it is becoming much more popular.  I have no idea what policies cover, and which company is better.  I would say that going with one of the older ones is probably better, because they have been around a while, but other than that, I have no idea. <br>  <br>  What I do know is that if you are planning on getting it for your dog or cat, the absolute best time is when they are very young, because then they really don't have any pre-existing conditions.  <br>  <br>  I have met plenty of people who seem to be pretty happy with their insurance, but I don't know exact companies.|`|GKZPxAaPaa	I don't yet, but I would like to get insurance. The policies are sooo expensive!  I have heard good things about this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.vetinsurance.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetinsurance.com/</a><br>  And I am pretty sure I am going to sign up soon.  If I do get insurance it would be this one because the price is right and they seem better overall. They have a list that compares the other insurance companies's prices also.
WkGg5Jelaa	One year old is essentially an adult, so keep that in mind.  Bearded dragons (and most other lizards) know it's time to mate at certain times of the year due to less or more daylight (in the case of beardies, less) and reduced temperatures.  So if you have your light on a timer (and I hope you do; they like consistency), and you decrease the amount of time it's on, the fertility levels in your dragons would increase, likely leading to a healthy clutch of eggs.  With dragons, they are able and likely to breed without the change in temp/light.  <br>  <br>  If you definitely do not want eggs, I would not put a male and female of that age together.  If you do have eggs, just remember to give extra vitamin supplements to your female, as egg production/laying is very hard on the body.  I had a leopard gecko die shortly after laying eggs because she was too young and didn't get the extra supplements.|`|keX0rz1oaa	its safe to give her a mate. beardies usually like having another one with them. but watch the behavior make sure they dont fight or hurt eachother if they dont get along take the other one out ASAP and put him/her into a different cage.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	If you don't want the eggs why in the world would you want to put a male and a female together. Frisky, nope don't think so.  Beardies are not social and only come together for the purpose of mating so they do not need so called friends. What are your plans for this male after putting him with her? Do you realize that you will need a complete tank and setup for him as well as sets ups for babies and incubator. You are going to put out a lot of money for something you say you don't want as well as trying to do something for the female that is completely un-necessary. I am not trying to make you angry, just want you to know the facts|`|TphsSOz6aa	Do a lot of research first.  Eggs are a hassle if you don't know exactly how to incubate them...and females can become egg bound.  Maybe without a male around, she'll just not lay??|`|Z4Lint4qaa	yes its safe
Gnfc4wRlaa	It depends on what kind of dog you like.  Pugs are sweet dogs and playful.  They are more heavily built, muscular, so when they land in your lap, you really know you've been landed on.  Chihuahuas are more delicate and seemingly have more of a need to be with their person.  You also have to be careful.  My little chihuahua burrowed under things for warmth and I didn't know she was there.  I was changing curtains once and dropping the old ones as I worked.  I got my foot hung up in the pile of curtains, gave it a kick to get it out of my way, and heard a little "Oof!"  Squeaky was in there (she was okay).  Anyway, they are adorable dogs, just more delicate than most.|`|QQqhzuNDaa	Pugs are more endearing.|`|9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	Personally, I don't like how pugs look.<br>  I have a half-breed chihuahua though. And he makes quite the hilarious subject to talk about. It's like an angry midget that bullies the big boys!<br>  <br>  Most common thing known about my dog: "He likes chasing little children and trying to eat them :)"<br>  <br>  He is very fun at home to play with (fetch is the most hilarious and mood-upper thing to do at home after he gets his shower from going outside), and even though he's a bit of a coward, he's very loud when someone else comes into the house. While that's annoying for when friends come over, imagine if a thief tried getting in :). He's not a hero, but at least we know someone else is in the house.

Each breed has different exercise requirements, grooming requirements, health issues, temperament, etc. etc. You need to figure out what type of dog is best for you (do you want a sweet loyal companion, someone more extroverted, etc,), are you a couch potato or jogging for 3 hours a day, etc. It doesn't matter how many fans a dog has on a website.

They tend to get overweight quickly and often get skin problems.  Personality wise, they are a lot better then the chihuahuas.  <br>  <br>  Other small dogs that are awesome (in my opinion): Papillions, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, French Bulldogs, Havanese, and Corgis<br>   <br>  Check out akc.org and look into the breeds.|`|3fur16Rgaa	It doesn't matter to other people go to <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm</a> it will show the best dog for you and there is no registering or fees just a simple test.  this site is no bullcrap they know what they're talking about.|`|cRsaAjtoaa	Pug!

IrdZKYT3aa	What kind are they?  Do you know the sex?<br>  I had four dwarf males and two male pearl gouramii's with no issues. However, the two pearl were living together when I bough them, along with others, and the four dwarf were living with a bunch of other males. If they were housed with females and males they can be more aggressive.  If they were housed alone they may be aggressive.  Right now they have to figure out whom the other one is, having never met them.  You should be ok, just monitor for chasing, harassment or torn fins.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|IgG5PPjRaa	depends on the type of gourami. my bf has a blue gourami, semi-aggressive, but it killed both sharks in the tank and the red gourami twice its size. keep watch for any signs of damage to the fins, tail or face of each fish, and check the gills for damage also. they will tend to nip more than anything at the fins and tail, but may body slam causing damage elsewhere. if you continue to see no damage, dont worry too much, but def keep an eye on them!!!|`|ItADvi7Daa	Right now they are checking each other out. They are territorial fish, you should have at least 10 gallons per gourami. If you have less than that, I would suggest to keep an eye on them. Things may settle down once they get used to each other. Wait and see.|`|369F0dYfaa	Most likely the one who was in the tank 1st is trying to show the new one that he is dominant.|`|WzLcNuVNaa	they should be fine
YnCUyvK7aa	No, besides them being aggressive [the puffers, not the bettas, that is], the puffers will do better if they're kept in a brackish tank.  This means adding a small amount of marine salt to raise the salinity.  Bettas are freshwater fish.  So the 2 kinds need a different environment.<br>  <br>  A figure 8 puffer would also need a larger tank than a 10 gallon once it's grown.  A 15 gallon is the minimum, a 20 gallon would be better.|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	i'm sorry to say this but this is not going to be possible.you see puffers are aggressive towards other fish and bettas are also.females are not that aggressive but still they7 shouldn't be with puffers.if you want to keep the betta with other fish then you should get neon tetras.other than that don't get puffers or there will be a fight.|`|onfX2jqLaa	im so sorry but absolutely not.<br>  as cute as they are, puffers can demolish fish! for a puffer you would need a filter and a heater. i suggest getting a little 5 gallon for the puffer because they really need to be on their own.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Puffers are aggressive and would hurt your betas. Besides, you really shouldn't put any more fish in your tank, its kinda full. Maybe a bottom feeder, and then that would be it.|`|XQAT64toaa	betta fish are not really good living with many other fish. only specific fish can live with bettas. they are fighting fish. look at the wikipedia page about it, it should tell you all you need.|`|QRl8oUzqaa	puffer and betas are very aggressive fish.  i would worry more about the puffer. they are kinda tricky.  look up info on puffers and bettas for call a pet store|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	There are number of puffer fishes in FW. Some grow as big as 30 inches while other only grows to about 3 inches. <br>  <br>  Almost all puffer fishes are aggressive and are fin nipper. And thus flowing tails of betta is an inviting target.<br>  <br>  And yet Betta are also very aggressive and will attack other fishes if provoked.<br>  <br>  Finally with 5 bettas already in that 10 gallon tank, you just don't have enough room any other fish.  That is if you aren't already over stocked<br>  . <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|00RgkZF8aa	Of course not. Puffer fish are aggressive and will fight possibly to death with the Bettas, regardless if they're female.
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	it makes me want to puke! I guess I am cursed with having some kind of ethics and integrity. Sure I could really use a few thousand dollars (to pay for all of the spays and neuters for the kitties dumped at my house) But I have not even considered breeding mutts (or any dogs or cats for that matter!). The people that do are ONLY in it for the money and any fool that pays over $50 for any mixed breed dog should be drug out to the town square and put in stocks and be subject to public ridicule.<br>  <br>  I don't care what whine story these idiots want to vomit from their mouths. They are breeding mutts for profit and stupid morons are buying them. I really need money so maybe I will start trapping squirrels in the park and selling them. I am positive that if I advertised that I had a "rare" bushy tailed tree climbing teacup chiweenie, that some idiot somewhere would give me at least $800 for it.|`|cf11108a6ba39e7132dcf3e861a52c23aa	Yes it is sickening! Most of the people that sell these breeds (if thats what you want to call them) do not care what kind of home the pet is going to. All they see is $$ symbols. Maybe this economic disaster will help straighten things out for awhile but it will continue when things turn around.<br>  What makes me mad is how many ignorant people are out there. They are the ones not the breeders that are the problem. If nobody buys these pets the problem will go away. Right?<br>  Gotta go now. My German Wirehaired pointer is sitting next to me and she needs exercise.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	You know its bad when the original people who started this with good intentions, and were doing it right, are disgusted with what has happened. Its sad because some of the mixes actually do have potential to be good at something yet most all they care about is money and will not breed true, all they care about is F1 cash cows so to speak. <br>  <br>  Some like the "labradoodle" were started with good intentions, but they soon realized they could not make stable dogs so the original people dropped it, yet someone found it and has now turned it into what it is. Some of these mixes have been around for more then 30 years yet the ones breeding them could care less about them now. They think that if the just slap a name on it its a pure bred.<br>  <br>  It has become a serious problem as serious as the "teacup" fiasco. whoever came up with that should shoot themselves. <br>  <br>  It will get worse till people wake up and see they are not buying anything special.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It really is getting out of hand and plain disgusting. But as long as there are idiots, that would rather buy a mutt with a stupid name then to buy from a responsible breeder or adopt then I am afraid we are going to be stuck. <br>  <br>  What responsible breeders would call an accident the puppy millers consider them a goldmine. Breed mutts design a cute website and make a fortune. Unethical yes but they are not stupid|`|eDySIDPQaa	It's a huge problem, every day a new one pops up.......<br>  <br>  And they want to call all of them purebreds now, have you noticed that as well.<br>  <br>  I am just fed up and gonna write my Congressman  LOL|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Yes! I was at the pet store the other day and there were two people having a conversation about their English Bulldogs. One of them said " Oh,have you heard about this guy,Mr._______,down the road? He's breeding Boxers and Bulldogs together to make a hybrid and improve the breed!!" And the other person says."Yes,they are trying to improve the breed and make it like in the old days!" I had to bite my tongue or I would have gone into a tirade about "hybrids."I wanted to explain that you improve an established breed by breeding the SAME breed of dog for certain traits - not by mixing a completely different breed into the mix,unless you are developing a NEW breed,which takes generations.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I also hate it & sick to death of this nonsense.<br>  <br>  I resent the lies they tell ppl to trick them into buying their pups however the ppl don't do their research like they should.  I don't know how many ppl swear their "designer" dog is a real breed cuz they looked it up on-line.  Or how many clients call wanting to get a breed clip for their "designer" dog then I get to break the news there isn't one since they just paid a fortune for a mutt.  Many ppl buy these dogs thinking they are hypo or shedless like the breeders claim only to find out the hard way after they are attached, they are none of these things.  In fact, most take more work than the purebreds they are a mix of.<br>  <br>  I think what is the craziest thing is the majority of folks buying these dogs if you had told them 5yr ago that ppl would be paying hundreds to thousands for a mutt, they would have laughed in your face & said impossible. I don't know what is worst  - poorly bred purebreds or poorly bred "designer" dogs - they are both bred by the same crappy breeders.|`|tTLg4u9laa	It will only get better if we introduce drastic breeding regulations.  And yep it needs to affect ALL breeders, NO exceptions.  If you want to breed you have to adhere to tough rules to make sure your breeding stays in check.<br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned, all breeders are the same so long as there is a pup left in the shelter.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	i hate it. period.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Oh I'm with ya on that!  Yes, I think it's a huge problem.  People are very ignorant and they all want something different or "better"  heh.  If they only really knew what they were getting.<br>  <br>  Because, first off, anyone selling good representatives of their breeds would never sell a dog to someone that was going to make "poo's" out of it.  So they're starting with substandard dogs, then mixing breeds ... this does not a healthy dog make.  And the big trouble is, it's not the BYB's that are responsible for all of this.  The commercial breeders have gotten into it too.  <br>  <br>  I really wish people would do more research before getting dogs.  It's all about education but so many people just refuse to think of it that way.|`|OWGBAiXtaa	What are your opinions on this?  It's a big fad.<br>  <br>  Do you think its becoming a problem?  It's a new problem replacing an old problem.<br>  <br>  Will it only get worse?  Maybe.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid, "purebred" dogs were the big fad.  People were breeding purebred white German shepherds like crazy along with cocker spaniels, dobermans, you name it.  Of course none of these dogs had papers, but the BYBs that bred them still got high prices  and the dogs were status symbols.  Then when I was in 20's there was a huge dalmation explosion.  In my early 30's it was rottweilers.  Late 30's, it was pit bulls.  Now it's "designer" dogs and runts.  It's just the latest fad and status symbol.  There's always been a problem with dog breeding for the masses, the problem just changes its appearance.  The sad part is that the dogs are the ones who wind up suffering for it.  Fads lead to poor breeding, health problems and temperament problems.  There will always be a problem with irresponsible breeding as long as the option to breed is available to irresponsible people (and it will be).|`|SRmNJCdiaa	I really do think it is a problem.  People are getting false information from people that are only in it for the money.  You don't know what to expect from a mixed breed dog, temperment, coat, health problems.  I don't have anything against mutts as pets.  There are lots of really great mutts out there, but purposely breeding to "fancy" breeds together and giving it a dumb name to make a buck is disgusting.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if it will get worse, maybe this is one thing our bad economy will fix...in a way.  People aren't going to have $2000 bucks to spend on a mystery dog they can pick up at a shelter.  <br>  <br>  I hope the problem goes away, but they only way it can is through education.  Educating friends and family and if you're in a profession that deals with animals, educating your clients.|`|TuHfZdYGaa	It's completely out of control. Im sick of it.<br>  <br>  Im also sick of people saying *All dogs were cross breeds at one point*. It is a bullsh*t excuse for what they are doing and the gullible and uneducated buy it.<br>  <br>  The prices are ridiculous and these breeders are crooks.<br>  <br>  Anything doodle and teacup is a joke.<br>  <br>  My stafford b*tch Maggie comes from 3 generations of Grand Champions.<br>  <br>  She has had all breed specific genetic health tests and DNA proof of parentage certificates.<br>  <br>  I paid $900 for her.<br>  <br>  Go figure!  How can these breeders justify their prices?<br>  <br>  The truth is they cant, they pray on idiots.<br>  <br>  And unfortunately they work on supply and demand, the more people buy their puppies the longer they will stay in buisness.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	its always been a problem.. its just that the craz is catching on because more celebs are getting in on the crazyness, and that its cheaper for the breeders to breed mixes rather than pure breds. Its also cheaper for brokers, puppy stores and the likes. More people are under the notions that mix breeds are healthier and longer lived than a pure.... not in the case of sick parent dogs of different breeds. I guess people are just not smart enough to realize you can not get a diamond from a Rock and a Stick!!! if both parents are sub par you get a sub par puppy. That simple... its a shame really that human beings are so dumb and desperate to spend there hard earned money on a fad and a mutt.<br>  <br>  Just to clear the record, I own 4 mutts myself, and I didnt pay a dime for them other than there vet care!!! They are priceless to me!<br>  <br>  I have a CORSO BULL ... very rare! <cane corso/pitt mix<br>  <br>  a COY AUSSIE... super sneaky! <Coyote/Australian Shepherd mix<br>  <br>  an ASTOUNDING HOUND... very secretive! <Bluetick Coonhound mixture of unknown heritage><br>  A Genuine, Authentic, straight from the Sahara Desert MOROCCAN LOVE DOG... very cute and pricey... <a street dog from Casablanca Morocco... of no particular lineage><br>  <br>  ALL worth my love and life...<br>  they share my home with 2 Purebreds as well... Cardigan Welsh Corgis.<br>  <br>  BETHANY A - there is NOTHING, I mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING wrong with owning or having a Mixed breed. There is homes needed for Labradoodles, the issue standing is that people are paying hundreds, if not thousands for dogs with cute names that are not anything special. They are not a standardized dog, and even in the case of the Labradoodle people are STILL not breeding to a standard. Therefore you can get a dog all over the board. I still think a Labradoodle should only cost 50$, and they could be the best dog in the world!!!|`|1WmDOPGtaa	It's a huge problem, and unfortunately I think it will get worse before it gets better.  I've never really understood why anyone would shell out more money for a mixed breed dog than most purebreds from reputable breeders run.  I'm hopeful that the false advertising will catch up with these people and eventually put them out of business for good.|`|ymU9QGlUaa	A dog is a dog is a dog.  As long as the dog satisfies the needs of the owner it doesn't matter if it is a mix or a purebred. If that offends some people, they will get over it. All dogs have dog DNA, and to say that one is worthy of being alive while another isn't simply because it is a mix is ridiculous.|`|keIqjnijaa	Why would you even spend $2000+ on a dog to make it look beautiful?<br>  It's stupid.....I know. It really gets to me.<br>  Dogs are meant to be "Man's best friend."<br>  You love them for their companionship and their personality.<br>  It's ridiculous to pamper you dog in "Calvin Klein" PJ's.<br>  I DO NOT pamper my dog, But love him, take him for walkes, and spend cold nights huddling up to him. <br>  Love your dog and spend as much time as you can with it. :)|`|2VdJgenjaa	My opinion to this: I love my labradoodle and I'm not the only person who loves her. Two families in my street are getting one because of her. I would never get one from a pet store or some joe blogs on the side of the street or recommend it. I just showed my friends where they could get one that needs a new home.<br>  <br>  Yes it will become a problem yet we were looking for 18 months for one in the shelters and couldn't fine one. We ended up getting her through the ALA "looking for a New Home". I'm guessing it's a bigger problem in America. <br>  <br>  Yes it will get worse as they have started an Australian Labradoodle Association and they have made a standard and are trying to get them registered around the world. Sure it will take a while but they are going to do it. Weather you like it or not. I've read that cockadoodles have done the same.<br>  <br>  I'm just stating facts.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Ok the thing is that I got my Labradoodle second hand if you will, and she came with gentic history and stuff like our Pure Border collie and poodle did. She had also been temperament tested as well. I was a bit surprised that when I was handed over this mix breed pooch we got heaps of other stuff. Plus we were also given all her vet documents that the previous owner had. She also had a 5 generation gentic history with all their scores etc on it.|`|9aLNaMP3aa	There's no ''designer" breed, these dogs are just mixed breeds, or I'd just called em mutts. In my country NOONE sells mixed breeds, they just give em away. I don't think people understand the meaning of pure breed or respectable breeders.I dont have anything against mutts though, they're all cute little animals as well is just the people. And I don't understand why people are willing to pay so much for this dogs.<br>  Another thing that bugs me alot is those pet shops where they sell you "pure" breed pups, they even sell sick ones. And people just go and check them out, and the sales person just tell them all this great things about the puppy that is pure breed, when the puppy doesn't even look close as to what the breed standard is!

I think that I wouldn't choose to be a particular breed;  I'd want to be the nice, quiet, patient lesson horse that the trainer puts the timid beginners on to give them confidence.  I couldn't jump very high, but if the rider pointed me at that little cross-rail or low post-and-rail, I would never stop or run out, I'd pop over it no questions asked.  <br>  <br>  One of the things I've always enjoyed is taking small children who have never been around horses up to meet my horse.  That's something I really get a kick out of-- seeing kids who are timid realizing that they can take this great big scary (to them) animal and lead it around, and it will go where they want to take it; and watching them look into the purple-amber depths of a horse's big eye and making a connection with something that maybe they've never known before.  Little hands feeling a horse's neck both soft and strong, and the thrill they get when they hold a carrot out to the horse and the velvety muzzle with tickly whiskers nuzzles their hand and delicately takes the carrot from them.  <br>  <br>  If I were a horse, I'd want to be the horse that kids make that first connection with, that starts them down the road to get involved in something wonderful, almost magical, and sadly increasingly out of reach of so many people.|`|HY2i80mjaa	My mother would be an apendix and my father a prettiful walkappaloosafresian, they would fall in love after being introduced, by billie jean, I would be born 11 months later, i would then be called a Midwest  Warmblood so that I could go for a better price.

You need to work with him and try to find something that he really likes. Have you tried peas and raspberries? One of my rescues was tough to get him to get his salad. I withdrew crickets and worms. I tried mixing the worms in with the salad and that did help a little. When I found out what he really like, I started mixing that in with the salad and eventually it worked but it did take some time. You need a lot of patience. Flowers are good too, try rose petals and those listed on the list. Dandelion flowers and leaves are good too, Just be sure no sprays have been used. As an adult they should eat 80% salad and only 20% protein.

But if your economy is doing well you might be about to get $6000 + if he is very well trained you could even get more.|`|hQIqEnTEaa	$2000-$2500 is about right.<br>  <br>  I bought my horse who was 11 years TB gelding who had reserve champion official hack ribbons under his belt and had competed B grade eventing (pony club B grade - the zone) with his basic tack and rugs for AUD $2000. <br>  <br>  My friend bought her 6yo TB mare for AUD $3000 (although she had originally been advertised for $5000) and she had been champion TB mare at the royal show the year before (and has won supremes and champions since my friend bought her). <br>  <br>  Sadly TBs (even ones that are really experienced) aren't worth a great deal as there are just so many of them out there.<br>  <br>  You've mentioned that your horse has done well in hacking. How well? If he's won champions/reserve or supremes you should advertise this as it will increase his value.<br>  <br>  Don't bother advertising him as "good potential for showjumping". As a prospective buyer nothing annoys me more than seeing a horse who has done nothing advertised for a high price because he "has potential". Anyone can say their horse has great potential but buyers want actual evidence of what the horse can do (ie list his wins and experience).|`|TTLIp8Beaa	$2,000 - $3,000 USD.<br>  =//|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	i live in Aus and i would say 2000-2500 coz our horse economy really isnt as bad as the US and if he has good weight on him and is in pretty good condition you should be good for the amount above. <br>  <br>  Do you have any pics and what area are u in?<br>  what a look on simpletrade.com.au <br>  there you should ge able to gauge what other horses have done to yours and compare prices :-)<br>  <br>  Yeh but ppl arnt overly fussed on OTTB and u do have to remember that resession is hitting us pretty bad right now. sorry to tell you but dont think u will sell him in a hurry if ur going for like 5 grand or some thing i have a friend that is selling a champion cutting bred mare with fantastic blood lines she is 8 years old and is in foal to a palomino QH and has a P/B QH appaloosa at foot she paid 6000 and now she is only asking 3000 for the whole lot with her in foal and one at foot!!!!!

tB7QK6BTaa	It is not typically high paying work, usually just over minimum wage.  The exception might be someone who has the favour of the Hollywood set, and might then earn completely out of proportion to reality based on very wealthy and vain people and their coddled pets.|`|nmercOm7aa	It depends on where you work, what you charge and what overhead costs you have. <br>  Some places pay on commission, so the more you groom the more you make, but if you don't get a lot of business, you don't get paid much. Others pay a flat rate on the number of hours you work.  If you do all the grooming (bath, brush, dry, clip, etc) you may get more than if you only so some of it. <br>  Some salons charge more than others for the same service. The more you charge, the fewer clients you may have, so having high prices can be a disadvantage. <br>  A large salon space in an expensive area takes away profit. Having more groomers sharing the cost of the salon and supplies can help. <br>  <br>  You can make money, but you have to know what you are doing both as a groomer and as a business person.  If you are just working at a salon, you get paid what the owner decides.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Depends on how much shop is charging & how many dogs you groom. I live in a major city & working at a good shop you make between $400-$700 per week.  Usually $500-$600 is the norm.  It isn't a high paying job considering the work you do & is a very stressful mentally & physically. You don't become a groomer for the income or you won't be a good groomer or work for long.|`|LURQBU86aa	It all depends on the area that you live in and how experienced you are. I see that you've been asking about animal career salaries, and this website is a great help with that. In general not many animal based careers make a great deal of money, except for a vet which you said that you didn't want to do.|`|aDd2gMDIaa	140 bucks personal expertise
muPiBQ3Uaa	If you are employed by a professional training school, such as Guide Dogs for the Blind, then, yes, you can make good money, depending on what you do for the school.<br>  <br>   The top quality schools have paid staff veterinarians, mobility instructors, dog trainers, and ancillary positions that are all well paying positions, about equal to what is available on the open animal care market for similar job duties. Most of the positions directly involved with the training require a Bachelors or Masters degree in Animal Science, Animal Behavior, Orientation and Mobility, and for the Veterinarians, graduation from a nationally accredited school of veterinary science. That's about 6 to 8 more years of school after high school.<br>  The smaller schools and independent trainers usually rely heavily on volunteer or part-time staff for almost all positions, so if you are looking for a rewarding experience without a whole lot of monetary compensation, they would be the ones to search out.<br>  <br>  It seems that a lot of people are confusing service dog trainers with  service dog puppy raisers. The puppy raisers get the pups housebroken, teach socialization, instill basic manners, and teach obedience to simple commands (sit, stay, down, etc.), but they are NOT service dog trainers. The puppy raiser is very important to the professional schools because without them, the cost of the dogs would probably double, so I am not discounting the importance of the raisers; just clarifying that a raiser is not a trainer.|`|n4pNNcGfaa	No.  Most volunteer all or part of their time.  There is little funding for the training of service dogs available.  The disabled owners typically cannot afford to pay the full costs so some costs are covered with charitable donations and others absorbed with volunteer labor or services.<br>  <br>  The rewards of service dog training have more to do with being able to significantly impact the lives of others in a very positive way by helping them to gain the independence most of the rest of us take for granted.<br>  <br>  ---edit---<br>  <br>  Service dog programs typically are not nearly as well funded as guide dog programs and as a result professional service dog trainers are typically not as well paid as professional guide dog trainers.  Guide dogs have been recognized much longer than service dogs and have built up greater recognition by the public which leads to more charitable donations for program operations and salaries.<br>  <br>  Guide dog programs also typically require a college degree and a three year apprenticeship, which is not typically required of a service dog trainer.<br>  <br>  Puppy raising is a money losing proposition.  Not only are puppy raisers not paid, they pay some expenses out of their own pockets.<br>  <br>  But money isn't why people train assistance dogs (be they guide dogs, hearing dogs, or service dogs).|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	not really<br>  lots of them do it, just to help|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	NO!  Many of the disabled are low income or on fixed income.<br>  <br>  I have been doing SD training and GD training for years.  It is a labor of love.  You have to not only love dogs, and care about people; you must have good people skills.  Most importantly, you not only need to be very experienced at training dogs, you must be able to modify and tailor your training to the clients needs.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	no, usually none at all as it is a volunteer job. My dear friend trains dogs for GDA (guide dogs of america) and it is 100% volunteer, in fact she spends a lot of her own money on gas, food, toys, etc..you have to take the dog to the training center all the time for check ups, exams, all sorts of training days, when they are in heat...it is truly a labor of love. then, if you have done your job well enough and your pup graduates, they then go on to their owner. You as a trainer have no say in who gets the dog, if it will be used in the breeding program, what specific tests you and the dog have to go through, what schedule the exams and check ups are, you are responsible for making sure your dog is where it needs to be, when it needs to be. It is not a job for everyone.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  Most people who train service dogs have other dog related jobs, such a kennel managers and such, to supplement their income.
tB7QK6BTaa	Careers that make a lot of money typically involve an education and strong work ethic.  Whether in the animal world or anywhere else, "I want to make a lot of money, but I don't want to have to go to University, and I don't want to have to work very hard"  Is a meaningless statement not a goal setting process.<br>  <br>  Work hard, get a good education, have commitment, develop a solid work ethic... those things are planning a future.  <br>  <br>  Phantasies about being rich without earning that are not planning anything, they're mere phantasy nothing more.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Nothing related to dogs is going to make you rich, unless you go in the veterinary medicine.

Since I have never kept one, I wouldn't be able to tell you. <br>  <br>  The way to tell if you have the right amount of salt in the tank is by using hydrometer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Dissolve the salt in a separate container (such as a bucket) and then pour it in... undissolved salt can burn your fish or anything else that lives in your tank.<br>  <br>  You only have to add salt when doing a water change and when first setting up the tank, as salt does not evaporate out of the tank, so always replace water that has evaporated out with fresh water.
GKZPxAaPaa	I have never heard that it was many cases, but I have read that it could happen. It's not that common. My dog is microchipped and he is fine so far. He was chipped since he was a puppy, he is 3 years old now and no problems. <br>  Wow your country makes it mandatory? Interesting.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I'm sure it does happen, but I doubt it's very common. I can't imagine an actual tumor developing, maybe a cyst though.<br>  <br>  My dog or cat isn't microchipped yet, but they will be in the next month or two.|`|GaL66jbQaa	my dog has been fine for 6 years. some dogs develop scar tissue but it is not truly a tumor|`|tB7QK6BTaa	My Dane's are both chip'd.  Neither has had any problems of any kind related to the chip.  Most people I know have their dogs chip'd, so far I've never heard of any tumours or other problems with the chip.<br>  <br>  Consider that it has become an increasingly common thing for people to have their children chip'd, I guess for the crowd who's important enough, or thinks they are, that their children are at significant kidnapping risk.  In any case it would appear that micro-chipping is a fairly well established thing these days and the risks would appear to be minimal.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	From everything I have read the instances of microchips causing tumors are extremely rare and the few they have found have been unproven.|`|Wt61EclRaa	No.  My Greyhound that just passed away had one for 11 years with no problems.  I haven't heard about this happening through our greyhound forum.  Good question|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	I haven't ever heard of a dog getting a tumor next to the microchip. And so far I haven't noticed anything where my dogs microchips are. One is 8 months old, and the other is 20 weeks... so, they've had them for a couple weeks and like... 5 months.|`|b015RuNFaa	While I hear that it is indeed possible for a tumor to develop at the microchip site, I've had five dogs (three currently) over the years that have been microchipped and this has never been an issue for me or anyone I know.  None of my dogs have ever had any ill effects from microchipping.  Actually, my issues have more been with getting the chip properly registered, but that's an entirely different issue.  Here's something to keep in mind:<br>  <br>  "Considering how a large number of pets have been implanted with microchips with a relatively small number of confirmed cases of tumors associated with microchips, the AVMA advises against a rush to judgment on the technology.<br>  <br>  In fact, there is a concern among veterinary medical researchers that some of the research into supposed chip-induced tumors may be flawed, because the animals used were genetically predisposed to cancer. In addition, removal of the chip is a more invasive procedure and not without potential complications."
wLgGD63raa	You can use unglazed slate tile for your leopard geckos tank. It'd be a lot less of a hassle to just go buy some at Lowe's or Home Depot. You can usually have them cut it for you to fit your tank and it's pretty cheap. It only cost me $6 to do my 29 gallon.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	You can use terra cotta clay, but unless it is sealed, water will destroy it. Look in a crafts store for it. You can also buy premade tiles and saucers at Home Depot or Lowe's.

I have been breeding guppies for the fun of it for about 6 years now. You could try selling them to your local pet shop. You might have some trouble though, assuming you bought your guppies from a pet store, and not a breeder.<br>  <br>  Pet store guppies are not breeding stock, and eventually you will end up with deformed guppies (ie: smaller fins and hump backs) a simple way to try and combat that problem is occasionally buy some new guppies to get fresh blood into your gene pool.
ItADvi7Daa	You can't dig into the gravel because you will damage the root system. What I do is get my hand into the plant and swirl around the top of the plant and suck up the debris that floats upward with my vac.|`|369F0dYfaa	sorry i don't have a detailed description but the website under my source has a picture of a vacuum which works pretty well with mine, you can find them at almost every pet store. another idea is you can buy a custom tank that has a filer at the bottom of the tank under the gravel but they are very expensive. good luck|`|0FA9gr9Iaa	How can you clean the tank when it’s full of plants? The simple answer is, carefully! A gravel vacuum doesn’t work very well when there are roots and plants growing out of the gravel, and with other substrates you can’t use this method either. Cleaning the bottom of the tank if you over-feed your fish can be very difficult and take a very long time. If you get the balance right, it’s not necessary very often, which makes it easier<br>  <br>  Most plants need food to grow. Some of the food comes from the fish waste, but other nutrients will still need to be added occasionally. This really is part of the tending of the plants, so it will become part of that routine, but still needs to be considered.<br>  <br>  Why should plants need to be tended? Remember that an aquarium is a closed environment. In there, many things can make a difference to the quality of the water even to the extent of polluting it so much that the fish die. Rotting leaves and plant matter are a big source of pollution in aquaria. Tending the plants is simply making sure that any dying leaves or stems are removed promptly, not left to rot, and making sure that the plants stay healthy and looking good. One plant can take over the tank very quickly, while others take time to grow, so one of the tasks is to keep everything in balance during the growth, and maintain that balance in maturity<br>  <br>  You now know what plants you are going to use, so now you need to choose the substrate for them. Some will be happy with gravel, others will need special aquarium plant substrate such as Flourite, some may need sand, yet others could need a compost base. Research is the key all the way through this. Once you know what plants you are looking at, the substrate needs to suit them. Bear in mind that some plant substrates can be very expensive, so choose wisely.<br>  <br>  Are we getting the idea yet? A planted aquarium is not just a matter of throwing a few plants in and letting them get on with it. Many people term this now as aquascaping, and it has become something of an art. You can spend a little or a lot, depending on the final effect you want, but it’s not to be hurried in any event!|`|YnCUyvK7aa	You clean any areas without plants as you would an unplanted tank.  You can also use a gravel vacuum with a narrow diameter to clean the uppermost level of the planted area to get out any visible debris.<br>  <br>  But to really clean down near the bases of the plants, especially if they're planted closely together, you use invertebrates and fish.  Algae eating shrimp, ghost shrimp, cherry shrimp, Malaysian trumpet snails [can multiply quickly], nerite snails [won't multiply in a freshwater tank], blackworms [a fish food that will breed in an aquarium and give the fish an occasional treat as they usually burrow into the substrate], and smaller species of loaches and corydoras.  There are also a lot of microorganisms that are food for fry that eat or remove the organic debris.  And even if they don't eat the material, any that gets disturbed will float out to where it can be picked up by your filter.<br>  <br>  And some of the debris just turns into an organic silt or mulm on the top of the substrate that feeds your plants.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	You just be very careful when you clean it. I have had planted aquariums for about 6 years. Some plants will root them selves very well, so try to research some that you personally like. Also, bottom feeders will help to clean up the food that falls down to the aquarium floor, so I always have a few depending on tank size.<br>  <br>  If you plan on a planted tank, I would suggest getting fluorite gravel or eco complete, or something along those lines. Water column fertilizers are important too, my favorite so far is Plant Gro by Nutrafin.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	~warning! rambly answer ahead!~<br>  <br>  Because they think, "Wow, that's a cool/cute animal, I want one!" without realizing how much work or specialized care the specific animal needs. I guess they figure "Well, I've had a cat or a dog, or some goldfish, how much harder can this be than that? You just keep it in a tank..." The average person knows that all a dog or cat basically needs is food and clean water every day, and a fish just needs flakes every now and then and a water change from time to time, but sadly, if that's all you give to most reptiles, you won't have them nearly as long as you should.<br>  <br>  They feel sorry for the "poor little turtles" that are being sold on the side of the road and want to get the poor little thing out of those conditions, not realizing that helping that one little turtle will put hundreds more into the same conditions, and when you're buying that poor little turtle from someone who can't even offer a care sheet?!<br>  <br>  I think part of it is the buyers, but I also put some of the blame on people who sell animals to customers who have no idea what they're doing. I believe every business that sells live animals has a responsibility to at the very least supply a basic care sheet to anyone who leaves their business with an animal, and to give the people some idea of what they're getting into.<br>  <br>  The pet store I used to work at (still help out from time to time) not only keeps care sheets for 99% of what they have (and can have a care sheet for the other 1% within a matter of minutes, but they have books which they suggest customers buy at least at the same time as they purchase the animal, they've got knowledgable people working there who are more than willing to explain that "If you want that turtle, here's what you're going to need to keep it healthy and happy..." and with some of their stock, there's even adults on display so that you can SEE that that cute little green iguana that's looking at you with those big buggy eyes will grow up to be old 5 and a half foot plus Rasputin with the not-too-wonderful personality in the cage next to them. (Don't get me wrong, 'Putin's fine once you get him out of his tank, but be ready to bleed...) Or that those little bitty sliders will grow up one day. Or have someone on hand to say "Yes, these ball pythons have been eating fine for us so far, but don't be suprised if they go a few weeks without, because that's the way they are." or "That sand boa thinks thumbs are pinky mice." (somehow the guy who bought that thing never has been bitten by it when it tried to eat me every chance it got...) Or even straight out "We're not selling you that. We've never seen you before, you don't own any reptiles, and that vieled chameleon is not a good starter animal, how about a leopard gecko or a bearded dragon, or something else that's a bit easier to maintain?"<br>  <br>  It gets a bit annoying when you go in for feeders and everyone's busy explaining basic needs and care of whatever for potential owners, but I gladly wait when I have to... it makes me feel good when a parent walks out of there explaining to their kid why they can't have that turtle or iguana right now... or hearing a kid be told "Sure, you can buy that when you come back in with one of your parents."|`|hFgXi9cSaa	becuase some ppl are ignorant if i spelled that right <br>  <br>  they think herps are materialistic things,there liveing creatures and should be treated with respect and then some.|`|k2l20XdFaa	Good question, I ask myself that all the time. It is also the same reason that Congress has bills on the table as we speak. There are bills banning pythons, boas, and another bill that will even ban everything that is not naturally found in North America. This will ban frogs, turtles, lizards, monitors, birds, snakes, ect..... They even have the humane society backing them on these bans. The ban is against importing, selling, buying, breeding, trading, and even crossing state lines with these animals. The bans are HR6311, HR669, S373.|`|wZKb8egaaa	Impulse. It's something that everyone has done at some point in their life. When a little kid sees a cute little turtle they beg and beg until their parents give in. The parents know that the turtle wont live long, but they don't care enough to try and take care of it, because they didn't want their kid did. (which is why most people get their kids goldfish as a first pet, easy, and a short life-expectance. Not really, gold fish can live 10+ years and get really big.)<br>  It's the same as when kids find bugs or sick animals, the parents either gets rid of them or lets their kids kill them. <br>  And some people are just stupid. They want something cute that they saw on tv or in the pet store and just buy it without thinking. Even the caresheets in petco give enough info about the basic care that people ask about on this site. And petco fails as far as giving info about animals, which should tell you how much people pay attention. (on the care sheet they gave me for my iguana, the only thing wrong was the mention that I should give him crickets. Other then that it left out a lot of aggression issues iguanas have. I'm glade that I did a lot of research before, after, and still to this day.)<br>  So, my answer is, impulse buys. "It's cute, lets get it" -Two weeks later- "Why is it sick?/The vet cost too much./ It died." Yeah . . . after a while people learn to do research but how many animals do they have to kill before realizing this?<br>  <br>  P.S. Some people can also think that they are show animals. Like my mom. She doesn't understand why I like reptiles (or any animal other then a dog or cat) she always ask me what is the purpose of a snake, or frog like they shouldn't be alive or something. But she likes to look at them and force me to fix their tanks if I let them go an extra day without cleaning or I sleep in and don't feed them right away. She wants to say that we have them in the house without having to do any work for them. A lot of people are like that, but unlike the people the person who asked the question is talking about she would never buy them.<br>  <br>  Just thought I'd put that in as another reason parents let their kids get these animals without pushing them to do research. Because, if you haven't noticed it's mostly (not all, there are a some adults who buy animals without researching because they think they're cute) minors who do this.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Its all about the way it looks and feels to them to tell or show people, "hey look what i got, a snake /lizard, im cool and different<br>  But people dont understand that it is a living breathing thing that you have to take care of|`|b94588139eda1c69ea59fe863af53826aa	they are stupid, they think it would be cool to have it then they get tired of it.|`|o2ZWe0RQaa	ure rite i have seen lodz of people on the internet sayin oh plz sum1 help me i have got a snake i dont no what 2 do it is completly stupid and think of the snake itself.<br>  <br>  i have got snakes and i reserched for mounths before i finaly got 1.|`|ACGBj2liaa	not to be a smart ***, but same reason people have kids that shouldn't<br>   they don't think ahead.

YnCUyvK7aa	They don't work very well with sand, because the sand usually falls down through the openings in the plastic base.  If you can see under the tank, you should be able to see if there's a lot.<br>  <br>  The way an undergravel works is that they use an air pump [old way] or a powerhead [newer method] to pull water and wastes down through the gravel then under the plastic base where there are bacteria to remove the ammonia and nitrite.  Then the water gets pulled up the tubes to the top and goes back out into your tank.  If the space under the UG base is filled with sand, the water and wastes won't flow through very easily.  And because wastes build up under the base, you do need to pull it up and clean underneath every few months.<br>  <br>  It would be best to save up to get a hang-on power filter.  It's more powerful than an air-driven undergravel filter, and the filter pads are outside the tank where they're easier to clean when they need it.  You do this by rinsing them in the bucket when you do a partial water change.  If you clean them in tapwater, the chlorine will kill the good bacteria living on the filter.  You only need to change the pads when the floss starts pulling apart.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	as long as the sand is the very corse kind it will work

uKW6HUSOaa	Your best bet would probably be another English Bulldog.|`|TgRLsibGaa	I agree
hQIqEnTEaa	I would recommend a horse about 10-14 years old (been around but still has many good years left).<br>  <br>  As for breed, as others have mentioned, temperament is most important. Maybe a warmblood (although these tend to be more expensive) or a thoroughbred (cheaper) or a quarter horse. Don't be put off TBs because of their reputation as crazy race horses - my first horse was a TB but is lovely and quiet because he was properly educated after his race career ended. <br>  <br>  If you live in a cold environment your horse with need to be rugged against the weather so breed doesn't matter - you just rug according to need.<br>  <br>  When buying make sure you get a horse that has had plenty of riding experience (there are horses out there that make it past 10 years old without being broken in).<br>  <br>  When you get your horse remember that it is possible to feed for temperament (spiritedness vs laziness). My horse was fed on cool feeds while I became confident in the saddle. Then as I became more experienced I ditched the cool feeds and went for oats and other grains to give him more zing. <br>  <br>  BTW a great way to learn about horse care is to volunteer at a stable. I learnt at the riding for the disabled association - they taught me all about basic horsemanship, we got to ride the nice, well-mannered horses (for free) and were doing something good for the community too. Why don't you see if there is something similar for you to get involved in?|`|SrkoKZWuaa	You can probably find a larger quarter horse, about 15.3- 16.1 hh.  They are usually pretty quiet, but it does vary a lot from horse to horse.  If you get a 8- 14 yr old horse with experience it would probably be a good horse for a beginner. At that age the horse is most likely going to be healthier and therefore easier to keep warm during winter. Just make sure they have shelter an as much hay as they will eat (during the winter), as this is what keeps them warm. :) Good Luck|`|1uR2zPnEaa	first mistake first time horse buyers make is= what breed?<br>  <br>  don't search for horses buy breed, search for a horse by it's temperment, ability, health, and of course your price range.. then breed and color...<br>  <br>  but if you want something big go for warmbloods, or BIG quarter horses<br>  and something 7-10 years old <br>  <br>  good luck! happy horse shopping!!|`|AnX8QHgHaa	I would go look at the place close to your house and see if there is a possible half-lease situation there.<br>  <br>  A half-lease would let you work with the trainer without owning (a big plus if you are looking to buy a horse and then keep it there) <br>  <br>  It would probably give you 3 days a week with the horse (lesson for you one day, lesson for your mom the second day, and a day for you to practice a bit on your own)|`|Czh1fbQgaa	Whoa! Slow down! You NEED to take riding lessons before you make the VERY EXPENSIVE and LONG TERM commitment of buying a horse. You might not even like riding. After you take lessons for at LEAST a year, then you might be ready for a horse. Do AS MUCH RESEARCH AS POSSIBLE! I mean books, tv, internet, everything. When you are actually ready for a horse, a quarter horse, paint, appaloosa, breed really doesn't matter that much. The individual personality of the horse is more important. And NEVER get a stallion. Only mares or geldings.|`|XL62syrCaa	I would look at a draft/quarter mix. They tend to be laid ,back and larger and are good trail horses. But a larger foundation bred quarter horse (what I mean is thick and stocky, not these new leggy quarter horses) would be good too. Most horses can tolerate the cold just fine if you allow them to get used to it, unless they are a really hard keeper.<br>  <br>  But overall I can't necessarily recommend a breed. Whats going to be best is to find a horse no matter the breed that fits your specifics. You can't even count in age as I recently sold a 3 year old quarter horse who was so laid back that a beginner could ride her with only 60 days of training. She as smart and a quick learner and was great. Then I had an 18 year old that was so high strung that only the most experienced of riders could handle her.<br>  <br>  So all in all its going to be taking someone with you who knows horses and trying out the horse, doing a trial before you buy for maybe 30 days to make sure its a good fit and going from there. Sometimes the breeds you don't think would be good, turn out to be a best. Also make sure you don't shy away from mix breeds and unknown breeds as they can be just as good or better than mixes. It just takes time and you can find the perfect horse for you!
XQAT64toaa	the ingredients in indoor catfood differ from the ingredients in other catfoods. this makes the food easier to digest, and thus, easier on the cat's digestive system. if the companies advertised this nice effect, i'm sure they would make a lot more money than they already do.|`|DEdtNBBSaa	Well there's a lot to be considered about commercial cat food.

SXfWmOYHaa	I take my dog to the dog park all the time and there are people that come in without dogs occasionally.  Most of the time, it's parents with kids who want to see the dogs.  <br>  <br>  It depends on the type of people that frequent your dog park.  I happen to absolutely love dogs and I like to see people who love dogs as well, so it wouldn't bother me.  <br>  <br>  The 'weird' factor people may get from it may also depend on your age.  If you're a kid or teenager, I'm sure people wouldn't mind it as long as you're respectful of their dogs.  <br>  <br>  It also depends on what you are doing once you're in the park.  If you're going in and just staring and watching other dogs, it can be unnerving to some people.  However, if you're going in and socializing with the owners, it won't seem that way at all.  <br>  <br>  Visiting the dog park when you're considering getting a dog is a great idea.  It gives you a chance to talk to dog owners about their dogs and they can usually give you advice on dog behaviors, rescue groups/shelters, breeders, and even obedience training.|`|onfX2jqLaa	its not weird at all!<br>  i know very many people that do it for many reasons!<br>  i even do it myself sometimes.<br>  people may do it to play with dogs,<br>  meet people,<br>  scout out how the dogs are when considering to bring their dog there,<br>  and what youre doing!<br>  <br>  so many people are incredibly nice at dog parks and you will probably make friends there:)<br>  i suggest you go and look for breeds youre interested in. dont be afraid to ask people about their dogs!

TuHfZdYGaa	Desexing at 3 months???????<br>  <br>  Why this young?<br>  <br>  I have two staffords and one is still a young pup. She gets raw bones everyday and plenty of chew toys to play with. Staffords are *chewy* pups and will become frustrated when they have no raw bones or tasty chew treats. They become bored very easily also.<br>  <br>  Your pup will be teething at the moment and needs lots of long lasting chews, rope toys, kongs filled with meat etc.<br>  <br>  Raw lamb shanks, chicken legs, pork trotters, I even give my girl frozen raw sardines.<br>  <br>  In a few weeks you can start puppy classes/kindergarden. It is wise to sign up. If you cant control your puppy now it will be much harder later on.<br>  <br>  Phone your vet and ask for a reccomendation on puppy classes, then phone the trainer and get some pre-class advice.<br>  <br>  Training for a Stafford is a lifetime commiment. A few paragraphs here wont really set you up with the knowledge you need to be able to train your pup effectively.

Thats why he needed to stay with his liter mates until 12 weeks. Bite Inhibition. And he needs you to be the leaders. Now. <br>  <br>  Get him in puppy classes and start setting boundaries. <a href="http://www.flyingdogpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingdogpress.com</a> (read free article "it takes a pack to raise a puppy"... yes you must sign up too:-(. thats new)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a>|`|LYnK4xb0aa	snippy is not an option in my home ,,nutted or not snippy should be corrected now or the biting will get worse and the visitors will have the law on you|`|AM7CgQ4daa	30 years ago in australia most puppies were obtained at 6 weeks of age, so this does not automatically mean that your puppy will be vicious.  More likely this is a matter of having a dominate determined pup, that will grow into a vicious adult dog if you can not stop it now.<br>  Contact an animal behaviourist to come to your house,  the observe how you and your dog interact, and you and your partner as well.  He will give advice on what you are doing wrong, and how to treat your dog so he will grow up to respect you.<br>  I would also recommend obedience classes, your dog sounds as if he is used to ignoring you, classes will teach you how to talk to your dog to demand his attention, you observe and learn from the teacher and other people.|`|wJdAybRnaa	Treat him as normal??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That will let the dog know that his behaviour is okay when it certainly is not. <br>  <br>  Go to a very reputable dog trainer/behaviourist (your vet can probably recommend one). <br>  <br>  I would suspect that some of this problem stems from the fact that you got the dog too early. Puppies shouldn't leave the litter/the mom until AT LEAST 8 weeks old, 12 weeks being preferable. That time is crucial for proper socialization. Puppies bite each other, and when a puppy bites too hard the other puppy yelps, letting the puppy know that biting is not allowed. (Or will bite back!) This helps the dog understand that biting is not okay, and that extends to humans. Your dog didn't get this education when he was younger. Has he been outside a lot (on a leash), visiting new parks and neighborhoods, meeting new people, meeting news dogs, if not every day, at lest every week? He needs this in order to be properly socialized as well. <br>  <br>  Training definitely is needed in your case. I would call your vet and ask for a referral. Specialty practices have a beahviourist on staff usually.
09fdLaeIaa	yes<br>  he is hibernating<br>  he will probably wake up in spring<br>  do not make any loud noises or you will wake it up|`|TphsSOz6aa	How about keeping him in a heated tank, so he doesn't have to hybernate??  Reptiles/amphibians  have to be fat, and in super condition, and the water has to have high oxygen levels, to survive hybernation.
F3FrZ7eAaa	A lot of reptile owners choose to buy sterlite and rubber maid tubs rather than getting a tank. This is because they are inexpensive, completely sufficient and hold heat and humidity well. You can pick them up basically anywhere... wal-mart works. This would be a lot easier than building your own tank. You need to drill an appropriate amount of holes in there. Drills can often crack the plastic though, so unless you're going to be extra slow and careful, I recommend a soldering iron. It gets hot, and burns through the plastic. It doesn't need to be through the lid, if that's what you were asking. Just make some through the side.|`|HyWeOyT4aa	If you are new to keeping snakes you can e-mail me if you'd like.

These puppies are awful young, and to be kept outside like that is curel...another irresponsible breeder (not you, the other person). <br>  <br>  You need to go to the vet on Monday, not in two weeks. If the dogs have ticks and were outside for their whole life, they also most likely have fleas, which is not fatal in adult dogs, but in young puppies can cause anemia (literally, the fleas are sucking out all the puppies' blood). These pups need to be checked out for everything immediately.|`|Pe03hn9Haa	Do you by any chance live in Texas?

01nMRPHVaa	Common Name:Greek Tortoise, Spur-Thigh Tortoise<br>  <br>  Latin name: Testudo graeca<br>  <br>   <br>  Native to: Southern Spain, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe and Middle East<br>  <br>  Size: Adult carapace size is 6 - 7 inches. Hatchlings average 1? - 2 inches.<br>  <br>  Life span: Estimated to be over 50 years with proper care<br>  <br>  General appearance: The coloration of the Greek tortoise is highly variable and can range from olive with dark spots in the middle of each scute on the carapace to a "golden" form which is almost entirely yellow in appearance.<br>  <br>  Housing requirements:<br>  <br>  Enclosure: The best enclosure for Greek tortoises is an open "turtle table" of approximately 4 feet long by 2 feet wide by 1 to 2 feet deep for an adult Greek Tortoise though the bigger the better. Often preformed plastic garden ponds can be easily converted for this task. Aquariums are not recommended for tortoises as they do not allow proper air circulation. Very large screen enclosures such as a "Reptarium" may also be adequate.<br>  <br>  Temperature: A temperature gradient of 75° - 85° F should be provided with a basking area of 95° F. Nighttime temperatures can be allowed to drop to 75° F.<br>  <br>  Heat/Light: Temperatures can be maintained by using incandescent basking bulbs, infrared heat bulbs or ceramic emitters. As with most species of tortoises UVA and UVB light sources need to be provided. This can be achieved with specialized fluorescent bulbs. Many have had great success with newer mercury vapor bulbs which provide both heat and UVA and UVB light in one bulb that fits into a standard incandescent fixture.<br>  <br>  Substrate: A variety of substrates can be used. A sandy soil mix of 50% topsoil and 50% Caribbean play sand is often used with great success. Aspen shavings, milled coconut fiber and even compressed recycled paper (e.g. Carefresh) can also be used.<br>  <br>  Environment: Greek tortoises are a terrestrial species which prefers a dry climate. A suitable place to hide should also be provided. Such hiding places can be constructed from rocks or plastic containers. Commercially manufactured caves can also be used.<br>  <br>  Diet: The Greek tortoise is strictly herbivorous. They require a high fiber, low protein and calcium rich diet. Dark leafy greens such as kale, dandelion, mustard, collard and turnip greens should be fed regularly. Natural grasses and hays can also be provided. High protein foods such as commercially prepared dog and cat food and beans should be avoided at all costs since this will eventually cause renal failure due to the excessive protein. Fruits can be given sparingly since too many fruits will result in diarrhea and other health issues. If calcium supplementation is required try to use pure calcium carbonate. The bone of the cuttle fish can also be used and is commonly found in pet shops for calcium supplementation for birds.<br>  <br>  Fresh water should be offered at all times in a shallow dish. Your tortoise will also appreciate a 10-minute soak in a shallow bath water to ensure proper hydration.<br>  <br>  Maintenance: The enclosure should be spot cleaned daily. A thorough cleaning should be performed on a regular basis. A 5% bleach solution is an excellent disinfectant. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the enclosure before replacing the substrate and placing the tortoise back in the enclosure. It is always recommended to wash your hands thoroughly after handling the tortoise or cleaning the cage and cage accessories.

But pastrami is highly seasoned and contains garlic and onion (salts or powdered forms) and both are toxic to cats. Garlic and onions (as well as other members of the lily family) contain an enzyme that causes hemolytic anemia in cats. It weakens and destroys the cell walls of red blood cells.<br>  <br>  How about opting for a healthy kitty treat like dried turkey or chicken breast. There are several kitty treats on the market now that are just dried chicken or turkey meat- no spices. If your kitty really loves that wonderful beef flavor then why not give him a small piece? even a small bit of raw hamburger would be a good snack.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	pastrami is a highly seasoned meat, usually with massive amounts of salt and sometime large amounts of pepper.

1YNhKzeqaa	About nine months old, but its better if they are a couple years old.<br>  <br>  Goldfish need certain conditions to mate, they aren't as prolific breeders as  guppies and other live bearers.

1WmDOPGtaa	Very patiently.  At four months, your pup is sure to have a pretty short attention span.  Keep sessions to about 5-10 minutes  ( a couple times a day, start on the shorter end and build up) and make it fun.  The trick is to always leave your dog wanting more.  Try to always end on a successful note.  Find a good stinky treat that your dog goes nutty for, but be careful not to overfeed.  If you've done a few training sessions and used a lot of treats, cut back 1 of the meals a bit to compensate.<br>  <br>  At four months your dog should have all of his shots (or will within the next week or so depending on when your vet appointment is).  That means he's old enough to start obedience classes.  I highly recommend you look into it.  It will be much more about training you than your dog, especially in the beginning.  Don't underestimate the value of that.  Much in dog training can be counter-intuitive.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	the same way as a younger puppy, just with loads more patience, and you might have to get rid of some bad habits, and that would take more patience but it can be done|`|LYnK4xb0aa	about 5 min every hour work on the same thing ,,,like "come",, the pup like coming to you anyway so work on the word and reward ,,after a week work on sit  and stay as the pup gets older and sees what your doing the training will get faster  and longer|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	Chessies are very intelligent but a bit independent.  My guide dog is a chessy.  <br>  <br>  At four months they are old enough for obedience classes verses puppy classes. <br>  <br>  The trainer or you should modify how much time you should spend practicing lessons at home, and how much force to use on a correction.  Don't train a chessy with a totally positive method of training.  It won't work on a chessy.  Since your dog is crossed with chessy and lab, you can't be sure which will predominate for which characteristics.  A chessy will want to please you only if he sees you as his leader.  A lab won't fold under discipline either, so an approach that works on a chessy will work fine on a lab.  The reverse isn't always true.<br>  <br>  Don't use a head halter or choke chain on him.  A head halter can cause whiplash if your attention wanders and you stop walking.  It can also cause permanent nerve damage to the sensitive nerves on the bridge of the muzzle.  They are potentially very cruel if not used by the experienced.<br>  <br>  Choke chains shouldn't be used on puppies or adolescent dogs.  They can damage the cartilage in the neck bones.  In an adult dog the cartilage has all calcified and is no longer at risk.<br>  <br>  Use either a martingale (sometimes called a greyhound collar), or if your pup is too hard to control with one, use a prong collar.  They look bad but are actually gentler than choke chains.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She won't bleed.  Cats in heat rub against things, get vocal and affectionate, and sometime pee on things.  Some cats won't show all the symptoms and some even have *silent heats*.  You should have your cat spayed.  She is at risk of developing deadly cancers of the reproductive tract and of developing a deadly uterine infection called Pyometra which will cause her uterus to fill with pus and explode.  I would call the vet for an appointment ASAP.

onfX2jqLaa	absolutely do it. my boyfriend got our dog neutered about a year ago and it was the best decision. <br>  i actually think it is wrong if you do not because he will want to mate all the time and wont be able to. it seems like they have emotional problems when not neutered because they are almost sexually frustrated. they will want to try to mate with anything...like legs as you probably know.<br>  once you neuter him within a week you will see him so incredibly happier. <br>  within a month his testosterone levels have gone down and he is no longer agressive to everything and probably wont hump anything. <br>  yes he will absolutely still be your brave watchdog and will try to be macho and protect you whenever he can, he just wont try to eat every dog and cat that passes him by on walks thankfully!<br>  it is also easier to train male dogs once they have been neutered because they are not trying to be dominant over you.<br>  <br>  i have heard a lot of research and male dogs are much happier emotionally and behaviorally after being neutered.<br>  <br>  and dont worry! he wont be sad at all or be mopeing because he isnt sexually driven. he will be just as playful if not more.<br>  <br>  do it! good luck!|`|XC36OOiTaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  There are multiple health benefits to neutering a dog no matter what age he is at the time of the surgery.  As far as behavioral or emotional problems, he is supposed to be a pet.  I assume that you don't allow him to breed whenever he wants (which would be all the time).  He is constantly wanting to breed and will always have the urge to breed as long as he has his testicles.  So keeping him intact and not neutering him is cruel in my opinion.  He will be much happier after the surgery.  I wouldn't even tell your dad until it's done.|`|RSJTy4cdaa	No you don't have to. But he shouldn't have negative behavioral or emotional problems from it. Sometimes females can become more aggressive after being fixed but not males. Usually the opposite happens to males. <br>  Just remember, for a male dog there is less of a health benefit than for a female dog to be fixed but both can have serious complications. Weigh the risks with the benefits.|`|wJdAybRnaa	Yes you can get them neutered at any age (except when they are young puppies). No behavioural problems or anything will emerge, in most cases dogs quiet down after being fixed. Emotional problems...like, he misses his balls? No he won't notice!<br>  <br>  Neutering also reduces/eliminates the chance of your dog getting various cancers (prostate, etc.)<br>  <br>  Don't listen to your dad about animal related issues okay? :)|`|UlOKMInqaa	Yes, get him neutered! It is healthier for him, can prevent behavioral issues, and it will prevent accidental pregnancies (you just never know!). There is already an overpopulation of dogs and you don't want to contribute to that.|`|2P5WRadhaa	By ALL means, neuter him. Even though he's 2, It will still help his behavior, It will cease his hormone production and cut down on aggressive behavior and marking territory. and he'll get along better with everyone and other animals.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Definitely yes, a male dog can be neutered any time after eight weeks of age.

He marks territory only when on walks (no longer in the house) and he's less crazy/hyper.  He also eats less food (save you some money over the long run, lol).  Also, no chance of developing testicular cancer and severely decreased chance of getting prostate cancer.<br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend that during his surgery, you elect to use the laser.  It causes virtually no bleeding during the surgery, there's less swelling and bruising under the skin and incision site, and he will wake up more comfortable.|`|DfyBtGlIaa	It is best to talk to your vet about this issue.  It may be too late, I'm not quite sure.  Because my dad's old dog was neutered when he was a bit older than a puppy and he said that his personality changed.<br>  <br>  My dog isn't neutered and he is 9 and he doesn't go psycho when a female dog walks past cause i teach him who's boss, he hasn't even escaped the yard yet.  You just have to show him who's boss.  Like with wolves only the dominant male and female are allowed to mate and the rest don't try to cross that boundary, and if they do the dominant wolves put them back into place.<br>  <br>  It's a harder job if you choose not to neuter him.  It's up to you if you want to train him.  Talk to a trainer and they could give you some tips on how to control your dog.  You have to think if you can control his urge to mate.  It's all up to you and your family whatever you think is best.<br>  <br>  Hope you make the right choice =)|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	De-sexing him is the best course of action. If you want to avoid the trauma and unpleasantness of a surgical procedure you could opt for the 6-monthly implant, Supre-Lorin. It will suppress his testosterone, making him less aggressive, infertile (temporarily), more malleable and generally more content without the need for snipping off part of his anatomy.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	Do it!!  Get him neutered asap.  The earlier the better.  Now is a better time than never.  <br>  <br>  Thank you.|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Absolutely.

a115d141ee91d817492c69035423f958aa	First, whichever you decide on, DO NOT BUY from a chain petstore (Petsmart), either buy directly from a breeder or a small pet shop. This way they are more apt to be healthy and hand tamed.<br>  <br>  I have 6 Cockatiels at the moment, and they are like having toddlers. They are tons of fun and talk to me all the time, they are great imitators of different noises and love attention. <br>  <br>  My experience with budgies is that they are less attention craved, their care is about the same but the pet to pet owner relationship is not as fun. Yea, their cute, but if you want a miniature friend that will love you lots, get a Cockatiel.<br>  <br>  I totally agree with WhiteParrot, handle the bird before you buy it. A little skittish is kinda normal, but if it bites or shows no signs of wanting you around, keep looking. If you have a lot of time and a lot of patience, you can get a nasty bird to trust and love you, but I wouldn't suggest that to a first time bird owner.<br>  <br>  Lovebirds are fun too, I love my tiels and the lovebirds so much they are complete comics, and make my daughter and I laugh all the time. I really strongly reccomend going to a small pet shop, where the owner actually works, even if you go to several until you find one. Some areas even have Bird stores. That way you can get more of a hands on idea of what bird fits you best.|`|24vQ8D71aa	budgies are more active and will explore and play with anything you put in their cage .<br>  cackateels may talk more, certainly more clearly, but are very needy for company .<br>  for a first bird i would say buggie ,<br>  and if it will be the only one ,budgie or cockateel ,spend a lot of time with him, and let him fly around the room.|`|8Zx1wsgvaa	I've owned both and ended up getting rid of my budgies but still have my cockatiels. Budgies are cute but if you're buying from a pet store, you may not have any luck finding a really tame one. Since I've owned both, my choice is a cockatiel. They're hilarious! I have 2 males and they are so funny to watch and so sweet. Plus, its easier to find tame ones since more people breed and hand feed cockatiels as well as larger birds. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you're a first time bird owner, go with a cockatiel. If you decide it isn't for you, you could probably sell a cockatiel with a cage and accessories pretty easily.|`|6ok6SKjxaa	Go to your local pet store, see if the bird you find is friendly. I really don't think either one is better, just whichever you like more, whichever one is more friendly. <br>  <br>  I've never had a budgie, but I had a cockteil before, she was very sweet. She used to follow me around the house, (yes... like a dog :P) she was a real calm bird, actually slept with me sometimes. She sadly died last year... got a new cockateil that is `CRAZY. Mimics me, chirps all day, but then is a sweetheart aswell at times. It really depends on the bird... like I said, whichever you like best.<br>  <br>  Having it hand-fed is a plus aswell, more of a tamed bird. Both of mine were. I personally recommend cockateils, thats my opinion.|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	What matters is not which bird you get, but that the bird you get is tame and gentle.  Both birds are relatively small.  A cockatiel is very charming if you don't get one that is mean and aggressive.  But budgies can be a lot of fun.  Just make sure you handle the bird before you buy it.  If it is aggressive and strikes out it would not make a good pet.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Agree with Whitepar go to these two websites then visit your local pet store and see which one You fall in love with<br>  <a href="http://www.cockatiels.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatiels.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parrotsecrets.com/BudgieLove" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrotsecrets.com/BudgieLove</a>
IMPvzBk1aa	You won't want to hear this, I'm guessing, but your issue is one of training, and a harsher bit will not solve anything.  You have referred to a couple of dangerous behaviors that are developing, while indicating that she is stiff and "tanking" on the bit.  When a horse isn't trained to respond to seat, weight, and leg cues, riders rely on the mouth for control.  It never works.  The mouth is supposed to be cued as a light communication combined with the body cues that predominate in controlling your horse's speed, tempo, direction, and whoa.<br>  You say she has a temper and if you fight with her.....etc.  I assume by "fighting with her" you are referring to engaging the bit to maintain control.  Instead of now adding leverage force on her mouth, which is really the last thing you should do, you need to train her to respond to the body aids so that you can lighten up on her mouth, which will allow you to ride with lighter hands, and which will solve the bit resistance issues you are having.  <br>  If you ignore this, and just put her into a leverage bit, I can almost guarantee you these problems will get worse in the long run.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i would work her with a tom thumb snaffle for now, when she starts to respond better, go back to the d ring snaffle|`|H8ykO1Kzaa	i agree with the first answer. something like a tom thumb would be good. it will give you a quick response and is good to use when schooling. also, one that has copper will make a horse soft and moist in the mouth.<br>  <br>  or, you can do a thick twisted wire bit. one that has copper in it and made from sweet iron.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	I would suggest the pee wee bit  (see link below)<br>  <br>  It is the best bit I have ever had,  and believe me I have a huge collection of bits.... that I NEVER USE ANY MORE... You will find you get awesome  control with very light pressure.  it is easy on the horse too.  She will love it  (you will too)<br>  <br>   check out the link!|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I would stay with some sort of mild snaffle bit.  Have you tried any bits with copper inlays, or sweet iron?  These are great for horses that don't respond to bits well.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/tack_apparel/bit_gallery/dringsnaffle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a another method that works for in this situation: <br>  <br>  Ok I understand that you want a harsher bit to control her more, but in the long run this will only make things worse.  She needs to be taught to respond to a mild bit before going into harsh bit.  Harsh bits are meant for horses that considered "Done" or "nearly done".  <br>  <br>  If you use a harsh bit now she will fight you more because they cause her more discomfort when she fights you, and this can end with her hurting her mouth badly or even you.<br>  <br>  You might try a  hackamore if you don't think the snaffle is working: this is an english one<br>  <a href="http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=SLT734956" rel="nofollow">http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.as...</a><br>  <br>  I really would really stick a snaffle bit though after training her on a hackamore.<br>  <br>  Also you need to work her from the ground, this bad behavior needs to be corrected not by putting her mouth in a painful situation.  Work from the round pen with the bit in her mouth by lunging her.  Then proceed to ride her.  If you get her warmed up and some what tired in the pen she won't be as excitable when you ride and you will be able to teach her the right way to understand your cues.  This method has worked for me with the younger horses when switching them from a hackamore to a bit, and we only use snaffle bits on the greenies.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Try a kimberwick. I love them and they give you a little more leverage while still being mild. I use them on my very broke horse and my in training 3 year old. Both respond very well to it as with anything Ive ever ridden/trained in a kimberwick. I go for the jointed one (so not the one with a port), because I can work one side of the horse at a time. A tom thumb is a really severe bit and it sounds like you dont really need anything with shanks. If you want to go that route, an Argentinian bit is really nice. They are mild and are jointed so you get a little more leverage than a kimerwick but still have the option of working one side of the horse or the other. This is different from a solid mouthpiece bit because when you pull on one rein, the whole bit moves vs a jointed one where only the side you pull moves. Hope this helps!|`|XnNCNAORaa	A full cheeck, slow twist snaffle is what I'm using on my quarter horse. He's having the same troubles, and my friend let me borrow this bit and it helped considerably for control. I'm not saying this will fix all your problems, but if you can get your hands on one until maybe you can get a better one like the ones mentioned above then I'd do so.<br>  <br>  Also, different horses respond to different bits, so you might have to go through quite a few before you find the right one. One that might be perfect for one horse might be totally the opposite with your horse!
Ih0B30Pvaa	What style do you ride?  I have had this same problem with a gelding I had on a regular snaffle.  I ride english pleasure so I switched to a pelham double reined bit and it worked like magic.  You could switch to the pelham for a while (if you want to use direct reining) and straiten her up before putting her back on maybe a ring snaffle (where there is a ball in the center and the bit splits three ways)  Good luck with her!  I know it can be frustrated when your horse doesn't have respect for the bit and basically does whatever she wants and having an attitude about it.  Don't give up and work with her and let her know who is boss.  Sometime a bit doesn't fit some problems, but just don't let her walk over you!  Hope this helps....|`|6GehblM3aa	I had a similar problem with my gelding.  He wouldn't listen to half halts and would rip your arms off.  I found that transitions helped fix this problem.  Every time your horse starts leaning on you, even slightly, do a transition down to halt.  You must do this with your seat and leg, don't use any rein, just keep a light contact with her mouth.  I did this with my horse and his is a totally different pony now and goes of my seat and leg.  You don't need a stronger bit, they never solve anything.

Also, goldfish can get to be 6-12 inches, so they need much more than a bowl, they need a large tank!|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Well then, the only fish that could survive in that would be an interesting species called: NO FISH AT ALL! The No fish at all is a strange fish, because it is invisible....   sorry, I'll get on track now.<br>  <br>  Another fish you can keep in a bowl is a DEAD FISH! The dead fish species is quite amazing, it doesn't move, and about a week later, it will do something miraculous... called decomposing....<br>  sorry.. ther real facts are listed below.<br>  <br>  ALL FISH NEED FILTERS! NO FISH CAN SURVIVE IN A BOWL! <br>  True, you may have seen goldfish or Bettas in a bowl. BUT those fish are extremely unhealthy, and will die shortly. A goldfish living in a bowl will live for maybe a month, or at most 3 months. In comparison, a healthy goldfish in a proper home can live up to 25 YEARS! Not months, days, or seconds, but YEARS! To have a healthy fish, they must be kept in a tank with a filter.

They can hide in them and chew on them.<br>  <br>  Get a variety of different chew toys.  Sometimes they put flavors in the wooden chew toys so that they're more appealing for little teeth, just be careful about what kind of chemicals and additives they put in there.<br>  <br>  Here's a link so you can see what I'm talking about:|`|oNHtVHzsaa	it could also be the situation he is in. maybe he wants to get out of his cage, or he just wants to get out of his cage. try to take him out as often as possible and give him exercise. like somebody else said, the paint should be non-toxic because it's made for hamsters. my hamster used to do it all the time... it's nothing to worry about.|`|UlOKMInqaa	I have the same issue with my rats.

XsDs34Uuaa	I agree, neats foot oil is amazing stuff. <br>  Takes out scratches, water stains, everything, not to mention keeps your saddle in excellent shape! Its also GREAT for storage. I have a crosby saddle myself, I got it new six years ago and it too got the scuff marks from the stirrup leathers. If you have a havanna coloured saddle, do be warned that over time the neats foot oil WILL turn it mahogany. (not that mahogany looks bad) I suggest that if you have matching take (aka havanna bridle breastplate girth and saddle) to use the oil on ALL the items, this way when the darkening process takes place everything will still match. To get the scuff marks out you'll really have to SLATHER the oil on, like let it drip, the saddle will absorb it normally overnight and just keep applying until it wont soak up anymore. I did this to my saddle before storing it a couple years ago, took it out just today actually and its softer than its ever been!!|`|5i8lDbXfaa	How dark of a brown is your saddle, light or havana?   I use neatsfoot oil on my saddle it looks like it's darkening it when you first apply it but really it is not.  Just let the oil soak in and then rip the excess of with a soft cloth. It makes the color richer looking, I would be more concerned about getting the stitching too oily than the color darkening.  I find neatsfoot to be a really product, my friend used some of mine on her darker tan western saddle it it made it look really nice.
IrdZKYT3aa	I'd actually suggest filling out the schools you currently have.You need at least two more danio and another glowlight.  Cardinals need to be in groups of 6 or more to be Truly happy and adventurous, so I don;t think, even with what you have, that you could safely have them in there : (<br>  Instead, how about filling in the schools you have and maybe adding one killi fish instead?  They;re hard to find, but are very striking when you do!  They'll hang out around the top and are a great fish for smaller aquariums.<br>  Or maybe a few shrimp to help with the flooring, their bio load is pretty low so you could have a few and be ok.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	The danio needs 3-4 more buddies and the Glowlights need another 2-3.<br>  <br>  Just fill out the schools you have and add a cory or two.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

You can injure your snake.<br>  There is a greater chance of hurting your snake if you use tape to remove the eye caps. I know this is in many care guides,but I don't recommend it! The q-tip with mineral oil will safely soften the eye caps and remove them.|`|b94588139eda1c69ea59fe863af53826aa	most shed problems are caused by humidity being to low try soaking the snake in some warm water for 20 or 30 mins and then rub the old skin with your fingers or put the snake in a pillow case and let it crawl around for awhile|`|AA12197187	As mentioned in previous answers, humidity is the culprit (or better up, the lack thereof).

Well, it's not like magic, but it's sort of like "kitty cologne" that cats react positively to. You can find these in a good pet supply store, or online.

The best RO membrane in the world costing thousands of dollars is only 98-99% effective. So even that one would have a reading of 4 TDS using Rohns 200 tds number. <br>  <br>  The Ro filter takes out most of the TDS it is Deionization process that takes out the rest, and would take the water down to 0 TDS.   Hence the term, RODI water. <br>  <br>  9 tds is very good and not a problem at all.  A reading of 9 tds is about what RO water should be. <br>  <br>  I would use whatever is more convenient for you to use the RO or distilled water.

u2LGeiA0aa	I agree completely with the other responses, I have 2 cats, one communicates with her tail, the other seems to use it as a fashion accessory.  They depend on their tails for balance and to keep them centered, you'll start to notice this if you watch him jump, walk on narrow surfaces or jump vertically and stop quickly. Cheetah's use their tails for balance when they have to make sharp turns while running at high speeds. It's pretty amazing when you see the technology built in to your cat, tail and all.|`|nGafpEwoaa	Yes they have feeling and control of there tails.  The tail is part of there body.

If you've ever accidentally stepped on a cat's tail, or closed it in a door when you don't realize they're behind you, trust me they'd let you know (I'm not saying to go and try that by the way). It might seem like he isn't paying attention to it, but really, do you watch your legs while you're walking or running? You know they're there, you don't have to pay attention to them. And the letting it have a mind of it's own - if he's moving it around a lot, he's probably just 'talking' to you. I have three cats - one of them is very much a 'tail-talker'. Her tail is hardly ever still, but she meows less than the other two. She communicates with her tail.|`|UlOKMInqaa	Your cat has complete control of his tail!

70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You learned the hard way.Cats can get pregnant as soon as they have their first heat at about 6 months of age.Also ,cats should be kept indoors where they are safe. But the kittens are born now,and you have a job to do.Encourage her to get into the box with the kittens. Feed her something first,she may be hungry.Gently restrain her and put the kittens to her teats to see if they will nurse. It's important that they at least get the colostrum from the mom,as it protects them from disease.Often,a first-time mother will not know what to do and has to be shown.If they start nursing,this produces endorphins,which make the mom feel happy and relaxed and she may settle down and feed them.If she doesn't have more kittens by tomorrow,take her and the babies to the vet to make sure that she is OK. And yes,make an appointment to get her spayed and don't let her outside!! Indoor cats are so much safer and they can't get pregnant,unless you also have an intact male inside.<br>  <br>  If mom cat won't cooperate,you will have to go and get kitten milk replacer at the pet store or Walmart.You'll also need nursing bottles,which are sold in the same area of the store.You'll need to feed the babies about two teaspoonsful of formula every three hours and you'll have to stimulate them to go to the bathroom by massaging the belly,genital and anal area with a warm ,damp cloth.You'll have to do this after every feeding until they are about 3-4 weeks old.And you'll need a heating pad set on low,covered with a towel, and only keep it underneath one half of the box so the kittens can get away from it if they get too warm. Your vet can tell you more. Most cats are good moms,though,so give her a chance.The kittens will be fine for a few hours. Oh,and feed the mom kitten food,all she wants, and plenty of water.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thecatsite.com/Care/22/Hand-Rearing-Kittens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecatsite.com/Care/22/Hand-R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKTR6ciQTwg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKTR6ciQT...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4474827_raise-newborn-kittens-mother-rejects.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4474827_raise-ne...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Oh,that is wonderful that she is feeding them!!

Take her to them and try to get her to nurse them.  If she doesn't take to them, you'll need to bottle feed.

It's funny because I am currently writing a paper in college about why a person should spay or neuter their pets.  There are health benefits, the mental stress of going into heat is zero and just one litter of kittens can result in 67,000 cats over a 6 year period.  That's pretty incredible!  With over 8 MILLION pets dropped off at shelters every year and 4 to 5 million of those having to be euthanized (killed) because they don't have enough room to house them all or their one week adoption time has expired or they are sick or unadoptable.   It's a pretty sad case because even though you will give your kittens to a good home, who is to say their kittens will go to a good home.  People adopt whole litters of kittens to sell to testing labs.  It's pretty sad to let those animals go through that torture.  I'm so glad you will be having your baby girl spayed when she's done.  They can usually get pregnant anyway from as little as 5 months, so your babygirl at least got to have SOME childhood before she becomes a mother.  Hopefully, you'll be able to place the kittens by her belly to nurse.  She is probably very scared right now and really needs you.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	The box is good, put food and water near the box for Momma.... she'll settle down when she's ready... if she continues running around like that you may need a trip to an emergency vet to deal with stuck kitten(s)..... try to stay calm and calm her, if you can gently put her in the box with the kittens that is fine, but don't handle her roughly in any case.  Have you checked on the kittens?  Are they breathing?  If they're stillborn she may be ignoring them.  Since this would appear to be her first (and hopefully only) litter, she may not know how to deal with the babies, you should be prepared to feed them kitten formula if she doesn't feed them.<br>  <br>  Here's an article that may help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/kittencare/a/kittencarethree.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/kittencare/a/ki...</a><br>  <br>  In the meantime, monitor Momma closely, if she's having any trouble breathing or seems to be weakening in any manner... get her and the kittens to the closest emergency vet ASAP.<br>  <br>  Okay, have to add this now that I see someone saying to put a heating pad in with them.... do NOT put an electric heating pad in with them.... if it gets too hot you could seriously harm them.|`|UuvqZk7Xaa	Call your vet right now.  It sounds like your cat is very young and doesn't know what to do. Cats are often agitated between kittens, but don't usually run around.  It sounds like she is having another if she is purring and meowing.  Some cats may not nurse the kittens until they are all born, and the kittens will be ok unless they wait longer than two hours for their first meal.  Try wrapping a hot water bottle or heat pack in a towel in a box for the kittens to lay on for warmth, but don't overheat them and if you use a hot water bottle don't let it get cold or they will chill and probably die.  Your vet should have formula and an eyedropper or special bottle to feed the kittens if the mother won't.<br>  <br>  Some cats can go into heat and get pregnant when they are only 5 or 6 months old.  Get her spayed as soon as the kittens are raised and don't let her out of the house until then, or you could end up with another litter.|`|WGActb24aa	First, use paper towel to dry them.  If you have heat pad at home. Put the heated pad under the big towel, and put them all in the box on the top of the towel.  If the mom doesn't want to feed them, tomorrow morning, go to the pet shop to buy some replacement milk.  you can use the kitten bottle or needle to feed them.  I think you baby girl just too scary, hope she will adjust soon.  You can try to put all of them in a small room, such as bath room.  Make sure the mom is not run away, after she adjust herself, she will try to get closer to the little kitten. Hope it will help.|`|347642ff816df559b5b425b11dd2d682aa	Hi!! My cat use to run around my room and purr, jump on the bed, she just wanted me to be with her every time she had kittens. Try sitting with her and petting her. Maybe some more kittens are on the way. And keep a watch on her, if they are not ready for kitten, they may eat them up. Give her alot of attention until you think she has settled with the kittens. She'll want you around to show off the kittens and how proud she is. My cat use to be very proud of her kittens. She would keep meowing until I came and saw her kittens 10,000 times a day!! <br>  By chance, if she doesnt sit or feed the kittens, call a vet and find out what you should do.<br>  Do let us know the latest status of your cat and kittens...interested...!!<br>  And all the best!! and enjoy the kittens!!|`|JTVzERXhaa	Are they alive?<br>  Because if she's this young, they might not be and if you couldn't tell she was pregnant, she might've had them too early.<br>  Chances are, if she's this young, she will not care for the kittens and might eat them... not kidding.|`|F6ZEov0Taa	Look at some cat sites to see if they're healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  In a month, get them neutered or spade so they won't go into heat and piss on your furniture.<br>  <br>  <br>  If they're sleeping and not breathing too heavily, they should be fine.|`|5AH3Efs2aa	I pretty much endorse most of what mebekili said. My advice to you, on the heating pad debate, is that if you want to use a heating pad, you can place it on the floor, place a towel over it, and then place the box over it but only half way. This way, the heating pad heats only half of the box. This way, if the kittens need to escape the heat, they have somewhere to do.<br>  <br>  OR, you could place a lamp over the box, to provide warmth through light. Just be sure the kittens don't get too cold, or they could die.<br>  <br>  During parturition, neonates are born 30-60 minutes apart. if your cat is still running around after an hour and still no kitten, call a veterinarian--this could be dystocia (difficult birth), and can be an emergency. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest calling a vet if your cat continues to ignore her offspring. You might need to resort to bottle feeding, which is very tedious and time consuming, but important.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Please keep her confined to one room with the kittens.  Plan on spaying her when they are about 8 weeks old. Keep the kittens till 10-12 weeks before you rehome them.  <br>  <br>  They are still nursing up to 8 weeks and need time with mom/siblings to be healthy mentally and physically.  Its more then just eating some canned/dry food and using the pan.  They need important social time together.

Dogs begin to think about trying to become socially dominant around 2-3 years of age.  His behavior change is very concerning because he is now physically aggressive towards humans and that will only escalate if it is not professionally addressed immediately.  Have your vet examine him and make sure he is healthy and has no medical reason for his behavior.  I assume that he is neutered since he came from the pound.  Then I recommend you seek a veterinary behaviorist to help you.  This is very serious.  I don't know how you will get him to a vet safely if you can't go near him.  Please tell the vet and staff that he needs a muzzle BEFORE they try to touch him.<br>  <br>  I love dogs.  I have four, but I would consider putting any one of them to sleep if they were to become aggressive like this.  I think I am right about the reason he is aggressive.

n2dUmfcQaa	well are you selling the filly or trading if you are trading you have to think can the person that is taking the filly handle her? I have an arabian filly that can be a little hot, but Arabians work like this if you brush them and there good lots of praise needs to be given, if there bad one good tape not to hard they will learn quick.<br>  <br>     This is what i do with my filly, (she is ten months) when brushing because she loves to be brushed if she is good some pats, when she is bad such as kicking her feet, she gets a tap(i do not in any way beat any of my horse) just to let her know she has done wrong then go on doing what i was doing,( an arabian will test you, they will do things over and over to see if you are going to give the same reaction) if you are persistent she will learn.<br>  <br>  <br>  before you sell you should give her another week sit down with you mom and make out a plan,with a horse every thing has to be the same(they like to be handle the same way by people) If your mom does something when it is your turn to handle you do it, unless the filly was bad for your mom and not for you. <br>  <br>  also if you can keep your self calm you will be able to keep her calm!|`|6GehblM3aa	1. If I were you, I'd sell the filly for a bombproof horse.  That way you could actually ride and enjoy yourself.<br>  <br>  2. I own two haflingers, and they are the best ponies.  Haflingers can do anything!  My 13hh gelding jumped a four foot fence if that says anything.  They are generally laid back, though, just like any other breed, there are some nutty ones.  I know tons of haflingers that excel in dressage; they actually beat the big warm bloods.  I've seen them do barrels before, and they are good at it, but I wouldn't count on winning against a quarter horse.  Most haflingers are pony sized, so about 13hh-14.2hh.  However, people are breeding them larger now; I've seen some that are 15hh.  I think you should defiantly consider this haflinger.  They are great all around ponies and I'm sure you would enjoy something like that.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	yes, you're doing the responsible thing by selling your arab. <br>  and yes, haflingers make wonderful horses, i used to own one. i doubt they would excel in barrels or many western events, (not really built for it) but i showed mine in the low level hunter under saddle and hunter over fences. <br>  they have their spirited moments, but they're defiantly nothing like an arab, much more stable and reliable in my opinion.<br>  <br>  edit-<br>  if it's only for fun then they should be okay, and haflingers normally top out at 15hh (at absolute biggest) most are about 13.2-14.3 hh<br>  <br>  info-<br>  <a href="http://www.haflingerhorse.com/ahr_breed_standards.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.haflingerhorse.com/ahr_breed_...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haflinger_(horse)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haflinger_(...</a>

TTLIp8Beaa	too me, it sounds like she isn't properly trained to lunge.<br>  stopping is the FIRST thing you teach the horse, without fail. <br>  go back to the beginning and work on reinforcing vocal commands as well as getting her to pay attention to you.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	I agree with Jack.  She has to be taught to yield or disengage her hindquarters, which will make her stop.  It might seem round about since you are asking her to turn and stop but it's a piece of the puzzle.  Once she realizes that stopping is part of it, that can be refined down to just stopping.<br>  <br>  I also thing long lining is another approach to take...teach her how to stop, what the whoa cue means, on the long lines and then she *should* carry that over into lunging.  Or, better yet, do both.  It's good for her to know how to do both thing...disengaging her hindquarters AND long lining.  Plus learning 2 new things should keep the both of you entertained and busy for awhile.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	I don't think she is being "stubborn" I just think maybe she doesn't know what your asking or she just doesn't want to halt.<br>  <br>  Try putting her on a tight circle and a tight lunge contact. Then ask her to walk and then halt and how ever long it takes just get her to halt. I find saying "woah" helps. So soon she will associate "woah" with slow down (or in this case halt).<br>  <br>  Then when she halts praise her by petting her and then let her trot or do something on a larger circle and faster than a walk.<br>  Good Luck!|`|wmVmNEBOaa	Argh, my horse does this too. It's the most frustrating thing. I had to go back to square one, working on halt-walk-halt-walk transitions. She'll get it after a few sessions. You just have to be patient. I would fix this issue before you long-line her. No sense in skipping over important training steps just because she's bored.|`|QPMaoaSIaa	First focus on getting her to walk.<br>  Get her into an active alert walk and then call her name.<br>  If she is paying attention her ears will flick in your direction. <br>  Once your sure you have her utter attention, ask for her to stop.<br>  Use a voice command one of the following voice commands<br>  Wooooooah (Deeply and slowly)<br>  Wohooooo (Say it deeply and slowly)<br>  Stop (Firmly)<br>  Also make sure you put your arm out (One hand holding lunge rein, other out at shoulder height like half an aeroplane).<br>  If she doesn't slow her pace, repeat the voice command.<br>  If she doesn't stop at all GET SOMEONE ELSE to go and tug on the lunge rein next to her. That person should not say anything to the horse. The horse needs to learn your commands and your voice, not that persons.<br>  <br>  Focus on perfecting that and you should be fine.<br>  Good luck.|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Try long-reining I find it much more fun. For her and for you and you can go places too. You can act as if you are riding her and have far more control. If you feel you need to you can also lunge. Make sure you have 2 strong lunge lines of equal length and let the ends drag on the ground behind you if it's dry and you find it hard to hold 2 gathered reins. Then when you want her to come to a halt do your long low Haaaaalt stuff as well.<br>  Incase you don't know you attach the lines to the bit rings and thread through the irons to fall behind the horse. You tie the irons together with something under the tummy so they don't bang about and run your leathers up so they sit rounghly at same height as where you want her nose to be. You can slap her on the sides with reins to push her up to the bit and hopefully she will make a nice shape there so you can get all the benifits of riding without lunging with side reins or other such solid, ridged stuff. Hope this helps Debbie|`|3LXbUg1raa	The first question I'd ask is, "Does she yield her hind quarters?"  Teach her to yield those hindquarters to you first, then work on the stop.  Whenever you ask her to stop, make her yield those hindquarters to you...basically, the end result should be her facing towards you with her hindquarters facing away and her body will roughly make a 90 degree angle from the circle she was making when being lunged...every time you ask for the stop, yield those hindquarters around and have her face you...if she tries to keep walking, keep yielding those hindquarters.  Be consistent and insistent...she'll get it.  To properly yield those hindquarters to you, she has to come to a stop...be as insistent as you need to be to get those hindquarters yielded.  Do that, and it will come together with getting her to stop properly.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
ersYwx6gaa	Since it's small, the small breed diapers may not work, I recommend you get a type of handkerchief and put a napkin in there (in case they go, so the handkerchief won't be ruined the first time it's worn) and be careful but staple the edges like a diaper, I'd say use safety pins but what if one comes loose? It's safer with staples.|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	You cannot put a diaper on a piggie. She would make herself crazy trying to get it off and eventually, she would. It is not an effective method of birth control.<br>  <br>  You can either keep them in separate cages or you can have the boar neutered.|`|fBYInMlNaa	That wold not work.  They would chew through the diaper.

WWhYCAbSaa	If something happens to your other dog, she'll be depressed for a while, but eventually get over it.  Dogs get over things better than do some humans. She'll handle it fine, probably better than you will.  It will take you longer to get over Zackie's death than it will her.  Seriously.  I've had dogs put to sleep, and within a few weeks, the surviving dog was fine.  Now ME, on the other hand...I still cry every once in a blue moon over my dogs that have been dead for years.  It's normal.<br>  <br>  As some people say, there is no point in worrying.  If something's going to happen, it's going to happen.  Worrying won't stop it.  Others say "Why worry when you can pray?".|`|cnZlMojUaa	Honestly, if Zack is really sick, Sasha probably knows this. Dogs sense things like this. When my little girl was sick (and dying) our older male would allow her to sleep with him on his bed and allow her to seek him out for comfort. One thing that I do feel helped him with her passing was that she had several extended stays in the pet ICU hospital, so she wasn't in the house and he was used to being alone. I would take a toy that he played with to the hospital and rub her scent on it so he could smell her. After she passed, he was less active for a couple of weeks, then acted like nothing had happened. I had spent so much of my time consumed by her care that my little guy got pushed to the back and I felt guilty for that. I think you are feeling that too.<br>  <br>  Try to enjoy your one-on-one time with Sasha and strengthen your bond. Even when you get Zack home, try to set aside some Sasha-only time. Walks are great. Enjoy your time with Sasha. Also cherish your time with Zack.<br>  <br>  I know that you didn't ask about this, but if you are in the same place I was, you may experience this. When you are a care-giver to a critically ill pet and the pet passes, it may leave you without a sense of purpose. Be prepared for this. Know that Sasha will help you through this time. I hope you still have lots of time left with your Zack, but you and Sasha with help each other pull through your grief when that time comes.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	it just shows how close they are marie she will be fine jade was a little mopey when carlo died but then she perked up after a week or so sasha will be fine once my little man is home again|`|AoSeHXeQaa	poor baby :o(<br>  <br>  If something happens to him, she will probably do what a person does - mourn, and eventually get over it.<br>  <br>  I have had at least two dogs for years, and since one is always older than the other, I have had to go through doggy mourning a few times.<br>  I usually bring home a new dog in a week or two, so my sad doggy has company.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the second bond is not as strong, but when my chihuahua died last year, I adopted a rat terrier to keep my Westie mix company.  He is actually a better match for her temperament than the chihuahua was, and they love each other dearly, as you can see from their pictures to the left. :o)|`|WiycCxpzaa	If something happened to the other dog she would mope around and cry because shes probably not used to being alone, but they get over it.<br>  <br>  We had to put our APBT Max down a few weeks ago. Penny, our other dog, grew up with him since the day we got her. When we came home from the Vet without him she knew something was wrong. She cried and wouldn't do much of anything, just laid in the floor. After a few days she started to get back to normal. We even got her some of her own toys to play with (she never had toys before because Max would take them and eat them). <br>  <br>  Best thing is to try to do something different with Sasha, things she might not have been able to do with the other dog around. Get her toys to play with and interact with her. She will be mopey for a few days but she will let it go and get back to herself again, you may see a whole new dog too. I've seen a whole new Penny since Max has been gone.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	One of my toy poodles grieved for months after he sister died.  They were so playful and inseparable.  It took months of constant attention and cuddling from me before she started to come out of her depression.  I had to hand feed her or she refused to eat.  She quit playing like they used to play together, they loved to tree the squarrels in the back yard.<br>  <br>  She is no longer grieving and seems happy but I should rename her velcro because she clings to me like she clung to her sister.<br>  <br>  She really does need lots of special attention and understanding right now.  I truly hope Zack get well.|`|BRT2teSqaa	2 of my dogs were raised together from 0-10.  When 1 suddenly died at age 10, it was obvious the other missed her. She would often walk around as if she was looking for something.  She was sad for a few days. We distracted her with toys and treats during this time. <br>  <br>  Dogs have very human emotions and IF Zackie were to pass away, Sasha would act sad for a while, but they do NOT have long term memories.  It will pass.  I don't think you will have to worry about her dying of sadness or anything like that.|`|7YPdogmDaa	well...if you spent every day with someone...and they just left and you didnt understand why wouldnt you be a lil sad? Yes  you would, then you would get over it and be fine. Same thing with your dog. She'll be fine.|`|KuUx34hCaa	you might want to get another pup as it's hard to know for sure what will happen|`|kvHqnR5Haa	The first couple of responses are very good - I would like to add that as nervous as you are she may be picking up signals from you.  So maybe if you relaxed and didn't worry so much about it she will liven up.  It's amazing how much dogs pick up from your moods.  And she will be ok if you ever lose Zackie.  When my childhood dog died his sister was not herself for a while but she came around.  They are tough and they get through it just like you would if you lost someone close to you.  I hope she gets her energy back!<br>  <br>  Add:  In response to the answer directly before mine - our dog did the exact same thing when her brother died.  For weeks she would walk around looking for him.  It was very sad to see but she came around eventually.

Not just about temperature issues...there are also safety issues (the dog can get hurt,) and the possibility that someone will break into your car.<br>  <br>  That being said, on road trips, I have HAD to leave my dogs in the car when traveling alone while I went inside rest stops.  I leave the windows slightly cracked, make sure the car is locked, never leave keys inside or ignition running, and do what I have to as quickly as possible.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Temperature wise, you're fine.  Just crack a couple windows so that he can get some fresh air circulating through the car.  <br>  <br>  That being said, you have to realize that there is a risk of theft.  Someone could steal the dog.  Also, there's a chance he could get out of the car and run away or get injured.<br>  <br>  If you MUST go to Wal-Mart, MUST you take the dog with you in the first place?  Can he not just stay home?  If he's a smaller breed, why not just bring him in with you?  I have a Cavalier that I take in the store with me when the need arises.  I've never once had anyone tell me I had to leave (she stayed in my arms or in the cart).|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	I have - but I think it may depend on the breed of dog (or at least the type coat he/she has).  If the dog has very short fu and gets cold easily (like a Greyhound), then it might be harder on the dog than if it has fur like a collie.|`|7WUvPI8maa	you'll be fine.

A couple of people actually came in to the place I was at to find out whose dog it was and to tell me I shouldn't leave it in the car!  Another time, I came out of the store, and a lady was writing down my license plate number so she could report me!  I love my dog and would never do anything to harm her, but some people are just over the top about it!!  So just be careful about that.  I've also heard of some stores that don't allow pets to be left in the car.  One of my friends got a ticket from a police officer one time because she was in a store and didn't realize dogs weren't allowed to be in the car when you're not there.|`|AA10412922	Where I am,breaking into cars to steal the dog is a problem.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	I wouldn`t if your dog is not a barker.<br>  I`m lucky enough to have 2 that if anyone even walks by the car or truck they will bark at them.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	My dog is quite fond of my pet rats. He always has to come over to greet them when I have them out downstairs. He's a superbly friendly dog with virtually no prey drive, so I highly doubt he would intentionally harm either of my rats. However, being a rambunctious Mastiff puppy, he could snap their spines simply by wagging his tail near them. As such, their interactions are quite limited. Besides, the rats like to explore the world through their mouths, and my older boy has gotten the dog on the nose several times. (No harm done. When they're taste-testing, they're like tiny working Labs, with their soft mouths.)|`|f6c72MTmaa	My dog found a baby mouse.

pTD05NBKaa	wow ... that's a lot.<br>  OK<br>  first thing: find a trainer who will work WITH you.<br>  your first option sounds more like a doggy daycare.<br>  I'd be very surprised if they actually train your dog anything...I can almost guarantee: when you get your dog back nothing will have changed except that he'll have extreme seperation anxiety, thanks to the TV &may forget how to behave in a home environment, since he'll have his own "room"...I'm sorry, 30minutes a day for play time is NOT enough. They need constant attention. They're pack animals, not cats. BTW, treat training is useless.<br>  >>how old is your dog now?<br>  I have no clue where you live, but I wouldn't trust any of these "trainers".<br>  **personally ... the guadi website isn't impressing me at all! (uptown hounds)<br>  <br>  FYI: the triangle metal choker is called a "Prong Collar"<br>  &like the guy said before me "AKC White German Shepherds" = non-existence. Yes there are white german shepherds...but it's a disqualification in the AKC. neither one sounds good.<br>  <br>  **i have the feeling the pool in your first option is just for show. In the photo gallery, there are only 3 dogs shown in the pool. It'd be more believable if they had more dogs.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	The bottom line is you NEVER send your dog to anyone for any kind of training.  Obedience training, or any kind of training, is something you do with your dog.  The instructor teaches you how to teach your dog and that's all they do.  You don't build any kind of relationship with your dog by sending him away, nor will your dog listen to you when he comes back.<br>  <br>  You're making a huge mistake if you send your dog away.|`|Chxoncy7aa	I also prefer to train my dogs myself, at classes.  My sister is in Fla, and she did send her dog away for training.  They were having a lot of problems and were not successful in correcting them, even with classes.  It did a lot of good and the dog is easier to handle.  If they had kept up with practice, the dog would be really well trained.  My sister however is intimidated by the dog, so some of the training was lost.  I do agree with positive training, and do not use any type of prong or correction collars.  That is really the biggest thing I didn't care for at these places.  They don't have a lot of information about their trainers to look at.  Both places look pretty nice.  If you are having big problems, this may be ideal for you.  I would say as long as you can make the trip to visit with your dog and see the progress, then that is good.  If you go and see the dog and are not seeing much improvement, then think about taking the dog elsewhere.  Good luck|`|KxjUim7yaa	Interesting. I have never considered sending my dog off to have someone else train it. I have always taken my dog to classes or trained my dog here at home. The deluxe spas certainly sounds nice. I think that treat training is the way to go. If the training is done in a friendly method. i would be a little afraid of a school that taught aggression training.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	I agree with the first answer, I would not want my dog trained when I was not also there at the same time. I would want to see everything they were doing with my dog and watch the training methods so I could get a good understanding of how/what to do.<br>  Also, I would worry about someone having my dog, someone that I do not know. Does not matter that they call themselves dog trainers, you still are not watching over your dog.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose, I would choose the place where I could go for hourly lessons once or twice a week and then practice what they showed me all week till the next lesson.<br>  <br>  And as for the training, your dog may learn lots of good lessons and behavior but if you do not follow through with the same techniques, consistently and with assertive energy, your dog will go back to his old ways immediately. He will not forget how he was with you and in your home(pack) before training. He will want to revert back when he is back in familiar surroundings.<br>  <br>  Also, the price of $2000. seems so high.<br>  <br>  Have you considered buying your own dog training videos. There are many out there.<br>  Dogs are really quite basic in their thinking, not involved and complicated like humans. Behavior problems develop when dog owners do not understand basic dog psychology.<br>  Dogs know two ways to be...either they are the leader of their pack or one of the followers.<br>  Most dog owners unintentionally allow their dog or one of their dogs to assume the leader position. Then the problems develop.<br>  <br>  Well good luck with whatever you choose.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/products/sns_dvd.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/products/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/products/btpl_book.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/products/b...</a>|`|aCqSF87Raa	I wouldn't use either place. And here's why:<br>  <br>  1st Place) <br>  <br>  You should NEVER send your dog away to be trained - the dog will bond with the person training him/her and will listen to the one they work with. It does not guarantee that the dog will listen to YOU. <br>  <br>  Also, the dog is working in an unfamiliar area. Any behavior problems MAY NOT SHOW UP for that reason. The dog needs to be working in your home, where they feel the most comfortable.<br>  <br>  More often than not a dog will do excellent in a facility but will revert to the bad behaviors at home, even if you try to continue the training and games.<br>  <br>  Confidence boosting and all that fun stuff sounds good, but what good is it to get the dog to trust YOU if you are not there from day one? You don't know the commands, you don't know the body language that warns you of an impending "incident", you don't know how to handle the dog or any incidents that may pop up....<br>  <br>  It basically sounds like you're paying someone else to do YOUR job as an owner - IE taking the easy way out.<br>  <br>  2nd Place)<br>  <br>  They gave you a puppy at five weeks. Now that's acceptable in some situations (IE mom dog is dead) but they did not tell you how to properly care for or train the puppy (since it missed out on a lot of learning experiences it would have gotten from mom.)<br>  <br>  <br>  If i had to choose one over the other it would be the one that insists on YOU being there with the dog. Not the one that says "I'll take 100% care of your dog for a month for a fee, then hopefully it'll listen to you later one!"<br>  <br>  PS - Choke collars are pretty out dated and can cause injury if not used properly - i don't see them being used for years to come. <br>  <br>  However a LOT of trainers are using Prong collars for dogs who need them as an extra boost to listen to the handler - they are correct that not ALL dogs will work for food rewards and SOME dogs will ignore them altogether if they are in aroused states (aggression, territorial, etc.)<br>  <br>  It's up to you but i warn you - letting someone else do the hard work will more than likely create problems for YOU in the future.|`|ixFbNr4taa	Go with the 1st school.  From your description - the second school uses choke chains and pinch collars -- very old school and harsh.  <br>  <br>  To me - your main focus must be to continue the training when your dog returns home.  Lots of people think that the school has trained the dog and it will behave perfectly from that point on.  NOT TRUE!!  Your dog is a dog - it will always push the envelope and try to see what you will allow it to do /get away with.  You must continuing the training, continue the newly learned good habits for the lifetime of the dog.  If you don't - do not blame the school -- only yourself.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Quite frankly, I see severe problems with both those places.<br>  <br>  It's not that I'm opposed to sending your dog for training.  Dogs with sever behavioral issues often benefit from it, but neither of these places are places I'd take my dogs.  Both are doing things that send up red flags to me.  Big ones.<br>  <br>  Keep searching.|`|AA11046881	You don't say what YOUR training goals are. If you want police training, then the second one says they do that, but I have my doubts. The first one looks like a nice doggie hotel or day-care. No mention of a training program, though.<br>  <br>  Keep your money. Never consider sending your dog off "for training" without you. The trainers probably can do what they claim, but you will not be able to duplicate the results. Dogs are not computers that just need the right software load. Learn how to train your dog yourself and you will have a great relationship and you will have the ability to teach your dog about anything.<br>  <br>  Check with your local dog clubs, sport dogs, AKC competitive training clubs, etc. Call the agility clubs. Even if you don't want to do these sports, these are the people who can hook you up with some really reliable advice.<br>  <br>  Also, the second one breeds "AKC White German shepherds" and wolf hybrids which are illegal in Ohio. Don't go back to them.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Ok, in my experience, obedience school is done with the owner there. I don' know if its because of where I live, but we take our dog to a class once a week and they show us how to train our dog. The best person to train your dog, is you. I would not feel comfortable sending my dog away to be exposed to god knows what especially if your on the fence. Its just me. If I were you, I would save your money, pick up books. Stanley Coren is excellent and do it all yourself. Not only will you strengthen the bond between you and your dog, your dog will respect and listen to you. Also, your dog would probably feel most comfortable with you. If I left my dog to someone else, she wouldn't of learned anything being too sad and missing me. Not to mention the confusion of lifestyles and who to listen to! Good Luck|`|cvR2RnLBaa	I have heard of people sending their dogs "away to school" which is not something I can relate to. About 2 years ago we got a 2 year old dog from someone. She had no manners, no training, no nothing. She didn't even know how to walk on a leash. We had been to obedience training with our other dog so, I had a pretty good idea as to what needed to be done. I spent 15-20 minutes training our new dog every night for a few months. We also took her for 1 round of obedience training (1 hour per week) where we had taken our other dog. It took time & patience but, she's now a very good dog and one we're very happy we have. I would be very unhappy and I'm sure my dog would be as well it I left her with strangers to care for her and teach her. These are things that a responsible dog owner should be doing herself.|`|vIYGV1C7aa	Personally, I wouldn't want my dog to do any training that I couldn't be a part of.  That way, we are both learning together and would only build your leadership role as well as build the bond between you.
NlvghuIkaa	Only if you happen to have a load of money and a hard heart. There is no such thing as a teacup. In case you were never notified, teacup means sickly runt, bred purposely for money making reasons only. <br>  <br>  It's runt to runt breeding. They happen to have many difficulties throughout life and often have a lifespan of three years. You need to pay around $2000 for the dog in the first place plus another $8000 for medical bills each years. Still like the idea?<br>  <br>  On the other hand, standard Yorkshires make the perfect one on one pet. They do require a lot of training and housebreaking can be quite a difficulty. Make sure you also have time for walks each day and then a play session afterwards. Here is more information...<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireterrier.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/yorkshireter...</a>|`|bIaywrBCaa	yorkies are good dogs for people who want small dogs but not for people who want a dog to carry in your purse. Let it just be a regular dog, not an accessory and there is no such thing as a teacup yorkie. A regular sized yorkie from a reputable breeder will start around $1,000. Someone seeking to sell a "teacup" may charge $2,000 or more. They are dishonest and want to make big bucks for sickly dogs.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I guess so. As long as youre giving it the proper care and love it needs then a Yorkshire Terrier can be for almost anyone.|`|XagPxe7Faa	Dogs are not accessories.  And it would be extremely unsafe for an extremely small dog to be carried around everywhere.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, there is no such thing as a "teacup" Yorkie.  It's a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely small with no regard tot he overall health of the animal.  These are the types of breeders that you should avoid at all costs.<br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest that before you consider acquiring any breed of dog, you thoroughly research the breed and it's standard FIRST.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	A dog should be allowed to walk for exercise, not crammed in your bag. A dog is not a toy or something to make you look like Paris Hilton. Also, so called "teacup" yorkies have tonnes more health problems than regular yorkies...they are basically runty dwarf yorkies. if you want a fashion accessory, buy yourself a new "purse".|`|Bw18seFqaa	there's no such thing as a "teacup" anything.  That is a label used by irresponsible breeders to sell a sickly runt for a high price.  Yorkies are small enough at 7 pds or less.<br>  <br>  Dogs dont belong in purses.. they have LEGS for a reason.  If you're wanting something to shove in a purse, I suggest a cute little key chain.<br>  <br>  A pet-quality Yorkie from a reputable breeder will cost around $1200 or so....  show quality around $3,000 or more, depending on the bloodlines.<br>  <br>  From a shelter or rescue, around $300 or less, on average.|`|fxo2yMZYaa	I have a tea cup Yorkie, she's about 7 months. She's very good easy to train. I have her for 5 months now and i have her train to go on the puppy pad, she sit and stand on command.  They're very friendly n likes to have your attention.  I don't carry mine in a purse all the time but when i have to put her in her travel bag she doesn't give me a problem.  She love to play<br>  <br>  Although a toy breed, the Yorkie still retains much of its terrier ancestry in terms of personality. Individual dogs will differ, but they are generally very intelligent, independent, and courageous. Yorkshire Terriers are quick to determine where they fit in a household's " Their behavior towards outsiders will vary - they often will be inclined to bark at strangers, but some Yorkies are outgoing and friendly towards new people. The differences in behavior in this regard are largely based on how the owner trains or conditions (and socializes) the Yorkie.  Some Yorkshire Terriers may be timid or nervous, rather than bold, but the vast majority do seem to meet the breed standard for a confident, vigorous, and self-important personality. The following qualities are likely to be present in a Yorkshire Terrier oblivious of its small size, it is eager for adventure. It is highly energetic, brave, loyal, and clever. Affectionate with its master, it can become suspicious of strangers and aggressive to strange dogs, if not properly socialized. Some people allow them to get away with behavior no dog should display. They can become yappy, as the dog does his best to tell you what he wants you to do. They can develop jealous behaviors and become snappish if surprised, frightened, or over-teased. Because of their small size they are recommended for older, considerate children. If given the proper boundaries by owners and if proper pack-leader behavior is displayed, training can be easy. Housebreaking requires simple consistency. The Yorkie is an excellent watchdog.<br>  Yorkies are probably one of the most affectionate breeds around.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	They are a dog, not an accessory.  I can't imagine a dog actually LIKES being crammed into someones purse and squished under their arm.  The cost varies.  You'll spend at least $300.  Just remember that you are essentially paying hundreds of dollars for a "mutt".  They are just Yorkie runt puppies bred with other runt puppies to eventually get to the small "teacup" size.|`|BO28Mn8haa	G-D DAMN IT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A TEACUP. AND A DOG IS NOT AN ACCESSORY! They are like children, but it costs more effort because you just can't take a dog wherever you go like you can a child.<br>  <br>  I have two yorkies and their lack of ability to want to keep to their training is making me think a child would have been easier! Remember a dog is a lifetime commitment, meaning the entire life of the pet.. which can be 15 years or more!|`|nl5JOu43aa	"Teacup" Yorkies have more health problems than larger ones.My male is 2 years old and weighs 15 lbs.,my female is 1 yr. old and is 10 lbs.,they both fit on my lap.If you let them know right away you're their "pack" leader,you couldn't ask for better companions.Don't spoil them! This makes them rotten little yappers trust me.Dogs look at us as pack members,not humans,and they follow their leader.Yorkies are highly intelligent and there's nothing they can't learn,but you have to respect the fact that they are dogs and not babies.Not saying you can't show lots of affection,they love it,just keep in mind  that you're the boss.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	I think you'd be better off with a "Stew Pot" yorkie. They won't fit in a purse...but LOVE to be toted around in a back pack....but only on weekends.....during the odd numbered months....oh, and never on the 15th of any month...even if it is the weekend...and can only be spoken to in their Native Icelandic tongue. You should be able to get one for somewhere between $20 and $20,000...depending on color, of course.<br>  <br>  PS.....NEVER...EVER....Feed it after midnight!|`|AA10202158	I have always been afraid to get a small dog, because my "spoodle" dog is a medium sized dog and I still trip over him sometimes.   I would be afraid I would sit on it or step on it, or otherwise damage it.|`|pXbbhoKCaa	if you get a yorkie be aware they bark alot.
YAPYO7L8aa	I apologize if this sounds flippant... but there is an old saying. "Cats were worshiped as god's in ancient Egypt and they never forgot it!"<br>  <br>  LOL! That reminds me of something. A Mennonite friend of mine came to visit. I told him that the day God created cats he had a bee in his bonnet. I couldn't tell him what I really meant was that the day God created cats he had a bug up the old ****.<br>  <br>  Anywho you must give cats credit... they still have homes although they act so high and mighty as if they are God's gift to mankind. So they must be doing something right.

Anyways, my kittens are sisters, and the one adores him, while the other one honestly goes and hides when he comes over. Chanel is definitely an introvert, while Coco is an extrovert and can't get enough of him.  You have to decide how to treat a cat (or any animal) based on its personality.

TphsSOz6aa	Put some baking soda or toothpaste on the bite...and don't worry.  Not a dangerous type.|`|XayiqDyUaa	Usually, if a spider has red on it, it's dangerous.  The one that bit you is probably harmless, just keep an eye on your bite because the broken skin can allow bacteria to get in and get infected.  Bacteria is more dangerous than that little yellow spider. <br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT IS A CRAB SPIDER? <br>   <br>  There are several types of spiders that are commonly called "Crab Spiders."  The most commonly encountered crab spiders found in Kentucky are in the family Thomisidae.  These are often called "thomisid" crab spiders, or simply "thomsids."  Thomisids tend to have a flat shape compared to other spiders, and their front two pairs of legs are typically very long compared to the back two pairs.  Thomisid crab spiders hold their front legs out and up, similar to the way a crab holds its claws.  Many thomisid crab spiders have bright, "neon" colors (yellow, green, and orange).  Others have gray and brown color patterns.<br>   <br>    <br>  Running Crab Spiders belong to the family Philodromidae.  They are sometimes called "philodromid crab spiders" and they are distinguished from thomisid crab spiders by their 2nd pair of legs, which are always longer than the 1st, 3rd, and 4th pair. <br>    <br>  All crab spiders have eight eyes.  Like all spiders, crab spiders have eight legs, two body parts (abdomen and cephalothorax), and fang-like mouthparts called "chelicerae."  <br>    <br>  <br>  Typical thomisid crab spider. Note the long <br>  1st and 2nd legs. (R. Bessin, 2000) <br>   <br>  SIZE: Body length up to about 1/2"  <br>    <br>  LIFE CYCLE <br>   <br>  Like all spiders, crab spiders go through a simple metamorphosis.  Young crab spiders hatch from eggs and look like tiny adults.  They shed their skin as they grow.  Most crab spiders live for less than one year and have only one generation per year.  In most of these species, the females produce eggs in the fall, and the offspring hatch in the spring.  In other species, several generations of females produce young each year and immature larvae are the overwintering stage (thanks to Dr. Gary Dodson from Ball State University for this information). <br>  <br>   <br>    <br>  ECOLOGY <br>   <br>   <br>  Most crab spiders and running crab spiders do not rely on silk to capture prey.  Instead, they are ambush predators: crab spiders wait motionless on flowers, leaves, and other strategic places for flies, bees, and similar prey.  Many crab spider species, especially in the family Thomisidae, have the same bright colors as the flowers on which they sit.  Other crab spiders have dark colors that blend well with bark or soil.  Crab spiders are able to walk forwards, backwards, and sideways with ease.<br>   <br>    <br>  PEST STATUS  <br>   <br>  Crab spiders are considered beneficial to humans.  Although they eat a few bees, they also kill flies, mosquitoes, moths, and other insect pests.  Some species are large enough to bite people, but no crab spiders are known to be dangerous.|`|f6c72MTmaa	I wouldn't stress that much. Calm down and take a couple of breather's.

3z0NLTGYaa	Last I checked, there was no international registry of microchips.  Generally, each chip has its own registry and may break them down to be sold to specific markets based on numerical series (Home Again does this with chips sold for use in South Korea).  <br>  <br>  Yes, you need an ISO compliant chip for travel to Europe.

ak9DrBSwaa	If they've escaped once, it's safe to assume they'll do it again. They can get out of amazingly small spaces. <br>  <br>  For dwarf hamsters, I'd only use a bin or an aquarium.<br>  <br>  Temporary fix until you can get your cage situation resolved - take the current cage and place it in another container. The easiest (if you don't have a bin available) is often a bath tube WITH THE DRAIN IN (no water obviously). If they escape from the cage while you are away, they'd be unlikely to be able to scale the sides of the tub and go anywhere else.|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	I have a Russian dwarf hamster (robo I think they call them unless I am wrong) and I had the same problem!

If this isn't an option, try putting a box under the cage.|`|QxudUbGvaa	Like rats.. hamsters can squeeze their whole body thought small cracks.. even if its through ur wired cage.

IrdZKYT3aa	Well, I just wrapped up treating my own tank.   I slowly increased my temp to about 30 degrees celsius, or 90 degrees Farenheit (this option depends on your fish and stocking levels, high temps decrease oxygen in water so too many fish will require a bubbler), added some aquarium salt (also depends on current fish as some don't tolerate salt well)and dosed daily with QuickCure (this med is a 48 hr med).  I Only lost two females, one who'd just given birth and one who was heavily preggers about to give birth.  I fed them every three days, and cleaned them every other day.  B/c the carbon has to be removed, you're in charge of maintaing healthy water parameters.  It's recommended to do a small changes daily or every other day and at least one big 50% water change.  These help to remove the free swimming parasites before they can reinfect the fish as well as keep the water quality good. <br>  Here's a couple sites that explain the Ich parasites life cycle and how temp plays such a huge roll in the treatment. <br>  Best of Luck!|`|OblSdMaaaa	You can still feed them as you normally would.  <br>  <br>  Also, remove any carbon from your filters, they can neutralize the effects of some medications.|`|onfX2jqLaa	you can feed them whenever their normal feeding time is. and yes dont clean your tank for about two weeks because they really need to get the medicine into their systems and through their body! be careful that you dont have any scaleless fish it can be harmful to them. you may want to buy a special tank for the individual fish when they are sick. that is what my boyfriend did and it has worked very nicely. the fish dont get stressed by the bigger fish that pick on them and may be territoral and eat most of the food.<br>  good luck!

AA11887983	If your dog has maggots in the wound, he needs to be rechecked right away.

Wishing you the best for your cat friend, Kate|`|keX0rz1oaa	if hes looking really bad, hes miserable,if he's in alot of pain and he doesnt look healthy your best bet is to call a vet and ask them if its better to have him put down if hes going through so much trouble. as sad as that is, it might be the best thing. but if he's not showing any signs of weakness or that hes in pain then just give him his pills and maybe he will gain weight eventually.  sorry to hear about your kitty :(|`|AA11457471	You already know what the best thing for the cat is.<br>  Trust your gut on this instead of asking other folks.<br>  You obviously care very much. I'm sure you'll do what you feel is right &, in the end, that's all any of us can do.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|E0xuQFFnaa	My cat had cancer about 2 years ago and we made the decision to put her to sleep. Unfortunately the night before she was supposed to be put to sleep she was hit by a car and passed away she was 14. We decided putting her to sleep was the right thing to do because the cancer was in her tummy and liver. It is up to you about what you do with your cat.|`|TphsSOz6aa	Your cat is miserable.  You need to have him put to sleep.  Facial cancers are some of the absolute worst, for pure misery.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	see the vet now|`|t3NgGMW6aa	It is the question of who you do it for...you or the cat.  The cat's life quality is going down hill, so you know what the decision is.  When you have the vet do it is now your choice.  It will help to know the animals cross over to a better place right away.  They meet friends and will meet you when you pass over.  They will be healthy and young and have no illness there.  It is a wonderful place.|`|X9FrU4hTaa	I had a two year old cat that developed a tumor on it's chin. I had it surgically removed. Two weeks later the stitches came out, two weeks after that the tumor returned. We went through this for 2 months. My vet had been off ill and when he returned he did a radical removal of all tissue from the cats lower lip to his sternum (breastbone). The cat did well for awhile.<br>  When he began to lose weight I saw he was trying to eat but much of the food dribbled out. There was a huge tumor inside his mouth.<br>  Putting a suffering animal down is the kindest thing for the animal. It hurts us and we miss them but they do not deserve to suffer when it is hopeless.<br>  Talk to your vet. Most pills do little to help the growth or their suffering.<br>  Having paid for many surgeries without curing the problem I would not put another animal though that.<br>  God bless you and the Kitty.

Talk about the cost to the city/state for both breaking up these dog fighting rings, and the prosecution of the perpetrators, as well as the cost of taking care of or euthanizing the dogs.  <br>  <br>  You can talk about the misuse of veterinary medications by non-doctors and by unethical vets, in treating these dogs.  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your speech.|`|yEnWdKfqaa	A good thing for you to mention is "punish the deed not the breed". You should persuade your audience that instead of killing off breeds you should stop the problem. For example many people hate pitbulls and think that we should kill off the breed. Although pitbulls are popular in the news for harming people it is the way they are trained. If the breed was killed off it would not stop the source of the problem. People would just find a different animal or breed to use in dog fights. Google stop BSL and you will find a lot of information on this. You could look up laws in different states regarding BSL and dog fights.|`|wJdAybRnaa	Google "dog fighting." Go on the websites of the ASPCA and the Humane Society (and PETA maybe) and search for "dog fighting." <br>  <br>  If you can, there are dogfighting magazines and online forums glorifying the sport, it would be interesting for you to look at those and see how these awful people justify what they do. (google "pro dog fighting" or something)<br>  <br>  As for the persuasiveness part...I don't have the time to teach you about argument! :) Google that too!|`|soJwuVdnaa	You could say something that relates to how people who fight their animals are...mentally I mean.  Like what kind of person does it take to do somethign like that...what are their motivations?  I think that would be a good way to go with it.  You could also discuss the illegality of it. Where is most prevelent....Michael Vick or other famous cases....Lots of ways to go.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	You can also point to how the fighting breeds are slowly being outlawed - like pitbulls.  There are cities where people who have these dogs have no choice but to get rid of them because of people who fought these breeds.  It's sad that the 'fighting' breeds get a bad rap and so many of these dogs get destroyed because people breed them for fighting.|`|i5zBmtqRaa	I would mention:<br>  Dog fighting is abusing someone who cannot speak for themselves<br>  Dog fighting normally points to other illegal activities like drug sales, guns, prostitution<br>  Dog fights give certain breeds bad reputations and make them "bully breeds" even when they're good dogs<br>  About 90% of the time, if a dog is rescued from a dog fighting operation, it will most likely be euthanasized because it is considered a dangerous and unpredictable "weapon"
onfX2jqLaa	best place is a breeder like everyone has said, if you find them in pet stores ask them where they got them because they may have gotten them from a breeder which is great! <br>  ask about the temperment of the hedgehog because you really want a nice hedgehog! nothing that has been abused or treated badly by a bad owner or pet shop.<br>  <br>  names, id say anything that ends with a "ie" or a "y"<br>  dont worry i wont suggest sonic OR hedgie. <br>  mine is named lilly<br>  i also like the name peanut (haha i know a little random)<br>  sophie, chester, mango, ringo, fabio(haha! i like it), sunny, xena, hugh, tiggles, rascal, annie, buttons, blueberry, greg, badger, penny, pepper.<br>  sorry i could keep going for days<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|7SyCZnM9aa	An exotic animal rescue would be the first place I looked. Most pet stores buy  their exotic animals from second rate breeders and don't really know how to care for them properly. Do your research and find out anything and everything about them such as special dietary needs, exercise, cage requirements, grooming, etc. Just to give you a heads up, their poop is absolutely disgusting. Imagine slightly watery ferret poop. It's yucky.|`|XayiqDyUaa	Our local pet store has them, check yours.  Google "pet names" if you can't figure one out on your own.  I usually have my pet for a week or more and watch it until the name just comes to me.  I had a cat once that loved to play with socks so I changed it up a bit, instead of the obvious,socks, I named her Saki.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	Go to a breeder.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	You have 2 different questions.

AA11887983	Medications of certain types have been used for treating inappropriate urination in cats.  But any time you use medications for behavioral problems in animals, you have to be very careful.  First you have to be absolutely sure that there is no medical reason for the problem.  Then you have to have really good communication with your veterinarian.  Using medications of this type are considered off label, and that means that there are no FDA approvals for its use like this.  Your vet has to be able to talk frequently with you about the progress and potential side effects of the drugs.  <br>  <br>  Prozac can be used in cats and dogs, but is probably not the first drug that is used.  If you are having problems with your cat and inappropriate urination, get with your vet and find a plan so that you have the best chance of solving the problem.  As for whether it works or not, that depends on the individual cat, and the reasons for the problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bxlYleZkaa	DO NOT give you cat any medicines or drugs intended for human consumption!!|`|oDVx7nSxaa	There are many reasons that a cat sprays, and behavior drugs will only take care of some of them.  If a cat isn't neutered, no amount of behavior drugs will stop that.  If a cat *has* been neutered, the next thing to do is get him vet checked to rule out any kind of urinary infection or crystals in the urine.  Both of these can be common in males, and some males will spray.  Once this has been ruled out, then the spraying is considered a behavioral issue.  <br>  <br>  One thing to try first is Feliway.  It's available as a plug-in, and releases a calming phemerone (oderless to us humans) that convices many cats to not spray.  It works for some, and not for others.  Just be sure to follow the directions on the package for how many of the diffusers you need for the size of your house.<br>  <br>  Spraying is a territorial thing.  If you've got too many cats, or two cats who rub each other the wrong way, then sometimes one will spray to show that they are the dominant cat.  Providing each cat with their own space can help - and the easist way to do this is vertical space.  Get at least two tall cat trees, so that the dominant cats can claim their own space.  Spraying can also be a reaction to a stress that's outdoors - are their unneutered males coming to your house and marking outdoors?  That can be a trigger for many cats.<br>  <br>  If you've done everything else, then behavior drugs are the final choice.  Be sure though to have your vet explain what their training is in animal behavior drugs, or refer you to someone who is.  This is a very new field.  Many vets are still prescribing the "obsolete" drugs like Valium (diazipam) and Elavil which have the unwanted side effect of drugging the cat.  The latest drug is Prozac - yes, the same drug prescribed for humans but in obviosly a cat dosage.  Proper protocols require a blood panel first to check basic liver and kidney function.  If that checks out, the cat is started on a low dosage of Prozac, and monitored.  It may be too much or too little, so follow up is very important.  Once the cycle of bad behavior is broken, the cat is generally weaned off the drug.  Some cats need to remain on the drug longer than others, it all depends.  It can be extemely effective in many cats, for aggression, spraying, chronic fur pulling - any type of anxiety.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Under vet supervision, there are medications to help with anxiety related spraying.  A less extreme measure you could try is use of a Feliway diffuser.  These release calming pheromones into the air and have worked wonders at soothing stress and anxiety in cats. You should have the vet take a look at the cat first to rule out any medical issues which could be causing the inappropriate urination. And if he's not neutered, that should be your first action to control it.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Drugs like prozac only treat the symptom (stress), but they don't actually deal with the cause, so are not really an ideal solution.  It's a bit like constantly taking painkillers for a broken leg, rather than repairing it.<br>  <br>  If your cat is neutered and he's spraying due to stress, the best solution is to determine the source of the stress and reduce or eliminate it.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Yeah, by KILLING it!  Is your cat neutered?  If not, this could be why he/she is spraying.  Also, make sure this is not a medical problem..sounds like a vet appt. might be necessary.  NEVER give you cat drugs meant for humans..most can kill cats.|`|t3NgGMW6aa	The cat has a problem with something around the house.  He is spraying to mark his areas.  Is he fixed?  If not he is trying to lure a female.  There are wall plug-ins that are at the pet store you can get to try to get him to stop.  The plug-ins calm the cat down and can stop the spraying.  There is also sprays you can use to discourage the animal from an area.  Either may work.  Also ask if you have changed living areas or something around the house, as this could be a protest by the cat.|`|ZxOGKZOkaa	That could kill the cat, so yeah, I'd say it works.  But seriously, never give pets meds that are for people unless your vet says so.  Neutering your cat will cut down or eliminate the spraying altogether.  One small fee, no constant expensive medication necessary, and no chemical side effects.  It's a wonderful procedure and actually has health benefits.|`|NjOmMVZ7aa	You need to identify why the cat is spraying. Usually it is a stress issue. Talk to your vet and ask advice. Do NOT give human medication to a cat!|`|mR5RkClpaa	DO NOT GIVE CAT THIS STUFF , IT IS A CAT , NOT A HUMAN, A VET PRESCRIBES ANIMAL MEDS  DO YOU TAKE OTHER PEOPLES MEDICINE
d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	To answer your question specifically, it depends. Don't feed kibble and raw meat at the same time because they digest at different rates, and will cause stomach upset. If you're looking to switch from kibble to raw then it's perfectly ok. I would as someone else suggested do your own research on raw feeding before starting. Although you will find there are some who say you need supplements and vegetables, I agree with the others that don't think it's necessary. After all, you don't see the carnivorous animals in the wild taking supplements!<br>  <br>  Edit: Just wanted to add if you do start feeding raw, that's the only time you'll want to switch foods cold turkey. Unlike switching kibble where you add a little new to the old and so on.|`|AA11887983	I think that if you get recommendations from your vet on a good quality raw food diet, you can gradually introduce it.  Any time you change a diet, you should do it gradually, to lessen the chance of vomiting and diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  But make sure that you know what to feed, and how to properly prepare it. Raw food diets are good if they are the right kind.  You still have to be careful not to give them just any old raw meat.|`|SJwRbuBHaa	they can get e-coli poisoning just like we can.<br>  <br>  and thats not any fun to clean up..|`|wJdAybRnaa	Yes it is okay to switch the dog over to a raw diet, slowly. Jen is not informed whatsoever about this topic...<br>  <br>  You need to thoroughly research raw diets before starting one, because you need to add bones and bone meal, veggies, oils/fat (sometimes), some carbs, and vitamins, minerals, and supplements to the raw meat. There are also raw diets available that are already prepared: Honest Kitchen, Nature's Variety, and other websites/companies have ready-made raw diets. Google it. <br>  <br>  Many regular vets do not support a raw diet because they are not informed about it and have been brainwashed by Science Diet, Eukanuba, and other dog food companies (they are the ones that sponsor nutrition courses in vet schools, publish nutrition textbooks, etc.). Holistic vets are very supportive of this type of diet, so it might be helpful for you to have one of each!|`|26PPwzrWaa	yes. Just dont feed it with or too soon before or after the kibble. Generally after feeding raw meat, you want to wait 8 hours. After kibble feeding, you want to wait 12hrs. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigdogsporch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigdogsporch.com</a>
2P5WRadhaa	Same answer as last question. He's too young and too soon away from his mama and litter mates to try to do detailed things with, yet. Concentrate on the basics and the rest will fall in line. It may be 6 - 8 months before you can get him comfortable with the things you're trying to do. Relax! Don't' try too much. Have patience. they are smart, but things don't happen overnight. He amy not even start to train until he's 3 - 4 months old, so don't try too much or expect too much beyond the basic housebreaking needs.|`|zkt6nYeEaa	I know exactly what to do:<br>  When your friends are about to sit down, tell them to turn their back to the dog and sit down without looking or paying attention to it, they will calm down and give up eventually. Tell them to do this even if they are standing up. They might not like feel comfortable sitting on laps but they should sit on your lap as soon as you sit down. don't hit it or make a noise because then it thinks it is getting attention and will continue to bark and bite.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|onfX2jqLaa	dont worry my border collie chow mix did the same. he is just teething and will grow out of it. also be sure to get him neutered! so he wont be aggressive and sexually frustrated!|`|6UDSSn0aaa	Sounds like a job for the Dog Whisperer.|`|HmPivTTcaa	We have a 10 week old pup and had the same problem. Get a rolled up newspaper and slam it against your hand to make a sharp noise and say either NO! or UH-UH!! in a loud voice. If you don't have a newspaper handy, just give a little swat on her behind - NOT enough to hurt, just to startle and say UH-UH! in a firm tone. This worked for us and now our pup licks us and doesn't bite :-)|`|AA11887983	You do realize that as a shepherd/chow mix, he will probably be pretty sizable as an adult?  He won't be a good lap dog when he is fully grown.  <br>  <br>  I would work on the learning the proper games to play with him right now, to minimize his thinking that your hands are toys. Then you need to make sure that everyone who comes over does exactly as you do.  Consistency is the biggest key in training a dog.  They don't understand that what might be ok one time is not ok another time.  <br>  <br>  He can also be enrolled in a basic obedience class.  That way, you can both learn at the same time.  And he will probably love it.

If that is not available for teh moment, take some milk, boil it many times, because that breaks down some of the proteins it is hard for them to digest, add some sugar or honey, and let it cool down until it is lukewarm, not hot not cold. then use a feeding bottle to feed them, or a syringe. Be careful not to choke them. Also,after every feed, you must wipe their butt with a wet cotton to help them pee and poop. They should pee after every feed (every 2-3 hours), but they may  not poop for a couple of days, because of teh change in food.Also check if their mother is outside somewhere looking for them.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	They'll need feeding every two hours about 2 tablespoons of formula fed with a kitten bottle or syringe/eye dropper.  You'll need to stimulate peeing and pooping after they eat by rubbing their bums with a warm, wet cotton ball.  They need to be kept warm.  If you have a heating pad, place it in the box (set on low) and put a towel over it. Here is a website with recipes for emergency kitten formula (just till you can get real formula) and tips on caring for the kittens.<br>  <a href="http://kittenrescue.org/meow/handbook.htm" rel="nofollow">http://kittenrescue.org/meow/handbook.ht...</a><br>  <br>  They'll need feeding again before you can get to the store in the morning.  Hopefully you have the ingredients to make formula. Do not, under any circumstances give them cow's milk.  It will cause them to have diarrhea which can be deadly for young kittens.|`|dbe3949bbbedd96e00cdf1a2462e0484aa	petland should car it but if they don't your local vet will good luck  you will need to feed them with an eye droper sevral times a day and night  i bet they are soooooooo cute|`|8rfodw6Qaa	walmart even has kitten formula. <br>  get the formula and a kitten bottle and also a syringe to see what works better for feeding and read the label.<br>  i also think you have to wipe them after the feeding w/ a warm paper towel on their bottom to help them go to the bathroom.<br>  do not feed them milk. it will upset their tummy.|`|CKxYgkrpaa	u need to get just born kitten milk i got mine from petco it was 6 dollars u need bottles also which is bout 4 dollars they can be form 2ays to 10 days old keep them warm contact a vet they can tell u more if he can go back the momma cant be far|`|t3NgGMW6aa	They will have to be hand fed.  NO COW MILK! This will give them the runs.  The pet store will help you pick out bottles and can formula for them.  Hopefully you will be able to feed them.  You rub their backs to burp them, and wash their bottoms with a soft cloth to get them to potty like their mama does.  Keep an eye out for the mama cat, she will be looking for them.  If not it will be up to you.  Good luck!|`|yS2n0Zh7aa	Are you certain the kittens are abandoned?  The mom could have been out eating or ?  The best chance for their survival is with a vet.  They may not be acting hungry due to dehydration and starvation.  Lethargic and quite is not good.
n4pNNcGfaa	You desperately need to enroll in a basic dog obedience class or puppy kindergarten class.  The problems you are having are the result of mismanagement.  Keeping him in a crate that much of the day is not only cruel it is perpetuating his problems and causing new ones.  Leaving him in a crate will not teach him where to potty or what to chew.  Only your supervision and patient training will do that.  There is no easy, quick, or magical cure.  Puppies take work.  If you aren't up for the challenge, you should find him a home with someone who is.  The longer he is managed this way the less likely he will ever be able to learn the basic skills needed to be a desirable pet.  Unfortunately, this is the history of most dogs that wind up in shelters.  They're gotten as cute puppies and when the owners learn how much work puppies are and finally give up, they are dumped at shelters where they find it difficult to find homes because of ingrained bad habits from the former owners.  Many are euthanized because they can't find new homes.  So if you care for him, get on top of it immediately and enroll in a training class.
yEnWdKfqaa	Try researching breeders on the internet. You can also go to your local vet to find different breeders. While picking your pup you should pay special attention to the way they act. Be cautious of puppies that are afraid of people or hide in the corner whenever there is a stranger. A shy dog can be hereditary and if they are not well socialized most of the time it is not a good breeder. Also, while picking a pup don't necessarily go for the pup that runs up to you first. It is usually the ones that are calm and collective that make the best dogs. Make sure that they are alert. Try jingling your keys to see if they are attentive. Ask to see each pup individually. A pups temperament could be different when he doesn't have his "buddies" around. He could be less confident when he is not around his friends. Good luck finding a good breeder!|`|ApSzd48oaa	if you go on the kennel club website and search for a new puppy they bring up a list and just phone them they usually say if they kc reg and what not but you should see the pups first and then see if there is any thing you would like to ask|`|lFTynrRVaa	You are going to select a very strong dog for security purpose because time it become very furious but it is very good family dog also.

sAcQTPkCaa	introducing rats can take some time and isn't always successful if you do get a mate for your rat then the following stages should be followed<br>  - put the new rat into its own cage and let it get used to its cage for at least 3 weeks<br>  - after about 3 weeks put the rats cages next to each other so they can smell each other <br>  - after a few days let them both have supervised time out of their individual cages and splitting them up if any fighting happens do this for a wee or so gradually increasing the time they spend with each other<br>  - let each of them go in the others cage a few times<br>  - then finally thoroughly clean one cage which they are going to live together in, re-positionin everything in the cage so that when you do put them both together it is new for both of them so they are less likely to fight over territory. However not all introductions are smooth and successful so you might have to separate them if they do fight to avoid injury etc.<br>  hope i helped and good look :)|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Fighting WILL occur, its only natural. You can minimise by buying another cage and putting them next to each other so they can smell each other, then introducing them in a neutral either where neither rat has been before, such as a bathtub.<br>  <br>  There will be fighting, and rat dominance and even play fighting can seem harsh, but dont worry unless you see blood.|`|knFrwCxcaa	yh but make sure the cage is clean no smell of the other rats wee or poo and make sure theres all fresh bedding and saw dust because the rat will be in his territory and wouldn't want the other rat sleeping in his bed that smells of him<br>  <br>  Rat breeder|`|AA12282893	They shouldn't fight too much but will for a couple of days. I got a baby dumbo (6 weeks) and introduced it with full grown 1 year old females and after a day, the baby dumbo took over the place. I have done this with females mostly but it is usually ok with males also. It is a good idea to introduce them in a neutral environment(bathrooms are best usually) and rub the litter from the older one (used litter) on the baby to pass over the scent. It is good to also have an extra cage in case they don't get along. Good Luck! Fell free to email me if you need anything else.|`|BWez86Ldaa	No. Introductions can take a while. Youtube rat introduction and I believe you will find some videos to help you out. Generally, in my experience, it's easier and quicker to intro two young rats.<br>  <br>  How I do intros is by making a rattie buffet of their favourite food on a plate then put it in the tub. Then I give each rat a bath in the sink before putting them in the tub. What this does is makes them focus more on the food and grooming than on one another. They will probably sniff one another a few times then eat together. This is always good. Rats that eat together will live together! Another thing to keep in mind is to completely clean and disinfect the cage and move all the hammocks/food/water bottles around so that the cage is new and different for all rats involved.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	He will not bite you unless you offer him your finger that smells like food.|`|3sB49YNnaa	There is an extremely small chance that he will mistake a finger for food but it isn't a problem as a rule.  I've been giving guinea pigs treats by hand for better than 40 years and have never been bitten while doing it. <br>  <br>  One thing he might do is to take is top teeth and scrape along your skin and/or lick you.  They do this for salt and it is perfectly harmless and kind of cute.  Pigs have fat little tongues so it feels sort of odd at first.|`|YFTZM86maa	Maybe on accident if you hold the food wrong. (small foods like peas) Try doing it like you would feed a horse..hand flat with food on the palm.  Also keep in mind that the eyes on a pig are off to the sides and they can't see all that well straight ahead.  Accidents happen, but rarely would they be that excited about some food that they'd bite you hard.  You may feel teeth scrape as they are feeling for the food.  Once you know each other better, you can try holding the food between finger tips.  If the food is long or large enough, you won't need to worry about any of that, just hold it between your fingers and it will take the loose end.<br>  Guinea pigs are not prone to bite.  They will explore with their teeth and nibble or groom, but it shouldn't be confused with biting or aggression.<br>  Don't be scared!  If you are, and you pull away when trying to hand feed him, he may miss and get your hand instead.  Be calm and he will be calm to.  All creatures react best to positive energy.|`|UFn9eMYvaa	If he doesn't usually bite, don't worry about it! Keep you fingers out of the way--- my rats eat out of my hand, but sometimes nibble on my fingers. Don't feed him through the cage bars though! If you do that and poke your finger through the bars, he might bite!<br>  <br>  If he does bite, or you're really scared, put some gloves on--- leather if you have them. Then even if he does bite, it won't hurt, and you can get him used to eating out of your hand.<br>  <br>  I've never been bit by any guinea pig when hand feeding them, and they didn't even know me!
Ry3JbhUsaa	Not personally, but I've seen advertisements for a toilet training litter 'box' that you set on top of the toilet (with the lid up - not sure if you have to leave the seat up too).  After the cat gets used to using it, I think you start weaning them off of having litter in it - part of the system 'breaks away' to have the support ring for the cat to use, but no litter.  Eventually, the rest of the 'box' can be removed & the cat is supposed to be willing/able to use the toilet without it.  I have no idea what catalogue I saw this in, but know I've seen it.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	why would you want to force a cat to do something that is totally unnatural?  poor cat.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	thats a bit weird, isnt it?|`|0TuWYaneaa	The only way is to put a litter pan in the toilet bowl.Find one that fits and replace the one the cats been using with it to begin with.After a couple of weeks move it into the bowl.especially around the times you know the cats been going.Leave it partially used.After awhile he will begin using it.Once the cat is comfortable using it regularly,remove the litter from it and see if it will still use it.Its a long process and not all cats will go for it.After you get him to go with out the litter,then you can remove the pan.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I would strongly suggest against it. For hundreds of years cats have been doing the same thing: digging and squatting in the dirt. Try to think how awkward and awful it would be if you were forced to only use a litter box. Well it would be just as drastic of a change for for him. Cats don't deal well with major changes in their routine.|`|2AOzkBPJaa	not a clue:D start with a tiny toilet seat id say. haha.<br>  <br>  I have a potty trained parrot though!|`|Oq7CAayZaa	nope. you teach me to pottytrain my dog. not easy is it?

fd084ea5251793e8be9788692c598ce0aa	Both of your dogs are very young - I STRONGLY suggest obedience training, especially for the female.<br>  <br>  The fact that the female is showing you ANY signs of aggression is very bad.  She thinks SHE is in charge, both of the male and of you.  You must break this now, because it is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  Dogs will be jealous of each other - this is true.  Always try to treat them fairly.  For example, both dogs are allowed on the couch or neither dog is.  <br>  <br>  In my house, one dog actually prefers NOT to be on the couch or bed for an extended period, which is a blessing.  But they will get jealous of each other.  One is clearly the alpha of the two, but both have been trained and respect me as the overall alpha of the house.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, please get training to help establish yourself as being in charge again.  This does NOT involve beating or yelling.  It involves correction (often with prong collars, gentle words, a firm stance, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|167db7cd488d6db5d40b385fe3207723aa	Pit bulls are usually aggressive towards other dogs. It's part of their past.<br>  Regardless of any obedience training and what not you do, NEVER leave them alone together. Sooner or later there is a good possibility of coming home to a dead dog.|`|5afc2a9454a727b121b5706b6653e719aa	dogs r going 2 do that it life|`|AA10801947	Yeah, I have a male and female pitbull and they do the same thing. This is very natural with this breed. My wife and I give each dog equal and identical attention. She comforts one dog and me the other. We alternate dogs so that they get the same amount of attention between the both of us.<br>  <br>  Like the other person said, the jelously is never really going to go away.<br>  <br>  The couch is the pinnacle of jelously. We make sure BOTH dogs are up on the couch with us. Never just one. They are the way they are.|`|LIwZzwBPaa	Give it time. How long have you had the new one? You will need to give them equal attention, and praise when they are not growling at each other. Hug/pet the male and say 'good dog'  while hugging/petting the female at the same time so she learns the male is a good thing and not a threat. I just added a puppy to my family of 2 dogs that I've had for 6 and 61/2 years. They were pretty grumpy at first, always growling if chloe ( the new puppy) came near them. It has been about 3 weeks and there is less growling and more getting along. Although there is still some grumpiness, they are adjusting to each other. It will just take time and A LOT of patience. Say no when your female pitt growls and be quick to say good dog when she is showing any sign of playfulness and 'getting along' behavior towards the male. Let them know they can both be on the sofa by saying good dogs (or don't let either one on the sofa if you don't allow that at your house) Try to get them to play with each other and treat them both the same. Don't let her 'hump' the male as that is a sign of domination and be quick to reprimand when/if that happens. Humping is something you train out of your dog and still have an 'alpha' between the two. Be patient and give lots of attention to both and the will be great friends! Healthy training treats work wonders as well!|`|MP41NYFoaa	If you let them do this, they will continue. It is important to never let them think it is okay for them to act this way. <br>  Our siberian husky used to do this. When she acted with this bad behavior, we ignored her or displinced her to let her now it is not ok. We would not acknowledge her and finally she got the point that her acting this way was not getting her any attention either.|`|PcImSgBbaa	Although sbby is kinds right I have known people to have a male and female in the house together I would never ever leave them home alone . But they may be civil if you properly socailize them.<br>  And the jelousy should be the least of your concerns. You to try to give them equal amounts of love but there will always be some jelousy|`|f8be0a59f4ae196fee609c52bd995808aa	Make sure both those dogs are fixed immediately...when they get older, they will kill eachother.  Pitts are very dog aggressive.  I'm not joking...it happened to my sister's pitts...although they did not kill eachother, they did some very life threatening damage to eachother,, and it was because one of the males was not neutered.
0ca1a37209095645212ecc716e63cb3baa	Take your dog to a social behavioral class or training classes.  You may even want to see a vet about this situation.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	When a dog starts acting aggressive all of a sudden, you should always take them to the vet to rule out health issues.. Dogs don't suddenly start to act aggressive without reason.. Either being treated aggressively, teased by kids, etc... If nothing has changed, the vet might be able to help. If she is healthy, then seek the help of a trainer.. Aggression is a serious problem, especially since she has already bit someone..|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Sorry that your yorkie has some serious issues. Even little dogs can be a BIG liability, and she needs some real help. I would seek a pro trainer's help because this will be a big job. The best thing you can do in the meantime though is to start taking control of her. Keep her on a leash even in your home so it's easy to correct her. If someone knocks on the door, grab the leash and give her a little yank until she calms down. Block her so she can't reach the door and don't answer it until she is calmed down. When the people come in, if she is still barking, do the same thing. Tug the leash and block her so she can't reach the visitor. What you are telling her by doing this is that the door and guests are off limits to her and they are YOURS!!!|<br>  Good Luck!!|`|67068835ffcfd72d59ec5e6dc66eb309aa	you need a pro. trainer and i wish you alot of luck!|`|PtYzB2EJaa	I would not take an aggressive dog to a dog park, as this could result in an injured dog, either yours or someone elses.

If a dog bites someone that is "the last straw" so to say I am no pro but I have eleven dogs and i have given you my solution it is up to you what you do from here.|`|LxWybRWDaa	Try a dog park. That will teach your dog that it is not boss. Around your house or on walks, keep a leash on her. When she does something bad, firmly pull the leash and say NO, then reward her afterward if she stops. Also, try putting her in a crate when she is bad.|`|gsUEFOAjaa	Take your girl into the vet asap for a complete checkup.  Sometimes behavior changes are the result of illness or disease.    If possible, you could also ask her breeder for advice.  Only after she is cleared by the vet should you go to a dog trainer.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider buying a muzzle from a pet store; ask a vet or the dog's breeder for advice on using a muzzle.  Choose the size correctly to fit her comfortably.  Be gentle and easy with your dog when you put it on her, and take it off after a few seconds the first time.  Use it only for very short periods of time, and never leave her alone with it on.  Also I wouldn't use it when she may need to pant, such as on a walk or a warm day.  If she shows signs of panicking, don't make her wear it.  <br>  <br>  When you take her on a walk, use a short (4 foot if possible) leash and have her walk slightly behind you on a heel command, except when she is relieving herself of course.<br>  <br>  You may have a more difficult problem, however, because if you are feeling afraid of your dog, your dog will pick up on that and may indeed bite you one day.  You need to work with a trainer to overcome your girl's issues (assuming no illness).
AA12243001	The breeder and our vet both recommend Eukanuba.  My westie is almost 5 years old, and that is his main food.  He is healthy, weighs about 16 lbs., and eats his food with no problem.

But let me offer you this: not only will you have peace of mind for feeding your beloved pet something good, you will not be spending as much as you think. Because of the low nutritional value of the bad foods, pets have to eat more of it to feel full and get nutrition. Your dog will eat less, and absorb more nutrients. Also, you'll find your pet will be passing a lot healthier [and a lot less!] stool. <br>  <br>  Here's a list of great, nutritional, foods for your pet.

RVM4ppqaaa	They live about 5 or 6 days without hardly any blood.<br>  My dog Pepper has about 104 ticks on him.<br>  <br>  -ASPCA worker|`|OqWjmJcJaa	Really, giving your dog tick preventative is the best thing you can do.  Depending on what brand you use, he may still get ticks, but they will either not bite, or they will die before they have time to transmit any diseases. <br>  The main thing is, everybody gets ticks, so don't freak out, it's no big deal.  They hang out on tall grass and weeds and wait for critters to come by that they can jump onto, so anytime you or your dog have been out in the woods or the park, or even in an area where the lawn hasn't been mowed in a while, check yourself and your dog thoroughly for ticks when you get home. <br>  <br>  You'll never find them all on your dog because of the fur, but do your best and if you've been in a bad tick-infested area, check him every day for a week.  It took us that long to find all the ticks my dog and I picked up after a week camping.  <br>  <br>  A tick generally has to be attached for at least 48 hours to transmit disease, so if they don't look very engorged you can probably just pluck them out and flush them down the toilet or squish them really good or something. If they look like they've started to swell up with blood they may have been attached long enough, so you should try not to pop them and instead put them in a jar of alcohol or something to kill them but keep the body for a few days in case you or your dog starts showing signs of disease or infection, then you can take the tick to the vet/doc with you.<br>  <br>  Also, you can use OFF! or something similar on yourself when you go somewhere where there are a lot of ticks.  Don't spray it on your dog though, stick to the preventative you're using.

VD4D9ITVaa	Getting a large dog for an apartment is really not a good idea, but if you are set on it, then I'd suggest you get a dog that has low energy indoors.<br>  <br>  A good breed may be a great dane (they are known for being couch potatoes).<br>  <br>  But can I ask, why do you want a large breed?<br>  If you want a hardy dog that you can play with, there are tons of medium and small size breeds.  I would higly reccomend a breed that has little shedding (there is no such things a dog that doesn't shed at all) it is very convienent.<br>  <br>  Bichon Frises are very hardy and playful dogs. They are little, but great companions, easily trainable, and great family pets. They do not shed, and are very loveable.<br>  <br>  Please consider your reasons for wanting a larger dog.|`|IMaPRQxFaa	Some apartments limit the size of the dog you get... so check into that. Boxers are good dogs and are decently sized. Do not get a dog that is very energetic like golden or lab, since they will be home alone for 8 hours. They will bounce off the walls.|`|eOFznK8Vaa	Adopt a senior dog.|`|ppe73mvZaa	a shih tzu. Because they dont really make noise, theya re small but they grow big. They're the perfect choice. My friend who lives in an apartment that doesnt allow pets has shih tzu but it doesnt make noise, so they allowed her to keep it. :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|qBDf0L9eaa	You live in apartment so you can get pamolian.|`|ySYYHCjhaa	well i have a bluehealer vary obedient he always listens to me if your not too crazy about bluehealers try a great dane or a cocker spaniel but I also like labrador retrievers|`|6JRUbmHjaa	a stuffed one. No dog should be left for 8 hours a day. It's not fair
AxaspNJJaa	for what breed though?|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	white|`|6pUzzsuhaa	to me its more about the dog's personality<br>  i don't really care what color the dog is- my dogs are all sorts of colors|`|mrA6yUTZaa	well i personally like dogs in a chocolaty shade like the one in the link below but the white one looks cute too|`|H6B90UG5aa	*shrugs*...I'm partial to brindles ...I've got 3 APBT (2 mixes, 1 "pure") pups that are brindles ...2 light 1 dark|`|jzASWplfaa	it depends on the dog
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	They're highly athletic and require a large amount of daily exercise and stimulation.<br>  They're intelligent and very responsive to training.<br>  They're loyal and loving.<br>  They're self-confident and protective.<br>  They're immense shedders.<br>  They're often quite vocal and frequently bark, whine and grumble.<br>  They require a firm, benevolent leader who commands respect.<br>  They grow to be quite large very quickly, while they mature slowly; as such, they're very big, rambunctious puppies who can inadvertently knock down a child easily.<br>  They must have a genetically sound temperament; you must do your homework in finding an excellent breeder to ensure the proper GSD temperament.<br>  They're prone to a great deal of diseases and maladies, such as hip dysplasia, skin issues, eye issues, so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  Consider reading this: <a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/germanshepherds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  And this: <a href="http://saveashepherd.org/index.php?page=is-a-german-shepherd-dog-right-for-you" rel="nofollow">http://saveashepherd.org/index.php?page=...</a>|`|6qsocyK3aa	They're agressive and stubborn when treated badly but loyal, gentle, friendly and protective when treated well. The only thing is they do have very long hair which requires a lot of grooming. And remember, a cute puppy very quickly turns into a big barking dog that can be hard to manage in the wrong hands.
9kceDOTraa	All the input talking about a group being too much now are CORRECT.  There's a few things to consider and you have some advice given already from a  VERY poor cichild keeper.<br>  <br>  First thing to consider here is that a Jack Dempsey is a rule the whole tank type of fish and you have 2 of them in there now.  They may not exhibit aggressiveness at this time, but it's only a matter of time, and only if those Convicts go into mating, will they have any chance at all against a Jack Dempsey.  <br>  <br>  55 gallons looks like alot of space now if they are small, but it's not nearly enough to keep a full grown community of that stock.  Not even by far.  Consider what happens if those 2 JD's turn out to be male?  It will be a fight to the death between those two in only 55 gallons of space.<br>  <br>  Now you have 4 Convicts and if you have 2 mating pairs out of that, ok they could stand up to a Dempsey, but that's really wouldn't what would concern me.  Just one pair alone is likely to spawn, say from a 1 year time, Jan to Dec, about 300-400 fry alone.  Convicts are the guppy of the cichild world and you have a possible 2 pair in there.  If not the end of this year, then clearly by the end of next year, you are going to be OVERRUN with Convicts in that tank.  I'd come up with a very solid plan on what you're going to do with all those fry before they show up wanting food.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	4 convicts can probably live in a 55 for life. JDs will need a bigger tank, soon,<br>  <br>  Ian|`|dT77Rj8raa	All those fishes will grow, and trust me, once there huge, someone is going to die. 55gal is great if you want to have a lot of fish, but the fish must only grow to a maximum of 3 inches. If you want to keep larger fish in a 55gal tank, then you should only house a few, just because your tank is bigger then 40gal and can house the convicts doesn't mean your tank can house 4 of them. |`|oaUelbqKaa	Yes, that's too many--the JDs need another, bigger tank.  If any of those convicts form mated pairs, though, you could have some serious carnage on your hands.<br>  <br>  Joe M, your tank is insanely overstocked and filled with completely incompatible fish.  It is not "healthy".|`|uGkLRQsxaa	once those convicts start spawing you're going to have one hectic tank|`|gPYqGoZBaa	uhhh yeah...<br>  <br>  1 JD needs 55 gals minimum.|`|XPymjCdBaa	Yes that's too many. You could keep the convicts in there, or a single jack dempsey with a single convict, but that's about it. Once those fish start pairing off and wanting to breed, you will be in very big trouble.
71i6IjdZaa	He looks to me like he could be Staffy X Kelpie X Lab, also I think its great you adopting from the rspca:)<br>  xx|`|0SHAY9TQaa	aaawww, he is so so cute! He is definitely a black lab mix, maybe with some border collie.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Enjoy :)|`|6qsocyK3aa	Black lab. He's v cute! :)|`|edzU8VJiaa	Aaahhhh...  Don't know who told you he was a Kelpie cross, but this pup is nearly all black labrador.  <br>  <br>  He will be very intelligent, very naughty, and will need some serious training.  <br>  <br>  I owned a rescued black lab who was a nightmare when we got him and took a lot of effort and training to  become acceptable in public.  However, he was SO protective and loving, that we almost forgave him his bad behaviour.  He "saved" me on more than one occasion, when he thought I was under threat, and I still remember him with great affection.  He was a dog I always felt safe with in any situation, since he had proved that he would put his life on the line for me.<br>  <br>  Count yourself lucky to have such a dog.  Train him well, give him lots of love and affection, and he will repay it a hundred-fold.|`|HBbNtDpfaa	Maybe a labrador or. a staffy, good luck he's very cute :)|`|bVkIEpyGaa	From that second pic I'd say he was crossed with a panther!|`|aJRP6WWYaa	I think he's got lab in him. He has the feet of a lab and the size. Also labs are very smart. You said he was smart. What's his name? He's a cute puppy.|`|aYjF2SOKaa	I'd say there was definitely a look of some sort of terrier to his face... The face is too skinny to be a staffy or pitbull. Possibly a little lab, or something of similar size|`|Mw8RehZOaa	he looks like a staffy x patterdale<br>  <br>  see my pics and compare<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.uniteddogs.com/dog/16756/pic/290067" rel="nofollow">http://en.uniteddogs.com/dog/16756/pic/2...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.uniteddogs.com/dog/16756/pic/106714" rel="nofollow">http://en.uniteddogs.com/dog/16756/pic/1...</a>|`|16XpYCBmaa	I would say he has some black lab in him, it is hard to tell for sure since he is still a puppy. He is soo cute. :)|`|UViJ899Daa	i think it looks like a black lab x pit bull mix... a friend of mine have a dog that kinda looks like your dog..|`|9YCmiewRaa	Looks like lab x sheepdog|`|70At0HClaa	black lab|`|ePMgDPwMaa	awwww he is so adorable he look like a black lab to me awww cute dog|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	awww so cute, anyway ur puppy looks so much like ours many yrs ago and her mom was a germand sherdx collie and her day was a lab x wippet..so looks like u may have quite a mixture there also...but dont worry because if thi is right then ur have the most loveable and adorrable dog for yrs to come...<br>  <br>  happy playing|`|pC5GiAgsaa	Awwwwww he's such a cutie!! He's a spitting image of our black labrador puppy. However he definitely has something else in him but I'm not sure what. He looks mostly labrador, however from the way you described his paws and the way his ears are sticking up he could have some german shepherd in him....... awww!|`|EF05ydABaa	ugh i think it is a jack Russel cuz it looks a lot like my dog only skinner cuz mine is overweight lol and my next door neighbor it looks almost excacty like that only white so thats what i think it is i<br>     is it hyper? email me back and answer that then i can tell u for sure|`|55N1AA7zaa	well id say that he looks like a lab or collie x stafforshire bull terrier<br>  <br>  just by the pics xD
