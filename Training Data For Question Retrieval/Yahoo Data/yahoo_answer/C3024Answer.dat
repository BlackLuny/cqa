BMGEi0yCaa	Boca isn't horrible. I don't know how old you are or what your financial situation is, but if you're on a budget and under 21, pretty much the only things to do is shop, eat, beach, movies, golf or tennis.<br>  <br>  Boca is nice, though. Very beautiful, but also kind of small. There are 2 parts to Boca, just so you know. There's West Boca, which is about 10 miles (max) from the beach and West Boca is seperate from East Boca. If you're into the bar scene, there's a lot more to do in West Boca. East Boca, however, is within city limits and that's where a lot of the expensive shopping and eating are.<br>  <br>  As for the people, they're not mean, just incredibly rude. Just yesterday I was in a store and I was next in line to check out. Some lady with her kid just cut in front me and the woman behind me and put all her stuff on the counter. The cashier saw and rang up her stuff without a word. I would have had a few choice words for her if she didn't have a baby with her.<br>  <br>  But it's mostly the drivers that you'll have to worry about. If you're coming during summer, you won't have to worry about the snowbirds, but there are still a lot of jerk drivers on the road. You either have the trust fund kids in mommy and daddy's porche or BMW driving 30 miles over the speed limit weaving in and out of traffic or you have the rich jerks in their stupid Mercedes doing the same thing and giving you the finger if you blare your horn at them.<br>  <br>  But don't get too down about it - if you're coming during summer, the beach is beautifullll and will completely make up for all the jerks and overpriced stuff. It does get busy, but it's still worth the hassle of trying to find parking.You could also try going to Deerfield Beach, which is the next city south of Boca. It's not far at all. If you go to "downtown" Deerfield Beach where the pier is, it's a great little area. You have affordable restaurants, bars, surf shops, ice cream shops, pizzerias, tattoo shops, all that stuff. My friend lives on the Boca/Deerfield city line (about a 5 minute walk to the beach), so we're always down in Deerfield Beach hanging out when it's nice out. There's actually one restaurant in Deerfield that we LOVE called Oceans 2,3,4 and we love sitting outside on the porch. It's a great restaurant that's on the beach. Literally. You step down off the porch and there's nothing but sand and water. Gorgeous around sundown.<br>  <br>  Boca is a good location, though, for Vacation. It's right smack inbetween 2 major cities - West Palm (City Place) and Ft. Lauderdale (Las Olas), which have TONS to do. You can go to the beaches there, there's also shopping (some is expensive, but you'll find a lot more affordable stores), there's more bars, clubs, restaurants, movie theaters, water parks, arcades, boating, and all that kind of stuff. Also check out Delray Beach (next city north of Boca). It's got a lovely beach and downtown area as well.<br>  <br>  So point is this - Boca is a great place to visit (despite the rudeness the expensiveness), but a crappy place to live. I should know, I've lived here for 21 years, born and raised, haha. If you do visit, bring lots of summer clothes, flip flops, sunscreen and spending money. =o)

I was a medical transcriptionist working from home for 13 years. <br>  <br>  Many transcriptionists get their training through a course of study while others carry their medical terminology knowledge with them from other health related fields. You would need to get the terminology down, and then get started. Many companies want experience so there's a catch-22. However, doctors and hospitals may be hiring, and after a time you can work from home as many transcriptionists do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.MedicalTranscription.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MedicalTranscription.com</a>|`|fkgSuOIhaa	I make videos, then upload each one to multiple sites all over the internet, not just youtube, I put ads on my website and then tell them in my videos to visit my site. 1 in 30 people click ads, so I get about a penny per person since each click equals about 30 cents.

6N8aZlhbaa	I think certain aspects of the market need to be regulated. The banking disaster, utility disaster, mortgage disaster, and commodities disaster all show that those areas of the market are too important to the world economy to be run purely on speculation and greed.<br>  Without regulation the desire for profits will outweigh the needs of the population and we'll only repeat what is currently going on at some future point.|`|Hp18CSwLaa	a good balance of both is necessary.<br>  <br>  the free market has been proven to be much more efficient, but of course, government regulation is necessary to a certain extent.<br>  <br>  Man is essentially a greedy being, so if left unchecked, the market will serve to benefit those with the more, at the expense of those with less. <br>  <br>  If there were no government interventions and regulations (such as price controls, etc.) whatsoever, the rich would become richer and everyone would become poorer. Monopolies of commodities such as oil and other necessities would jack up their prices and people would be forced to buy anyway. Greed would overshadow the needs of the world, and would bleed the world dry.<br>  <br>  The regulations ensure that this doesn't get out of hand, and people don't get taken advantage of... well, it ensures that we don't get taken advantage of TOO much.:D
