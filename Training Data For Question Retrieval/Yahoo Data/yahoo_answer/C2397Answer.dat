N8DC9foaaa	Ok, this uses the freezing point depression formula first which is:    Tf = Kf * M (molality)    We first find the Tf which is the change in temperature due to the addition of the substance. This would be 5.53C - 4.85C = .68C    So that gives us: .68C = 5.12C/m * M    Solve for M. .68C / 5.12C/m = M    Our Molality for the solution is: .13 moles/kg (solvent) (using sig digs)    Since Molality is moles of solute/mass of solvent (kg) we can now set up:    .13 moles/kg = ?moles of solute / .0235 kg benzene    Solve for moles of solute (.13moles/kg * .0235kg) = .18 moles of unknown    To calculate moles, we always take the mass (g) of the substance / molar mass so -     .18 moles = 0.704 g / molar mass (our unknown).    Solve for the unknown: 0.704g / .18moles = molar mass    molar mass = 3.91g    Hope that helps. :)

fhET9Awpaa	An outline follows a basic structure. Do either a sentence or phrase outline but don't use both. The first word of each section is capitalized. There must be an introduction and a conclusion. An outline is very specific and includes certain points that can be broken down. After the first 'I' use the tab button to get space, then when you write down the A underneath, tab the A until it is directly underneath the start of the above sentence.  If you use an A, then you must write down a B. If you use a 1, use a 2. You don't always have to use numbers; you can just use A, B, C, then go on to your next topic under a new roman numeral.    Ex.  I.         Intro               A.           Info              B.           Info                            1.         Even more specific info                           2.         Even more specific info                                      a.         Extremely detailed                                       b.         Extremely detailed    II.         A.

E2Bdez4Iaa	Usually, it would be  4 years of undergrad (pre-med), then 4 years of professional/gad/medical school to get your doctorate or MD, so getting an MD alone would take 8 years (more or less).     Getting a PhD on the other hand, is around 4 to 5 years (after undergrad).    It all depends on how well you do in school and your applications to grad/med school and/or if you survive (jk).     Good luck!|`|SIhxrxD3aa	First you would need a bachelor's degree which takes four years.    Then you would go to med school.  Some schools offer dual degrees to get your MD and PhD at the same time and it's usually a 6-7 year program.  Of course not every med school will offer this and not ever med school will have a PhD in public health and if you did them seperately it would probably take longer.  An MD and master's in public health dual degree will only take you 4-5 years if you wanted to go that route instead.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	If you want to be a physician, then get your MD.

C4ykAUrcaa	this is how I would solve the problem...  Since you know that the two lines are interesecting one another, you can set them equal to one another.  So you two equations are  x^2+y^2=20 and x=-2y... then insert every x for -2y  (-2y)^2+y^2=20  and then solve for y  4y^2+y^2=20  5y^2=20  divide by five and you answer is 2  y=2  and insert that in for y and x =-4    so the points of inersection of (-4,2)|`|b36a3ea5053129e74f60939bd03c219faa	okay first you need to solve one of them for y. I recommend to do the x+2y=0. that comes to be y=(1/2)x. Then sub in (1/2)x for y in the other problem. it will look something like x^2+[(1/2)x]^2=20. then just solve for x. then you take the square root of both sides and combine your like terms of x. it should look like (3/2)x=(square root of)20. Then multiply both sides by 2/3. then it would look like x= 2*(square root of)20 all over 3. Then you can evaluate if needed to get the decimal. Now take all of that and substitute it into the y=(1/2)x to find the value for y. your value for y and your value for x is your point of intersection. But also you have to realize that the square root of 20 can be positive and negative when solving for x. so using the positive and the negative solutions for x you should have 2 points of intersection.|`|JRqB3QlGaa	That is right.

1khVEE6oaa	Okay, well you are certainly not alone.  Scientists are even talking about the failed science in the global warming hysteria.    I actually wrote an email a couple days ago to send out to my family and friends on the topic.  I didn't cite my sources, but they can be easily googled by typing in the quotes.  You are welcome to use any or all of it!      Here you go:    "The winter of 2008-2009 sure has been cold, hasnt it?  According to the data published by IARC-JAXA, October 2008 saw the fastest Arctic sea ice extent growth ever recorded.  Additionally, this winter has given us record low temperatures, with cold spells often breaking records previously set fifteen or twenty years ago.  It snowed in Houston and New Orleans, and if youre a native of either city, you know how rare that is.  In late January 2009, terribly icy winter storms left more than a million homes and businesses without power in New England.  Ironically, Al Gore was forced to brave this rough and frigid weather, so he could get to Congress to talk about global warming.    John Coleman, founder of the Weather Channel and eminent Meteorologist, recently said, "There is no significant man-made global warming.  There has not been any in the past, there is none now and there is no reason to fear any in the future.  The climate of Earth is changing.  It has always changed.  But mankind's activities have not overwhelmed or significantly modified the natural forces."    He went on to discuss the actual cause of climate change, saying, "Worldwide there was a significant natural warming trend in the 1980's and 1990's as a Solar cycle peaked with lots of sunspots and solar flares.  That ended in 1998 and now the Sun has gone quiet with fewer and fewer Sun spots, and the global temperatures have gone into decline.  Earth has cooled for almost ten straight years."    This has been happening throughout the history of the world.  In fact, back in the 1970's, there was similar climate change alarmism going around - except they claimed a new Ice Age was coming within decades.  Actual measurements of Earth's temperature and climate show no man-made warming trend.  In fact, during four of the seven decades since 1940 when average CO2 levels increased, average temperatures in the US were actually decreasing.  Additionally, there are hundreds of research papers available from a wide variety of sources confirming the existence of a period warmer than today just a thousand years ago known as the Medieval Warm Period.    Dr. John Theon, the retired scientist formerly in charge of key NASA climate programs has come out as a skeptic as well.  Dr. Theon was responsible for all weather and climate research in the entire agency, including the research work by James Hansen, who is the leading global warming alarmist in the country (except for maybe Al Gore).  Dr. Theon has stated that "some scientists have manipulated the observed data to justify their model results.  In doing so, they neither explain what they have modified in the observations, nor explain how they did it.  They have resisted making their work transparent so that it can be replicated independently by other scientists.  This is clearly contrary to how science should be done.  Thus there is no rational justification for using climate model forecasts to determine public policy."  Please, someone tell this to Congress.    The arguments for man-made global warming are tenuous at best.  A small data calculation error of 0.8 degrees centigrade was discovered in findings by NASA, and the recalculations showed an overall decrease in U.S. temperatures since 2000 by 0.15 degrees centigrade.  Furthermore, the sea level has been rising since the end of the last Ice Age 10,000 years ago.  The rate of increase has averaged four feet per century.  Yet in the 20th century, when we are told that "global warming" began to have a major impact on the sea level, it rose by just eight inches.     Fraudulent "hockey stick" data published in 1998, which showed massive global warming during the 20th Century, turned out to have been cherry-picked from a small sample of tree rings.  When challenged on this, one dendroclimatologist justified himself by saying, "You have to pick cherries if you're going to make cherry pie."  The whole thing was proven to be a sham when not one other scientist could reproduce the results.    Finally, US Meteorologist Anthony Watts discovered that a large portion of the nation's 1,200 weather stations have been wrongly sited, because they are situated in man-made heat-absorbing centers.  These include locations on rooftops, on slabs of heat-absorbing concrete, and next to air conditioners, diesel generators, and asphalt parking lots.    Many facts have also been ignored by global warming alarmists.  For instance, the periods of warmer temperatures on Earth have resulted in warmer and longer growing seasons and more areas available for crops.  Increases in CO2 levels also cause an increase in plant growth.  Based on the data, it's clear that CO2 follows the trend of temperature; it does not cause it.  In reality, solar activity is the originator of most climatic change and most weather patterns on Earth.  Especially since similar temperature changes can be measured on Mars, which has no power plants or SUVs.    In summary, it is abundantly clear that the manmade global warming madness that has swept our nation is nothing but a hoax.  It has been perpetuated by environmentalist wackos like Al Gore for two reasons, one good and one bad.  Firstly, they want to lower pollution.  I have no problem with lowering pollution, because I don't want to breathe smog or swim in a dirty lake.  However, encouraging conservation should not be done with scare tactics and false data.  Their second reason is much more insidious:  They want power.  The more liberals can regulate, the more than can |`|hyHvG1Olaa	Start with the websites listed and you can begin with the the breakup of the ice shelf in Antarctica recently in the news.

uIqqC1Kaaa	Slope is defined as the change in y divided by the change in x. In simpler terms, how does the change in x (left or right) affect the change in y (up and down)?    to do that, find the change in both x and y values, which is essentially taking the difference between the two points, meaning subtract one from the other.    For y= 5-(-6)=11  For x= -2-5=-7    slope= (change in y)/(change in x)= 11/-7, or -11/7    In general the slope formula is:    m=(y1-y2)/(x1-x2)    in which there are 2 points: (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).|`|P2BjtJnUaa	y = mx + b    the slope is the same as the (m)|`|TPpTAKAdaa	You use this formula: (y2-y1)divided by (x2-x1)    So, plug in the coordinates that are given.  -2=x1, 5=y1, 5=x2, and       -6=y2.

kNPJaPmLaa	My family members on both sides are non-believers. Ever since my uncle's family converted to Catholicism, I have been inspired to learn about the Catholic faith. Protestants and Catholics share many of the same beliefs. However, I do not like that many Christians tend to pray using long words to impress others. I see more anger than love. I wonder if I really go to a Christian school because of the way I am treated by other students.     I wonder how many Christians actually know Jesus. I Corinthians 13:12 states that Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known by God. Attending a Christian school, church, praying meaninglessly using the same words again and again but not earnestly, being raised in a devoted Christian family, and being with Christian friends do not buy a ticket to heaven. Faith without works in dead, according to St. James. You will be shown the times you disobeyed Gods commands by abandoning the poor or lonely friends who desperately needed you. Jesus said the lonely and the poor are actually Him and asks Christians to love one another. We are each responsible for what we do and what we fail to do.    I know I cannot get away from God since He and I have built a strong relationship past years. Also, most importantly, God will NOT let go of me, rather He will tightly hold onto my hands. I think that God just wants to test me so that He can change my community through the Holy Spirit in my heart later.    ---------  Wow - this is a great and thoughtful paragraph! I didn't change it much, and it can be edited down more if need be. One more thing I feel compelled to mention, which you didn't ask: don't join the Catholic Church because there are Protestant hypocrites. You'll find them all over the place. The devil is industrious and he does not discriminate on denomination. Learn about the Catholic faith because it is the Church that Jesus started. Every protestant church is an offshoot of the Church that Jesus started. Today there are over 32, 000 faith communities, but there is still only one "Church:" the one that Jesus started.     Best to you.
NBnuL73Eaa	STEM CELL ORGAN TRANSPLANT  British doctors announced in November that they had helped perform the world's first transplant of an organ grown from stem cells, signalling a significant medical breakthrough.  Surgeons replaced the damaged windpipe of Claudia Castillo, a 30-year-old mother of two, with one created from stem cells grown in a laboratory at Bristol University. Because the new windpipe was made from cells taken from Ms Castillo's body, using a process called tissue engineering, she did not need powerful organ rejection drugs.  Avoiding the use of these drugs means she will not be at an increased risk of cancer and other diseases, unlike other transplant patients. Five months after the operation, she is living normally and is able to look after her children again.  Stem cells are "master cells'' that can be manipulated in a laboratory to become any other cell in the body. Scientists predicted that within 20 years surgeons could replace hearts with laboratory-grown organs. The technique would "revolutionise'' surgery, they claimed, with the potential to save thousands of lives.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtec...      GM ANIMAL ORGANS FOR HUMAN TRANSPLANT  Hearts and kidneys from genetically modified pigs could be transplanted into humans within a decade, a leading scientist revealed in November  Lord Winston, a fertility expert at Imperial College London, told a press conference he is developing a GM pig that he believes could solve the shortage of organs for transplant patients.  The pigs, which could eventually also donate other organs such as the liver, will be bred so that transplants will not be rejected by the human body.  Once created, the "donor strain'' should be able to reproduce normally, producing an almost limitless and cheap supply of organs.  A shortage of appropriate donors means that around 500 people die every year in Britain while waiting for a transplant.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtec...      SCIENTISTS PROPOSE WARP DRIVE  Two physicists boldly went where no reputable scientists should go and devised a scheme to travel faster than the speed of light.  The advance they said could mean that Star Trek fantasies of interstellar civilisations and voyages powered by warp drive are now no longer the exclusive domain of science fiction writers.  Dr Gerald Cleaver, the associate professor of physics at Baylor University, Texas, and Richard Obousy have come up with a twist on an idea to produce a warp drive that they believe can travel faster than the speed of light, without breaking the laws of physics.  In their scheme, published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in August, a starship could "warp'' space so that it shrinks ahead of the vessel and expands behind it. By pushing the departure point many light years backwards while simultaneously bringing distant stars and other destinations closer, the warp drive effectively transports the starship from place to place at faster-than-light speeds.  All this extraordinary feat would require, says the study, is for scientists to harness a mysterious cosmic antigravity force, called dark energy.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtec...      PHOENIX MARS LANDER REPORTS FROM MARS  Cheers rang out at Nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California, in May as word reached Earth that the space agency's latest mission to explore Mars had touched down safely.  The Phoenix Mars Lander, a robotic probe designed to investigate whether the planet's subterranean ice ever supported life, successfully pulled off a hair-raising descent that had mission controllers 170 million miles away anxiously holding their breath.  During the so-called "seven minutes of terror'', the final moments of the craft's hazardous plunge to the Martian surface, the three-legged probe activated its heat shield, deployed a parachute and used 12 rockets to slow from 13,000mph to just 5mph.  With little room for error, there was significant risk the 212 million project could end the same way that more than half of previous missions to Mars have done - in failure.  But in the final hours before the scheduled arrival, engineers at JPL remained upbeat about their chances of success, citing the clear weather and fact that Phoenix was on course to touch down on target in the arctic plains near the planet's north pole.  Their optimism was borne out when mission controllers received a signal at 12.53am BST telling them the Phoenix had landed 15 minutes earlier, the time it took the signal to travel the distance to Earth.  Over the next few months the robotic laboratory send back unprecendented images and confirmed the presence of water on the Red Planet.  It eventually died on November 2, two months after its expected survival date.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sciencean

It marked a pivotal moment in the history of the American colonies.     In ways that could scarcely be understood at the time, the Great Awakening prepared the British subjects of North America for a radically different ideology and society.

So the first then we are going to do is separate things so they look much easier. Here we go. Set this up like fractions    k^2-4         2-k  --------      -------  Fractions are easier to deal with multiplication than  /3k^2         11k       with division, so we are going to turn this into                               a multiplication problem Just take the second                                fraction and flip it upside down. Then this                                becomes a multiplication problem (and a whole                               lot easier!)    k^2-4            11k  --------  times ------  3k^2              2-k    Now look at the K^2 - 4. It's a perfect square so it     becomes   (k-2)(k+2)  (Know what I did there?)    (k-2)(k+2)    11k  -------------- *  -----     3k^2          2-k  Multiply the second fraction by -1 to make    (k-2)(k+2)    -11k  -------------- *  -----     3k^2          k-2 (This is going to cancel out with the numerator in the                              top left  Now we have    (1)(k+2)    -11k  -------------- *  -----  Now we multiply across the top to get the top,     3k^2        1       and across the bottom to get the bottom (That's why                             we changed the problem to a multiplication.

Just factor it out.    t^2 -49 is a perfect square. (t-7)(t+7)   t^2+4t-21   will factor out to (t+7)(t-3)  t^2+8t+15  will factor out to  (t+5)(t+3)   t^2-2t-35  will factor out to  (t+5)(t-7)    Now let's put this together as a fraction multiplying a fraction    (t-7)(t+7)             (t+5)(t+3)  -----------     *       --------------  (t-3)(t+7)             (t+5)(t-7)   Now we can cancel a bunch! The                                            (t+7) will cancel in the first                                             fraction, and the (t+5) will                                            cancel out the second. What's left?  (t-7)            (t+3)  -------   *      ____  (t-3)            (t-7)    Now the (t-7) will cancel leaving just    (t+3)  -------  (t-3)         Hope this helps.

Juliet has trusted the nurse with her errand and has even told her about her secret marriage to Romeo. The nurse is obviously not a big a fan of Romeo and the Montagues as Juliet is, especially since when Juliet's parents command her to marry Paris the nurse even advises her to marry Paris and forget Romeo.     Peter also appears to have feelings towards Juliet. For example, when the Capulets discover Juliet "dead", Peter tells the wedding musicians to "play 'Heart's ease'...because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe'." (Act IV scene 5). This shows that he is genuinely saddened by Juliet's apparent "death.    Hope this helps!|`|GvlxK336aa	i don't really get the question. what do you mean by neutral characters?    the nurse is with the capulet family, she breast feed juliet and raised her.    and i'm not really sure about peter, i think he's just a servant for the montague family.

Injury (ie: bomb blast)  Hereditary (genetics, inherited from parents)  Disease (ie: brain tumour)|`|PVVXoQqraa	There are SO MANY possible answers to this question! Did your homework specify whether the hearing loss had to be permanent, or temporary? Just in case, I'll answer both.    Temporary hearing loss is not uncommon. Did you ever to go a concert and have a stuffy, cotton-in-your-ears feeling afterward? Did your ears ring for a while? That's a sympton of a temporary hearing loss caused by the loud music at the concert. We call it a Temporary Threshold Shift, and it usually goes away after about 14 hours. But if that were to happen every day, it could lead to more permanent hearing loss, which we call Noise Induced Hearing Loss. That's why DJ's and musicians need to be careful to protect their hearing.     Permanent hearing loss also has a number of causes. One common cause is the aging process -- as we get older, we lose sensitivity in our hearing, particularly for high-pitched sounds like birds and telephone rings. We call this age-related hearing loss Presbycusis.  Another, less common, source of hearing loss is certain medications. Medication that has the potential to cause hearing loss are called Ototoxic medications, and are rarely prescribed unless other, less toxic drugs, have failed. Hearing loss caused by ototoxic medications can begin rapidly or very slowly, depending on the exact drug and dose schedule, but generally begin in the high frequencies (pitches) first. If a person taking a potentially ototoxic medication has a concern about their hearing, they should speak to their doctor who prescribed the drug. Often the benefit from the drug outweighs the possible risk of hearing loss.

FZKFLTyLaa	That something is amiss with them, mentally.
z4hqJvpaaa	It is strange that your parents would believe that, especially as adults, you'd think they realize that they socialize without attending school.  Most of us do.      I have heard of homeschool groups in Ireland, but sorry I don't know anything specific.      I agree with the advise on reading "The Teenage Liberation Handbook" by Grace Llewelyn.  It can help answer a lot of questions for you and your parents.    Best of luck to you :D|`|WewCtMpzaa	I find it interesting when the kids are requesting homeschooling. It sounds like public school has something going on.    As with homeschooling, the way I heard it, kids are often in public more than kids are. Kids in public schools only socialize among themselves, so they only get a finite level of socialization. Whereas if they spent more time around in public they would have a greater exposure of people.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Start by looking up some youth groups or clubs in your area and tell them that anyone can join those groups. Make sure that you only join or commit to the groups that you are interested in, otherwise it will be very stressful and disasterous (I have done that). Point out to your parents that you do things outside of school, like playing with friends, and that those things won't stop. You will still have friends, but you don't learn very well with a group. At our schools, they allow the kids to sign up and come in just for the special programs or classes they really enjoy as long as they are taking on a full classes schedule in homeschool (that's just the required subjects). We also have certain days where the homeschooled students are allowed on the campus (with a visitors pass) during the lunch/breaks to visit with friends.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	My daughter also tells me that she'd like to be homeschooled, but usually only when things are getting really stressful at school.  Are there things going on at school that are hard for you to deal with? If it is cuz you are being bullied, please be sure to tell your parents. There are definitely some benefits to being homeschooled, but your parents would have to be a part of a homeshooling coop in order to give you enough socialization. You might see if there are any of these coops (where parents get together regularly) in your area.  Be sure to talk things out thoroughly with your parents as to why you want to be homeschooled. Perhaps there are problems in school that can be solved; or perhaps not. Good luck.|`|r18PoGJiaa	I really can't stand it when people say home school children have social skill issues. That is a bunch of bs.  My daughter is home schooled and has tons of friends.   The way the schools are today, I would recommend all parents home school their kids.|`|AA11759162	I have a few ideas. The most successful would be to first arrange to meet with a local home school group and introduce them to your parents to see how they will hit it off.     You must also remember that your parents have to be easily as dedicated as you for this home schooling to work well. You will need to make a portfolio of how you would pass your exams and get accredited for all your work.    It would make sense to look on this problem as a persuasive argument. You need to first research all you can about the topic and think really hard if it is really for you, or if the issues are really elsewhere.     If you have time, look on the internet at other peoples experiences. I have listed in my site the 10 most popular online schools, many of which accept overseas entries.     There is also a service - at least in England - for being taught outside of school - in special state run centres with small groups. This could be a viable alternative to home schooling if your parents don't want to become involved in the lessons.|`|IlndnVyBaa	Okay, show them me as an example    I started homeschooling in 9th grade because the school where I went too was terrible. Think of it this way.    You don't go to school. But still you go to stores to buy stuff, I don't think at all I have a socialization problem after being homeschooled for more than a year. Also try to convince them that kids at your school are bad and smoke and stuff.     Also public school education isn't very educational at all. They waste a lot of time through projects instead of real learning.    Ask them this. Do you become antisocial in the summer time?????? Homeschooling is just like summer time except instead of doing nothing you study.    You don't need a homeschool group|`|Amyrijm2aa	Hey there, New,    I am homeschooled and have been since fifth grade. I am now a junior in highschool and am taking classes in college. A lot of people make the mistake your parents have made: they assume that homeschoolers have no social life and are socially retarded.    That is not the case. In fact, I have more friends through homeschooling than I did when I was in public school. And I have more true friends at that. In public school, people tend to put on facades and act fake around you. In homeschooling, it's difficult to do that. Because we don't see each other every day, we don't get to blow anyone off. I am very socialized "for a homeschooler".    Another benefit to homeschooling is that you will not have to be bombarded with things like sex, boyfriends and girlfriends, popularity or even your own safety. In homeschooling, you can concentrate on your education while still having friends on the side. You also don't have to worry about bomb threats. xD    The deciding factor about homeschooling, really, is whether or not your parents want to put in the time and effort for it. There are programs you can use for your curriculum, like SwitchedOnSchoolhouse, that help guide you in the learning process, but as far as your social life goes- unless you can drive, your parents will have to help get you into homeschool groups and things like that. If you are really interested, I recommend that you do an online search for homeschooling groups in your area. Use Google or Yahoo!'s for the best results.    I am from the USA, though, so I don't know how Ireland does things.    Hope I could help!  ~Raiden|`|zBLIqCyWaa	no offense but you want to be home schooled?  I don't think I would ever want to be home schooled.  Anyway, if you are in band or choir you would be able to go to the school for those activities and get to see your friends.  You could join a club like 4-H.  Or you could be in a sport like Figure skating or horse riding or swimming or soccer or any sport you can think of.  All of those activities would include socializing with your friends.  Then maybe your parents would understand.  Good luck!|`|sZUVFvsqaa	Schools are designed to prevent socialization! Think about it, you're not even allowed to talk to each other during class. The only reason schools are supposedly good for socialization is because there are a lot of people in them, but the fact is whatever socialization does go on in schools is all based around becoming exactly like everyone else (that's what schools are for, after all). I was bullied constantly in school. Definitely not an enlightening experience and now I spend a lot of time trying to get back my confidence that used to come so naturally.    I recommend reading "Teach Your Own" and "Teenage Liberation Handbook" for some great information about schools and socialization.|`|08a714d3e35f7a5fcf99d16c6a42a486aa	There are plenty of ways to get socialization when homeschooled. My kids meet other homeschool kids throught homeschool clubs, they also go to church and volunteer with community organizations. I also sign them up for sports. My kids actually socialize more now than when they were in public school and I can control the types of kids they meet. Instead of just hanging out with random kids around the neighborhood my kids meet other kids with the same interests as them and in a supervised setting.|`|3BrCf1dBaa	I simply do not understand how people can say, "Home-schooled kids don't have socialization skills." I've been home-schooled all my life,   (I'm fifteen now) and I love it!     Think about it this way: Kids who are in public school stay in class all day with people their own age and one adult, therefore they learn: Only talk to people your own age. Kids that are home-schooled, go lots of places with their parents (grocery store, library, etc...) and meet people of ALL ages, therefore they learn: Talk to everybody. Which do you think will be more able to converse with other people, no matter the age?    Parents who home-school their children do not lock them up in the house all day everyday!      Hope I helped! :)|`|srzEvVi0aa	You asked me to respond to this, I'm copying/pasting this from another question:     School is far from real world. Most people who "home" school really "world" school, meaning they are interracting with the "real" world much more than children couped up in a desk for 6-7 hours a day. At school, being segregated by age into classes, often alphabetically, being told what to do, and socialized by the most alpha class member is not real world.

Ann7Jyhoaa	Friendly, I had this really strict teacher for French last year, so I skipped for a month in a row, probably like half the year in total because I was actually so scared of her and she didn't even notice because she was too busy being strict.     I even went into a different class for a couple of weeks and the teacher from it didn't even notice either. Maybe I'm invisible =/    If didn't have the option of running away whenever I didn't like the teacher,  I would co-operate less just as a form of rebelion, trust me, at my school the strict teachers get delt tonnes, bless their souls    =)|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	strict any day of the week.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I learned better from the friendly teachers because they were easier to talk to when I didn't understand something. The more strict teachers did, however, make me feel more comfortable in a classroom with kids who I knew did not behave.|`|600tkYoYaa	As much as I hate saying it, strict teachers. I complain about them a lot, but still like friendly teachers are okay, but the thing is you don't learn as much. Also, I know that if your class is crazy, then you're never going to get anything done, and you won't learn as much as you would with a strict teacher that would take control. Also strict teachers seem to be more organized, and I found that sometimes, they seem to explain things way better than friendly teachers. Friendly teachers are fine if your in kindergarten or grade two, but when you're older, it's not that great. They let you get away with too much, and usually they don't explain things in depth.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	To know when to be strict and when to be friendly is the ideal way to be.|`|yq1WSp8naa	You can drag me to your Schools,.but you can never make me learn!|`|P6r2In1Iaa	Yeah like when they moved me from the solitary desk with the built in ink well and gave us shared tables the distractions were everywhere.   We had to spend most of our time looking for stolen goods from our pencil cases and watch out for the class perverts whilst leaning over for retrieval of said stolen goods. Then you had to try to listen amongst the jokers and clowns.  Its as if learning didn't matter anymore the teachers went soft all of a sudden then the ones that where strict found the most petty things they could think of to put you in line. To chew gum meant you could not learn and had to stand outside.|`|g4nlUfmeaa	Either approach can be effective, there's a lot more to teacher competence to classroom demeanor, and for different personalities will be suited to different teaching methods (as will different students).    Also, they're not necessarily mutually exclusive traits.  A teacher can be strict about enforcing his class rules and policies and yet have a very friendly, helpful attitude.    I haven't had a lot of strict teachers.  My current anthropology professor is pretty strict, but he's also friendly in class (though he was pretty rude to me when I raised a valid concern with him in e-mail).  So far, as far as teaching material, he hasn't distinguished himself as being particularly great or horrible.  I don't particularly like him as a teacher, though, because I think some of his policies are excessively strict -- for example, if you miss one important lab, you take such a hit on your grade that you're pretty much guaranteed an F, and he won't let you make it up unless you a documented excuse.  So if you come down with a bad cold, you either have to come to school all doped up and risk getting your classmates sick, or you have to pay to have a doctor check you out so your illness is documented, and HOPE he accepts that as a valid excuse.    So I think sometimes, teachers who are strict go a little overboard in a way that just produces unnecessary stress and unfairness.  A teacher who is too lax may not push students to do their best and actually try to learn the material, but I'd prefer a teacher who's a little too lax than one who's too strict.  Basically, I prefer teachers who teach well and then evaluate your understanding of the material (through exams or papers) and don't sweat it too much if you miss a couple days, or turn in an assignment a few days late.    My best teacher was pretty friendly in and out of class, an created a semi-informal classroom atmosphere (he was pretty cool with most stuff unless it was genuinely disruptive).  He was very lax in terms of due dates, but he also had high standards for his students -- getting an A on a paper really would require that you pay attention in class and apply all of the lessons that he'd taught you.  To me, that's ideal -- missing a class might hurt your grade, but not because of a ridiculously harsh attendance policy ... but instead because you'd have to attend class to actually (get this!) LEARN THE MATERIAL so you'd be prepared to do well on papers and exams.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	Teachers who are strict in discipline and assignments are in the long run the best.  "Friendly" or "cool" teachers are also good, but students are often abandoned when it comes to teaching them about real life and every student's future part in society.  I remember the names of the strict teachers, but can't recall any of the names of the "cool" ones.|`|u6hZqcUIaa	A strict teacher who is friendly to you after you are done being their student is ideal.|`|EZorC9S1aa	Friendly and strict...these notions are very subjective, and they have to do with the personality of the teacher. I think that what is most important for a teacher is to be competent in the field taught. That is the first criterion, without which you cannot be a good teacher, whatever your personality. And secondly, you must be willing to transmit what you know, because you think that your students should have the chance of receiving the knowledge that you were given. So, once you have those two criteria, the personality counts less. Some friendly teachers are good, some strict ones are good too. A teacher must find a balance between the two: be friendly but not lax, be strict and rigorous, but not rigid and narrow-minded.|`|3acdeb00c5e3b78aa35777fb098bdcc6aa	One who dares to be both.|`|ANnv9gRjaa	A teacher who is warm and caring, who is not necessarily strict but very clear about boundaries.|`|pnZssBg9aa	A friendly teacher.

Set up  2 like a fraction, too!    8       (x +5)(10)0.5)   ---- =  --------           (since this altitude is 5 more it is      x+5  5         x (10)(0.5)      (x is the height of the smaller triangle)    Now cross multiply   8x  = 5x + 25 Subtract 5x from both sides    3x =   25; divide by 3 ; x= 8.3 for one altitude and x + 5 or 13.3 for the other.  Don't get alarmed when these problems dont always work out to an integer value. Alwsys plug your answer back into the original to check your answer, though!     3   Set up same way      X + 500       7                                       ------------  =  ----                                            X            5    Hope this helps.
AA11124874	What do you mean by sps? Seattle Public Schools? Springfield Public Schools? The Society of Physics Students? (LOL).    If you are asking about the curriculum package called "Everyday Math," it was probably adopted the way any other curriculum package gets adopted.    Right now my school is using it, and I think it is one of the worst programs ever invented for regular ed. It confuses the heck out of most of the kids, does NOT align to state standards and benchmarks, and does not adapt to different student learning needs and styles. It also expects 6 year olds to have full ability in abstract reasoning skills.    It supposedly was designed by taking special education math strategies and "spiraling" (where you circle around through a set of skills, doing something a little more difficult each time you come back to each skill). However, in special education, we don't teach ALL the methods to every kid...we hunt through the different methods to find what works best for each kid, and only teach that kid one or two ways of finding the answers based on what works best for him/her. The variety of methods are for the teacher's toolkit, not for each individual child to know all of them. Also, the "spiral" is circled through once every couple of months, to taking up to a full year for one circle in special education. Once again, this speed is based on the student's needs, not a program's set packaging.    Everyday Math attempts to teach EVERY method of solving problems to ALL the students, and cycles through the "spiral" every two weeks to a month. It is too fast, and doesn't allow kids the time to build confidence and mastery in a particular skill.    It IS a good program for students gifted in math, and I WOULD recommend it for gifted Enrichment programs. However, when used, it should be with 1:1 or small-group guidance to ensure that the child doesn't focus on the paperwork rather than the thought process.
AA10839140	your report card grades have already been recorded on your school transcript, there is no way of getting out of it. anyone who has doubt about your grade can just refer to your transcript for the truth. you will probably be held back no matter what you try to do to cover it up. try seeing if there are summer school classes that you can take to bring your grade up then maybe you can go on instead of being held back.  (oh and ranz, your answer is very inappropriate)|`|AA11124874	You have to look at why you got those "F's."     If you had major life changes this grading period resulting in lots of 0's, but did ok on the stuff you did turn in, you may be able to get "only turned-in assignments" counted toward your grade and have your grades changed on your transcript. However, you will have to have documentation (death certificate, medical letters from your doctor, a divorce decree, etc.) to show what was seriously messing up your life, and will have to do some explaining about why you didn't bring it to the school's attention earlier.    If you have those "F's" because either you just didn't turn in your work, or you were having trouble understanding the material, then you need to go to summer school or retake those classes next semester. You may want to also ask for a tutor.|`|AA11850769	First of all, what grade are you in?  What subject did you get the 3 F's in?  Why do you think you got the F's?

Thanks.....|`|AA11801444	If by "change it" you mean take summer school to make up the classwork, then, yes.  Do it.  Check with your school for courses offered, dates, and limits to what you can take.  You might have to take community college classes if your school isn't offering a class you need to make up, but check with your school first.  They may not accept all classes.  I would suggest you work hard this summer to make up what you can and get in the habit of studying hard so you don't find yourself in this situation again.  Make sure you take advantage of all the resources at school, including teachers, guidance counselors, tutors, librarians,.....and don't forget your parents.

3bahzW9Uaa	There is an Assessment Plan that is presented to the parents for their approval. Parents must sign this plan before assessments are done. The plan must state what tests will be done and by who.  If you look at this form, you can see the name of the assessments and look them up online.   Parents may participate in the form of answering questionaires sent home, which should be done if assessing for ADHD.  Parents are not present at the school for testing.  I highly encourage you to request copies of all reports and test results at least 5 days prior to the meeting to go over these results.

Thus, there might be slight differences, however, generally speaking the procedures are the same around the country because there are federal laws and intiatives mandating special education.    The test to qualify a child for an IEP is called a "Mutlifactored Evaluation" (MFE) and is conducted by a school psychologist. The evaluation lasts a couple of hours and is given over the course of a few days (if the child loses attention, the school psychologists may choose to the break the tests into smaller chunks for the child (so it will take longer to conduct).    No, a parent cannot be present during the tests for a variety of reasons: (1) The presence of a third party (especially someone the child has a close relationship with) can significantly skew the results (2) The content of certain portions of the tests are highly confidential. For example, once you are exposed to certain IQ tests, you can never take the test again because the results will be invalid. If people know what to expect when taking an IQ test, the results will be skewed. The less people within the population exposed to these tests, the better.    Also, you should know that schools must take the child through an "Intervention Process" before conducting an MFE for the child. Some schools may be behind the times, but this is the process they are supposed to follow.     There is a national intiative called "Response to Intervention" that says we cannot qualify a child for special education services without attempting to remedy the problem through individualized, research-based intervention. This is because too many kids were being identified as "Special Needs," when probably, they were not.    The child's school probably has a team of teachers and educators (often called the "Intervention Assistance Team") that meets with the  parent to brainstorm and begin implementing interventions that address the needs of the child. The hope is that the interventions will remedy the problem. If, over time, the problem is not improving with intervention as the team would hope/expect, then the team may decide to do an MFE.    Just a heads up, it is rare that children get IEP's for ADHD. Certainly they can (in, Ohio, they can qualify as "Other Health Impaired") and receive services. However, this only happens in more severe cases and there must be documentation (insufficient response to intervention, low academic achievement, etc.) that the ADHD has caused a significant negative impact on the child's academics.    Also, just another heads up, a child who is 7 years old is also pretty young to qualify for an IEP by way of ADHD. Certainly, it can happen if the case is severe, though. Because the developmental span for kids when they are younger is much greater (they can mature and develop out of behaviors), it is less common for a child to qualify for services.     I don't mean to discourage you, just want to prepare you that the process for qualifying children for IEP's has changed quite a bit in the last few years. Parents used to be able to walk into a school and demand an MFE. This is no longer the case.    Hope this helps. Best wishes!
rpRzeGN5aa	Well...so many parts of Africa are really messed up.  In Zimbabwe, the government is reall corrupt. Robert Mugabe has done things that have turned out to be really bad. One was that he expropriated thousands of white-owned farms, handing them back over to the black Africans; however, many of these people didn't know how to run a farm, and agriculture suffered a lot--as did the economy. He triggered hyperinflation as well. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Muga...

A cline is a gradual change in a character or feature across the distributional range of a species or population, usually correlated with an environmental or geographic transition. In biology, any gradual change in a particular characteristic of a population of organisms from one end of the geographical range of the population to the other. Gradients of characteristics usually accompany, and are responses to, environmental gradients; for example, a mountain range features gradients from top to bottom such as a temperature gradient (colder to warmer) and a humidity gradient (wetter to drier). http://www.answers.com/topic/cline
DuvR2fzvaa	Peter Mueller from the Phoenix Coyotes. Hockey players are highly influential characters. They're tough and hard working to say the least. He's really inspirational because of his struggle with his induction into the NHL. He worked so hard to prove to Wayne Gretzky, head coach of the Coyotes, that he would be an asset to the team. Gretzky didn't send Mueller back down to the WHL because he strived for success by scoring his first NHL goal within the first three games of the season and recording a hat trick less than a month into a season; this was possibly faster than any other NHL rookie.

Speak to your school counselor about directing your current course of study to prep you for college.  In California, it was called "math-science emphasis".  Also ask about grants and scholarships.    Your marks (grades) are important.  Study (read) literature on your own to improve your vocabulary, grammar and punctuation.  The Junior SAT (a test taken in your junior year to prepare you for the SAT test in your senior year) is a good prep tool for the SAT test.  SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) is one of the main tools colleges and universities use in addition to your overall grade point average, to determine who to admit.

AA11124874	I am a special education teacher, and also the mother of a child with special needs (learning disabilities, ADHD, OCD, and a bunch of other diagnoses).    Mom to mom.... don't freak about this.    You hit the nail on the head when you noted that HE is not phased by the idea of doing kindergarten again.    The BEST time for repeating grades is in Kindergarten and/or 1st grade.  This allows him to get a good foundation of those basic skills, rather than falling farther and farther behind while being presented work of greater and greater difficulty.    Even at higher grades, if he did the repeating thing early on, most kids won't notice that he's that much older than them. However, bullies will be bullies, and they find something to pick on with everybody... just report them and the school should deal with it.    When he is 30 years old, nobody will care if he graduated at 18, 19, or even 21! All they'll care about is whether he has a high school diploma or not. If he goes to college...the college won't care what age he got the high school diploma, either!    You said he is in a private school. Is he getting speech therapy for his apraxia? Is his teacher trained in special education methods? You do know that the public schools will still provide speech therapy and special educator resource services for children in private school (required by law).      If this private school he's attending didn't get you and him linked to the services he needs, if their teachers do not have special education training... I would strongly recommend that you seek a different school for him. With his learning differences, he really needs teachers highly trained in instruction methods for kids with language disabilities and ADHD, as well as speech therapy. How's his handwriting? Have they discussed Occupational Therapy for him?     Two years retention is really the most he should ever have. In public school, especially in special education, retention is rare and usually only involves repeating kindergarten once and/or 1st grade once. Additional instruction needs are taken care of through pull-out special education with specialists trained in helping students with learning differences build their learning skills.    The earlier the correct intervention, the better off he will be in the long run.     If you want to keep him out of public schools for faith reasons, you may need to look at moving to a place where there is a Christian private special education school.  If you can't afford to move, you may have to trust that your and your church's instruction of faith will be enough to compensate for the concerns you have with public schools, and send him to the special education teachers and therapists that can give him the academic help he needs.

Just continue instilling confidence and high self esteem in him and he will be just fine...|`|AA10906330	Have they done any testing for any learning disabilities? My first grader was below grade level when he started first grade. He was reading at a level 1, thats kindergarten level. Then, a couple of weeks ago, they did an IEP meeting and are now evaluating him for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). ADHD is when children have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. At the same time, they are very hyper. This could be keeping him from learning. But the teachers won't tell you that they think the child should be evaluated. You have to recommend it yourself. If they say no or that they cant, you should find out from the school district about getting an intra-district transfer. They have to be willing to test your son. Go to www.greatschools.net and find out what your schools API scores are. If they aren't very high, then there is a possiblility that they might not have all the funding to try to help your child out.     My first grader has been in a reading recovery program, and he is now reading at a level 13. He's still not at grade level, but he was enough to pass to the 2nd grade. He just turned 7. Keep your head up. If you need anymore advice, email me at julisa_aje@yahoo.com.    Everything will be ok. :-)|`|b598ad84865147cac05d4e8e109cd122aa	Hi,  I have taught kindergarten for 10 years and imagine that this must have been a difficult decision for both your family and the teacher.  Making the decision to retain a student is never easy. Do you know what type of challenges your son faced during the course of the school year? Were there any summer school options? Are there other kindergarten classrooms in your son's school (so that your son would at least change classrooms)? Your son must have started kindergarten at a later age (which can be offered as an explanation if the age issue becomes a problem later on).  If the school is large, there may not be the issue of teasing at this age-although, I would still voice my concerns to the teacher.  I would also ask for a list of skills to work on over the summer and throughout the following year so that this next year is more successful for him.  Hope this helps!|`|895e049035892a484e590e7b1b9b46a8aa	I took two years of kindergarten also.  I was one day shy of being 19 when I graduated.  Don't worry about the teasing it doesn't last too long.

Many historians have traced the causes of World War II to problems left unsolved by World War I (1914-1918). World War I and the treaties that ended it also created new political and economic problems. Forceful leaders in several countries took advantage of these problems to seize power. The desire of dictators in Germany, Italy, and Japan to conquer additional territory brought them into conflict with the democratic nations.       that really isn't that great...  let me think of another one...  oh...  here:      War is one of the most tragic things in our world today. It is even sadder that usually it comes around at least once in our lifetime. In the 20th century alone we have already had two huge wars.

You'll want to make payments on it all along though so you can actually get caught up at some point and not have to borrow at the beginning of each term.    You may also be able to arrange an unsubsidized loan through the school.  Ask the Financial Aid folks what's available; they'll know since they're involved with all financial aid anyway.    And - while you're in School Mode, find and attend a Dave Ramsey "Financial Peace University" course.  Bad credit is almost always a sign you lack skills for managing money.

You could begin by either talking to someone who specializes in children's mental health, or a lawyer -- either way, both of those types would end up  being involved.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	I think it is definitely time for some evaluation.  If your son is showing signs in development, then this is the time to step in.  He will show more progress in his learning and his behavior, the earlier you get started.  Your wife is probably feeling very intimidated by your child's behavior.  She is afraid that people are going to blame her for it, whether she is at fault or not.  Children can have many disorders that cause behaviorial issues that are not related to abuse.  Any mom would be intimidated by that.  I would first do some research about his specific behaviors. I would chart the behaviors that you see and if you can relate them to what happened prior to the outburst.  For instance, he banged his head on the wall because he didn't get cookies.  The more information you can give a doctor, the more help they can be.  Then I would sit down and talk to her.  Reassure her that you are in this together and that this is not a blame her situation.  Many parents who have children with behaviorial disorders end up having DYFS called on them.  It doesn't mean they are abusive.  If she refuses to co-operate after this, then I would petition the court for the right to have him seen.  This might bring custody issues into the forefront.  Your son needs help now, not later.  This is not a decision to be made by how tempermental your wife is.    You did call the young lady your wife, so is there a custody agreement?  If you are not divorced and there is no custody agreement, you can take him to a doctor without her permission.  You are the father and you have the right to be concerned about your son.  Good luck.    Another thought:  In regards to the children that I work with, the more supportive the parent is, the more successful the child is.  You cannot sit back and wait for the child's doctor to notice the delays.  You cannot wait for a pre-school teacher to ask for testing.  If the mother does not want to take an aggressive approach or acknowledge that there is an issue, you have to be the strong parent and step in.  I believe that you need to try to work with your wife, but be willing to go over her head if she does not cooperate in the best interests of the child.  After all, the best thing that could happen with an evaluation, is that the doctor will tell you everything is okay.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	I'm reminded of Barney from "The Simpsons."  Homer and Barney are talking in a bar:    Homer: I'm attracted to another woman! What am I going to do?    Barney: Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman and you'll realize you have nothing in common.    Homer: Barney, that is so insightfuI. How did you come up with that?    Barney: It was on one of these bar napkins.     __________  I'll say this to you, as a parent, but caution you to phrase it more delicately.  It is hard, but many girls in high school or early college (at least the type we can easily get infatuated with) often don't care to know people very well.  That makes it especially more difficult when a person has autism because it does have an impact on social skills.      I wouldn't suggest trying to pull him away from the girl right off the bat because that just might backfire.  What I would do is helping him try to focus on forming his own social life.  He needs to find what he is interested in and surround himself with people who have the same interests.  If it's computers, he should join a computer club.  If it's building things, maybe he can sign up for some sort of shop class (either in or outside of school).  Readily get him involved in his interests and get him interested in doing things, especially if that involves a group who share the same interests.    People with Autism cannot easily relate to others who do not have the same interests.  But if he finds a group of people that like the same quirky things he is interested in, chances are they're readily accept him because he likely has a very focused talent in that area.  Once he has a group of friends, the infatuation with the other girl will start to dwindle and he might even find someone better for him and more suited for him.|`|9q7UPZIfaa	He will be stuck on her until you expose him to other people, other organizations or activities.

But don't push him to make new friends.  My son has autism, too, and that's one thing that I have diffenately learned is that they can't be pushed to do something they don't want to do.  It actually makes it worse.      Has this particular girl told him about this?  Maybe if she and her fiance sit with him (maybe with you also) and try to explain things, maybe he'll start to get it.  I know that sometimes it takes a while for them to "get" things, so give him time.  Also, be prepared for a really broken heart.

AA11424684	Cowards   This idea of a marginal place--inside the gate of hell but before the river Acheron--for souls neither good enough for heaven nor evil enough for hell proper is a product of Dante's imagination, pure and simple. Possible theological justification for Dante's invention may be found in Apocalypse (Revelation) 3:16: "But because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth." Included among these cowardly souls--also known as fence-sitters, wafflers, opportunists, and neutrals--are the angels who refused to choose between God and Lucifer. What does this original idea say about Dante's view of human behavior and its relation to the afterlife? What might Dante's conception of this region imply about hell proper and its eternal inhabitants?     Gate of Hell   It is not until the beginning of canto 3 that Dante finally enters hell-- at least its outer region--by passing through a gateway. The inscription above this gate--ending with the famous warning to "abandon all hope"-- establishes Dante's hell as a creation not of evil and the devil but rather of his Christian God, here expressed in terms of the Trinity: Father (Divine Power), Son (Highest Wisdom), and Holy Spirit (Primal Love).     Charon   In the classical underworld (Hades), which Dante knew best from book 6 of Virgil's Aeneid, Charon is the pilot of a boat that transports shades of the dead--newly arrived from the world above--across the waters into the lower world. Like Virgil's Charon (Aen. 6.298-304; 384-416), Dante's ferryman is an irascible old man--with white hairs and fiery eyes-- who at first objects to taking a living man (Aeneas, Dante) on his boat. In each case, the protagonist's guide--the Sybil for Aeneas, Virgil for Dante--provides the proper credentials for gaining passage on Charon's boat.      Terza Rima   This is the rhyme scheme that Dante invents for the 14,233 lines of his poem. Literally translated as "third rhyme," this pattern means that the middle verse of a given tercet (a group of three lines) rhymes with the first and third verses of the next tercet. For example, in the verses of Inferno 3 describing the gate of hell, dolore (2) rhymes with fattore (4) and amore (6), podestate (5) rhymes with create (7) and intrate (9), and so on. Terza rima can thus be expressed with the following formula: aba bcb cdc ded . . . xyx yzyz. A mathematical consequence of this pattern is that the number of lines in any given canto is always a multiple of three with one left over.      Anaphora   Dante occasionally repeats a word or phrase at the beginning of successive verses or tercets (units of three verses) to drive home a point. Inferno 3 opens with a striking example of this poetic device (called anaphora): Dante begins the first three verses containing the words written above the gate of hell with the phrase Per me si va . . . ("Through me one goes . . ."). How does this use of anaphora contribute to the overall tone and meaning of the inscription (Inf. 3.1-9) and to the reaction of Dante and Virgil to the ominous words (Inf. 3.10-18)?      "Great Refusal"   From among the cowardly fence-sitters, Dante singles out only the shade of one who made "the great refusal" (Inf. 3.60). In fact, he says that it was the sight of this one shade--unnamed yet evidently well known--that confirmed for him the nature of all the souls in this region. The most likely candidate for this figure is Pope Celestine V. His refusal to perform the duties required of the pope (he abdicated five months after his election in July 1294) allowed Benedetto Caetani to become Pope Boniface VIII, the man who proved to be Dante's most reviled theological, political, and personal enemy. An alternative candidate is Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who refused to pass judgment on Jesus. Why does Dante refuse to name any of the shades--including the notorious one--in this particular region?      Acheron   This is the first of the rivers and marshes of Virgil's underworld in the Aeneid that Dante includes in his topography of hell. Whereas Virgil makes no clear distinction between the locations and functions of these bodies of water (Charon seems to guard them all), Dante's infernal rivers are more sharply drawn. Here the Acheron functions as a boundary separating the cowardly neutrals from the souls in the circles of hell proper. Charon ferries these shades across the river. This attention to detail reflects Dante's desire to underscore the reality of hell and the protagonist's journey through it.|`|AA11124874	The circles of Hell (starting with Limbo) move gradually from acts of ingorant offence to conscious acts of impulse to premeditated betrayal.

AA11124874	At age 13, your body is only starting to develop. Sex can damage it horribly. Pregnancy damages it even worse. If, even worse, you end up with an STD, it can do things to a body that is still developing that is much more awful than to a fully-grown body.    Also, your brain is not fully developed yet (hard to hear when you're a teenager, but true). Brain development is not complete until in a person's early 20's. You are able to reason about some things like an adult, but not everything. That is why you can't vote yet, drive a car, etc. After the "sex" moment passes, and the relationship isn't really there (very few guys "stay around" for very long and develop relationships with teens), and you are all alone and now you also have changed forever... it hurts not only your body but your heart, big time!    A better way to think about that is to see it as "hey, if I'm this smart now, just wait until I'm 25!!!"    But it also means that you don't understand the full issues surrounding sex, relationships, and life decisions. Having sex is a life decision, not a "let's just do it" thing. When done, as a fully-grown adult, with someone you are committed to for life, it is an incredible experience.  It is more than just the physical sensations, and is magical.     Remember, the whole reason the urge to mate is there, is because that's how we make babies. For humans, baby-making isn't just the act of mating, however. It is establishing a lifelong relationship to provide support for the offspring, too. You have urges not only for the act of sex, but also for that long-term relationship. If you don't have the lifetime committment, you will hurt, bad, in the long run.    When done as a teenager, it can ruin your life... as in the entire next 60 years!      Wait. It is worth it to wait.... and the fully-grown adult you will understand the "why" of waiting, and be so glad you did.|`|AA11959383	Dear You Good Mamma:    This question is so irrelevant. If you are 13 you are not even a woman, you are a child, mentally... no matter what your physical status is. And if you are just asking for trouble if you have sex at that young age... one of the results can be an unwanted pregnancy.    If you are 18, the same thing applies but at least you will be more conscious of what you are doing.    Legally, when you are 13 and you live under your parent's rules, they can take the baby way and adopt him or her... you are not mature enough to take care of a child. Or, if you are 18, you are legally responsible for a child but you might not be economically better than a 13 year old.    Do you want my advice: Don't do it! Boys are not worth all that trouble. Be a kid, enjoy life. Don't rush it!    To me, the best time to have sex is when you are in love, when you know that the person you are going to bed with is the person who will marry you, who will stay with you forever. .|`|AA11896896	it's all about maturity.

AA11124874	Standardized testing is a waste of time.    If students were not allowed to pass to the next grade level unless they had a "B" (80%) rather than a "D" (60%) -- after the second retention the child would automatically be screened for special education supports, a portfolio was kept for each student showing this growth, the small unit tests used by teachers anyway to really chart progress and benchmark mastery were included in those portfolios, and the fees currently spent on standardized tests were used instead for random portfolio auditors..... We'd have the quality of education we want without taking a month out of instruction to sit and take a test that teachers can't use data from anyway because it takes the state so long to score it.    Standardized testing is in place because the companies who make the tests, and want to make lots of money selling them, lobby hard to ensure that standardized testing is viewed as the only way to ensure accountability (what a lie!).     Also, there is an agenda by the Bush administration to attempt to cut Education out of the Federal budget, using teachers as scapegoats, rather than being brave enough to face the drop in popularity caused by saying that Education is not a Constitutional mandate at the Federal level, and Federal programming is therefore optional and removable. Standardized testing, made difficult enough, with the impossible and ridiculous demands made by NCLB such as schools with poor attendance being penalized even though the parents are the ones who control attendance and not the school, ensures that the general population is seeing teachers as failures, rather getting upset at the politicians who cooked this whole thing up.|`|AA11525919	I agree 100% with the last answer!    States punish the children by having them go over and over boring material to try and pass these tests which are biased against minorities anyways.  Then, they punish the teachers by telling them they are failures as teachers because the students didn't pass...or they didn't receive "commended" scores!    It's all about money, power, prestige, and scapegoats.    Someone please get Bush out of office, and the whole world will be a much better place...and American's can take our heads out of the paper bags!|`|AA11315746	absolutely not!!!!  if a child cannot handle the work in say 3rd grade, yet gets promoted to 4th just because of some, ignorant law; what makes anybody think that a child that couldn't do 3rd grade work will be able to handle the tougher 4th grade work?    Here in Texas, at least, 1/2 of the school year is spent teaching to the TAKS (Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) Test; ignoring the other basics that are not tested, such as history, grammar, sentence structure, science, etc.  This is done so that the school districts can get more money from the State since their state funds are driven by the number of students who pass the TAKS.    In my opinion, if they went back to the way school was taught when I was in school, each child would be more capable of passing any standardize test they were given AND have a good basic knowledge of the things that are important to them when they get out into the working world.

AA12235964	MBA generally is i finishing degree ie a  polishing one  in many countries. People in Us and other countries do Mba to improve in the business skills they already have so that they may seek a raise or qualify for some new post  that is the reason the universities that give you degrees wish you have a work experience with your application (colleges do not offer degree)because they do not offer any kind of co-Op or work experience with the course study as generally it happens in india that an MBA gets a summer traning with a company.There fore it is really hard to get a job with out any work experience after you have the degree unless you do it from some institute that gives you placement gurantee....THINK AGAIN before you choose MBA rather go for a professional study in you sector...

ec3e79358743ba78280ec949576c97b5aa	Humans as animals teach our young the skills necessary to survive.  Human society has evolved to where hunting and gathering are replaced by reading, writing, and arithmetic.  Just as hunting and gathering are a burden, so is learning the 3 R's.  The contrapositive to your statement would be "Is not having an education a burden on young children?"  The answer is yes.  But which burden is better-to have education or not to have education?    To respond to the comment:    > I too am starting to wonder if we are giving our kids (especially  > 5-8 year olds) so much school work that they aren't getting to   > be kids. And don't get my started on the weight of those  > backpacks.    My experience of children's minds are that they get bored easily.  We either fill up their bored minds with lessons and activities that we plan for them or they search their own ways to fill them.  Kids usually fill up their minds with less constructive activities like video games or finding what troubles they can get away with (which is a natural instinct for searching the limits of their environment).|`|26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	Chill out, people... this poster's first language might not be English.

But my concern goes farther than that - I see SOOOOOO many children in that age group who have a schedule to rival a corporate executive's.

Young lions that wander from the pride are killed by hyenas. Young wolves that fail to learn pack hunting techniques end up as lone wolves, hungry and isolated.

E sono fermamente convinto che non passa a meno di non cambiare visione del rapporto che si ha con l'oggetto della nostra gelosia. Restringendo il discorso alla coppia non c' pi gelosia nel momento in cui ci si rende conto di amare e di essere amati veramente. Chi ama veramente non cerca altre soluzioni di sorta ma trova tutti gli universi che gli sono necessari nella persona amata e se la persona amata ricambia questo amore in ugual misura la gelosia non ha pi ragione di essere e perde di colpo significato.

Questi due sentimenti, scusatemi,sono tipici delle persone con poco carattere. L'indifferenza e il miglior disprezzo in assoluto. Se una persona non ci piace o ci ha fatto qualcosa, va perdonata e poi ignorata se non vogliamo avere piu niente a che fare con lei. Ma l'energia che spreco per l'odio e la vendetta la metto in atto per qualcosa di piu proficuo e la indirizzo per cose piu positive.

It's not the easy issue you'd think, especially if you're trying to examine both sides of the issue. The media treats global warming like it's just a fact, while in reality global warming is a theory, one with many facets and holes. I'm not saying that it's not correct, but there are many unanswered questions.

AA12208409	Obviously you have a problem differentiating between the R and L sounds of English. I would suggest making a poem or other little saying up to help you remember the words that have Rs and the words that have Ls, maybe use Left and Right to help you. Here are some I just made up:    It's Right to feel pRessure when all that's Left is pLeasure.    It's Right to sit on the gRass, but sit in the wrong place and you'd be Left with gLass.     It's Right to make a coRRection, but not if you Left your coLLection at home.    It's Right to fRy Rice, but you'd feel Left out if you tried to fLy Lice.      You can also look at the shape of the letters, and try to come up with some way of remembering the difference, for instance grass bends like R, but glass is sharp and straight like L; Pressure pushes down, like the last part of R, and so forth... practice makes it easier, too.     It's also easier to hear the difference if you regularly listen carefully to a lot of spoken English. I would assume your native language is an Asian one, as very few Asian languages and dialects differentiate between L and R. These sounds, called liquid phonemes in linguistic terms, are made quite similarly in the mouth, and practicing making them can help your mouth and tongue learn how to get into the right positions to say them clearly, as well as help your ears learn to hear the difference better. The links below contain some L and R words you might like to practice saying.  Good luck!|`|aac9c4c694c5a7045e42a90ea8bedd9baa	no i dont think so    maybe look em up in the dictonary|`|84ee595d7dbb0b7345a4ad064748d230aa	I think a better way to differentiate them would be learning how to pronounce them correctly.

732a2d3ee2a21e48e8a30ce7cd77420eaa	I assume you mean Bumpkin:  Yokels, also called bumpkins, are unsophisticated country people. In England yokels are traditionally depicted as wearing the old West Country farmhand's dress of straw hat and white smock, chewing a piece of straw and carrying a pitchfork or rake. The Wurzels cheerfully play on this stereotype in their Scrumpy and Western music. Yokels can also come from other parts of Britain such as Yorkshire or Norfolk. English yokels speak a country dialect from some part of England. [1] Variations can involve the straw hat with baggy trousers or a large untidy weatherproof hat not of straw.    Yokels are also depicted as talking about bucolic topics like cows, sheep, fields, crops and buxom wenches to the exclusion of all else.    The word may derive either from a comic mispronunciation of the word 'local', from a dialect word 'yokel' meaning 'woodpecker' or from the Somerset word 'yogel' meaning 'owl', owls being traditionally seen as stupid in Somerset.    In fiction, such yokels may be depicted as gullible and easily conned. Conversely, they may be viewed as straightforward and simplistic, and therefore seeing through sophisticated pretenses.    The development of television brought many previously isolated communities into mainstream British culture in the 1950s and 1960s. The Internet continues this integration, further eroding the town/country divide. In the 21st century British country folk are less frequently seen as yokels.    According to Apalon Co., Ltd.'s Bumpkin Stereotype Chart, differences between different yokel stereotype groups are greatly due to changes in environment, for instance - Hillbilly (alpine), Redneck (Semi-Deciduous Forest), Hayseed (Grassland), Backwoodsman (Deciduous Forest), Bayou Bumpkin (Swamp/Everglade), Desert Rat (Desert/Chaparral), Jack Tar "Jack Fool" (Aquatic), and Hoser (Tundra/Taiga.) However this is not always the case, as with Hobo (rural) and Swindler the both generally nomadic.    In the United States yokel has a similar meaning to Hillbilly or country bumpkin.    Bumpkin (capital B) can also be an abbreviate of Bumpasskin (of or relating to Bumpass, Virginia.)    If not here is a Blumkin:    Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin (Russian:   ; 1898  3 November 1929) was a Left Socialist-Revolutionary, assassin, Bolshevik, Checka agent, GPU spy, Trotskyist, and adventurer.    He was born into a Jewish family, was orphaned early in his life, and was raised in Odessa. In 1914 he joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.    After the October Revolution, in 1917 he became head of the Cheka's counter-espionage department working for Felix Dzerzhinsky. During the Red Terror, Blumkin was known for his brutality. The writer Isaiah Berlin recounts the following story about the poet Osip Mandelstam: One evening early in the Revolution he was sitting in a cafe and there was the notorious Socialist Revolutionary terrorist Blumkin at that time an official of the Cheka drunkenly copying the names of men and women to be executed on to blank forms already signed by the head of the secret police. Mandelstam suddenly threw himself at him, seized the lists, tore them to pieces before the stupefied onlookers, then ran out and disappeared. On this occasion he was saved by Trotsky's sister.    Politically Blumkin remained a Left Socialist-Revolutionary. This party was opposed to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, oppression of the peasants, and the German possession of the Ukraine. Blumkin was ordered by the executive committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary party to assassinate Wilhelm Mirbach, the German Ambassador to Russia; they hoped by this action to incite a war with Germany. This event was timed to occur at the opening of the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. On the afternoon of 6 July 1918, Blumkin  along with an aide, Nikolai Andreyev  went to the residence of the German Ambassador on Denezhny Lane. Blumkin gained entrance to the embassy by presenting forged documents. When Mirbach entered the drawing room, Blumkin pulled a gun from his case and shot the ambassador point blank, killing him. This provoked an armed insurrection in Moscow, sometimes called the Third Russian Revolution, which was quickly quelled by the Red Guard. The members of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries at the Bolshoi Theater were arrested and their party was forcibly suppressed. Blumkin, however, escaped and went into hiding.    Dzerzhinsky pardoned Blumkin and employed him once again as a Cheka Agent. In the spring of 1920 Blumkin was sent to the Iranian province of Gilan, on the Caspian Sea, where the Forest Party under the leadership of Mirza Koochak Khan had established a secessionist government called the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. On 30 May 1920 Blumkin, with his penchant for intrigue, fomented a coup d'etat which drove Koochak Khan and his party from power and replaced them with the bolshevik controlled Iranian Communist Party. The new government, nominally headed by Kuchak Khan's second-in-command, Ehsanollah Khan, was dominated by the Russian Commissar, Abukov. He commenced a series of radical reforms which included the closing of mosques, extorting money from the rich, and forcing the populace to wear the hammer and sickle ensignia. In August 1920 Blumkin was back in Petrograd where he was entrusted with the command of an armored train that conveyed Zinoviev, Karl Radek, Bla Kun, and John Silas Reed from the Second Congress of the Communist International [1] to the Congress of Oppressed Nationalities in Baku[2]. Their journey took them through parts of Western Russia where the Civil War still lingered. At Baku the delegates enacted the proposal of Zinoviev, Head of the Comintern, which called upon the bolsheviks to support the uprisings of native peoples fro|`|AA11673580	Blumpkin is a name, such as Rose Blumkin|`|b600ad076fb3629871be8e7bdd726a5aaa	It's a blue pumpkin.|`|fce20da2208b36dcfe0d2d366c62f3a4aa	its a peach with a slug that lives near the pip or stone cos when you bite it you say blumkin hell what is this?|`|185685b627e12d1a5f453c7796d434c5aa	if you have to ask then you're not old enough to know.|`|4c2ee8fa6b898136a163694b2638efddaa	An evil pumpkin.

Das kommt daher dass in der Geschichte der Krankenpflege fast ausschliesslich Frauen in Pflegeberufen t?tig waren. Oftmals waren es Ordensschwestern ("Nonnen") die diesen Beruf ausübten. <br>  <br>  Lange hat sich dadurch das Wort Krankenschwester gehalten. Erst in der "neueren" Zeit hat sich die Bezeichnung Pflegepersonal, Pfleger/Pflegerin etc. durchgesetzt. <br>  <br>  Bei Nachtschwester bezieht sich das Nacht natürlich auf die Dienstzeit (Nachtdienst). Entweder fand es der Pfleger lustig sich als Schwester zu bezeichnen oder er hat einfach nur den "veralteten" Begriff verwendet. <br>  <br>  Heutzutage wird oftmals über den Begriff Krankenschwester sich lustig gemacht, gerade aus dem Grund dass m?nnliche Pfleger weit verbreitet sind.|`|F6elcRnmaa	Da würde ich mir keine gro?en Sorgen machen, wenn die "Nachtschwester" zum Personal geh?rt hat.

AA11124874	What do you think they feel?    By the way... dropping out of school is not the same as dying young.    I never got my high school diploma (although if I could go back in time I'd whap myself repeatedly with a large frying pan to get across my point that I should stay in and finish... and save lots of time and trouble for myself later)...I was actually pretty suicidal and almost took my own life several times (thank G-d, the Fates, and all the stars in heaven that I never actually went through with it)...  and now have a Master's Degree and a career, and I'm almost 40 years old... still breathing!    However, teachers also learn that, to maintain their own sanity, they MUST be able to "let go" of their students. Once a student is out of their classroom, they must let go of their heart or emotionally "bleed" because of all the awful choices many young people make.  They hear of a young person who has failed (death, prison, etc.) in spite of all the people who were available to help them (teachers, counselors, etc.), weep for the loss, and then the teacher MUST turn their back on it all and get on with their life.  Or they quit teaching.    And the students who do accept the guidance given them by teachers and other adults around them, and who turn themselves into productive members of society, make it all worth while.    And yes, there was a teacher or two who were instrumental in my not committing suicide as a young person. They both gave me "space," (excused and/extended deadlines), and were always talking to me every day about how I felt, trying to find goals and make plans, etc.     However, in the end, it was MY life and MY choices that have given me a career, a beautiful family (married 16 years with 2 kids), friends, and a real life.  I did go through a decade of medication and counselling to get where I am today... and I'M the one who sought out the help. Nobody forced me to do it.     Nobody will force you, either, to get real help or to do the things that will make a good life for your future. However, if you ask the right people, the help is there.     And it is worth it to live.|`|592b837688ec9e4110f33c84249fbcc6aa	With all the things a teacher has to do to keep up with their classes, they seldom think about ex-students who drop out. But they do think of ex-students who go on to do well.|`|b3a925850da70cb6f64fa8ec7c08e357aa	~ Some are sad.  Some don't care.  Some just shrug their shoulders and say, "I know nothing good would come of that kid."  What do you want them to think?

Les lves, de tout age, qui essayent de se faire pondre un devoir tout cuit par les traducteurs du site sont trs nombreux. Nous ne rpondons que si nous voyons un peu d'effort de la part du demandeur : on exige qu'il fasse son devoir, de nous le montrer - avec les fautes et tous - on lui indique ce qu'il faut amliorer et on lui explique pourquoi ce qu'il a crit est faux. Aprs c'est  lui de corriger ses fautes, en utilisant les informations qu'on lui a donnes, ou de demander plus de prcisions, si nos explications n'ont pas clairci tous les doutes.    Si le demandeur ne s'adapte pas  cette dmarche, tant pis pour lui, il se dbrouillera tout seul ou il ira chercher ailleurs. Nous, nous souhaitons proposer de l'aide qui soit vraiment pdagogique. Si l'lve n'en veut pas, je suis d'avis qu'il mrite sa mauvaise note. D'accord la solidarit, mais il faut un peu d'quit aussi.

AA12120714	In order to get your message across to any one person or to a group of people and keep their attention the speaker needs to use a vocabulary that suits the people he or she is speaking to. If you talk above their heads use words that they cannot grasp then what good is it to use some rare  words if they have no meaning to the listeners.. but to only you?

A quoi ou à qui sert-il?S'agit-il d'un lieu romantique, ou exotique, qui fait rêver, ou d'un lieu terre-à-terre, commun? Etc.).<br>  <br>  II. Le regard du narrateur ( Est-il objectif ou subjectif? Valorise-t-il ou dévalorise-t-il ce qu'il décrit? Vois les comparaisons et les images employées, comme les métaphores, relève des sonorités particulières, considère s'il y a un lexique mélioratif ou péjoratif, s'il y a des marques de jugement positives ou négatives).<br>  <br>  III. Une description significative (Montre que telle qu'elle est con?ue, la  description ici annonce les caractéristiques des personnages qui doivent habiter dans ce lieu, et le genre de problèmes qu'ils pourraient affronter: c'est-à-dire qu'elle préfigure tout ce qui va suivre dans le roman).<br>  <br>  Bon travail!|`|TO9mFTnCaa	Petit coup de main .<br>  <br>  Le champ lexical sur la moisissure, le renfermé etc tend à montrer qu'il s'agit de principes et d'un mode d'éducation démodé .<br>  <br>  Vous avez également la misère à commenter .<br>  <br>  Bon courage et hop hop hop au boulot !|`|is9x38oLaa	Tu as une idée de plan ou tu veux que l'on te fasse tout ton devoir?
AA10704364	School 1:  "a very bad school"    forget this    School 2 - mean spirited people - forget this    School 3:  Do you have the capacity for more difficult academics?    How important is losing one year of French to you?    School 4:  Find out why your friend is going there.   check out this school's location & physically check it out      School 3 seems to me to be the most logical from your breakdown - but do the 'footwork' & check School  4.    Incidentally,  you have a fine mind & an excellent way of refining problems into succinct sentences.  Good for you.    Good luck.|`|38dc1078682a1ed118a51d23312db4ffaa	Okay, here is my advice. Word of mouth is usually pretty reliable. This is how a lot of businesses get free advertisement. The same could be said for a school. Why are there so many negative things being said about the school? The best way to answer that is to take a tour with the principal and find out for yourself.    Secondly, your best friend is going to be your best friend no matter where he or she is. If location changes this, then maybe you weren't as good of friends as you thought you were.    Lastly, getting into college is never a sure thing. Where you go to high school has nothing to do with what colleges accept you. It has to do with grades, community involvement and ACT or SAT scores. It's no walk in the park at any school.    I hope this has helped and that you make the best decision for you based on facts.|`|AA10043860	Keep in mind, you can make new friends at a new school.  Going to a school simply because you currently have friends there is a bad idea.  What if your friendship with that person ends?  What will be your motivation for going there then?    I'd personally go for school 3.  The only drawback seems to be the amount of work you'd have to put in since you say it's a long school year and a tough curriculum.  You'd lose a year of French, but you'd get to learn a whole new language as well.  It might make you multi-lingual.      And, if you want to go to a good college, it pays to work your butt off in high school.  If you work hard, you'll usually find it's slightly easier to transition to the workload you'll have in college.  I promise you, the amount you study now is nothing compared to how often you'll study for more advanced degrees.  Get used to work sooner and it'll allow you more time to relax (without losing your mind from stress) later.    Take your time with the decision and make sure you do what you feel is best.  No one else can live your life but you.

They don't want the responsibility for themselves, so they want someone else to be responsible for them.    But did you know that this was not just done in ancient times?  Today, people still do it.  Look at the medical industry.  People follow them religiously.  If a doctor tells you to take a pill, you do it, even though thousands of people die in the USA each year from the pills they are prescribed.    Do people question their doctors?  No, people pay 100 dollars for a bottle of pills that cost 1 dollar to make.  They pay 300 dollars per day for a hospital room with 3 other patients sharing it, but would never pay 300 a day to share a hotel room with 3 strangers.  You think the hospital costs that much, think again.  Everything they do for you in that hospital room is billed in addition to the 300 per day.  And the hospitals receive millions of dollars from local, state, federal governments, plus grants and trusts and charities.    If you rent a helicopter to take you to the airport from where I live, it costs $150, but if that same helicopter is dispatched to pick me up in front of my house to fly me to the hospital, it costs $15,000.  Why do people pay it?  Because the medical industry are people's gods today.|`|AA11264628	In medieval times the king was God's presence on earth.  If you attacked the king, you attacked god himself.

666a0376129698bf867ba8cba1e23f20aa	Consider working in fashion marketing. You could use your business and psychology backgrounds to conduct market research.    As for companies, any large corporation is likely to have a marketing division. Also, some smaller companies might subcontract their market research. Try to make connections in the fashion industry and see if you can find out what marketing companies do work for the fashion industry. You might also be able to find that out through some Google research. The marketing companies might have websites that list their clients or specialties.     If your school has a fashion related major, you could talk to people in those majors or the professors to get info. And your school's career center is likely to have some information. They might know other students who have worked in the industry. Sometimes, the career centers are even contacted by employers looking for interns.|`|92714dde98c75a9fe05979a975262d72aa	Go to career services.  They can help you find an idea for internships and future jobs.    If you are interested in fashion and business, I work in a study abroad office in a university.  I know of many programs in London that offer internships and classes in fashion, including some geared toward business aspects of fashion, like merchandising and advertising.  It is possible to combine both of your loves.  I bet you can find psych courses as well, like being able to read trends, etc. (or maybe thats sociology)    However, if psych is what you really want, don't go into something just so you can make money.  You won't be happy doing something just for cash, and you'd eventually quit or be miserable.  Trust me.  I was a business major for my first two years because I wanted to be rich, but I ended up switching to international education because it fit my personality better.  I'm so much happier now.|`|a79bf311d7e95b4911fe205d27e235eeaa	Concentrate on finishing your B.S.  You have plenty of time to figure out which career to pursue.  The most important thing is to find a job that you enjoy, even if its not in Psych.  Most people end up working in an industry unrelated to their major anyway, unless its a specialized field.  So, get your B.S. and have some fun.  These are the best days of your life.  Take care.|`|AA11557233	I feel your pain, I'm in the same boat...more or less.  I have a BS in Psych from Fordham University, and came to the conclusion very late in the game that I wanted my PhD.  If you want your PhD, take the steps to make securing it much easier.  Don't concern yourself with money, as most doctoral programs grant assistantships/TA position with a stipend that about covers the cost of tuition.    At the end of your jr year, ask the dept about a possibility in doing an honors thesis.  Doctoral programs will expect you to have some research experience.  Or ask if one of your professors is running a study and needs assistance.  I did this the fall semester of my senior year, I spent about 6 hrs a week doing data entry tasks.    I know this probably wasn't the answer you were looking for, but I wish I had known this when I was a sophomore.|`|53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	If you want to be a clinical psych, you need a PhD in most jurisdictions.  My sister went that route.  If that's what you really want to do, then go for it.  It is a long path, so my suggestion would be to take as few detours as possible.  Competition to get into good schools for a PhD can be competitive - you need good grades and references.  I'd try if it all possible to look for summer opportunities working for professors in your field - that certainly helped my sister.    If you are serious about clinical psych, you should be aware that you will require some reasonably strong statistics.  I don't know what a 'business' minor is, in most universities where I live, business is in a separate faculty from arts and science, and you cannot dabble in 'business' courses.  Sociology is fascinating, but a very high overlap with psychology.  If you have the ability, a minor in biology or statistics would be a much bigger help in going for your PhD in psych.  If you don't have the ability ... I suspect you're in for a rough time.    An alternative path if you're interested in 'people' and business might be to aim to work in human resources, though this involves a lot of work regarding benefits etc in addition to dealing with personnel.  I don't know whether business school or a BA is more common as a lead up to HR work, but you might look for an HR position in any organization as a summer job, if you are unable to find work in psychology.    Finally, if you are interested in business and psychology, you might want to consider working towards a career in industrial/organizational psychology.  Unlike the HR department, industrial psychologists are normally consultants brought in to deal with a specific problem or issue, like organization design, designing tools to screen and hire applicants, etc.  This is one of the only fields in psychology where you can (apparently) find work with a masters degree, rather then necessarily needing a PhD.|`|66256ffe24045d659983994d0de50a63aa	You should consider truck driving school. Seriously.    You can earn big bucks, it's glamorous, and you can meet all sorts of contacts in the fashion industry at each of your destinations. Also you will have plenty of time to study psych between deliveries and such. Also the training is real short you you can get into it real quick. Also, all the time on the road will give you plenty of time to sort out the options in your life.    I hope this helps.

Graph it, or solve it for y or x???    The easiest way to graph it is to sovle for y    y = -2x + 9    -2 is the slope of the line, and 9 is the y intercept.    You can also just plug values for x into the equation and note what value of y is the result, then graph the pairs of numbers.    Now I see you are looking for two points- a ( , ) and b ( ,  )    So you can graph it and see what points the line passes through or you can plug an x value into the equation as explained above to find your points.

AA11124874	K-12? You teach everybody from age 5 through age 18? Yikes!    You will want to focus on generic decorations. Maybe dedicate a fraction of your wallspace to each age level (keeping fire codes in mind... never cover more than 50% of your wall, if you have sprinklers, no sprinklers is 20%, or they'll make you take it all down).    Cut that 50% available area into 6 segments. in one, put the alphabet, calendar, etc. for your K and early elementary kids. Then dedicate a segment to elementary science, one to elementary social studies, one to intermediate/middle-school grammar/writing process, etc., focusing on quality, not quantity. If there's lots you want to have up, plan a rotation system for the posters, etc. to each be up a part of the year.    Use your art prints to accent the information, and shop for posters and bulletin board materials that complement the colors in the Banks prints.

In this case I would work around pieces which depict people interacting with nature.    Also, one of the things which may relax your kids, and get them to interact is by getting them involved with the ownership of the space.  I remember back in high school during my down time in French class I would get bored, and since we were in the art room I would take oil pastels and do renditions of famous arworks on the chalkboard (very interesting medium oil pastels on slate).  You could do the same, and reward your kids by getting them to cooperate on your board with an art project of their own.  I would suggest leaving the piece up there for at least a week so your children can take pride in their accomplishment.    - Good Luck!

It also is helpful in seeing through lies, knowing whose pencil it really is when two students are tearfully pointing fingers at each other, etc.    If you want something that will make your energy stronger, take Reiki training.

The wording can be very tricky in those things so you need to read very closely, so as not to misunderstand or misinterpret.      Skimming is the exact opposite - it means to just go through and read the topic sentences, get the general gist of the article.  It is useful if you are short on time, or aren't that interested and just want to get an idea of what it is about.      Scanning is what you need to do when you are supposed to be writing a paper on a book for English class.  You need to be able to understand all the little subtleties of the text.

cfed57bbc38f175747627c9566eb4786aa	It's important to study hard in high school, especially if you are planning on going to college. However, it is important to relax and have some fun too!  My advice to this dilemma is to plan ahead. Have scheduled times for doing homework and studying, and have scheduled time for relaxing and having fun. Another way to ease stress is to plan to get your major assignments (papers, projects) done at least two weeks ahead of the due date. That way, if something "fun" suddenly comes up, you don't have to worry about homework.|`|1de73f5e82dc5e01efb691289dd0c00baa	date more!

AA11124874	All education relates to instructing the children in skills and mindsets that the current society values to prepare them to be productive adult community members.    Until recently, only a few children bound for leadership, administrative, scribing, or similar literacy duties were taught to read and write.  All other childrens' educations were skilled-labor instruction through apprenticeship (craftsmen, farming, etc.), if they were to be educated at all (unskilled labor -- now covered mostly by machinery).    In the United States today, the majority of valued careers/jobs require literacy... therefore the press to get all citizens fully literate.

Rr9Q11RZaa	I agree with the answer above...Associate of Science or Arts. I did exactly what you are planning on doing. I'm now in my first year of vet school. I took as many science classes as I possibly could at my community college. All vet schools require the basic sciences so definitely go ahead and get those out of the way at your community college. I did Bio 1 and 2, Chem 1 and 2, Microbiology, and Organic Chem 1 and 2. I loved community college so I think you are taking a great route to vet school!! Keep up the hard work!|`|AA10412478	Depending on which university you go to, make sure your credits from the college will transfer over. At a community college, you could can an Associates in Arts and Sciences. Some community colleges are affiliated with local and state universities. Talk to a vet school faculty adviser for guidance first. Wishing you the best and continued success!
AA10412478	Speak to a college guidance counselor. There are tests that can be taken to assist you in choosing a major. Take prereq's first. What are you passionate about? Art? Music? Science? Math? Technology, Helping people? etc. When you find a field that may interest you, ask about "job shadowing" for a day to see what the career entails. In addition, find out what fields are in demand so you won't waste your time and energy doing something you hate or you can't find work in your field. People change careers all the time and go back to school at different points in life. What you may do at 35 may be totally different from what you did at 25. So don't put so much pressure on yourself right now to figure out what you will do for the rest of your life. Things change, your outlook changes over time. It's life so enjoy it! Good luck!|`|u0Fvfg22aa	It's an easy question.  What do you like to do?

From there, you can go in any direction. And it's a solid enough career to keep you in money and something steady. There will always be a demand for medical professions in all fields. Good luck!

To be sure check with your academic department to see if they have a preference.|`|09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	I think if it's a scientific or mathematics paper you ought to use past tense to describe all the experiments and stuff you did or are referring to.  However, if it's something else like an English literary comparison paper, history research paper, or something along those lines, present tense seems more appropriate.  In fact, I think for philosophy papers you can use present tense and first-person point-of-view.  Actually, for history research papers, it seems that past tense would also make sense (because of course, you're discussing the past).  That's why the best solution is to check with your department and whoever's evaluating your thesis.  I think the abstract ought to follow the same tense and style that you use in your actual paper.

AA11124874	How far along are they on spoken English?    In print decoding, advanced phonics instruction is best for reading (e.g. the 3 sounds of "s" -- sun, is, sure; the 5 sounds of ough; the 5 expectations for double vowel patterns -- bead, bread, great, country, oil; etc.).  Orton-Gillingham training (designed for LD students) is wonderful for ESL reading training as well... I have students who are bilingual LD in my class, and it works.    For vocabulary and overall comprehension...  Remember that learning happens best when personal interest is involved.    Have them bring in their work, hobbies, or family stories to share.  Do shared writing, where the person tells to the best of their individual ability about their item, activity, interest, etc.  You then guide the class to write sentences with correct vocabulary and grammar, together.  Focus on noun-verb agreement, and preposition choices (the usual culprits with ESL students).

It seems odd though that in such matters of customer delight that barbers and waiters get tips while doctors and nurses often get nothing but an insult or scream from a deranged and uncomfortable patient.

Las mujeres contemplan muchos otros aspectos distintos al tama?o, forma, textura, color, etc. del pene, de hecho (y las damas de este foro no me dejaran mentir), a la mayoria de ellas no les gusta nuestra "herramienta". Lo que ellas buscan en una relacion sexual no es solamente los que se pueda sentir fisicamente, sino que buscan en mayor proporcion una satisfaccion emocional y sentimental. Si tu sabes como tratar a una dama desde el preambulo de una relacion sexual, la puedes hacer llegar al climax incluso sin una penetracion, y esto ha quedado demostrado por las chicas que su preferencia sexual es hacia otras chicas, se sobreentiende que entre chicas no puede haber una penetracion como en una relacion heterosexual.   Asi que mi querido amigo no te preocupes demasiado por el tama?o, simplemente preocupate por satisfacer a tu pareja en todos los aspectos que involucran a una relacion sexual, no dejes pasar por alto todos los detalles, hazle saber que lo realmente te interesa es satisfacerla plenamente. Existen muchas maneras de hacer esto y no todas incluyen una penetracion.   Quierete tal como eres, no te sobajes por tener el tama?o que tengas, ademas ?quien te dice si lo tienes corto o largo? tal ves estas dentro del promedio, y tambien considera esto: tal vez tu pareja sexual no conoce otros penes y no tiene punto de comparacion.   Por ultimo dejame decirte esto: el tama?o de tu pene depende del tama?o de tu cerebro, recuerda que el organo sexual del ser humano mas activo, mas creativo y mas "cachondo" es el cerebro.

It is also a right rectangular prism. The term "rectangular prism" is ambiguous. Also the term rectangular parallelepiped is used.    The square cuboid, square box or right square prism (also ambiguously called square prism) is a special case of the cuboid in which at least two faces are squares. The cube is a special case of the square prism in which all faces are squares.    If the dimensions of a cuboid are a, b and c, then its volume is abc and its surface area is 2ab + 2bc + 2ac.

Euler's formula (the number of faces (F), vertices (V), and edges (E) of a polyhedron are related by the formula F + V = E + 2) gives here 6 + 8 = 12 + 2.    Cuboid shapes are often used for boxes, cupboards, rooms, buildings, etc. Cuboids are among those solids that can tesselate 3-dimensional space. The shape is fairly versatile in being able to contain multiple smaller cuboids, e.g. sugar cubes in a box, small boxes in a large box, a cupboard in a room, and rooms in a building.|`|52ed6c5ed3d23ec96b851680422e6cf1aa	CUBan drOIDS ?    on a serious note i think its just another name for a cube
AA11255945	One-to-one tutoring is the most effective.  Sylvan and other learning  "centers" do not provide this as a standard service.  At learning centers your child will be in a group of 3-4 students and his specific needs may not be able to be met.  The requirements they have for their programs are typically double the hours per week and they will tell you that your son requires way more hours of help than they actually know as fact.  With one-to-one tutoring the entire hour of service is for your son only and is geared toward his skills and strength (not that of a group).  You will usually pay the same hourly rate for private tutoring (and can have it done in your home so you don't have to drive to a learning center) as a learning facility but you will end up paying more in the long run at a facility and it will take longer to see results.  Learning centers like Sylvan use their own program which does not usually support the local school curriculum.  They will test him at the level he is with their program so they can tell you it will take 100-150 hours of tutoring to raise him to his current grade level (of their program, of course).  This is only after you have paid around $150-$175 for an assessment that you likely do not need.    I've known many people who have gone to Sylvan and other national learning center chains only to find that what their child really needed was one-to-one attention.  Additionally when you have the tutoring done in your home you get a chance to be involved in the learning process with your child.  A team effort of student, tutor and parent is always a winning combination.  Your involvement shows your son you care and that his education is a priority to you.    Some options on where to look:  1.  Contact any local school and find out if there are any teachers who are providing private tutoring services for children your sons age.  Many schools keep tutor referral lists to help parents.  The best place to start is with the administrative office of your local independent school district.  2.  You can use an online tutor referral service if you want to be able to pick the tutor yourself.  3.  Place an ad on Craigslist for your city.  You would be surprised at how many responses you will get (from extremely qualified individuals) and you will pay a lower hourly rate than going through a service.  Many tutoring companies use this site to recruit new tutors.  Make sure to interview each with all the important questions (what type of students they typically work with, their educational background, etc.).  You can do your own criminal background check for less than $10 on your state department of safety website.  Ask for previous client referrals.  4.  You can look at the local yellow pages online and start calling around.  Interview each service you call.  If they don't have the time to answer any and all questions you have then avoid them.  If they don't care enough to spend some time with you on the phone then they probably don't care enough to place the best tutor with your son.  There is one national in-home tutoring company notorious for this (they offer a cheap, cheap rate and you get cheap, cheap service).    I have owned and run one of the largest in-home tutoring companies in the fourth largest metro area in the country for over 6 years (I can't tell you the company name because it would be considered advertising).  I've talked to every type of parent imaginable and I'm always willing to consult with or counsel any parent for free before they use our service.  Am I biased about the  service we provide?  You bet!  But only because it's the most effective for the majority of students who need help.    The point really is there is something for everyone out there.  Learning centers may work for some but definitely not for all.  I haven't seen a case yet where one-to-one individualized attention failed to provide results.  Find the best fit for your son, your family, and your budget.  Make it a priority and don't expect a quick-fix.  Learning and retention takes time and effort, not only by the student and the tutor but by the parents as well.|`|AA12107238	Sylvan Learning Center.    www.educate.com/|`|AA11124874	This link is through an organization filled with reading/writing specialists.

2cb036da1085d5e92b074b3fc2c869fbaa	If you know the decimal "places" it goes tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc.  To round, take the one to the right of the place you are rounding to.  If 5 or over, thake the place you are rounding to up one.  If less than 5, leave it alone.    .3456 rounded to the tenths would be .3  .3456 rounded to the thousandths would be .346    The negative number thing is harder.  a negative minus a negative...add the numbers and make the total negative.  A positive minus a negative...change the two negative signs to a plus sign and add them.    -10-4= (-14)  10- (-4)= (+14)    A negative number minus a negative number...change the second two minus sings to a plus sign and subtract the lower from the higher and use the sign of the bigger of the two. (When you change the second two minus signs, it is the same as a negative number plus a positive number)    -10- (-4) = -10 + 4 =(-6)    Confusing?  Yes.  Practice, practice, practice!  And remember...two minus signs equal a plus sign.  10- (-4) =10+4!    Numbers represent the "real world."  If you have ten dollars, and you owe somebody four dollars, its like you only have six dollars.  But if they decide to cancel the debt, that is subtracting a negative number.  And the result is the same worth as having fourteen dollars before the debt was cancelled.    Hope this made it clearer, not worse!  If I can clear it up for you, I will try again!|`|62c73d4f4e3fb973d1175efbe209c74baa	2.07  .3598  -62  -44t  96  14z  21|`|f6b10f99ba79172b9fe7eac1cbbb600caa	When you round to hundreths, look at the third   from the decimal point.  If it is 5 or higher, round the 2nd   from the decimal point (the hundredths) up.  In this case, 2.06812 becomes 2.07 because the 8 is > 5.    Same thing with the thousandths, except you focus on the 4th   and round the 3rd (the thousandths).  In this case, .3597831 becomes .360 because the 7 is > 5.    Adding subtracting negatives becomes easy if you imagine a line with 0 at the center; positive numbers increase going to the right & negative numbers increase going left.  In your 1st problem, -48 is 48 digits to the left of the 0.  If you are subtracting 14, move 14 more numbers left and you will be at -62.    In your 3rd problem, when you are are subtracting a negative  , you are actually adding a positive (2 negatives make a positive).  In this case 93 - (-3) is the same as 93 + 3 = 96.    Try the rest yourself|`|AA11497473	In rounding, the hundredths place is the second place from the decimal  example= 1.02597 would be 1.03  the thousandths place is the third from the decimal  example= 1.02597 would be 1.026    in subtracting with negatives, just change the symbol from - to +and change the sign of the number that follows:  example: -48 - 14 would be -48 + -14= -62   example: -20 - (-2) would be -20 + 2 = -18|`|99841efaab766d47f2d444844cf416ecaa	Rounding places    If the number is:   a.wxyz    a = ones place  w = tenTHS palce  x = hundredTHS place  y = thousandTHS place  z = ten thousandTHS place    If the number to the right is 5 or higher, you round up.  If the number to the right is 4 or lower, you keep the number the same.  Example  3.7693 rounded to the nearest hundredTHS place, you would find the hundredths place (6), look at number to right (9), since 9 is 5 or higher, you would round up to 3.77.    1.49660 to the nearest thousandths = 1.497  5.4306 to nearest tenths = 5.4  2.65606 to nearest hundredths = 2.66    Subtraction with negatives:    same sign?  add the numbers and keep the sign - example -56 - 22 = -78    different sign?  subtract the numbers and keep the sign of the biggest number - example -56 + 22 = -33    if 2 negative signs next to each other, change them to a positive:  45-(-7) is the same as 45 + 7 or 52    Good luck!  I hope this helps!|`|AA11126297	I don't know exactly what your first question is. If you want to round 2.06812 to the nearest hundredth place just think of the 0 in the tenths place, the 6 in the hundredths place, the 8 in the thousandths place, etc. This will be the same no matter what the number is. So, since you are rounding to the hundredth look at the 6 (since that is the number in the hundredths place). Then, look at the number just to the right of the 6. In this case the number is 8. If that number is greater than or equal to 5, then the 6 will round up to seven. Everything to the right of the six will turn to zero (or you can just not write anything after you write seven). If it was less than 5, then the 6 would stay 6 and everything else would turn to zero. You can do the next one yourself.    With subtraction you just subtract.     With the first one, think of it as -48 and -14, not -48 minus 14. With this problem you have a negative and you are adding a negative (you can also write it like -48+-14). This means you have to have a negative number as your answer. Since you are adding negatives just add the two numbers together and put a negative sign in front.    With the second one, it is the same thing. Add the two negative together, the same as the first problem, and you will have a t at the end. This only works if the letter in the problem is the same letter.    With the third one, you are subtracting a negative from the 93. This is the same as writing it like: 93+3. Same thing with the fourth one, just add a z at the end.    With the fifth one, know that you are also subtracting a negative with the -(-37) (when you see -(-) like that it just means add). So, since the -16 is negative you have to actually combine the two together. Rewrite the problem first.    -16+37  It is okay to flip flop these numbers    37-16  I think you know how to do that.|`|AA12303470	Ok, this isn't as hard as you think it is. In order tp round to the nearest hundredth, you need to look at the number in the thousandths place. (Ex. 2.06812 --the "8" is in the thousandths place, and the "6" is in the hundredths place.) Because the number 8 is greater than 5, it is rounded up. (If the number in the thousandths place was less than 5, it would stay the same). So, 2.06812 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 2.07. Use the same method for rounding to the nearest thousandth by looking at the number in the ten-thousandth place. In this case, 0.3597831 is 0.360 rounded up to the nearest thousandth.      In order to subtract negative numbers use the "keep, change, opposite" method. In the number sentence, keep the forst number, change the subtraction sign to an addition sign and the last number in the sentence should be changed to its opposite (ex. 14 changes into -14, while -14 would change into 14). So--    -48-14= -48+(-14)=  -62  -40t-4t= -40t+(-4t)= -44t  93-(-3)= 93+3= 96  12z-(-2z)= 12z+2z= 14z  -16-(-37) = -16 + 37 =  21    I would explain it more to you, but it's really hard to type out. Hope you understand it better now though. ;]|`|f89d0c115e06933174d99d7388408a2caa	I suck at the rounding, sorry : )    1) subtracting a negative number with another number makes it MORE negative. Get it ? -2 -1 = -3 ,  -3 -2 = -5., -30x - 5x = -35x.    2) OK, multiplying 2 negative numbers make a positive number. Multiplying a positive with a negative numbers make a negative number.  Having a -ve sign in front of a bracketed expression is less multiplying everything inside it by -1.    - ( - 3) is same as  -1 x (-3) which means +3.     -( -2z) is same as -1 x (-2z) which means +2z|`|c0275e9963323c24b4f0b8106cf4b1b0aa	if u mean answer the questions... then  2.06812 to the nearest hundredth = 2.07  .3597831 to the nearest thousandth = 0.360    (-48) - 14 = (-62)  93 - (-3) = 96  (-16) - (-37) = 21    i think...

AA11124874	You'd get more answers posting this under "special education."    A very simple bullying response procedure you can teach him (that has worked well for a couple of my students) is:    1. SMILE at the bully and count at a smooth pace to 3.  2. Turn and walk away.  3. Say to self "They attack what they fear."  4. If they follow, move in the direction of a teacher.    Don't just have him say the steps. Practice them with you, and other members of the family (each pretending to be a bully).    As he practices, build in these ideas:    Bullies are looking for a hurt or fear response. If you smile, it confuses the heck out of them.    If you ignore their verbalizations, it also confuses them. By turning and walking away, you are dismissing them without becoming confrontational.    If they follow, placing yourself in line-of-sight to authority prevents them from continuing, without becoming a "tattle tale."    If they linger, to "catch" you when the teacher "isn't looking," move closer to the teacher and stay in proximity. If this is not possible, THEN go to the teacher, say "excuse me," wait for the teacher to say "yes," and say "I am sorry to bother you, but there are a couple of bullies who are following me everywhere. I've been ignoring them, but they won't stop and I need to go to (place). Can you help me?"  This shows that you have been trying to handle it on your own, you don't like to tattle, and the bullies are the ones pushing the issue.

These are stories that are designed to help children with Autism/Asperger's to understand the complexities of social situations.  Type in Social Stories into a search engine and see what pops up.    Also - you might want to talk with him about why he thinks the clothes will make him "cool".  It could be that the kids that were picking on him were wearing these clothes and he figures that if he wears them, the kids will think he is one of them.  Talk with him about the fact that everyone is different and unique.  If he is getting picked on, tell him that one way to react is to find a safe phrase that he can repeat to himself (in a quiet tone) to calm himself down.  He can also go to a trusted adult and let them know that he is being picked on

For the last question: Yes. The factors  are (x+17) and (x+18).  If you want to check whether a quadratic like this  one factors over the integers, compute the  discriminant. If it is a rational square, we can   factor the quadratic  over the integers.

ThKkn5fKaa	The SAT isn't designed as an intelligence test, but it at least gives us something.  Actually, the fact that you did well on the SAT but were also a lackluster student, could potentially tell us more.  If you were like me in high school, you probably just didn't do any homework, never studied, and then just did well on the tests and you SAT's, lol.  At least that's how it was with me.  I got a 1360 on my SAT, but I was something like a 3.4 in GPA.      You might be very close to borderline.  You might get in easily.  I don't know.  What I do know is that I'd greatly recommend you looking into it.  It was great finally getting to know people that are similar to me.  Joining Mensa was one of the better decisions I've made in my life.  I'd recommend checking out the US Mensa website.  They have a little quiz that you can take there.  And they also have a test that you can give yourself at home.  Not to mention, official testing is only $30. (or at least it was when I joined...) You might want to just try it out.

Also you may need to rephrase some sentences after you are done, you will find out you have a better paper.|`|9817b906dbbb6e7df9c07ebefe0fd252aa	i have that too. my advice is that just cut out anything you think is not important or re-write it. do the most important stuff first and if it is too short slowly add the important stuff|`|AA12121778	Use words that express more but count less.     For example: My first English draft, already superfluous, exceeding the thousand word limitation set by my teacher, with no end in sight.   You used 31 words, I used 21 to get the same point across.  Get into the habit of using a Thesaurus when writing.

MDRiu5iLaa	It's no big deal, you have a few options:    1) Retake the class. The new grade will replace the old one and all will be right with the world.  2) Petition to remove the grade. I'm not sure which office you would go to to accomplish this, however you can definately ask a counselor. Once you've done this, make sure to pick a simpler lab class, my suggestion is one that is for non-science majors (which your CC should have).  3) Talk to your Prof. I've changed more than one grade by simply asking my prof if I could redo the class work/tests/projects. If you never ask you'll never know.    General suggestions: identify the type of teaching that is best for you (lecture, reading, hands-on, visual, etc.) and then do your best to stick with it. Go with your strengths and avoid your weaknesses, it's great to learn something new but stick to something near your field/interests. Use Prof. rating sites. Talk to other students. Talk to prospective Profs, I have just recently taken to "interviewing" them before I ever sign up for a class. Talk to Profs about other Profs. Everyone has valuable info for you.|`|3780188914a9ceea7009f30a2d00a665aa	If your major is English and you are interested in applying to another university to study English, then they wont care about the lab or physiobiology class that you had to take because it's not really relevant.  If the F really bothers you, you could retake the class with a tutor and definitely with another instructor.  Don't worry though, you'll be fine!|`|p3j1D18Aaa	Dont feel too bad. Its bound to happen sooner or later. This semester I got stuck with a foreign professor for Electircity and Optics and I nearly failed cause i could never understand him and it was his first time to teach. You will bounce back. And yes GPA doesnt transfer between universities, so you can make up for it in the application process.|`|aeb50a1352b19cb8d52140f1b33cee8baa	Well, I'm no expert but I suppose if you keep your cumulative GPA high enough it should be ok.  1 bad grade might seem disastrous but good grades in other classes will probably help balance it out.

Ed. teachers teach different things depending on the state and grade level.

1e5e770f583f8bf7d60243fb178705b8aa	Hola nuevamente.       Segn lo que yo s y he aprendido, la religin es, en cierta manera, una invencin del hombre al tratar de explicarse fenomenos, sobre todo de la naturaleza, que no se puede explicar debido a nuestro peque?o cerebrito y a las pocas ganas de querer investigar. De ahi viene que, por ejemplo, las culturas mesoamericanas, griegas o romanas de la antigedad tuvieran una cantidad de deidades impresionantes: dios del viento, de la lluvia, del trueno, del sol y un largo etc....      Lo que tengo bien cierto es que no podemos tampoco andar como animalitos por el mundo sin una base o respaldo espiritual que nos apoye, sobre todo en momentos de tensin o preocupacin. Coincido totalmente contigo respecto a que Dios no se encuentra unicamente en una iglesia o salon, Dios esta por todos lados y podemos contar con l en cualquier lugar o cualquier momento.   Afortunadamente tenemos el libre alvedrio que nos permite creer en lo que queramos y deseamos o querramos creer.     De hecho no hay religiones malas, todas nos llevan a ser mejores seres humanos, a tratarnos como iguales o hermanos, a ser buenos elementos en nuestras sociedas y situaciones como esta; el problema radica en los miembros de estas religiones que muchas ocasiones tuercen o interpretan las doctrinas como mejor lo entienden o en base a lo que quieren o desean.     Espero no ofender a nadie con mis comentarios, (no es mi intencin), yo respeto todas y cada una de las religiones, as como a todos y cada uno de los integrantes de estas, simplemente externo mi punto de vista.    Aqu en Mxico salio hace algunos a?os un peque?o libro de Rius llamado "Cada quien su Dios" que habla de las religiones, sus pros y sus contras, es una lecura recomendada para todos aquellos que tenemos problemas para acercarnos a una religin, se los recomiendo.    Bueno... eso digo yo!    Saludos.|`|8c0dc2e6063e2836daef2e754b5558e0aa	pues es mejor respetar la fe de los demas y creer en lo k tu cres que es lo mejor...pero...en lo personal a veces soy intolerante en ese aspecto y critico a los cristianos...

Lo mas importante es que estes convensido de tu pensamiento y que te sirva! yo no creo en dios,sin embargo tengo puesta mi fe en otras cosas que en los buenos momentos me acompa?an y en los malos me ayudan a superar. A pesar de no ser religiosa, no estoy cerrada me gusta escuchar diversas opiniones con mucho respeto y mis mejores amigas son religiosas....cuando ellas me dicen que dios te bendiga lo tomo con mucho amor! con el mismo amor que yo les deseo lo mejor siempre!
Ria9c8Roaa	Well, if your looking for just some random home schooling strangers, lol, I'd post "Who is a home-schooler and wants 2 go 2 the beach?" otherwise, be more specific. I'd find a nice spot somewhere for rent, (which is usual 2 have beach houses at Flordia) and just have fun over there.|`|mGEwdQyvaa	Well are you in contact with other home schoolers? Are you in a homeschool group? That's your first step.     1. Find people who are interested.    2. Brainstorm with these people to figure out things like  -Where exactly you want to stay  -What kind of things you want to do  -How much it will cost  -Will parents be there too?  -How will you get there?  -Pros and cons of doing it and how to deal with the cons.    3. Once you brainstorm, you should know what things need to be done. Assign everyone in your "committee" a job such as   -Calling places around Fl. to find a house to rent.   -Calling airlines or bus lines to find out prices and see if there are group rates.  -Writing up a proposal for parents to get their help and consent.  -Organizing a fund raiser of some kind (car washing, yard sales, etc) to raise money.  -Calling places around Fl to find things that you can do while you're there  ...etc.    It will take work, but it wont be that hard, and if you get other people on a committee with you, it will help a lot. A lot of it might even be fun. It may also help if you know a home schooler or home school group in Florida who can help you arrange things. I'm in Florida, and I'm a member of the Gulf Coast Home School Association. If you want to be on the gulf coast, you can get in touch with this group (GCHSA.com) and they might be more than happy to help you organize a homeschool trip down here and even invite you to get involved in some of our group's activities. E-mail me if you need any more advice.|`|TaaQut43aa	tha is nice do it

It's really not much different than saying "I'm either grape juice or a purple juice." Grape juice IS a purple juice...    Both are correct, but one is more specific than the other.

A gift card is nice but the two presents that I received that I loved the most was a Ty teddy bear with  1 teacher on it, it was very small but it made me feel extremely appreciated.  The other was a gift card for a teacher supply store.  Schools are great, but there are things that teachers would like to have in their classrooms that the schools just don't have enough money to buy.  Fun things like bingo alphabet games only cost ten dollars, so $25 will go a long way.  Ebay has a couple of different Ty bears that are pretty cute and do not cost much.  That has been my favorite gift so far.  The one that I got was really small so it probably only cost about 5 bucks, but I love it!  And the size is great, it fits on my desk at school.  I think that the biggest reason that this present stands out in my mind is because the child picked it out herself.|`|1dd2e9b3e24fa5961a9283e104768a16aa	A gift certificate for a local resturant for $25. Most teachers already have the apple coffee mugs, tree ornaments, and hand-made whatcha-ma-call-its. A homemade pie or something like that might be nice, but it's hard to know what allergies and likes/dislikes the teacher may have as far as food is concerned.    Hope that helps!|`|cEa8TTenaa	You must get them something they would personally like: do you know these teachers?   If you are unsure, a book token is always appreciated. Most teachers read.  Otherwise, a nice hamper filled with small but inexpensive things will be great.   For example: an inexpensive plastic salad bowl filled with a nutcracker, a potato peeler, a pair of salt and pepper shakers, a pair of salad servers (all from your supermarket, nothing fancy) and then a lovely little bunch of grapes... all wrapped in a large sheet of yellow cellophane and tied with a gold bow. Presto!  Or a coloured box filled with a miniature Christmas pudding, miniature Christmas cake, tiny pack of chocolates, tin of smoked oysters, tiny bottle of olive oil, a small jar of capers or olives, then add a mango, and wrap in the same way.  Or a similar box filled with a hard-cover notebook, a nice gel pen, a pack of stick-up notes, a small pack of envelopes, an address book and a calendar for 2009, plus some chocolates, and wrap in the same way.  I always give my teachers presents like this... one particular teacher just loved a salad bowl full of Avon cosmetics (small sizes) wrapped extravagantly.  (Place a scrunched up sheet of cellophane at the bottom of the container, then arrange the small gifts nicely on top before wrapping.)

9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	hi,   here is a great article for you to read.  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...
aUzpU7M2aa	Ancient use of forms of certain alphabetical characters familiar today (because I assume you refer to alphabetical characters still in use) is represented in very remote time from many archaeological finds across a broad geographical area within southern Europe. The sign system I refer to is known as Vinca. The signs appear on pottery, amulets, bracelets, etc. The use of this script easily pre-dates the well-known ancient Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Sumerian, etc. scripts. Used in various combinations the anciently used characters appear to have encapsulated specific information for their users not less than 6000 and possibly as much as 7500 years ago. The term 'pre-writing' is tentatively used for the symbols rather than writing. Perhaps simply to avoid unwanted controversy until such time as sufficient further examples of the ancient script are unearthed for the script and its role in the culture of the time to be better understood.

sZUVFvsqaa	Read chapter 10 of the Teenage Liberation Handbook. My parents were dead set against homeschooling, but I read several books on the topic and used the techniques outlined in TLH and was able to get myself homeschooled in only a couple of years (and believe me, if you'd met my parents, you'd realize what an accomplishment that was).     I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|3BrCf1dBaa	Choose a time where she's not overly busy, or plan a time where the two of you can talk. Above all, be respectful - she is your mother and whatever she decides, that's what you have to go by. You could do a little research on what would be needed. You could also come up with a schedule for yourself - show that you've really taken an interest in this. Give your reasons as to why you want to be homeschooled, and ask why she is against it. Is it because she doesn't have the time? Or is it that she thinks you won't be able to socialize? Tell her that you don't want to "survive" school! You want it to be a positive experience! My siblings and I LOVE school, we love learning everything we can!     I personally think it's a great form of education, I'm fifteen years old, have been homeschooled my whole life, and will be dual enrolling at a community college when I'm sixteen.     Best of luck to you!!! :)|`|mIZvBsQkaa	My friend is homeschooled and she may be taking her GCSEs at the age of 14 because they've helped her so much.  She's not homeschooled by her parents, she's homeschooled with qualified private tutors.    this is their website: http://higherclass.schools.officelive.co...    it's got facts and figures about homeschooling.  i want to be homeschooled!!    good luck|`|e02bb8ac05d1cbbd4ae510baab6f0498aa	It is difficult when parents and kids don't see eye to eye.  It sounds like you are committed to the idea of homeschooling but your mom is not.  Listening to where her concerns and fears are is a huge step in the right direction.....asking questions.  You might be tempted to interrupt or prove why she is wrong but if you can hold your tongue and listen, you might hear some problems that will give you a chance to find a solution.  I will also suggest a public school homeschool program that many families are trying with success.  I do not know what state you live in so you will have to do the research on this.  In your search engine type in your state and "virtual academy" after it.  I know that states like colorado, texas, and georgia have this progrm which is funded by the public school and provides all the computer software and even a laptop to make it happen.  They also provide a teacher to talk to when you run into difficulties so both you and mom have someone to help you along the way which is encouraging for homeschoolers who are doing it independently.  They help with transcripts and grades so this takes a load off of mom too.  If that is not an option, have you considered a public charter or private school to transfer to?  OR a tutor?  the last 3 cost money but the online academy is free, however, it may be worth it to pay for something if your mom would consider other options.  Oh, and you might ask mom if she would be willing to meet with you and your guidance counselor to see what options are available to improve the situation you are in....sometimes another adult can be a strong help when talking with parents and getting them to hear you.  Your counselor might be able to suggest some solutions to improve your present situation or provide alternative schooling options.  Good luck,

JzxS4jBDaa	Well, each person has their own way of practicing for ANYTHING. If I was in a spelling be, I'd do something uber cliche: Grab a dictionary and have someone ask me random words from it. (Since doing it yourself won't work -- you'll be instantly cheating.)    In the sources, I have a spelling bee website. Also there, I included my Google search of "how to practice for a spelling bee". Hope they help!~|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Practice, Practice, Practice, Practice, then Practice some more.|`|32ubwZjtaa	write the words like 5 times each and say them repeatedly without looking like a hundred times and have someone help you.    ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|6627NijZaa	read the dictionary|`|3NQizLOKaa	i was in the finals, mad hard. i did it by reading my social studies textbook.|`|XkidpdPWaa	I have no idea.

That way you get acquainted with a lot of words you may never see normally.    Good luck!|`|G0NrzSwkaa	well most of the school spelling bees are based on a national spelling be:  Canwest Spellling Bee  try going to their website and practicing their words.    also try asking a teaching who is involved in the spelling bee for some of the guidelines.    then practice depending on what type of learner you are:  audible - record yourself spelling the words and listen to it  visual - write the words down over and over again  kinesthetic - create psters or fun activities to do with the words    GOOD LUCK!

If youre on a waiting list, dont despair! Bursaries are awarded throughout the spring and summer to replace bursary recipients who decide not to participate, so you may be able to explore another corner of the country after all.    If your application is accepted    The institution you will be attending will send you an acceptance package. Complete the package and return it along with your registration fee and deposit, if applicable.    Dont delay! If you havent replied within two weeks of being accepted, your bursary will be given to another applicant. Institutions need to know how many bursary recipients are coming.

Dh0JX2Onaa	It seems that math would be a good subject for you./|`|5Xh7y0waaa	hmmm ... apart from maths specialist (which is supposed to be very difficult, so maybe that's why you're not taking it?)you've got maths and science covered unless you want to do biology or something like that. VCE P.E. is also very science-y, but in the same way as biology which is the one science that you haven't chosen.    Engineering though, that's really interesting. I wonder, is your school part of a V.E.T. (Vocational Education and Training) Cluster? Lots of schools in Victoria are.    V.E.T. programs are like VCE subjects - you take them during school in years 11 & 12 and they contribute to your ENTER score, the difference being that they are very hands on, and you would probably be taking it at a school that is not your own.    There most likely will be an engineering coarse if there is a VET cluster at your school, because my V.E.T. cluster offers 'V.E.T. Engineering', and it's the sort of thing that they would have in V.E.T.    V.E.T. subjects are also quite light-weight, which I think would be good for you as you are taking on so many really tough ones (Methods, Chem. and Physics).    I'm not doing V.E.T., but lots of my friends are, and they think it's great to get away from their school for a few hours each week with some friends. You should ask your careers adviser about it, if you haven't already. It could work out really well for you.    It's good that you are thinking about it early. if you are going into VCE next year, your teachers will put a lot of pressure on you at the end of the year to make some dicisions. So that's really great.|`|Yc8mcp03aa	well if your doing engineering why aren't you doing specialist maths? Engineering requires heaps of maths and of course you'd want a good score so specialist will boost you up by heaps. I think you should dump methods because you don't really need that if you choose specialist.

4NRFZ1aDaa	I am an American who obtained my Masters Degree in England.  You need to conduct much research about your intended country.     Each country has their own rules about who may come to study, as well as any visa requirements for families. (Spouse and children).  Unless you have been living together at the same residence for at least two years, you may not be able to apply for a family visa since you are not married.    You may need to consider leaving the pets at home with family and friends, as most countries will require any pet to remain in quarantine for a period of time - which can be months.    Additionally, oftentimes there are financial requirements showing you have a certain amount of money saved in order to obtain a student visa to another country.  You need to understand all of this, and also must be accepted to a University prior to applying for loans and grants.     Check out the website below, it is targeted to potential international students.      Also your boyfriend should contact the university he is interested in studying at for more information.    Good luck.|`|2HETgiwgaa	You should find most of what you need to know on the New Zealand immigration website.  I've put a link for you below.  I'm a bit biased, but I'd recommend Otago University in Dunedin (where I studied) - depending on what course your boyfriend is thinking of.  Pets would probably have to go through quanrantine - info about that is on the biosecurity link below.      Feel free to contact me if you want to have someone in New Zealand who you can ask questions :-)
