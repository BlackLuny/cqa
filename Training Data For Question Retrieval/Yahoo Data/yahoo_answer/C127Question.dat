But it was way before he ejaculated. I'm just really concerned about still getting pregnant and my period won't come in less than 10 days because its regular for it to come every month around the 10th. I'm only 16 so i can't take the plan B pill and i don't know what to do!
20090202104258AAcXEs4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Just found out wife is pregnant! YAY, but we had 2 prior miscarriages....?	should I be worried?  I am trying to be positive and think we just had bad luck in the past, but I am obviously worried....I figured I would post this here rather than talk about it with my wife and concern her...      A little history, we are 31, miscarried in Jan 07 and July of 07.  WE recently went through a battery of tests over the past couple months and we were deemed healthy (DNA, chromosomes, physically, etc) so they suggested not going the route of insemination or IVF because they felt we could do it alone.  I however have a slightly low sperm count, my motility is fine, and morphology is low...      Here we are, month later and she tested positive with a HPT and she is 2 days late...however she really doesn't have much in terms of symptoms, last time I recall swollen breasts, discharge, etc...but she only claims to see more veins in her chest and is a little "wet" here and there....am I over worrying and is it way to soon to worry? (she is literally a day late)      thoughts?
20090202104431AAkhuWV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long should I wait to start buying baby stuff?	I'm 21 weeks tomorrow and I'm just curious as to when I should be buying things for the baby. Should I wait until after viability? My mother says I should. She is a L&D nurse and she wants me to wait until the baby could survive outside the womb because the thinks if something were to happen before then, having all the baby things would be heartbreaking. I'm ready to buy NOW! But my mother makes a good point.       How long should I wait to start buying for my baby?   How long did you wait before shopping for your little one?

I am now 7 weeks along in my second pregnancy and am showing already. My pants are tight and my belly is hanging over. When I stand up, you can tell I have a little bit of a belly. I feel bloated. It definatley looks more like a chubby tummy than a prego tummy right now. I don't require maternity clothes yet but I don't feel they're far away. Is it normal to show this soon?

I am going on 13 weeks tomorrow with twins and I saw my dr for the second time 1/28. At my 12/30 appt she wrote up a slip for a 1st Trimester Sequential Screening for Down Syndrome (the one where they count the folds in the babies necks). She forgot to give it to me on the 12/30 appt and now she is rushing me to get it done. The slip says 11 6/7 weeks to 13 6/7 weeks. If I don't go this week will it be too late? Does anyone know what they do during this test? How is it done, how long does it take? What is really involved and what would they be able to tell me? Thanks in advance.
20090202104946AA3Ftun	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you have trouble conceiving because you were overweight?	We're going to start ttc in a couple months. Within the past year, I have gone from 120lbs to 140lbs (I'm 5'6") due to a bit of stress and a sit-down desk job. I know it's not too much over what I should be, but wonder how much overweight you have to be before it becomes more difficult ttc.    I am done with the stressful situations I was dealing with the past year (and hope no more come up!) and I'm going to start walking on my breaks at work so I think I should be okay with not gaining anymore weight.       If you had trouble conceiving because you were overweight, how much over were you? Do you think I'll have a problem conceiving?         Thanks!!

This is my first pregnancy and I know that it's kind of a stupid question but I have no idea about it. I am 37 weeks pregnant and I am having pains and sharp twinges in my vagina.

I have no idea.

When I have my baby (8 days to go!!) I want her to be there but I'm really scared of her holding him. She's never had kids of her own and she doesn't listen right off the bat, you really have to nag her for her to understand or listen. She doesn't realize that his head needs to be supported and things like that.       She isn't the only one I'm going to have issues with... I just want to nicely be able to tell people no and I would rather have some hold him while sitting down and preferably with supervision... even some adults. I usually have no problem being a b*tch when it comes down to it but my step-mom's mother just got diagnosed with cancer and she's very emotionally fragile.       What would you do? How would you handle it?

She had a birthday party she went to, when we were leaving she started a fit throwing herself on the ground. I picked her up and tried talking to her but she started screaming and kicking "NO" soI put her down and tried getting her coat on.      During that entire time she kicked, scratched and went out of control screaming and flailing. I got her coat on and had to carry her that way out the door. I mean, I have never ever seen her like that. She threw herself on the hallway floor and then on the ground outside scraping up her hands.      My questions are A: What do you do to dissolve this situation immediately? I tried saying you can go home and see your new kitty, you can't come back if you're not good then relied on screaming.      and      What kind of punishment does a child like this need? She will be 4 in April and knows right from wrong and had zero communication with me as to why she was screaming.      THANK U!

I work full-time and go to school part-time. I currently live with my mother,but I will have a place of my own in early July. Even though I live with my mom, the responsibilites of my son are taken care of by me.      I would like some opinions about if i should keep this baby. The father and I are happy. He does, however, have another baby on the way by another girl. I am not one for abortions. I do feel that I am ready, I guess im just a little scared about having another child.      I know money will always be an issue with children no matter what financial state you are in. I do not feel the baby will stop me from getting my degree( slow me down yes, but i will not let it stop me & i didnt with my first child). i kinda kno what i plan to do, just would like to hear some opinions. Thanks!!

He's been delayed with his speech and we think this is due to him watching too much TV for the first part of his life. My husband and I agreeded to cut it down and now he doesn't watch too much, espeically movies since its movies where he completely gets tuned out from everything. We do let him watch about 20 minutes before bed. My husband now thinks because our son is getting obsessed with Toy story and always aksking for it we should cut him off and put other movies on. I think this is terrible as he's asking for it so why not let him enjoy it for 20 mins before bed?  My husband thinks it's not normal for our son to be so obsessed with this movie. I think it's normal.  Any thoughts?

However, I'm still dying to know if everything else looked ok. His spine, legs, EVERYTHING. Also, I know they can see "markers" for down syndrome. Did anyone else feel like this? Like really anxious to know that everything looked ok?       Also, at about 19 weeks, I had an ultrasound done at the hospital when I had cramping, and the doctor said everything was normal. Would they have checked the babies spine and everything on that ultrasound?      I know worrying isn't any good, but any suggestions to help me not worry about him so much?

Ho sempre avuto rapporti protetti con il preservativo, ma ho paura di essere incinta. Non chiedetemi perchè ma ho questa specie di FOBIA da 1 anno a questa parte. Sono sempre perennemente terrorizzata all'idea di essere incinta. So che molti di voi mi diranno di prendere la pillola per essere piu tranquilla ed è quello che ho intenzione di fare. Ma leggendo alcuni dei commenti qui su answer ho dedotto che anche con la pillola c'è un margine d'errore. La mia domanda si divide in due:   1) è possibile che io sia incinta pur avendo sempre usato il preservativo SEMPRE (non si è mai rotto)?   2) Sto male davvero questa paura è diventata una vera e propria ossessione. Ma come mai? Da cosa può essere causata? Secondo voi devo rivolgermi a uno psicologo?   Vi prego di non giudicarmi infantile, perchè questo problema mi mette in seria difficoltà. Non ho pù 16 anni... Ormai ne ho piu di 20...

20070501111455AAty1w8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My two year old son.......?	My 24 month old son is halfway potty trained. He will tell us when he needs to go pee and will go on the potty. We make a huge deal out of it everytime he goes. However, when he goes to sleep at night or takes his nap during the day, he takes his pull-up off and throws poop and smears it all over the walls. I dont know how to handle it because I dont want him to be afraid to poop. I tell him that when he needs to go poop that he can come tell us and we'll take him to the potty. Everytime I even suggest that he try to poop while hes on the potty, he throws a fit. Its hard to tell when he is going to have a bm as he has them at a different time most days so there is no way I can know. Anyone else experience this? He is very intelligent and has a vocab of over 100 words and listens to directives. Im not understanding this.

20070616084945AAW4Q45	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible Im pregnant?	Hi there   Really hope someone can help or give me some advice.   I have 28 day cycles and my period is never late. (The last time it was late was over 1 year ago and even then it was only 2 days late)   Last sat - 7 days ago - which was the day my period was due, I had sex and the condom split. I wasnt overly worried since it was the day my period was due.  However, my period never arrived and is now 7 days late which is not normal for me.   I started to get worried during the week and took a home pregnancy test on wed (being 4 days late) which came back negative.     Is it possible that I could still be pregnant and if so, how early would I be able to tell?   Thanks a lot

N?o tenho rela??es sexuais desde o dia 17/03. Meu ciclo é aparentemente regular, de 28 dias, só tive o atraso de um dia no mês de mar?o, que desceu dia 4.   Durante esse ciclo, como já disse, n?o tive rela??es sexuais, porém meu namorado me tocou várias vezes e em algumas dessas vezes, ele provavelmente tocou seu pênis, mas n?o chegou a ejacular e nem perto disso, na verdade.   Minha menstrua??o era pra descer hoje, 29/04, o que n?o ocorreu.   Meus seios est?o doloridos, me sinto irritada (até demais) e espinhas apareceram, algo que sempre acontece quando estou para menstruar.

Well, Im getting tired of it. I just feel like life is too short to wait until our lives our "settled" or our careers are "perfect". I want to be around my first baby when they are a baby. I don't want to miss that with being a first time mom, and I want to grow with my child, not be 50 having my first. Im 21 now, and my husband is almost 24. He is deployed right now, so by the time he gets back and I get pregnant I will be 22 by the time our first is born. We own a townhome, have two vehicles, and Ive got 2 years left of school, however it's all online, and very manageable..I do about 10 hours a week which I could do when my husband gets home from work no problem. We don't have tons of money, but we should have at least minimum 3,000 dollars to buy baby needs, and we will have around 1,000 dollars left over a month after paying bills.I also want a big family someday. I think I want like 4 kids!      What do you think?

20081112220928AAlFvKq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to Stop Acting Like a Teenager?	I'm 18 and I still act very irrational. I make very stupid decisions and my family & friends have always been there to help me make good decisions. To tell you the truth, I don't appreciate it. I know they are doing it to look after me but I feel like they are controlling my life and that when I do make good decisions it is to please them not myself.  I'm not talking about doing drugs or alcohol. I'm talking about stuff like grades, going to college, the clothes I wear, the way I walk. I feel like I've bent over backwards to please everyone but myself. I don't tell them how to dress, not to curse, to what to wear. I feel the problem is my personality is not conventional. I hate the idea of changing my entire personality to kiss @$$ to people who are being themselves. It's very difficult for me to stand up to my family & friends, so I instead I act out in a bitchy way & all they seem to remember that I was being mean to them not why I may have been that way to them. What's your best advice?

The baby's father, was a one weekend stand (he stayed the whole weekend) and that is when he or she was conceived. Now, he isn't sure what he wants to do. I don't care if he wants in or out of the picture. I have a boyfriend right now, and we just started dating. He is willing to step in and support me and my baby regardless of the fact he isn't the father. I have no clue what I can do here. I mean, if my baby's dad doesn't want to be a part of his or her life, do I sue for child support or just leave it alone. If all things work out with this boyfriend, if he decided to sign the birth certificate, would I be unable to claim child support from the biological dad? This is such a sticky situation; cause in a way I want him to pay and in a way I just want him to not even be in the picture.

It was negative, and I have not gotten my period yet, but I am due on Thanksgiving or a little later. When I had sex 2 weeks ago, It was the last day of my last period, and then I had sex again a week after that ( Last Wednesday). For maybe a week or a little less, I been getting cramps in my pelvis area or a little lower.. and been getting back aches, and headaches. been eating a super lottt.. i also been full of emotions, one minute sad and depressed, the next full of rage.. could i have taken a test too early, and thats why its negative? I know i'm supposed to wait for my period, but i want to know the possibility of my being pregnant or not. I know all the signs I been having are also PMS signs, but i never get them this early. I got another test that i will take in about 2 weeks. I know I'm due next week but they say there can be spotting and cramping as a sign of pregnancy... i'm just new to this and kind of confused. I also just really hope I am pregnant, and i'm afraid i got my hopes too high (which i probably did)......Any advice???

20090202115505AArGyeM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Severe coughing 35 weeks pregnant?	I have had a cold since wednesday. With the most nagging part being my coughing. I cough so bad it keeps me up all night, i can hardly eat and have no appetite,  when i cough i cough up pleghm most of the time and now its to the point where i cough so bad i cough up pleghm with tints of pink blood in it and my tummy muscles are beginning to really hurt whenever i cough. I drink hot tea with lemon and honey, i stay warm, warm baths,vicks vapor rub, tylenol cold, cough drops etc...these have helped some but the coughing is unreal. Im 35 weeks pregnant and afraid that me coughing might affect the baby in some. will my severe coughing hurt my baby or can i9t cause premature rupture of the bag of waters. i know it sounds silly but i am concerned. have a doc appt thursay and hope my cold is gone by then..thanks
20090205102850AAvdHiO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Which school would you choose?	If money wasn't an object, would you send your child to a school other than public schools (I'm SO unimpressed with my local public schools)?      There's a private academy type school (yes, a military school) near my house.  I was reading on their website and 95% of all students continue on to 4 year colleges and usually have received some sort of scholarship.  They take 6th grade thru 12th grade.        I know I have quite a while to really be thinking about this, but I was just curious of what other people thought... Public Schools... Military Academies... Private Schools... Homeschool....      What do you think?

We have the food, the location, and most of his presents sorted out but I'm stuck on a theme. I LOVE polka dots but I know my husband would cringe at that idea! I've thought about doing Noah's Ark but would that be too cheesy? I know I DON'T want to do Sesame Street or Mickey Mouse. Basically I want something not too "normal".      So, if you have any ideas or pictures, could you share? Thanks!

20090202115056AAjfcml	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Mother-in-law problems during pregnancy *Sorry kind of long*?	My mother-in-law has had it out for me from the very beginning and i've learned to just deal with her.  My husband and i have been together over 2 years and she just won't quite.  He was married before and has 2 children with his ex-wife.  His ex-wife isn't a wonderful mother by any means and has taken complete advantage of my mother-in-laws love for her grandchildren, by dropping them off at any time she pleases as if it is her personal baby sitter and giving my MIL a sob story about how she can't do it without my husband and wants him back.  Well anyway my hubby and i found out we're expecting a little boy and when we told his family everyone was soooo happy for us except of course his mother.  all she could say was you all are so stupid.  Well as time has progressed it hasn't gotten any better, but now she won't say anything in front of her son, she says it when i'm sitting there alone.  Like when we visited yesterday she was ranting about the ex-wife and how she's always dropping the kids off and trying to get rid of them, i just sat there and watched tv partially listening to her and then she looks right at me and goes oh don't worry it wont be much longer you'll be doing the same thing trying to get rid of the kid whenever you can, you're not the type of person that will be able to handle being a mother.  She has never once asked how the pregnancy is going, unless i'm speaking with my father-in-law and she shots in a nasty comment.  my hubby has told her more than once that she needs to leave me alone, but now it's just to the point where i blow up on her cuz i can't deal with it anymore, when she made the comment yesterday i told her she wouldn't have to worry because i would never allow her to watch my son, and that i wouldn't ask her for a damn thing, which i have never done to begin with.  I just don't understand what the hell her problem is and i don't know what to do about it.  It's not like i can avoid going over there because my hubby wants to visit with his father who is a wonderful man and his 2 younger sisters.  Any advice, i'm down to the point where i won't go with him or i'll sit in the car and then he gets upset because he feels rushed and i want him to spend time with his dad because he isn't in the greatest health right now.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated
20090204114557AA1U98o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does anybody have a picture of a dirty diaper (not as sick as it sounds)?	okay. as some of you may know, my 6 month old has a medical condition. part of it is that his pancreas doesnt work properly. so he needs enzymes with each bottle. im supposed to determine the amount of enzymes based on his bowel movements. the problem is that ive never been a baby person so ive never seen an actual "normal" dirty baby diaper before. ive gotten them to be less yellow in color, and more of what i think it a normal smell and less greasy but im still not sure if its correct or if i should be giving more enzymes.       can anybody help me out? would anyone happen to have a picture? or be able to describe in detail what a correct bowel movement should look like at around 6 months?

I've suffered from back pain for years now, but for some reason this pregnancy didn't make it worse until yesterday my feet are so swollen and aching , the lower pain is painful,and I'm getting these funny feelings and slightly sharp pains in my private area. tho my whole lower body has been paining for weeks now, i can hardly turn/get up from my bed without a huge pain in my lower body. i haven't bothered to call the midwifes at the hospital or anything cos i still feel pretty good (besides the pain in my lower body meaning my hips and lower lol). i just want to know has anyone experienced this?

20090202115104AASpbmq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does anyone else feel trapped between two worlds?	My fiancé and I decided to have a baby.  It was all planned and we worked incredibly hard to make one (it took 5 months of negative tests and heartache).  The silly thing is we're both at university (I'm 21, he's 30) but we couldn't wait.  I went back to university at the beginning of the semester with a 4 week old baby and thought it was fine, I'd manage.  (At the time I decided not to take a year out as he slept all the time and thought it would be better to get it over with).  The lecturers even let me take Lukas in on the condition I left if he woke up.  I managed to have him fed and ready for a nap every time and in 4 months never had to leave once as he slept through each lecture!!        Now he's 5 months and a proper little person with his own opinions and his own very loud voice!  Semester 2 is starting and I spent the last couple of weeks ploughing through assignments and reading to get through exam period.  I'm just coming to terms with the fact that if I want to have this degree, I'm going to have to put him in childcare.  I only have 5 hours per week of lectures but there's still so much work to do outside that, plus keeping the house inhabitable and getting through piles of laundry!       The thought of leaving him with someone else makes my stomach turn - I've left him briefly with friends or family, but actually paying a stranger to look after him racks me with guilt.  I have to get through the last 4 months of university (even more so now for his sake), but I just want to be with him every second!  It's like a constant battle everyday choosing between university and Lukas.  I suppose this is pretty much what being a working mother is, right?  The ironic part is now I'm studying so I can have a good job and provide him with everything he needs, but 99% of me wants to be a stay at home mum!        Anyone else feeling the tug of war?

20090205101226AAAkCpa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	16 year old has 7 children...?	Should she get more assistance? Argentina has already given her land and built a house for her when her first set of triplets were born. She had a son at 14, triplets at 15, then another set at 16. She was only referred to as Pamela, and her mother has a job cleaning houses. The mother (16 year olds mom) reportedly said, after being asked what they were going to do, seek more assistance.       Do you think they should get more assistance?       I'm on the fence. No fertility drugs were taken, so 7 kids came from 3 pregnancies. So, while she's too young to have even been pregnant 3 times, she didn't actually go out and seek having 7 kids. Plus, I feel better knowing that even if the mother was in the wrong, her kids are being taken care of. They don't deserve to do without just because of their mother.

She also told me that I'm not getting presents, and I'm not allowed to even acknowledge that it's my birthday. I'm not even a bridesmaid and my whole family honestly does hate me, they've called me a fat whore to my face and have told me I don't belong in the family yet my mother insists that I should be glad to spend the day with people who actually love me. Should I just get totally dolled up and outdo her or should I dress like a total skank? I'm not sure that I want to just sit there and pretend it's not my sixteenth birthday and dress down like she wants me too because I'm prettier than her. She already has tried to tell me what to wear, and it sounded uber disgusting.

The only good thing is I dont need a referal for any specialist.

I found out I was pregnant and he begged me to let him come home.  Being a complete dumb A, I let him.  He stayed for about a week then walked out on me again, telling me to get an abortion and that right now the baby is nothing and unwanted.     Over the weekend I started to have some problems with bleeding, went to my doc this morning and got some news that my ex feels entitled to know.  Morally I know I should probably share the info with him, but he walked away from me basically informing me that our marriage is unimportant and to kill our child.   SHOULD I keep him informed and legally do I have to?  part of our argument this morning when I told him to leave me alone, was him telling me that he has the right as my husband and father to the baby to know what is happening with my body.

I was told at 16 weeks with both of my boys and clearly saw their little penis but they say it's harder when it's a girl...
20090202115841AAblCr1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Not wanting kids. normal?	Do you think it is too early for someone to decide they don't want kids at the age of 25?  When I say I don't people give me a hard time.  But I just know it's not what I want from my life.        Can one be sure of this at the age of 25?  Also do you think it will be a relationship breaker for me?

20090202122740AAA5VRR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Where can I find a decent/affordable shopping cart cover?	Well it literally kills my husband and I to pack our son in his infant carrier. When our taxes come back we are getting him a convertible seat. I would like to get one of those infant shopping cart covers. I want something that fits a variety of carts.          1. Doesnt have to be to flashy. Just with some bright colors. So he will like sitting there   2. Only willing to spend about 20 bucks on the cover   3. Has the option of a 3 point or 5 point harness buckle.    4. Decently padded for comfort   5. Easy to clean, wash and maybe 2 toys attached to it       My son will sit up but he hasnt learned how to get his own self to sit up. My husband and I have to set him there and he will only do it for few seconds. He can hold on and grasp things. SO I figured with the harness thing he will stay in there and be more comfy then having to set in his infant seat the whole time we shop places.

My husband was called over and he and the tech were talking and they talked me into looking. It looks like I'll get a little Brody Alexander after all.

But I don't know what to do from here. I'm due in April and nothing's been put up.    I'm reasking because I asked earlier and only got one answer.  I don't suppose you guys like me very much.

20090205110107AAQCpaS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	The surgery for a clogged tear duct?	My son is 8 months old, and his tear ducts have been clogged since he was a couple of months old.  Every morning we wake up to the crusty eyelids and eyelashes, with the greenish matter.  We have been doing the massage to try to open it up, and we used drops at one point, but as soon as we stopped them, the goop came back.      I know that these cases sometimes resolve themselves by a year old, but if it does not, he's going to have to have the surgery to correct it.      I would like to hear from moms/dads who had little ones that needed the surgery.  I have several questions...      1.  Did your baby have to be put under general anesthesia for this procedure?      2.  Was it out-patient at a hospital, or done in your pediatrician's office?      3.  What is the recovery like?        4.  Did your little one seem to be in any pain from the procedure?      5.  Did the surgery completely resolve the problem?      I am so scared of the general anesthesia idea.  He is so little, and I know that things happen under G.A.  I am so scared that they will take him from me, put him under, and that he won't wake up.  If anyone can ease my fears there, it would be much appreciated!      Thank you in advance!

I haven't had hardly any morning sickness. Before i knew i was pregnant i had 2 beers (i counldn't keep it down) and smoked cigaretes and smoked weed. I found out i was pregnant by the 10th week. Since then i've quit smoking. I don't have the greatest diet I have a lot of sugar during the day if i don't i get really lightheaded and sick. I don't have any kind of diabetes. not even gestational. I've had a UTI in the begining. My baby moves around and kicks a lot and i love it. I have gained 33 lbs already and he's growing really good. The Drs say i'm really healthy and the baby looks and sounds healthy too. I don't have any kind of pains. No strechmarks. I've never had heartburn during this pregnancy. I've barely had morning sickness.  i haven't followed any diet. i wouldn't say i'm a good eater i eat out a lot and don't pick the best meals. But does this mean that my baby is still going to be really healthy?

I'm 11 DPO today!   Right after O I had light on and off cramping til about 4 DPO   5-8 DPO- Nothing   9 & 10 DPO- I had spotting once when I wiped and that was it, my temps still remained high!   Also last night I had a hot flash, I almost felt like I was going to faint, I got all sweaty and light headed, so I sat on the couch and drank ice cold water. It was fine like 5 mins after.   I've also been having tender breasts & nipples since about 8DPO.    I know these could be PMS symptoms as well and I'm not stressing about them at all... the hot flash is what threw me off besides the fact I had spotting, high temps and what appears to be a triphasic chart.

20090202122131AAPfc4h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What's up with birth control effectiveness??? Makes no sense.?	I hear things like "birth control works about 99% of the time." This is insanity. That means you'll get pregnant after having sex 100 times? It's 1 / 100?      I've then heard that it's on a per-year basis.. e.g., you'd have a 1% change of getting pregnant when having sex for a year. This GREATLY depends on how often your having sex though. What if I'm doing it 1-2 times a day and the statistics are for people doing it 3 times a week?      Someone please clear this up for me.. I think in strict mathematical terms.      Thanks to the genious who knows this one

20090204114928AA6YEh8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why does nursing hurt?	Why after 3 or 4 days does nursing hurt?  I've had 3 beautiful kids and all three of them were like this and after the third day nursing it became so painful.  I stuck it out as long as I could but I eventually wasn't producing any milk.  All I can figure is that I was so stressed that I dried up.  I've had a lactation consultation's help with two of my children and they said that I was doing it right.  So, why does it hurt so bad that I cry during nursing?  I'm pregnant with our fourth child and formula isn't something I want to do.  PLEASE help me.  Thanks so much.

20090205101339AAURNLS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Best timing for 2nd child?	My husband and I have a 5-month-old and we are sure we want another child.  I'm already 32 and I'd like to have my children by the time I'm 35 latest.  I read that the optimal time to get pregnant with the next child is 15 to 23 months after giving birth to the first.  That would put us between Nov 2009 and July 2010.  However, I am a professor and would like to try to conceive at a time when I could have the baby over the summer which means either July 2009 or July 2010.  My husband is pulling for July 2009.  My daughter would be 11 months when we start trying to conceive (took us 3 months last time) so she'd be at least 20 months by the time baby #2 is born.      Okay, that's the background detail, now here are the questions.      1) Is your body ready to support another pregnancy 11 months after you give birth?  Has anyone had any complications from getting pregnany too soon?      2) Did any of you have a second child when your first was younger than 2 years of age and how did the first child take it?  How did he/she handle having your divided attention afterwards?      Thanks in advance!
20090205101516AAZjdL0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ok so last night i had unprotect sex with her on the pill, can she get pregnant if she stops using pill after?	I had sex with this girl i've been seeing, she saids she's taking birth control so i came in her and she thinks were going out but i don't want to go out with her. I don't want her to get pregnant and i want to tell her i don't have feelings. But what i am worried about is that they say the sperm can live up to 72 hours in a girl so can she still get pregnant if she gets mad at me and stops taking the pills after she finds out?.

I really haven't dwelled on it but the last few days put the idea in my head and I am wondering if this is something or nothing... I didn't take a test yet, I am due on Sun and want to wait to be late to prevent false negs... But I came home Tues feeling run down and tired... when I was changing I noticed my breasts are sore, not very but enough that I don't want to lean on them, on tues I had a sandwich for lunch and felt nausea but ate it because I was hungry and it tasted good (weird lol)... on wed night I had a headache and a stuffy nose, diarrhea but not an upset stomach. Same for today... Does this sound like anything? Or did I just catch a virus haha... the doc told my mom I was the flu!! So... it's only fair I get a second opinion haha...

She's throwing up at least once a day (at any given time, but mostly right after a meal, and it's not just the spit up kind, it's the gagging until it's all out of her stomach kind).  She's also tugging on her ears a lot, but not in discomfort (or so it seems).        I must add she was small at birth (6 lb 5.5 oz, 19.3 in) and now weighs 14 lb 15 oz, and her height is 27.2 in)
20090205102847AAp0rNn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	2nd time taking Plan B, a bit afraid.?	Okay, here's my story.   One year ago, April 1, 2008 I took Plan B as a precaution, as I didn't have sex with my boyfriend, but he ejaculated near my v. I am on a regulated cycle which always happends on the 19th. After taking the Plan B, my period arrived on April 7th instead. Less than a week after taking the pill.      This year, I have actually had sex on January 20, 2009. I still haven't gotten on regular birth control yet, so I took Plan B on Jan. 23rd. My period changed dates ever since I took Plan B last year and I normally get my period on the 9th of every month. Today is Feb. 5th, and still no sign of a period. does Plan B normally do this? it has no set date when you will get your period? i'm quite afraid right now and don't know what to do.       The letter in the box said that it was fine to take within the 72 hour limit and the nurse had asked me when I had sex as well, so she knew it's been 3 days. we used a condom and everything, but this was still an extra precaution. Once I get my period, and know that everything is okay, I will get on birth control, so please, don't lecture.    FYI: I am 20 years old.
20090205104634AAUDebE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How should I handle this situation?(vegetarian-friendly parents ONLY please)?	My daughter, who is 3 1/2, and I live with my mother and the rest of the family for the time being, and an issue has risen I don't really know how to deal with.      See, I myself am a vegan, and whenever I'm there I feed my daughter the same way. The thing is, there's no way to gaurantee she's getting the same fare when I'm at school(I've come home on several occasions to find her seated in front of chicken nuggets and root beer). So,   when my mom or siblings gives her meat or milk or absolute trash foods, how do I handle that?   I've spoken with my mom about it several times, and she thinks it's "ridiculous nonsense" or "you can't expect her to turn into some freak like you". And my siblings side with her because it's her house.   On the other side of the coin, when they do give my daughter these things...do I let her have it because she's already got it?(like "taking candy from a baby") Or do I take it away from her?   I'm at school most of the day and in that time everyone else around her is eating these foods, how do I explain it to her that "mommy and Iris know better, but grandma doesn't" without getting her all mixed up?         Btw we are moving by the end of the year...this is all just in the meantime...      Thanks =)

20090205105250AAN7lT9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Warning!  This one's going to get graphic!?	Just a bit ago, my son asked me when he was going to get his period.  Actually he asked me when he was going to get his "bleed" and after a bunch of questions I determined that that is what he was talking about.  Throughout this conversation I was also asked if I pee out of my tush since I don't have a peenie.  Great.  So I just thought since I was tortured with this conversation I would torture you all as well.        Here's my question(s)   What kind of uncomfortable or funny anatomy questions have you been asked?      And what would your answers have been to mine.  And how exactly would you keep a straight face through it....because I had a hard time.

Does Clomid usually make your period late? I was on 100 mg days 5-9, and I didn't use opk's because my husband said I was obsessed. I started my period on Jan 4th, and I usually have 28 cycle days, I am now almost 4 days late. I got a BFN on Jan 25, 27, and 30...I am afraid to test again.   I have very sore breasts that have been this way for about 12 days, and I am smelling things that normally don't bother me but make me sick now. My cervix is kinda low and hard, it is also closed, and my cm has been consistantly stretchy/clear/white for about 10 days...what do you think? Pregnant, or paranoid? I really feel pregnant, and this will be my second child, first daughter conceived naturally...I just don't think I can handle another BFN

20090205105446AA1JR6c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	3 year old son will not, has not eaten toddler or table foods!!!?	After many sessions with his Ped and referrals to an Occ Therapist and Nutritionist, they basically say "He'll outgrow it."  He still gets most of his nourishment from Whole Milk bottles (he gags on sippy cups).  We put rice cereal w/ banana or fruit (about 1/2 cup) in each bottle.  He drinks about 5 7 oz bottles per day!!!      He will occassionally take a Yoplait yogurt (orange flavor) about 5x per week (ie, 1 each day for 5 out of 7 days of the week).  He will take Chicken Noodle Soup, but just the noodles not the carrot or chicken pieces.  And, ,.. definately NOT a whole can.  Maybe 1/4 - 1/3 of the can of soup.  Once each week, when the family has spaghetti -- he will have some, but only about 2 handfuls or less.      He won't take toddler puffs, cereal, goldfish crackers, banana pieces or other yogurt flavors.  Very little juice.      He mimics playing with the pretend food - and even pretends to cook it for himself or us.       He has 4 other older silblings (12, 10, 8, and 6 years).  We try a reward system, playing the "Oooo...this is yummy, do you want to try some?" game.  He didn't even try his birthday cakes at 1 and 2 years.      Note*  At around 15 to 18 months, I do have memory of him grabbing a potato chip and putting right in his mouth, but he proceeded to have a gagging and choking fit!!!  He's had a hyper gag reflex as a baby with bottles, and now has night fits of what appears to be GERD or acid reflux which he coughs, cries and vomits a BUNCH.  No fever and back to normal activity by morning.      He is very bright, not autistic at all.  Speaks like a 4 year old and makes great eye contact, etc.  When he sees babies on Funny Videos or on YouTube eating... I hear him say "No... baby's gonna choke!"      My insurance is Kaiser (I work for Kaiser)... and they've closed his case stating, "He'll outgrow this picky phase".  PICKY???  How can he be picky if he has no idea what food tastes like??      I am so very worried.  He's supposed to start daycare after he turns 3 (which is in April)...but I am worried he just won't eat, and get very sick.      He also won't take the yogurt or soup from anyone but me (mommy)... not dad, grandma or grandpa (who watch him while I am at work).  It's getting very exhausting!!

20090205110812AAJEFc7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why do i resent my new baby?	I am a new Dad. I am 38 years old and have been with my partner for over 10 years. I am lucky enough to be fairly financially stable and don't have too many worries in life. I have travelled extensively, have a good (but boring!) job and to all intents and purposes have what everyone would percieve as a "normal" life. When my partner announced she was pregnant we were both excited. Our baby is now 4 months old and i can't stand the sight of him. I can't stand the noise, the upheaval, the mess and all the disruption to my life. I really resent the baby taking up my time. I am sick of my partner only talking about baby things. I am really disappointed in myself because I thought that I would feel so different. I know it sounds awful, but if I could turn back the clock and not have him, I would.   How can I change my attitude to make myself feel happy about this gift i have been given? Please someone, help me!

My daughter is watching Happy Feet so I'm sitting on the pc. I was wondering how much are you weighing at now? How far along are you? No need to be ashamed as we all aren't weighing what we used to! (o:      For myself..pre-pregnant size I weighed in at 130lbs, my last appointment which was Tuesday I weighed in at 180lbs (exactly). Yikes!      With my daughter my pre-pregnant weight was 120lbs and the the highest I went was 178lbs. So I beat myself out with this pre-pregnancy!      Btw, I'm 39 weeks and 5 days today and being induced on Monday!

20090205114035AAxplXc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents who let their children use pacifiers...has you child ever become obsessed with that one magical paci?	I let my son use a pacifier.  He's not addicted to, but he really likes it when he's overtired or waiting for his bottle.      We have a variety of different pacifiers- we have Avent and MAM, we have Born Free- and they are different shapes and sizes (even though they are labeled the same size, naturally different brands with vary).      My son will happily take any one of them when we wants one- so that's nice.  We're never chasing after that one "magical" one.      I don't have a plan how long I'll let him use one- but I imagine (and hope by 2 at the very latest he'll grow out of it)-    I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced that- where the child will only be satisfied if they got that one particualr paci- and if so, what age did it start??

20090205113822AA3ngMH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Do you think people overstress about potty training?	Do you think it is correct that all theses books, pediatricians, talk show hosts, and self-help gurus put an age on when a child should be potty trained? And if the child does not get it right by that age, then declare that something is wrong with the child developmentally. If an otherwise healthy and properly developing child is not potty trained by a certain number of months, do you think it is more detrimental to the child to then push because something must be "wrong"? Or is it better to just give encouragement and let the child do it when he/she is ready? Especially considering that, I mean, come on, I dont think there is ANYONE who (barring handicaps, physical problems, etc) are not potty trained as adults simply because they just never could LEARN HOW TO!!

20090205111345AAkR56v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What is wrong with me is this normal?	i am 16 years old.    when i was little around 10 i was cute. people woudl stop and point at me and whisper awww and annoying stuff like that and although it made me uncomfortable i was still ok with my appearance most of the time.    when i turned 12 i becaem extremely unattractive pretty much overnight. and i still am i think that i am the most disgusting person alive. sometimes i feel ok about myself and then i pass a mirror and i want to kill myself and i want to die. i try to avoid any reflections of myself and when i see photographs of myself i sometimes start crying and imagine killing myself. when i am around people i feel very bad for them for having to look at me so i try to cover my face when they speak to me. i also wear hoodies to school and sometimes hats and wear them for as long as i can get away with it. when people look at me i feel ashamed and disgusting i feel this heavy feeling in my chest and i get kind of butterflies but not the same and feel like crying and dying at the same time. the other day in sociology class we were talkign about suicide among the french in the 1800s and how they found that it was more common among protestants than catholics, and she asked us if we knew why but no one did and she said that it was a sin in catholicism but not in protestantism. i dont know why but that made me feel a bit relieved since i am a protestant but i always feel so guilty and i just want to move to the desert without telling anyone and dying out there and when someone finds me, they obviously wont ever find the exact location of where i come from so no one would ever know. ever since i was little i have found the idea of a funeral quite embarrassing for me bcause its like forcing people to all gather around me, it would make everyone uncomfortable. i have read that cutting yourself in the bathtub is like falling asleep but i wouldnt be able to do that i dont think because someone would walk in and see it and it would be awful    anyaway i am sorry this is os long but i am just asking and i am just very lonely and emotional as i have no friends or a social life and people say that i am boring and mock me behind my back

20090205112752AAFpWj6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How would you feel if you had a set of bi-paternal twins?	I was watching a dna testing episode of Maury last week. One woman had twins and as the dna test revealed had two different fathers. Upon further research this is called bi-paternal twins. In order for this to happen the woman has to ovulate twice in a month and have "relations"with more than one man in a short period. Fraternal twins make up 2% of the worlds population and bi-paternal twins make up 1 in 12 of fraternal twins.   So after knowing this, would you be proud to have beaten such statistical odds or would you be ashamed that everyone would know you got around?   * I should be doing homework instead of researching what I watched on Maury last week.

20061206132317AAH3G8Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Anyone recently told your child may be Autistic?	I'm in the process of getting my 5 yr old evaluated.  My son's public elementary school took several test after his PreK teacher made hints he's disruptive in class, she couldn't settle him down, she thought he was ADD and didn't speak much.  So the speech pathologist intervened and now she think its much more than that. After they did several test (off record because public schools can't make diagnosis) she and the others who conducted the test believe he may have a high functioning form of Autism. At times I want to think he'll grow out of it but then I'll read things on Autism and I say to myself my son does that too, i.e. repeats over & over commercials or movies scenes, does the repetative behaviour in front of people and shows no social awkwardness about it.  He has a hard time breaking routines.      My son just seems a little different, his speech isn't developed like kids his age but he can write his name, good with flash cards. Has rare eye contact and words are jumbled up?

20070104151625AAn8HhR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it possible to be a parent but to not like kids other than your own?	I never thought I'd be a Mom and now that I am one I can honestly say that I love my son with all of my heart & soul.  But I still have no interest what so ever in other kids.  I have nieces & nephews but can't be bothered by them.  When people talk about their kids I find my mind wandering off to grocery lists or only thinking about my child.  I could care less about other kids.   Is there anyone else out there like this?  Will this maybe change when my son gets to be older & then there will be more kids around?     Please no abuse...I know it is shallow & unkind but I just want to know if there is anyone else out there like me
