20090219172115AAeXVi8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do You Think We Are Seeing A Decline in the Popularity of Emo Rock?	Perhaps i am just being delusional in my wish for that genre to die and since I am in my mid-20's, it is difficult for me to know what the middle school and high school kids are listening to these days but from my vantage point, there seems to be hints of a real decline in emo rock's popularity.       It is clearly still around but I just don't hear about those bands, like My Chemical Romance or Fall Out Boy, as much as I did maybe 2 years ago. I haven't really seen any new emo bands really gain popularity like we saw around 2005 or 2006. Even if that genre is still popular, do you think we are starting to see the long awaited decline emo rock's popularity or is it spreading like some horrible plague?

Being the dummy that he is, he decides to buy a Parrot so it can tell him what his wife does while he is away.  When he goes to the pet store, there is only one parrot left and its hanging upside down.  Bob asks the store owner why is the parrot upside down.  The owner replies"he was born without claws, but he learned to hang on the pole by curling his penis around it.  Being the only parrot there, Bob decides to buy him.  On the way home Bob pours his heart out to the parrot and asks the parrot if he'll help him spy on his wife.  The parrot, feeling sorry for Bob and grateful for the new home, agrees.  Well, for the first few days the parrot has no bad news for Bob.  Bob of course is happy to hear it.  On the fourth day Bob notices the parrot is very sad.  He asks the parrot whats wrong, and the parrot replies "I have bad news"  Bob says "well out with it" The parrot says " the mailman came over today, and he was touching your wife, then he kissed her, then he took off her clothes." The parrot stops and Bob asks "and then what happened?"  And the parrot says I don't know, I got a hard on and fell off the pole.

We bought it, only to find out that it was a prank and they had put cartoons on half of the discs. He can't get his money back. And now he can't watch the show at all. So I was wondering, does anyone know where we can buy the entire disc set of Family Matters at a reasonable price and from a reliable company? We have looked EVERYWHERE for it and still can't find it. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. (:

20090203111308AAiTb42	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R - Possible casting spoiler?	Though I don't buy the magazine, I've heard that the latest issue of Soaps in Depth has an article about a Y&R Starlet Recast, with a Picture of Christel Khalil next to it.      Now take a look at the video in the link I've posted.  Judging by the unmistakable looks of the actress, it seems that Christel Khalil is indeed being replaced, and this new actress, Monet Stunson, is being cast as Lily Winters.  Who else would she be auditioning for?       http://www.kmov.com/video/?z=y&nvid=3210...       I hope so; though she said she's never had any acting experience -  more like modelling - at this point, anyone could be a better replacement for Christel Khalil.  If she is being cast as Lily, I think Monet Stunson will make this character a lot more mature, a lot less whiney and dependent, and will basically be an improvement on the Lily character.  Opinions, please?

As a big fan I feel somewhat disappointed and hope the new album is not much of the same. The first track released usually is the best so I worry what the rest of the new album may be like. With the last album the first released track Vertigo blew you away and the album itself certainly was great.   U2 are known for re-inventing themselves and have done this excellently with Achtung Baby & How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, but have also done it badly with Zooropa, Pop and to a degree All that you can't Leave Behind. I guess I may just be from the U2 old school of rock, please comment.

20090219181337AAqoVD6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Why do people think 50 cent is one of the worse in the game?	I know he's fallen off a bit with all his publicity stunts and pop songs, but overall, he's still putting out hot stuff. Power of the dollar was a classic, GRODT was a classic, The Massacre, IMO, was comparable to Ready to Die just by the storytelling and gritty dark beats, and even though Curtis was a let down from those albums, it was still good too and overlooked. People automatically think 50 cent is garbage because he put out a few songs to appeal to the club scene, but what rapper doesn't do that? And it's not like all his songs are like that. I just think he's underrated a bit, even though he's not one of the best. Also, i suggest you read his book "From Pieces to weight". It's very informational and you'll learn alot about 50 and will respect him more. Opinions on this?

20090220164102AAcbl7t	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	When are Hannah Montana songs "It's All Right Here" and "Supergirl" going to be released?	Disney Channel was using "It's All Right Here" as the promotion song for the third season of Hannah Montana, and in the episode "You Never Give Me My Money" a little girl is singing "Supergirl". Yet these songs are not on the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack, which I thought was doubling as the Hannah Montana 3 soundtrack. I've never known a Hannah Montana song not to be officially released on an album, so I thought this was fishy. Especially since "It's All Right Here" was used heavily in ads for the show. Why would they not release this song? Another song I've heard online but that was not released is "I'm Just A Girl."

And the wierd thing is is that i went to IMDB to look at whats going to play on MTV in the next few days and it didn't even show Degrassi in the time slots from 3pm-8pm from the marathon today. So i'm confused and i'm pretty much addicted to Degrassi now and i was wondering if someone could tell me the time Degrassi (season 8) premieres new episodes or even re runs and what station it usually shows it on.

20090220223907AAXcc3Q	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Who are Spider Man's 10 most dangerous Enemies?	Rule They must be apart of his major rogues gallery, and they must have first appeared in the comics.       Here is a link in case you don't know them.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Spi...       In my view these are Spider Man's 10 most dangerous major enemies.      1.Carnage He's as psychotic, and insane as the Joker. One that thrives on murder, and chaos. He's so dangerous that Spider Man has had to team up with one of his major enemies Venom (Eddie Brock). Had the Big Apple in major trouble with Maximum Carnage.   2.Green Goblin The master of being nasty, and one of Spider Man's most infamous foes. He's made his goal to destroy Spider Man's life, and has enjoyed doing that including having Gwen Stacy killed, and using Spider Man's known secret identity to torture him.   3.Venom (Eddie Brock) The antithesis of Spider Man that  has the delusional belief he's good, and Spider Man is the villain. Basically seems like Spidey on steroids, knows who Spidey is, and can block his spider sense. Another psychopath that made it his goal to destroy Spider Man.   4.The Kingpin Basically seems like a bad version of the American Dream. He's shrewd, calculating, nefarious, and has been causing trouble for the Amazing Spider Man, and Man without Fear Daredevil. With nearly unlimited resources he's been a thorn in Spidey's side. and nearly killed him.   5.Doctor Octopus He's the Mad Scientist, and has used his brillance for evil. He defeated Spidey in his first appearnce, and the wall crawler was considering giving up until Human encouraged not to. His four tentacles are more than enough to give Spidey plenty of trouble which they have done.   6.The Lizard One of Spidey's friends Curt Connors is the savage beast known as the Lizard. The Dr.Jekel Mr.Hyde personality make him dangerous to Peter, and all others near Curt Connors. Given the webhead a run for his money.   7. Mysterio What better way to discredit Spider Man than to frame him. With a hatred for Spider Man he's been able to give the webhead plenty of problems despite no super powers. He even fooled Spidey through a illusion that senior citizens were some of his most dangerous foes.   8. The Jackal Another case of brillance being used for evil rather than good, and a scientist gone mad. He manage to mislead the Punisher to kill his hated foe Spider Man, and like the Green Goblin he is aimed at destroying Spider Man.  Add in he cloned Spidey, and Gwen Stacy.   9. Scorpion He wants to destroy Spider Man, and J Jonah Jameson. Add in he's insane. To cross the Scoropion is to risk getting stinged.    10. Morlun He's able to tell where Spider Man is, and sucks the energy from mutants to survive. Tore out Spidey's eye then ate it, and then broke Mary Jane's arm.

20090220171306AAlTunU	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Where the heck did the herpes rumor start?(CB+Rhianna)?	Does any one know where the rumor that CB beat up Rhianna because she gave him herpes started? Why are people acting like that's 100% true?      I think it's so stupid. Every single report on TV/Internet said the altercation was over either another woman or texts from other girls. Plus, people need to remember that only she, CB, and the LAPD know for sure what happened.      I seriously doubt Rhianna gave CB herpes. It's not like you see her out acting slutty.   If anything, if she did have it--I bet he gave it to her. He's the player. I mean if he finds out he has herpes, what's to stop him from saying "Oh, I got it from you". When in fact he could've gotten it from one of his little groupies and then GIVEN it to her. It seems like it never occurred to people that he could be the liar.

Plus, (and I might be imagining things or remembering wrong) I faintly remember watching an episode when Jiraiya told Naruto that he reminded him of his student, the forth, since they looked alike and had similar personalities. But I don't remember Jiraiya telling him it was his dad or Naruto already knowing....

20090220224840AAtsKVx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Country	Country song help needed!?	I'm looking for a country song, probably from the 80's or early 90's. It's by a male singer, and in the video of it he has shoulder length, wavy brown hair, with a cowboy hat, and a sleeveless shirt. The song is about when the singer was a boy he saw his dad help a guy (I think it was a guy) with his car, and at the end of the song the boy is grown up and is helped with his car by the same guy who his dad helped. It's about paying it forward. It's kind of like Clay Walker's Chain Of Love. The chorus is short, if I remember right, and he talks about going down a road. I think the point of it was if you go down this road and help people. people will come back up the road and help you. I wish I could remember more. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! This is driving me nuts lol.       I've been looking online to see if I can find anything to help trigger my memory, but so far-no luck.

20090220181341AAQd8Vj	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Grey's Antmony: Izzy Stevens?	(yes I know I spelt it wrong..always do lol)      Is anyone else going to miss Izzy as much as me? I know that she wanted to work on movies, because she makes more money. Though I read that she had gotten a raise on Greys and even tried to get the actor that plays 'George, whom is one of her best friends' to complain about his pay so that he'd get a raise also. But then now she has cancer? Sad she is one of my favorite characters. I think that Izzy is the heart of the group, she is the one that cares the most. Love everything about her, the actress, Izzy's personality, her being George's best friend, all her boyfriends, that's shes so caring, her and her activities, her and her baking, her walking around in her panties is amusing. Everything. I love Katherine s movies, but I'm so pissed that she is probably leaving Greys. It just annoys me when people get their characters killed off. When they can just take breaks and come back.      Alright I'm rambling. Just curious to see if anyone else is mad that she is most likely leaving the show.

Some of it might be   "There's a party to-night . . . "   "at 6 o'clock I'm walkin ou-t the gate"      Any ideas anybody, I'm stuck on this one . . . . .

20090220225454AAEEt4U	Entertainment & Music;Radio	Recently i heard a radio ad for Connecticut School Of Broadcasting and was slightly intrigued. Should i pursue?	I've always loved radio. I know sports,music,politics,pop culture and current events well enough to shoot the breeze with anyone. My diction,tone and inflection has led old classmates of mine to urge me to get into radio. I work so hard everyday and not only do i hate what i do i also have very little to show for it.      Maybe i can actually be good enough to do something that i always wanted to do and get payed nicely for it. That has got to be a charmed life.      Or maybe i fail and have even less then i have now.      Is it worth me putting all of my life's effort to achieve a childhood dream at the risk of losing the little that i currently have?

20090221011954AAPrMyk	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Why should men (not) write advice columns?	Dear Terry,       I hope you can help me. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help. When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbour's daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbour's daughter is 19. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past six months. I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was made redundant six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore. Can you please help?       Sincerely,       Sarah                                ______________________________________         Dear Sarah:       A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no debris in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.       I hope this helps,       Terry

20090221013129AAg3nA9	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What is your characteristic------post-paid type or pre-paid type?	In my country the cellphone providers allow two categories of services:    1) Post Paid: You deposit a certain amount, collect your sim-card, use upto a certain limitation, paying a little anount as line-pent. Even you may cross the deposit limit. You'll be billed monthly. That's all   2) Pre Paid: You buy a card (say $100 or $50 or $300) & use till the said amount ends. Then you have to buy card again. No card, No service.    From a bizarre thought an idea came to my mind that we are also like those cellphone services! At least some of our characteristics are like "POST PAID" or "PRE-PAID" type.... say for example, I myself is a pre-paid type :D

20090220234015AANYmxe	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Joke time-kinda dumb but funny?	It's Halloween and everyone's out trick-or-treating. A bartender is working the late-night shift at the bar. He looks outside and sees everyone in crazy costumes. He sighs and picks up a glass and starts cleaning it.   At around midnight, a guy in a vampire costume walks in and sits at the bar. He says to the bartender "Hi. I'm a vampire and I'd like a cup of human blood please."   The bartender looks at him skeptically. "No you're not. You're just wearing a costume."   "No, no, really," he insists. "I'm a vampire and I'd like a cup of human blood please."   "Alright," the bartender says. He goes in the back and comes out with a cup of blood. He gives it to the vampire who drinks it right away.   "Thanks," he says, and leaves.   An hour later another vampire comes in and sits at the bar. He says "Hi, I'm a vampire and I'd like a cup of human blood please."   "Okay," the bartender says and goes in the back again. He comes out with another cup of blood. He gives it to the vampire who drinks it and leaves with a 'thanks'.   An hour later a third vampire comes in and sits at the bar. "Hi," he says to to the bartender. "I'm a vam..."   "I know, I know," the bartender interrupts. "You're a vampire and you want a cup of blood right?"   "Um, no," the vampire answers. "I AM a vampire, but I'd just like a glass of hot water please."   "Sure" the bartender says. He pours him a glass of hot water. As he gives it to the vampire he says "You know, there were two vampires that came in before you that wanted blood. How come you're just asking for water?"   Without answering the vampire reaches into his pocket and pulls out a used band-aid.      "Tea time."

Just put your ear up to my thigh, you'll hear it!"    The doctor cautiously placed his ear to the man's thigh only to hear, "Gimme 20 bucks, I really need 20 bucks."       "I've never seen or heard anything like this before, how long has this been going on." The doctor asked.       "That's nothing Doc. put your ear to my knee."       The doctor put his ear to the man's knee and heard it say "Man, I really need 10 dollars, just lend me 10 bucks!!"       "Sir, I really don't know what to tell you. I've never seen anything like this." The doctor was dumbfounded.       "Wait Doc, that's not it. There's more, just put your ear up to my ankle," the man urged him.       The doctor did as the man said and was blown away to hear his ankle plead, "Please, I just need 5 dollars. Lend me 5 buck please if you will."       I have no idea what to tell you," the doctor said. "There's nothing about it in my books," he said as he frantically searched all his medical reference books. "I can make a well educated guess though."       "Based on life and all my previous experience I can tell you that your leg seems to be broke in three places."

See this map? I want these countries to stop fighting with each other and I want all the Arabs to love the Jews and Americans and vice-versa. It will bring about world peace and harmony.      The genie looked at the map and exclaimed, 'Lady, be reasonable. These countries have been at war for thousands of years. I'm out of shape after being in a bottle for five hundred years.. I'm good but not THAT good! I don't think it can be done. Make another wish and please be reasonable.'   The woman thought for a minute and said, ' Well, I've never been able to find the right man. You know - one that's considerate and fun, romantic, likes to cook and help with the house cleaning, is good in bed, and gets along with my family, doesn't watch sports all the time, and is faithful. That is what I wish for...a good man.'   The genie let out a SIGH, rolled his eyes and said, 'Let me see the f*cking map again.'

The singer has a voice where you really have to listen to him before understanding the words. I think it starts out something like "This is my jam" another verse is "throw your hands in the air air" Only the word air sounds like ainer ainer due to the singer making it sound that way. It is a great song if i could just figure it out. A good song to dance to as well. It seems to be pretty popular right now.

Can someone who is using/has used this program give me a straight, honest answer as to how good it is?      And if you have taken vocal lessons from either Brett himself, or any of his associates (especially Sophie Shear...I am looking deeply into lessons with her possibly), then please, do mention so, and please tell me how they are, an approximate cost, etc.      Finally, if you live near Nashville/Dickson/Clarksville, and you know of any other great vocal coaches in the areas, please mention their names.      Please no negative or irrelevant answers.      Thank you so much to everyone who helps! <3

20090221011457AAH1f64	Entertainment & Music;Movies	If u had to give one message to danny boyle(SDM), what would it be?	I would say "It took a lot of courage and intelligence to make a movie like slumdog millionaire, we are forever indebted to you for your effort of bringing in awareness of poverty".       This movie has changed my prejudiced thinking and made me look at poverty in a different light, not sympathetic but empathetic. The next time i see a slum kid, its not just money or food that i will give but appreciation and care.

POEM: This is supposed to be a shape poem for my english class, and it's supposed to be in the shape of a raindrop. So if it looks all ****** up, then you know why. And remember, I'm only 14 mind you :)                                                      If I                                              were rain,                                       That joins the sky                                       and the Earth,that                                    otherwise never touch.                             Could I join two hearts as well?                             If I could fall through the souls                            of the young couples in the park,                          could I also fall through the souls of                     the arguing couple?Could I prevent death,                   encourage hope, cleanse the mind. If I were              rain could I drench the parade turning a celebration         of one day, into the celebration of Gods eternal creation?        If I could speak in the low hum of water dripping off leaves,           then I would sing into the river that catches me. But if I             were rain, let me sacrifice the heavens to the earth,                    So everyone, can see what the rain can do.                     Because for those who are unable to see.                       Unable to embrace the rain, let them be                           changed today. For today I speak                              through the rain, and let them                                           understand.         SONG NUMBER 1: IT'S NOT DEPRESSING AND IT'S NOT MEANT TO NOR WILL IT BE DEPRESSING. I also play the guitar and I'm working on finding the melody/chords to this. So yeah.      Just Because You're A Freshman Doesn't Mean You Can't Have Senior Moments    VERSE:   I have apologies on the tip of my tongue,   "I'm sorry that I didn't want to lose you."   Did you forget that you started it?   Don't point at me, I can't break my own heart.   If we were a race, you were the start.   I was the bystander that cheered you on.   But maybe now I'm wishing I shot the gun...   CHORUS:   I'm gazing out my window at night, wishing you were there,   there's no orchard by my house, but if only you could improvise.   Slowly but surely I'm accepting the wind and my sighs as lullabies.   Night after night they become more intense.   I'm high on hope, the hope that I can fix this.   I'm no Maytag repair man, but a poet.   My words make you feel right...   VERSE:   You're a lion, caught in a net,   I'm the mouse, your only hope.   I'll get us out of this mess.   Time travel, at best.   CHORUS:   I'm gazing out my window at night, wishing you were there,   there's no orchard by my house, but only if you could improvise.   Slowly but surely I'm accepting the wind and my sighs as lullabies.   Night after night they become more intense.   I'm high on hope, the hope that I can fix this.   I'm no Maytag repair man, but a poet.   My words make you feel right...   BRIDGE:   Your apologies are filling,   no need for desert.   Just an entree for an encore   of the nights that came before...   CHORUS:   I'm gazing out my window at night, wishing you were there,   there's no orchard by my house, but if only you could improvise.   Slowly but surely I'm accepting the wind and my sighs as lullabies.   Night after night they become more intense.   I'm high on hope, the hope that I can fix this.   I'm no Maytag repair man, but a poet.   My words make you feel right...         SONG NUMBER 2: Same thing goes for song number 1.         Nothing Left To Lose   VERSE:   No need to cry and flood this page with my tears.   I'll let these words say everything I haven't said.   Your mind's the cage, I'm a mouse, trapped and nowhere to go.   You're so cold you turn the rain that falls to snow.   I'm the thunder, and he lights up my sky like you did before,   you're out of luck, and I'm clapping for him to put on an encore...   CHORUS:   If you were a stray, I would leave you out in the cold.   You came my way, with all you'd say, and I was sold.   Tell me again if loving you was a mistake...   We're like china, when we fall, we always break.   And everything I knew was that I fell in love with you.   Losing you, my fear, was the reason for what'd I do.   Memory please...   VERSE:   The way you can love me is a death threat to him,   he lost his chance and his only dance is on the rim   of insanity, it's a state of mind, and by no surprise   he's the capital the fourth graders hate to memorize   If I was a sculptor, I'd make a model of you.   Then I'd knock you over with my mind, I hope you shatter   CHORUS:   If you were a stray, I would leave you out in the cold.   You came my way, with all you'd say, and I was sold.   Tell me again if loving you was a mistake...   We're like china, when we fall, we always break.   And everything I knew was that I fell in love with you.   Losing you, my fear, was the reason for what'd I do.   Memory please...   BRIDGE:   Told myself I'd ever fall again, but you pushed me...   And waiting one year, w

I just saw a movie on MAX (cinemax) in TWC. Its about 2 guys that go over and knock at a house and ask a woman for eggs and she lets them in but then they dont want to leave and when the dad tries to kick them out they break his knee with a golf club. They have no phone and the doors are locked so they're kidnapped in their house. The guys wear white clothes and latex gloves all the time and they just torture the family mentally and physically thru the movie and keep holding the golf club. then the boy (son) tries to run so they shoot him so he dies. then they pretend they leave and the woman tries to run away for help but they get her again and take her back to the house with her husband. then they stab the man...the woman shoots a guy and the second guy rewinds that scene with the remote control and so that doesnt happen. ??? so they shoot the man. then take the woman to shore with a small boat and throw her in the sea. at the end they just go to another house and knock and ask for eggs again.

20090220231016AAfdZ1S	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	I love this song (youtube link inside) and i want more!! help?	Shut up and Explode by Boom Boom Satellites    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR6p4phW2...       ive already checked out Boom Boom Satellites' other songs and albums but surprisingly... none of their other music really sounds like this and is chill electronic stuff. I've tried looking on Pandora for similar artists but it only brings up calm electronic songs/artists..      To me this song has sort of a heavy alternative sound to it. maybe a bit pop/metal ish. I love the upbeat feel of this song. What i want is other songs that have a very similar "feel" and sound.       no i don't want just any upbeat music like happy folk and country songs. I want songs with this same sound, this heavy alternative/electronic sort of sound to it.      ohh!! and if you know what genre (the more specific the better) this particular song fits in that would be great. that would make searching more music similar to this much easier.      thanks for reading!! please help me out here!

So he bought a plane ticket and took a trip to Orlando, thinking that he would start by working his way across the USA from South to North.   On his first day he was inside a church taking photographs when he noticed golden telephone mounted on the wall with a sign that read "$10,000 per call". The American, being intrigued, asked priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for.   The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. The American thanked the priest and went along his way.   Next stop was in Atlanta. There, at a very large cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it. He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in Orlando and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was.She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God. O.K., thank you," said the American. He then travelled to Indianapolis, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. In every church he saw the same golden telephone with the same "$10,000 per call" sign under it.      The American, upon leaving Vermont decided to travel to AUSTRALIA to see if Australians had the same phone. He arrived in Australia, and again, in the first church he entered, there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read "40 cents per call." The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign.   Father, I've travelled all over America and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to Heaven, but in the US the price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?"      The priest smiled and answered, "You're in Australia now, mate - it's a local call".

My friend has had it five times   And said it can be sore".      Then finally contended   Lay back and relax a bit   Quickly and readily he bent over her   And then he started it.      It was growing rather painful   Tears formed in her eyes   It was hurting quite a bit now   It must have been quite a size.      "Calm yourself" he whispered   His face was filled with a grin   "Try and open a bit wider   So I can get it in".      "It's coming now" he whispered   "I know" she cried in bliss   Feeling it deep within her now   She said "I am glad I am having this".      And with a final effort   She gave a frightened shout   He gripped it in anguish   And quickly pulled it out.      She lay back quite contended   Sighed and gave a smile   She said "I'm glad I came now   You made it worth my while".

It is about a guy who is schizophrenic and the person he sees is always telling him to kill people. His daughter also, it turns out, suffers from this. A neighbor takes photographs of him and blackmails him into letting him kill along with him. There is also a female detective after him whom he knows is after him and sends some body part from a cheating boyfriend or husband, he can't remember, as a gift to her.      Does this sound familier to ANYONE? Because for the life of us, we cannot find it through a google search.      Thank you!

20090221013913AAhjwJn	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Does anyone else thinks Dragonball GT was lame and stupid?	Since I was a preteen. Dragonball Z was my favorite show on Cartoon Network. Then when I watched the whole series of Dragonball GT. I find that show was a fuckin waste of time. That show killed it for me when Goku turns to a kid again which i ignored, but the new writer messed it up for me. Baby Vegeta, Super 17, Evil Dragons, and even the Super Saiyan 4 was all good in appearance, and had good music theme to the show, but Goku was getting his azz whopped more then he was able to fight back, everyone on the show was getting too weak even Gohan (became a nerd), Goten (been into girls more which doesnt matter but just gotten weaker for that reason), and Trunks (been taking care of his grandfathers business as the result). Vegeta started getting good towards the end, which should of been from the beginning. They did more talking, and hardly any fighting. If ya liked it then maybe some people are different, but i find that show to be even gayier than Pokemon and i think that show is stupid too. Do anyone one agrees with me or not.

Just answer these questions.      1) From which manga/anime do you have the most merchandise?      2) Your favorite anime character decides that they want to be your best friend. The only catch is that you have to send your current best friend to another dimension. There's no guarantee to their safety. Do you make the trade?      3) Which anime character would be voted most likely to get lost on their way home?      4) Which anime character would be voted most likely to beat up a small child?      5) Which anime character would be most likely to take in the most strays?      6) If you could marry any anime character, who would it be and why? (If you wouldn't marry any, which one would you most like to have brunch with?..since you're so afraid of a little animated commitment!)      7) If you could dedicate one song to Roy Mustang from FMA, what song would it be and why?      8) Who's your favorite character from the manga/anime Death Note? (If you don't like Death Note, just pretend you do and pick one anyway. If you don't know what Death Note is....well, that's just not possible...)      9) If you could kill any anime character PERSONALLY which one would it be? (If you wouldn't kill one, which one would you complain to in negative tones?)      ANIME THIS OR THAT: (You may select the secret 3rd option of "N/A" if you can't decide or if you don't like either, but please specify whether you can't decide or you hate them both...)         FULL METAL ALCHEMIST OR ONE PIECE      BLEACH OR NARUTO      OURAN HIGH SCHOOL HOST CLUB OR SKIP BEAT      SLAM DUNK OR PRINCE OF TENNIS      DEATH NOTE OR CODE GEASS      ....moving on to characters....         ROY MUSTANG OR EDWARD ELRIC      L OR LIGHT      L OR NEAR      NARUTO OR SASUKE      SASUKE OR ITACHI      ICHIGO OR CHAD      KAORU OR HIKARU      And last, as a completely random and unrelated question:      Thinking back on your day today, what song would have made the perfect theme song for you?
20090221022447AAhA84U	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Libra men please help! 10 points to best answer?	Here's the issue:   I have this libra old friend, usually he called me and we talked. It's nothing to do with love or anything.   Anyway, as life had it, I called him once and asked his assistance in lending me some money. Well, it was a rather large amount, but I added that I promise to pay him back by monthly installments.   Well, he was taken back or rather 'shocked' by my request, and apologized without citing any reasons!, not even asking me what I needed the money for, and if he could help in other ways or in smaller amounts!   I know he's doing well in life, and to make things worse, he stopped calling me for months in a row, and then we met up by chance one day and he talked to me like old days, neglecting the money issue or anything remotedly related to it.    Next he called me in another week or so, and wanted to talk. He started telling me about himself and I detected that he has a lot of money to spend here and there, from what he was telling me etc.    I refrained from mentioning that past financial encounter, and wanted very bad to tell him that another friend helped me (a Taurus) when and if he asked, which he didn't!!!   I am p***** off to say the least and I feel cheated.    I know that Libra men are far from being insensitive, so what's going on here??   What do you think of it?   Should I ignore him the next time he calls?   Should I confront him and make him feel guilty or just say nothing?   Is it bad to 'need' money and ask your friend to help you????      I am a Capricorn by the way if this helps   What do you make of this?

20090221020733AAHCx6E	Entertainment & Music;Magazines	How many times should you listen to a cd before submitting a review?	How many times. After listening to the new U2 album I thought it was horrible after one listen. 8 listens later I love it, It is a real grower. I am thinking of doing CD reviews for a magazine soon and I just what some feedback on how many times you should listen to write an accurate review. When I dont know if I like a record or not I simply describe "The song magnificent starts with an intriguing ensemble before warming to The Edge and U2's characteristic delay ridden sound"

20090221021255AAwR8nD	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What bands have amazing stage presence, more than just the music?	What're some bands you've seen live that have amazing stage presence/stage performance?   Like, in my opinion the tour TOOL did back in 07 I wanna say?    Or 06, I can't remember,    But Maynards stage presence SUCKED.    The lights and video screens and all that was INCREDIBLE, but he just sang the songs, barely said anything, and got off stage.    No crowd interaction or anything.      Bands that have had good stage presence when I saw them would have to be:   Vomit Gun   Blank Image   Breathe Carolina   Winds of Plague   A Day To Remember   Senses Fail   The A.K.A's   Pierce The Veil   Vomit Gun (I know, 2nd time, but they are my bro's, and their shows are hilarious (: )   Aiden (still a fan of them, but not as much as I was)   30 Seconds to Mars (won't be the same without Leto)   Nine Inch Nails   And the best stage performance I've ever seen has to be   Foxy Shazam         Just bands that do crazy stuff, and interact with the audience; bands that joke around on stage for the hell of it and don't take it too seriously.      ALSO! Please suggest bands that aren't really popular/big (I.E. My Chemical Romance, because I hate the idea of their music but I still enjoy it hahaha)   It can be local bands from your area, or bands that are starting to get popular, but just not massive bands.   I say that because I'm more into shows than concerts, because it's much more personal, and you can see the band on a different level.         Thanks ! (:

Hey every1..thanks for reading first of all :)      I was wondering if it would be illegal if i was to get an instrumental of a hip-hop track (im guessing it doesnt matter what music genre), put myself rapping over it and then put on youtube/social networking sites to promote myself.       I wouldnt be selling it. would purely be just to promote myself - not selling a thing.      Also another question - does this law vary from country to country?
