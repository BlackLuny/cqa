20090131111335AARdaEf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	If I ovulated early, can I test early?	My husband and I have been trying to no avail to get pregnant since late Aug/early Sept. I have 27-29 day cycles normally. I have used the ovulation prediction kits in the past & every time, I ovulated on about day 15. I didn't use them this month, but I got the egg-whitey CM on days 10-12 & got bad cramps on day 12. I'm pretty sure that's when I ovulated.       Anyway, if I O'd 3 days early, can I test 3 days before my period and get ACCURATE results? Which test is most sensitive & most accurate?
20090131111916AAEiRnZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I feel like Iike im with a terrible man? he's my baby's father?	okay my baby girl is 6 1/2 months old and we live with her father my bf who does not want to amrry me until the "time is right". which seems silly to me bc really is there ever a perfect time?       but anyways I am really tired of involving other ppl in my problems like my parents and best friend but did today bc he just made me feel like crap last night. I told them I want to move back home with my parents and get away from him. I'm tired of him. He's grouchy a lot. He never takes me or the baby out on nice outings just maybe to fastf ood or bookstore and thats it.      Hes also controlling. Last night I came home from my parents' house kind of late with her around 10 pm. He yelled at me and said I don't need to be taking the baby out so late. I haven't seen my parents for days now, on top of that I am 25---26 in July---I am a grown woman, capable of taking a baby out at night and being wise about it. It was just to my parents'! Then he started making cracks about them, lame jokes, like my mom's "mother goose" and my father's "father time" bc they're on the older side (had me in their 30s). anyways, then he mentions this girl downstairs from us who dates his cousin---she used to be a maxim model---and he says he thought he saw her on the cover of a calendar at a gas station. He has talked about this girl before, how she owns her own tanning business, cooks and cleans for his cousin whom she dates and lives with,e tc, like hes putting her on some kind of pedestal and comparing her to me. so I got kind of annoyed and said I didnt care and didnt want to ehar about it. he started saying whats your problem etc. etc. I said "cant you ask me how my day was?' and he just said "I already know what you did today---nothing as usual." he acts like im not interesting anymore bc "all I do" is take care of our baby. It hurts.       He criticizes my parenting skills, like how "I don't know what I'm doing bc shes not on a routine". He always has a crack to make about something. I cant stand it anymore. I just want to leave him so badly but my dad is trying to encourage me to "talk it out". I feel I could talk it out til I'm blue in the face and nothing will change. He blames me for having to work at his job.  He said last night, "I hate my job, and I hate the fact that I have to work while you get to play all day".He talks left and right about quitting his job, which makes me nervous. But then on his days off he doesnt even bother to look for another job, which if some1 truly hated their job, wouldnt they do that? (shouldnt they??) Now Ive been applying for jobs online, and he knows that, and it was he who encouraged me to be a stay at home mom for as long as possible, to benefit our baby girl, and avoid daycare, yet he says resenttful things like that? like he wouldnt be at his job if it wasnt for me when he worked since before I even came into his life 3 yrs ago.      oh yeah, and I told him last night how Jennifer Aniston was voted best body by men in some poll, and I said "its kinda flattering bc we have similar bodies" (he was the one that said that awhile ago, and he said "no you're way skinnier than her, ever since the baby you've lost your butt and you just look bony". It was very insulting.       Has any1 else ever been in a similar situation? What did you end up doing/ What ended up happening/   And in your ladies' opinion, mothers yourselves, and many of you wives/partners, what should I do?
20090131112035AAOu51g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is there anyone who was born with hydrocephalus?	I was born with water in/on my brain. I read up on this guy who also had it. he is an author named Sherman Alexie. In his autobiography, it said that he had seizures which were a result from this condition. I have never had seizures but I tend to laugh and smile weirdly for no reason. Can this be be another result from hydrocephalus? I also read that hydrocephalus effected the nervous system and my laughing and weird smiles have to do with me being nervous/shy. What is your opinion?

This question is particularly for breastfeeding moms but if you formula feed then you're welcome to answer. I'd just like to know what you fed your baby and how old were they? For example if you breastfeed, what did you begin to feed them during their 6 month? If it were rice cereal then what kind, or if it was something else what was it? Then what did you introduce at month 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, & 12? Please be specific. Thank you!!

I thought that a baby will wake up when they are hungry I know she does during the day, but my friend told me I need to wake her up every 3 hours regardless...is this true?

20090131114138AAPZlSf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Random question for all you pregnant ladies....?	Hi ladies =)      Just a random question really....I've been wondering when a pregnant woman's belly is considered a bump and not bloating?      The only reason I ask is that I'm on my 5th pregnancy but this will be my 3rd child (2 miscarriages) and started showing noticeably at 10 weeks.  Those who know me agreed it was the start of a baby bump and now, at 18 weeks, I look much farther along.  It really does look like I have a basketball stuck up my top and people are amazed when I tell them how far along I really am.      I've also read similar questions from other pregnant ladies who obviously know their own bodies and think they're showing but are told that it's simply bloating.      What is everyone elses opinion?
20090131113410AAKXEc1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	OK so I took a test when I got out of bed today. It looked like a faint line appeared before 3 min was even up?	and normally I'd believe that without a second thought. Today however I'm more or less telling myself that I imagined that second line since I know I have imagined lines in the past out of being so hopeful for another. My period should start on Monday and I'm getting some mild cramps but nothing more than that.      Have you ever done this and have you been pregnant?      Thanks ladies!

I keep checking myself afraid it is going to be red or brown, but it is always either nothing, very light yellow, or clear.      Is this normal to feel like this?    Thanks!

20090131113833AA64ijO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Drama in the Labor and Delivery Room - Help!?	I am just under 4 weeks away from my due date and am having a hard time deciding on who I should have in the labor and delivery room with me. My baby's dad and I were together for about 2 years when I found out I was pregnant, and he decided to break up with me when I was 4 months along. He tends to be rather controlling (and he doesn't think any pain medication should be used under any circumstances) and I am worried he will stress me out during labor and that that could affect the health of my baby. He has tried to be helpful and he has good intentions, but we always always argue.      Does he have a right to be in the labor and delivery room because he is the dad, or should I ask a good friend to be in there with me instead? It's almost like I would rather be alone than have him there with me.       Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance! :)

20090131121100AAAzkrd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What would you do if you were me?	Okay, I'm kind of in a jam.  I'm moving out on March 2 to an income based townhome in the suburbs.  My apartment complex where I have been since Sept of 2006 is charging me market rate plus water for the month of February, and one day in March.  This is $714 including water which is $24.  I work a job where they decreased everybody's pay so my whole check is about $730 after they take out medical, and dental, etc.  I could'nt afford to buy my son a case of diapers for the month like I normally do.  I can't pay any of my utilities because I have to use the check I get on Feb 12th as money to pay movers to move me.  I have no family members who will help move me.  Then I have to take the check I get at the end of February to pay the rent at the new place for March.  The rent is cheaper at the new place, but my mom is helping me out with my car note.  She pays half of my carnote, and my son's daycare.  She says in August, I have to pay all of my carnote, and my son's daycare lady is retiring so that's another hurdle to deal with then.  I know I can afford my carnote with the cheaper rent, but I'll even out like I am now.  Right now I can only afford the necessities, no luxuries.  I have renter's insurance and full auto insurance, but the rates will go down slightly because I'm in a safer location.  What should I do about my son's diapers, my utilites, food?  I managed to scrape up some money to buy him a small pack of off brand diapers, but they are not going to last the whole month?  I am on WIC, but he drinks more than 4 gallons of milk in a month's time.  What would you do if you were me?

20090131121056AAYvBlE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	23 weeks pregnant- strangely vomiting?	I just turned over 23 weeks in my pregnancy yesterday, and 4 days ago I had to lay in bed all day because I was cramping very badly, (putting me into tears) and throwing everything I ingested up. It was impossible to keep anything down. Then today I woke up around 7, got myself ready and then was feeling a little strange- so I took a nap and woke up from my nap to pee, and then just started vomiting again!   I am not sure whether this is just a bug- or what.      When I called the Labor and Delivery at my hospital, they seemed as though everything should be okay as long as the baby is still moving.       So, I have no fever, but just keep vomiting and not sure why. Should I be concerned, or have any of you had any symptoms similar to this?

Ok, so I am 6 weeks pregnant with my first child, my b/f is happy about this but he still lives with his mother, I live with my grandparents, I have the money to move out into a place of my own but my grandparents are having money troubles so Im going to stay with them for a while to help them out with the bills and in return they are going to help me with the baby. So we had made arrangments that my b/f would move in too. His mother found out and idk how she did but she told him that his is not ALLOWED to sign the birth certificate until we get a peternity test, because she dose not think that the baby is his, now he is my second b/f and i had one other back in high school which was years ago so i know 100% that it is his, his mother also dose not want him going to doctor apointments or putting any money twards the baby at all, again she told him he is not ALLOWED to. I dont know what to do. his mother is soooo controling!  she said that she is not helping out until we get this test done ( i dont want her help anyway, i dont want her getting he claws into my kid) aside from his mother being way to controling my insurance dose not cover a paternity test which i would have to pay out of pocket for, and its not cheap, to me it is a waist of money because i already know what it is going to say and so dose everyone else, except his mom. my b/f wants to be apart of the babys life and my pregnancy but he dose not want to make his mother mad, and I tried to talk to him and tell him im not going with it but he gets all pissed off at me, what can i do to ? at this point i dont know what to do, btw we were trying for the baby.

I still feed him the baby food, but instead of a whole large jar, he only eats the smallers ones now.  So anyhow, I was thinking that maybe rice milk would help his stomach be a little better?  I dont think hes lactose intolerant because hes has mommies milk for a year without a problem..And with all the genetically modified soy out there, I thought rice would be better..Any experience with this? Thanks.

She's started having sex again and is always very careful but obviously knows condoms aren't 100% effective and that the pill would be a much more sensible option.      There is no way she can persuade her mam to let her go on the pill.      By current UK law, would the parent's be informed if she went to the doctors? What exactly would happen?

And we wouldn't be able to ever lay him on his back without him fussy.    Anyone out there whose baby was diagnosed with infant reflux (and meds ARE working) but the above was NOT true?

20090131131058AAamC8a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Parenting advice 3 month old?	Okay moms I need help here.  My daughter for about 5 days was sneezing and congested.  The stuff coming out of her nose was clear.  Have the vaporizer running.  She has had no fever, and still eating.  She seems fine now (no more mucus)  but for 2 weeks she has been chewing on her hands like mad.  And now all of a sudden she is very irritable.  She is still sleeping great at night, no fever.  She just seems very upset off and on.  Could she be teething?  She is not hungry when doing this.  I am just so worried and I do not know what to do.  We are supposed to get a big snow storm again this week so I cant take her to the doc.  Any advice.  Mothers Only, or fathers.

20090131124235AAJ0d96	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should my 6 month old baby be sleeping longer at night?	Hi, I have a 6 month old daughter and she currently sleep from 6.45pm until anywhere between 2-4am, when she then has a bottle and goes back to bed until between 6-7am.      I'm not complaining about that as I think it's pretty good, but I just wondered at what age should I expect her to sleep the 12 hours without a feed?        Sometimes when she wakes she wolfes down a bottle (regardless of how much bottle she had before bed) and other times she's not particularly interested and just goes back to bed after a few ounces.  She also never seems interested in her breakfast which is usually fed to her about 6 hours after her bottle through the night!  (Hope I'm not confusing you all here lol!)      So my question is do you think she needs that bottle through the night, or is just becoming a 'habit' for her?  She's been on baby food for about 6 weeks and had three meals a day.      Thanks for your help.
20090131123216AAlUw3o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Should I test or not?	When I am stressed (which is often), I sometimes miss my cycle. Anyway my last cycle was on Christmas eve. I BD with dh quite a bit this month. Anyway this past week I felt really nauseous. Since my cycles can range from 28-36 days, I thought I was PM-Sing and I had cramp pains two days ago. I spotted very lightly and it was a light brown. I thought I was having my period , but nothing happen. I have very slight cramping, but nothing else. The nausea is getting worse though. AF should have arrived at the latest the 29th, but nothing. Should I wait it out more or should I test?

20090131125559AArpGvw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Questions about abortion, pregnant friend!?	One of my best friends that i've known since I was in elementary school just found out she was pregnant with her ex boyfriend. She said she didn't use contraceptive because they didn't mind if she got pregnant. Well, they've broken up and now she's been dating this new guy for about a week, and wants to get an abortion because she wants to make things work out with him. She said its going to kill her to get an abortion but she has to and she wants to do it by drinking some herbal tea which I think is dangerous! I know that it's not my life but i'm worried about her and can't help but be mad that shes making her decision off of a guy she barely knows! If she didn't care about getting pregnant at first I don't think she should end the babies life so suddenly. Should I try talking to her or what?

20090131124350AAqUAuM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could i be induced at 35 weeks?	i will be 35 weeks next week and i cant hang in any longer. not cause i dont want to be prego anymore. but becasue the amount of pain im in. i have sculiosis in the small of my back. and water on the knee in my right knee. ive been having alot of pelvic pain and pressure that feels like my pelvis is on fire or being ran over. i spend 80% of my days in tears. the pelvic pressure pushes in on my sculiosis and sends a shooting pain to me weak knee and ankle making it almost impossible to walk. i cant sit, stand or lay for longer than 5 min cause the pain puts me in tears. and in one week ive thrown out my back 4 times which prevents me from taking care of my 3 yr old. i lose my breath after only walking 20ft. and im not that big of a person so the baby has already ran out of room to move and grow. and the other day some how he got his foot stuck on the outside of my ribcage. and it took 30min for me to get his foot unstuck. this has been happening alot lately. at the US they said he was 2.5 weeks ahead of growth and weight. and hes so big that i can nolonger breath properly. it feels like someone is sitting on my throat. and when this happens my body goes into shock and i start trying to breath but it feels like im suffocating and i start getting light headed and have passed out a couple times cause of it. im just lucky i havnt landed on my stomach when this happens. and i was wondering if under my circumstances if a doctor would induce me at 35 weeks or not seeing as though the baby is ahead of growth and weight by 2 weeks.  because i feel like its safer for the baby and I for him to be delivered soon as i could fall on my stomach and hurt him when i pass out or hurt myself.
20090131130531AAqUEAN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How shall i tell my mum that i'm pregnant?	I'm 19 and at university, recently our family found out that my 18 year old cousin (her brother's kid) got a 14 YEAR OLD pregnant and she is keeping it. I know my situation is different since in the eyes of the law what my cousin did is actually illegal...    She kept saying "you better not get pregnant as well or i'll throttle you!" (she wouldn't really but it's just a figure of speech).     I don't know how to tell her, i'm the first person in my family to go to university and i know she'll be disappointed in me, i'm in so much student debt and i can't find a full time job, i think i'm going to move home and defer my university course.    My brother is 21 and already has a 2 year old son and his fiance is now expecting another baby in June.    I can't help but feel like i'll be the black sheep of the family, i am going to keep the baby but it's so hard to find a full-time job to get myself financially some-what ready. The father and i only split up about a week ago and he lives 5 hours away for work and i haven't told him yet but i am going to once i find out how i can contact his work because i deleted everything of him (before i knew i was pregnant)    Do you think i'm caring about what others will think too much? I want to do the best by my baby but at the moment everything seems so out of reach and i'm doubting i'll be a good mum no matter how much i try.    Sorry this is long but i don't know how to tell her.

I have a few symptoms, not being able to sleep, breaking out on my chin, hot flashes started yesterday, LOTS of CM, sore boobs, my nipples have turned bright pink, my cervix is very high, spongy and closed very tightly, tighter that I can ever remember feeling, I am bloated and my abdomen is very hard to the touch and at the beginning of the week I was having some pulling/pinching pains in my sides and abdomen. Just curious if anyone else has had similar symptoms and if and when would be the best time to test? We're really hoping this is the month!

20090131130105AAiyuoZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm feeling uncertain about breastfeeding!?	I'm 6 months pregnant with my first child. I'm still trying to decide weather or not I want to breastfeed. I know that "Breast is Best" for my baby and me. I've read all the nutritional information about how breast milk is best. That's really not whats bothering me. I'm just feeling very uncomfortable. I know it's horrible to say, but the thought of breastfeeding sort of grosses me out. I know I sound very selfish. Please don't answer back and tell me what a horrible person I am. I feel bad enough as it is. I need some real advice to help me over my fear. Every time I talk to someone about weather I plan to breastfeed or not, or when I see another women breastfeeding I get squimish (I know, I'm awful). It's not about breastfeeding in front of other people either, even the thought of doing it in total privacy makes me uncomfortable. I'm in need of some support. None of my friends have kids (or are even in serious relationships, for that matter), so I can't really go to them for advice. I've talked to my mom and she really didn't help out much. I don't really feel like I'm just too young and immature (I'm 24, married, have a steady job, etc). I feel pretty confident about being a mother in all areas, but this one. Did anyone feel the same as me before their first child? How do I overcome this and just do what is best for my baby? I don't want to add anymore stress to me or to my son when he is born (I'm afraid being this uncomfortable while breastfeeding will affect him, too). Any Advice?

And I see people come on here and say "Boobs and video games will get you a (12-14) year old guy".      I don't get it, if I liked a girl it would be for WHO SHE IS, not her breasts! If she liked the same video games before me, or she finds them fun, ok, that might help. But if she just plays them to get me, why would I want that?      I mean, come on people! What should a girls breast size have to do with anything? I'm 13, I might be interested in sex hormones, but not sex/games/things.      FOR ADULTS: What is your opinion?   FOR BOYS MY AGE: Do video games/boobs have anything to do with you opinion of a girl?   FOR OLDER BOYS: Did they for you?   FOR GIRLS: Do you think a guy only went out with you for breasts? And did you ever try to change yourself to get a guy?
20090131173024AATd0VO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Adoptees and AP's....what to do?	We are AP's to a toddler through foster care. This question is for AP's and adoptees who support and encourage open adoptions. If that is not you, please do not bother answering. Thanks!  Here is an overview of my child's natural family:  Mom has 4 children. All 4 are with different fathers. All 4 are in adoptive homes with different families. 2 of these children know they are adopted--my child and one other. The other two believe their AP's are their parents. NONE of these children are allowed contact with mom. The other children are 9, 11, and 14 years old  Dad has 4 children. 3 are with his wife of many years. Our child is his 4th, out of wedlock. He does not know of this child. Mom refuses to tell us who dad is, and the children and wife know nothing of the affair. The other children are 13, 17, and 19 years old.  Our child is 19 months old.   I hope all of that makes sense.   How in the world can I have an open adoption, when most of the family is unknown to us and when the ones we do know of don't know they are adopted? Further, should we even try when our child is so significantly younger than the other children? Finally, the ONE child that we have tried to stay in contact with...the youngest one..9 years old....states that he 'doesn't really care' to know our child, and the family keeps having 'scheduling conflicts' when we ask to meet them.  I absolutely want my child to know and/or know about his siblings....but I don't want to destroy lives to do so. Telling these children they are adopted; telling the others that dad cheated on mom, etc....that's not my place. So, I honestly don't know what to do. Mom refuses to give us locations or pictures of any of her other children, and, again, won't tell us who dad is or the names of his kids. I am just at a loss for how to give my child his history, when it is so very convaluded and unknown. I know I have MUCH more than many AP's and adoptees out there have....but all of these kids are within 1 hour of our home. I can't imagine ruining their lives, but I also can't imagine how my child will feel knowing that he has 6 half-siblings that close who he doesn't know and who don't even know he exists. PLEASE do not criticize my child's parents. Thanks for any guidance.

I'm 5 weeks today. We are so excited!

And then by the time I'm done with all that I'm so tired I take a long nap and then the day is practically over!      How do I stop obsessing and get on with things I need to do?

My son is 3 months old and tomorrow we are going to see the Polar Bear Club at my hometown ( A bunch of people who jump in the ocean in the middle of winter ). I am from NY and its supposed to be about 43. What should I dress my son in? I was thinking a snow suit. Also how should I carry him around in the sand? We have a front facing carrier ( the one your wear on yourself not a car seat ). Should I just carry him or put him in the carrier. The stroller is going to be out because I don't want to drag it across the sand.

My parents are going to San Diego for a month and then Australia for another month. My FIL has been smoking in the house a lot even after I've told my husband to tell him not to. I'm just irritated because we todl him the health risks for him and the baby. My husband even told him if he continues to smoke in the house that Peyton will no longer be coming over. She is there for 3-4 hours. The last three times I dropped her off, the house smell like smoke. If I don't stop taking her over there, he might think I'm not serious but we need a babysitter for when my parents are gone otherwise they are okay with watching her 5 days a week. How can I get him to see how serious this is. I want him to know we are serious. Is it asking for too much for him to smoke outside? I'm so frustrated! We can't communicate with each other so we use my husband as a translator.

20090131145354AASpnjB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	RELATIONSHIP ADVICE? long but important?	okay. i need some advcie form an outsider with no involvement.   I have been best frienwds with a boy for like a year and a half, we are riddiculously close and we know have helped eahcother through a lot of stuff, his family love me and my family love him, and i've always secetly liked his brother.   i told him a couple of months back, and he told me he liked me too, so we decided to talk to Harry (my best friend) about it, and see if he'd be okay with us getting together.   We asked him and he said he was fine with it, and we got together and everything was really lovely.   then Harry staretd cuasing problems between us, and thier mum, who is RIDDICULOUSLY oveerprotective and controlling, stopped letting Scott (the brother) leave the house if she knew he was seeing me. She was rude about me, and on friday night said to Harry that she wouldnt be letting Scott and me's relationship work.   But despite that me and Scott really liekd eahcother and stuff was woprking out rly well ect, and I kept mine and his relationship totally seperate from mine and Harrys and it didnt effect Harry AT ALL, 110% was nothign to do with him or how i acted with him or the time i spent with him.   Then last night Harry called me because he'd had an arguement with Scott and told me I was inconsiderate, and that he was mad at mw foor dating Scott, and told me to dump Scott or he'd be miserable. He basically told me to chose, and I did. I called Scott and said I didnt think it was working out, i didnt mention Harry.   The reason I broke up with him was because Harry is my all time best frined and I dotn want him to be miserable, but now I'm miserable?   I think I should have told him when i askedfirst time that that was the end of his imput andf after that he couldnt get involved, but i didnt and now im in a bit of a mess, becuase i really like scott :/   and hary hasnt even called me since, and seems to think he is the matyr in the situation and everyone is hurting him. In his words "he doesnt like things that are his belongign to anyoen else".   What do you think I should do?      also, im 15, harry is 15 and scott is 17

20090131134046AAzQsoc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Kind of freaking out - is this normal with tearing?	It's been almost a month since I have had my baby. I had extensive tearing and she cut me three times which tore more and I also had other tears she went through five spools of stitches to sow me all up. It took about 2 weeks for me to sit down normal and then I had been doing good. The blood was dark red so I thought it was healing. Then last week I started having troubles pooping, it came out easy but it felt like a slit on the back of my butt opened when I tried to poop, it felt weird like a tear on the back of it. Now my bleeding has turned back to bright red and it hurts still to poop. Lately I have been really weak, which could be from taking care of my son, but I mentioned it to my mom and she has me freaking out now saying I could possibly have it torn open and I could get some infection with toxins that can be deadly and get in my blood stream. I don't know if the feeling weak has to do with it or if I am infected. I called my doctor but the office is closed so the person on call said to just take stool softeneres because it just sounds like a little tear. Has anybody else had this happened and should I wait till monday to go to the doctor? I don't want to be infected and I don't know if it's a tear or not. It felt like my butt then a tear up then another whole, but that doesn't make much since to me without seeing it. I think I only had a little tear by my butt also, i don't remember. Should I be concerened? They said it also might be a hernia but I never had one before so I don't know what that feels like. It feels like a slit is openeing when I am pooping, it's just weird not sure how to fully describe it. What do you think? Anybody have this happen to them? Help?!
20090131140041AAkU5ok	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did I really need my c-section?	Given all the hype surrounding natural vaginal child birth, I had planned to let nature take it's course. I was in drug-free labor for 38 hours and was at 6 centimeters. Then I had an epidural and labored for another 6 hours and made it to 7 centimeters. When the baby's HB dropped for the second time, the OB ordered a c-section.       Once in, the OB discovered the baby was trying to come out face first and the cord was wrapped twice around her neck. At the time I thought for sure it was necessary - and quite frankly, was just happy to have my healthy happy baby.       Now, after listening/reading the endless litany against c-sections and so many proclaiming they are done unnecessarily, can someone tell me if I really needed mine or if the doctor "pulled the trigger" too quickly?

20081116033803AAI0hNb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Comp. feeding formula...?	My boy is 2 weeks and 3 days old. Up until today he has been a dream baby, but he has had runny water like poop. He spent his first week of life in the special care nursery and was fed with a feeding tube and then a bottle (expressed breast milk) and I have been having great trouble getting him to feed off me so have continued expressing and bottle feeding since we came home a week ago.      So today I met a friend at the indoor play centre, and because I could not express I gave him a feed of formula.      2.5 hours after he fed, he vomitted and then 10 minutes later he projectile vomitted what looked like the whole feed!      He then settled off to sleep for a few hours.      Now that we are back home he is back on the expressed breast milk and has had 2 feeds and no vomitting, although he has been hard to settle after a feed - which I know can be normal.      I will speak to his paediatrician tomorrow, but I am wondering if it is possible for babies to be allergic to formula or if it is just a coincidence that this is the feed he vomitted.      I should add that normally he does not vomit at all - express occassionally a small amount with a burp.

20081101035539AAZXxP6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Scared of going through pregnancy all over again?	My daughter has just turned 2yrs, I found pregnancy awful I seemed to get everything and in the end she was born by c-sec 4 weeks early because I got choleastasis & almost ripped my skin off from itching, plus the trauma of thinking she could be stillborn from it. The first year was horrendous she never slept and cried constantly, plus I think i had depression because I cried all the time & considered ending it all daily, that all went away once I started working again and all is going good now. I love being a mum to her, shes my world but to go through it again makes me feel ill. Its early days as i've only just found out i'm pregnant, my hubby is over the moon but is dissapointed that i'm not.    Has anyone else felt dread rather than elation when finding out your pregnant? I feel so guilty for feeling this way.

20081103135738AApF0ab	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it normal to bleed and pass clots during pregnancy?	I am currently 8 weeks pregnant and i started experiencing light brown bleeding about a little over a week ago. At first it was very light and nothing really startled me, however a few days later i started to have a little cramping and this time it was red. I was a little worried about this so i went to the ER there they gave me a transvaginal ultrasound and said everything looked normal a fetus and hearbeat 115bpm. . . I was relieved about this until a few days ago i stared passing brown blood clots i called the doctor and she said it was most likely old blood, however last night and today it continued only it is a dark red color. Is this at all normal?? Does anyone have anything reasuring to tell me?? I call the doctor she just said stay off my feet and drink alot of fluids. Ohh and forgot to mention not alot of cramping very slight.

20061005232633AALi9uT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone had their hormones dip down, and thought they lost the baby, but found out they didn't?	just curious. I'm just wondering, for those of you who had periods while you were pregnant, if your hcg dipped down at that time, but your baby ended up to be ok. Just wondering becaue I had a miscarriage, and my hormone levels went back down, but now I feel pregnant again, and although I could just be pregnant again, I'm not to talented with b/c it turns out. it's so early that I'm wondering if I was pregnant from before. They didn't do a pelvic after I had my bleeding, they did it once, then took my blood twice. It was really early in the pregnancy. I haven't taken a test since, and it'd be too early to test if I had just gotten pregnant again. I'm not looking for advice on that.         I want to know if anyone knows if the baby can be alive but not producing the hormone.

I have started feeding her table food and she does well with it. Pieces of bread or bagel, chopped up banana,cut up meat ball, little pieces of strawberry...etc  But for some reason when I try to give her the stage 3 baby food with the little pieces of stuff in it she gags on it. A few times to the point of throwing up what she already ate. I've tried it myself and it's really easy to mash up the chunks with my tongue. I don't understand why she can eat pieces of table food but can't handle the baby food.  Did anyone else have this problem with their baby ?

20060804144057AAxMgRH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about dog pregnancy and puppies.?	I have a full breed male husky. My neighbor down the street (who I don't like and never got along with) He has a female male husky. Recently, his dog got loose and somehow jumped the fence into my backyard while i was not home. I just came home from work one day and found his dog in my yard and caught it and gave it back to him.      Well...now its several weeks later and I found out that his dog (the female husky) is pregnant. So they mated in my yard without my permission.       My question is...   By law are half of the puppies mine? If so i want my half of the litter. I know him...he will probably go and sell the puppies for at least $400 a piece, since that is about how much people would pay for full breed huskies. What should I do?

Yesturday my son went to his fathers house from 5-8pm and i was very upset in the way he took care of him. Our son ate at 4 right before i dropped him off and i told my sons father that our son doesnt need to eat untill 7 but you can feed him at 630 if he get crabby. (our son is on pedilite cause he is sick)  so i told him to feed him at 7 but the earliest is 630 and i told him he wouldnt need to eat again untill i picked him up at 8. i left my sons father with two bottles just incase. well when i picked him up my sons father told me that he fed him the bottle of pedlite at 6 and then a bottle of formula at 7 and then a full bottle of water at 730!!! That is 15oz in an hour and a half!! i asked him why and he said cause he was hungry. My sons father has no clue about parenting or anything and  never sees our son. maybe once in a blue moon when he feels like it. so none the less i was very upset in how he took care of our son in three hours.
20060816215043AABtsYZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy Problem?	I am about in my 29th week of pregnancy, and experienced some strange symptoms today when I started driving home. I got very dizzy and had a series of heart palpitations. I got a little clammy and felt kind of faint and saw a few spots in my vision. I was also having trouble breathing most of the day. I am asthmatic, but it did not seem asthma related..it was more as if someone was compressing my chest. I pulled the car over as soon as I could and laid down in the seat until it eased up. Everything seems normal right now except I am extremely fatigued. I have been eating like I should and taking my prenatal vitamins and getting plenty of water. I called the doctor and they said to lay down and rest and call back or go to the ER if it happens again. I feel as if they kind of blew me off. Anyone else have these symptoms in pregnancy? What to do?

I will defenitely still go to the doctor tho, but i would like to know if anyone else went thru it and please tell me what is going on. Thank You:)

We have a 12 month old son together and i am step mother to his six year old and very attached to him like he were my own. He has a slight case of Autism and when i met him at 3 years old he would not speak at all his real mom visits around the holidays and i e-mail her time to time on how he is doing and send pics of him and the like. My husband rarley spends time with him and i am afraid this could damage him in some way he does call me mom after all. I was wondering if i could possibly get vistitation rights or have him come live with me sometimes?I am also concerned my 12 month old son will never really now his dad because of the divorce.?

And now she has just found out that she is pregnant again, after the last misscarriage she found out she is r.h. negative,what precautions and treatment can she get for that, and should she be getting it now regularly, or does she have to wait until the baby is more developed?      I'm worried that because she is r.h. negative, it is the full reason why the other two pregnancies did not come to full term!         A guess is that she is around 3-4 weeks along right now.      She is experiencing more symptoms this time, and is extremely tired ,anything she can eat ,or take (vitamins) other than the prenatals,that could help with this.         thankx-

20090109001613AAxwp1i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Single moms who still live at home: What's the hardest thing about it?	I love my family. And I'm very grateful for their love, encouragement, and support upon becoming a single mom. It means everything to have a loving family for my son and me, but sometimes it also feels hard being a single parent who has to still live at home.       Why? Because it's not *my* home. I can't make the rules. I can't say what's allowed and what's not allowed. I have no say in what kind of music is inappropriate, what sort of things get put on the tv, the way people talk and behave, and overall what is and is not acceptable in a home.      It makes me sad knowing that I don't have very much control over what sort of home my son is raised in. Of course I will do my best to raise my son right (as far as loving him and teaching him the right things), and I do redirect my son away from bad situations (even though he's only a baby), but it's not the same. Even though I messed up and got pregnant before marriage, I still have a strong desire to raise my son the best I can, and that includes a good home.      I'm sticking with school and hope to become an RN. Then when I graduate, if I still feel as though our home isn't the best environment for him (my son), I'll probably have to find my own place. That's how strongly I feel about having a good home for my son, even as a single mom.      We can't control the world, but our home should be the one place we do control--to the best of our ability.      Is there anything hard about you being a single mom living at home?

Hola amigos, les cuento que tome pastillas anticonceptivas (Jazmin) pero solo durante un mes pues me cayeron fatal, el mes que tome las pastillas abviamente si me vino la regla, pero este mes que ya no las tomè llevo 6 dias de atraso contando hoy y no me baja, aclaro que cuando tuve relaciones siempre mi pareja usò condòn y no se rompiò ni nada, pero estoy muy preocupada, ya siento un poco de malestar y peque?os còlicos desde hace una semana pero no me viene, pod`ria ser un desajuste hormonal por haber tomado las pastillas y dejarlas tan ràpido, a alguien le ha pasado un atraso despues de dejar las pastillas? Gracias.

20070217165909AApNsYi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am i pregnant??	I am 26, have a 2 year old and i am trying to fall pregnant.   We have been trying for just over 6 months. My period is never late and lasts 5 days.    My period was the normal colour on the 1st day, but by day 2 it had gone browny/black and only a little amount of it (Like it does on the last day) and stayed the same for days 3 4 and 5. The only day i can class it as a period was the 1st day when it was completely normal.   I know that the colour means "Old" blood but could this mean i could be pregnant. I am going to take a pregnancy test but dont want to get my hopes up. That was the 1st of this month till the 5th, i have been quite moody and short tempered and today felt a little dizzy, just wondered what you think.    Thankyou

He is living with me at the moment for a month trial but his mum is phoning and crying to him. We had decided before the trial that we would let him decide for himself but I don't think that the crying is making it easy on him. I have tried asking his mother to stop with the crying phone calls but they just continue. What should i do to help him decide (either way) to do what he wants without feeling guilty??

20061119133219AAA49kW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What do you think?	My husband belives in using spanking when our boys misbehaive or are disrespectful in a more serious way.  The boys are my husbands but i adopted them legaly when we got married. My 9 year old hit me today and my husband wanted to spank him but i stoped him. We disagree on this method. Although our son is a strong willed child i think we should insist with groundings and bannings, taking  priviledges away. Do you think that considering my husband is the biological parent i should let him have the final decision and not interfer ?

They are like little tingling sharp pains around my ovaries. I have also been getting a fever every once in a while. I discharge alot of white stuff, more than usual. This has been going on for about 2 weeks or so. It can't be because I'm about to start my period or anything, because I just had one 2 or 3 weeks ago. I want to talk to my mom, but I'm scared. Me and my mom are really open about this sort of thing, but this is more extreme than our little "sex talks". I am on the pill Ortho. Have been since last March. My b/f of one year and I have unprotected sex. I know, bad idea. But I'm not asking if it is a good idea or not. I am in desperate need of help, and idk what else to do. I have no way of getting a test unless I ask my mom. Please help!

My step daughter hates doing her school/homework.  She will do ANYTHING to get out of it, lie, make up excuses, hide papers, etc.  For the most part she is a good kid but she is so stubborn when it comes to just doing her work.  Her 5th grade teacher doesn't let us know if she isn't turning in assignments or when she isn't doing well in class and gets moved to the front.  I feel like I am the only one trying to make sure she is completing her work (her dad always backs me up and is on the same page) but I am always the one to alert him to when she is lying about her work.  I am worried she is going to start to see me as the bad guy.  Should I back off or should I keep inforcing the standard of - you must complete all your work before you can play- at our house?
