VefSnu0Gaa	i didn't think they were gonna play the doubles today, because of the tickets, but i guess since they're already behind in the schedule....<br>  anyway, that first set was very tight, and feli is a great doubles player, so i think spain will came back and win it today, too bad verdasco isn't playing :(<br>  but go spain!<br>  <br>  edit: serbia just won, damn!<br>  we'll have to wait until tomorrow....|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Don't know about Feli / Robredo team against Zimonjic / Troicki ? Serbia wins unfortunately. Rafa 's got to rest to play the reverse singles tomorrow.  My good luck charms to Feli / Rob !! Please prove me wrong and win today to save Rafa's knee :}:}|`|1w5blbobaa	Ohhh well 1 set doesn't matter....<br>  <br>  & anyway Rafa is unbeatable on clay,so nothing to be worried frnd.|`|RMxTrBnIaa	well i hope serbia wins the doubles because i want to see djokovic and nadal play a five set match.|`|a6CxaY2baa	If Serbia continue this level of play, they'll win. If Serbia wins the second set, then I say game over, but still you never know what will happen. It's early in the match. It's still anyone's game. I want Serbia to wins this match because then I'll get to see Rafa vs Novak tomorrow. If Spain wins the doubles, then Rafa vs Novak won't happen because what is the point of them playing when they have a risk of injuring themselves a few days before playing the Indian Wells tournament, an important ATP Masters Series Event.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't care who wins the first round since I know Spain will win, but I want to see the 15th match of their rivalry tomorrow. (I just care about USA in the Davis Cup because I'm American...so yeah I want them to win obviously hahaha)|`|uWYlumvsaa	Well Serbia got lucky winning that doubles match. It'll be over after Rafa punishes Djokovic tomorrow. I honestly don't think the other Spaniards will ever play at the kind of level where they can compete with the top players. Lopez and Robredo should've beat Troicki and Zimonjic.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	Serbia won, but Rafa will beat Novak easily tommorow, don't worry. :)<br>  (or novak will retire)|`|HNnVrvCfaa	What a tense 3rd set that was!

e0M5lpc2aa	I wouldn't give Hanley unless you have a rock solid SS behind him. Hanley is arguably the best fantasy player out there due to his 30HR, 100RBI, 100R, .300 avg and 35 SB a year potential. Hanley is also leaps and bounds over the number 2 SS, Jimmy Rollins.<br>  <br>  Pujols on the other hand, puts up Hanley-like numbers with less SB and a higher avg. Also depth at 1B is incredibly shallow, with Howard, Tex, Fielder and company at 1B. Why trade a legit number 1 pick, who is leaps and bounds above the next at his position for a number 5/6 when the next best 1B is a number 8/9/10?  <br>  <br>  Sure CC is better than Zambrano, but it's not worth giving up a 5 tool hitter like Hanley, unless you definitely have the player to sub in for Hanley at SS. Having a strong middle infield in fantasy is a huge advantage because the gap between a strong and average MI is so large.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a 1B and you have a good SS and bad pitching staff. Go ahead and do this trade. <br>  If your pitching staff is relatively solid, you don't have a decent SS and you have a decent 1B, this is a bad trade for you.|`|xRQfCdKOaa	If a 1st baseman is what you need, I suppose. Who is your ss going to be? Ramirez is #1 shortstop by far. While I believe Pujols is the best 1B he isn't that far ahead of the next few.|`|AA12234713	I you are able to get 1B A. Pujols and P CC sebathia For SS H Ramires and P C Zambrano this is not a good deal it is a perfect deal.|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Heck no!<br>  You're giving out one 'okay' hitter and one utterly useless player for one of the best starters in the league plus a good first baseman. <br>  WHAT A RIP OFF!!|`|5EuOTAjJaa	To put it bluntly: This trade stinks.<br>  <br>  Why would any one trade "TWO" dominant players for two just barely above journeymen players.<br>  <br>   Get real!!|`|yk4S7uuraa	No, you're getting much more quality that you're giving up. It's not fair trade. Hanley Ramirez is an average player, and Zambrano is porous.|`|gvMr9lMbaa	Hanley not good?wow very ignorant.CC should win 18 easy Carlos is risky,but could win that many.Albert for Hanley is even but remember the SS you'll have to replace him with will probably be a huge drop off,you'll have to make that up somewhere,probably your Utility.<br>     I would probably take the deal,but it's hard to say because I don't know what your roster looks like|`|AA11720887	Your question is incomplete. It depends on your needs from your roster which you didn't provide. If you have a Jeter on the bench then go for it. If you already have a top 5 first baseman, let it go. Zambrano had a bad year for him last year. Look for this to improve. It looks like a good deal for you but only you know your roster and it's shortcomings.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Somewhat fair and you would definitely have the better end of the deal.  Pujols and Ramirez are a push and Sabathia should have a better year than Zambrano.|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	NO!!!!!you would be getting MUCH better players than your giving.<br>  CC is the best starter in the league.<br>  Pujols is ONE OF the best hitters in the league.<br>  <br>  Hanley isn't really THAT good<br>  Zambrano-lets face it,HE STINKS!!!!

p7WqwU6Taa	to combat spinners who seem not to have much pace on the ball, i suggest standing back to begin with. You can obviously try to lure them up to the net, but it seems these opponents you are facing aren't trying to increase the pace of the game, but are instead trying to slow it, and wait for you to make unforced errors, or to throw you off balance. For this, i suggest increasing the pace of your shots, via hitting flatter shots, high topspin shots with kick, or a combination of both, somewhere in the middle. If a defensive spinner finds you're having trouble with their defense, they won't need to switch to offence, so hit hard, and force them to lob not because it's fun, but because they have to, or else they lose the point. Move up to the net as you do so, and pound them with hard hitting, but consistent and reliable power! =]<br>  <br>  It's not until you face spinners who also have a lot of pace on their shots, that you're in real trouble. But try to set them off balance with a variety of shots, and keep them on their toes with your armada of different strokes and playing styles. The worst thing to do is to allow a defensive spinner get into a comfortable rhythm, that way, it will be extremely hard to turn the tide of the game.<br>  All the best, and although i myself am a player who uses a lot of spin and kick, from now on, I will be considerate and refrain from doing so too casually =P|`|jpTl3o5naa	By answering this, I am talking about myself. I love to put a spin on any ball. Sorry.........it's fun!|`|IETH9UEVaa	the way i play is that i add more spin to anything to get the ball over and have them on the defensive so they can't do whatever they want. so advice is to take control before they are in control.|`|IrWFzPpMaa	Basically,one way you can handle players who hit with alot of spin is maybe stand a little closer in the court and make contact with the ball before it gets to bounce too high. Once the ball bounces,you then have to deal with the spin on the ball,but if you hit the ball a little quicker not letting it bounce and get too high off the ground,you should be able to return the ball back.|`|GWQXdw2qaa	Watch them carefully to see which way they are slicing their racket so you know if there's a top spin or back spin or whatever so you can better predict what direction the ball will bounce in.<br>  <br>  Also, hit some short balls and vary your hits so that your opponent has to run around more and not have time to hit a hard one to you.|`|qd7lLILMaa	Return with a deep shot down to there weaker shot and run up to volley, this will force them to make a poor shot or another lob. if they lob it then try your best to destroy them with an over head but if its a good lob then try it again. Once you get to the net, you control the game and just get some solid shots, angled volleys, or drop shots. Keep your confidence and make sure you don't try to rally with them at the baseline for they may be more consistent than you. good luck.|`|cBjQozuQaa	I encounter this all the time. The key is to do something that makers ur opponent vulnerable. This is the best thing to do and how I win my matches. Hit a topspin ball first then slice the ball back then if the opponent still returns it send a flat ball theirway if that doesn't throw them off then they r amazing tennis players!!!

DFshzoJkaa	Katz has ALWAYS been one of my favorite boxing writers.  He doesn't shill for promoter's and always calls it like he sees it. I've been a follower of his since his days at NY Daily news, and have learned a lot from him over the years.  He's the last of the old time boxing writers, and one of the very few who REALLY understands the sport and all the crap that goes on behind the scenes (of which he always exposes too).  He's not just a writer, but a TRUE fan.  Just wish he'd write more often.  In recent months, I've been wondering who he is writing for now.  But I imagine he's become exasperated and fed up with the current state of the boxing... just like I have... and he's taking a break.  If anyone knows who he is writing for now, let me know.   PS- I DEFINITELY whould have paid $49.99 to see his unsanctioned bout with Ron 'The Toadie" Borges.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i think he's a good boxing journalist,although i havent read much of his work in a while.<br>  <br>  has your avatar changed in the last few minutes (5:20 pm gmt here now)?|`|4a4c6f67f834620fbf409b518828d5d4aa	Michael is a good writer, but I haven't seen to much of his boxing editorials lately.

It won't arouse suspicion, and will work well enough as a last-ditch stabbing weapon to negate the need for plastic knives.

T1vgsbyKaa	The night before your game drink at least one cup of gatorade, and eat a dinner with plenty of carbs. When you wake up in the morning eat a solid breakfast, (nothing to upset your stomach.) and make sure to stretch to avoid being tight. i would also do some light running to get your legs warmed up. Having the right foods (foods with carbs) gives you more energy, because you have more to burn off. Gatorade gives you electrolytes which is also a source of energy. <br>  Another thing I always do right before a game is splash some water on my face to make sure I am alert and ready to kick butt!|`|Ff7lRKHiaa	i have noticed that when you chew gum during a soccer game you really don't get dehidrated as easily<br>  <br>  aslo if you get really pumped up before the game<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i Helped|`|bI1pDaofaa	Eat porridge or oatmeal.

Z5xgSATSaa	You may be able to take the cassette apart, but if you don't put all the cogs and spacers on, you will have to buy spacers to replace the cogs you took off. You will also have to adjust the limit screws on your derailleur so the you don't shift the chain off the cassette and into the spokes, Unless you are converting your bike to a single speed I don't see the point in removing cogs, just don't use the ones you don't need, much simpler.

8T0Z0Y17aa	You cannot ask that question. You cannot compare batsmen with bowlers. Similarly, you can't really compare spinnners and pace bowlers.|`|AA11088802	sachin|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Brad Donman|`|AA11589320	This has to be one of the most annoying question asked about sportsmen. <br>  <br>  Its annoying as we need to have a level playing field before we can compare something.  In the science world its called a controlled environment, or clinical trial.<br>  <br>  Taking a sportsman from say the early 1900s and comparing him at any level to a person of today is absolute nonsense.    <br>  <br>  In the 1900s the players had full time jobs.  The training was a between drinks and coaching was all but non existent.  It was left to the players to develop their own skills and this includes Olympic hopefuls. <br>  <br>  Yet another factor to think about is the level of competition.  Its easy to score 100 runs if the fielding team is hopeless.  But not as easy if they have talent. <br>  <br>  In fact just 40 years ago this was still the norm.   <br>  <br>  May I ask. <br>  As Don Bradman is rated as one of Australia's best, just how bloody good could he have been had he received the support that is provided to cricketers of today?   <br>  <br>  Today sports man/women in top level sports are full time sports people.     <br>  <br>  What amazes me is the ability of less populated countries say for example New Zealand to produce so many quality sports people when you compare their population to other larger lands.  <br>  <br>  In my eyes Glen Mcgrath would have to rate as up there with the best.  Not just for his playing ability but for his off field behaviour which is always wonderful.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Ex players who are now commentators.

Jump (15 years old.)|`|XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout.

KsoUiryAaa	Absolutely Denver! And I dont even see them stopping there!! Well at least not as far as the draft goes. They are going to have such a hard hitting D next year it not funny. They probably should draft a LB in the draft, which would be great probably my boy from USC or from Ohio State.<br>  <br>   But putting into perspective the other teams that did good for their teams:<br>  <br>  The Redskins for getting a great Defensive Lineman in Haynesworth and re-signing their best CB in DeAngelo Hall. <br>  <br>  The Chiefs for somehow getting Cassel for what they get him for.<br>  <br>  The Seahawks for upgrading their WR's since everyone of them was injured last year, by signing TJ.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	I think they are the big winners this year so far.<br>  The Denver Broncos: They signed Jabar Gaffney, J.J. Arrington, Lamont Jordon, Correll Buckhalter, Brian Dawkins, Andre Goodman and Renaldo Hill. These are just a couple of their big names signing on offense and defense.|`|VSJyzwYwaa	well Denver  has done good as well as the Seahawks,both teams have improved greatly.But the the true winner is the Giants so far.But there is time left and players out there that still havent been picked up or signed yet.I am a Seahawks fan so of course i want them to get all there needs met.so far i am pleased,like what Denver has done for your excitment.(rightfully so)Great question thanks!|`|0BgzkLdUaa	Broncos and Bucs.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Denver|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	The Dan Snyder All-Stars.

For the world...Eto'o is the best La Liga, Ibrahimovic is the best in Serie A, Toni is the best in Bundesliga, and Benzema is the best in Ligue 1.

kqP7GwOcaa	A lot of people don't think of it as a chess match because it ended in a KO, but the first Leonard/Hearns fight was as technical a boxing match as you will find.  Tommy's reach and jab were giving Ray all kinds of trouble, and for his size, Tommy's speed and lateral movement were almost equal to Leonard.  Angelo Dundee's famous speech "Your blowing it son, your blowing it" lit a fire under Ray, and he came out late to KO Hearns, but up until then, Hearns was actually out boxing Leonard in one of history's better technical performances.  It wasn't what was expected, the roles reversed and the slugging Hearns became the boxer and the nearly pulled it off against the slicker Leonard.  Had Ray not completely reversed roles and turned slugger after Dundee's warnings for the epic KO, I think Hearns would have taken the decision.  Great fight.<br>  <br>  Others that were chess matches that come to mind were Salvador Sanchez's epic late KO of a young, almost unknown Azuma Nelson.  Ray Leonard/Duran (pick one, they each had there twists) and Pernell Whitakers gems against Chavez and DeLa Hoya, two fights I though Whitaker won rather handedly but were in my opinion very questionable decisions.  The Carbal/Gonzalas classics deserve mention as well, Humberto Gonzalas was at his best against Michael.|`|dh48AkbCaa	the muhammad ali vs ron lyle fight was a technical fight, as both wanted to draw the other man in, and it made for a boring contest.

The news media as a whole don't (won't) print the stories. It would be a great service to gun owners if it were printed in the NY Times, Chicago Tribune, or some CA paper. The big media don't want you to hear about it. <br>  I heard a one-liner on Oklahoma news about a Representative who had introduced an open carry law. No more mention has been made since.

AA10241450	20 minutes isn't really effective unless your running at a fast pace and since your trying to lose weight the optimal speed is aerobic or at a comfortable pace.  That's worrisome if your feeling your running to your bones.  Are you training on a treadmill or running on cement or around a track?  Have you replaced your shoes recently or have had your shoes for a while?  It may be time to change your shoes if your bones are hurting or you may be getting shin splits.<br>  <br>  My advice is to slow down the pace and go longer.  Try walking faster at a high pace and alternating with your jogging periodically.  Try going 30 and later 40 minutes.  You should also take advantage of resistance training at the gym.  Do heel and toe raises with some weight - I would do these after doing squats.  Also do leg presses and curls.  You need your leg muscles to be strong since your working out 5 times a week  and if your bones are feeling it.  Also mix up your aerobic training doing elliptical, running in the pool or the bike since your not pounding as much.  Let your body recover and do easy/hard day workouts so you can let your body adapt to the stress.  Good luck and have a smart workout!|`|1b4u5Ch7aa	your fine|`|PTw2PIPkaa	you can run everyday if you wanted to. you are doing fine.|`|1LsvZA9qaa	See a doctor just to be sure that everything is fine..

Do you really think that being a "real" fan has to do with being on their games or living in the same country as the club?<br>  <br>  90% of those who goes to their teams game end up with booing the players out if they haven't played "good" enough. Why? Because they had put so much money to come to the game and if they don't get entertained they want their money back. Real fan? I doubt.<br>  <br>  @Mr lover - I'm sorry, but still I don't understand how booing is suppose to help the team in any way. It will just cause them worse. Booing will not set everything straight either. And as a Gonner you probably know how inconsistent our games have been over the season.

bwibB9Cnaa	If Matt Cassel is the real deal then deff the Chiefs. Everything is riding on Cassell's arm.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go Pats '09 Brady to Moss!|`|Boc1Buuwaa	Ok first of all, im going to exclude the 49ers, Raiders, Lions and Browns from the list. 49ers will need to get a QB somewhere to dig out of their hole. Raiders.... well..... get rid of Al Davis somehow first. Lions, well come on, their the lions and will probably draft Crabtree with their 1st pick and Percy Harvin with their 2nd 1st rounder. Browns hired Eric Mangini, so that automatically gives them a 3 year hole again. I can definately see the Rams going somewhere if they draft a solid lineman with that 2nd pick. They need protection for Bulger more than anything. They have a solid QB/RB tandem with him and Jackson, and I think Spags is going to have a solid coaching career. The defense will be a lot better under Spags also, and look for Chris Long to have a great 2nd year. If the Bengals can avoid injury and drama, and draft a Lineman or a great defensive player then I can see them having a turnaround season. Jags, im not so sure about, Packers can only get better if Rodgers is improved, and they draft some guys to help out for the 3-4 defense. Then theres the Chiefs and Hawks. I see the Chiefs going in a whole new direction if they snag Curry in the draft. Cassell is going to thrive in KC in my opinion, and if LJ stays then watch out for this team on offense. Curry will make other linebackers better and they have a solid Line. Maybe get some help in the secondary as well. Hawks will have problems if they dont get better on the line|`|PuxP6UzVaa	The Saints and 49ers  will win at least 10 games this year.|`|AOA8TJraaa	Browns, 49ers, Chiefs and Seahawks.|`|0P71zlECaa	With all the wheeling and dealing they've done in the off season, plus the upcoming draft, almost all of those teams in the list should be improved next season, at least on paper. <br>  <br>  That doesn't mean their won/loss records will improve. Obviously some will, some won't.<br>  <br>  Mostly because of their weak divisions, I'd say the Packers and 49'ers are most likely to have a turnaround season and challenge for division titles. <br>  <br>  Picking one, I'd say the 49'er will have the best turnaround.|`|VSJyzwYwaa	I would have to say the Seahawks because of there off season signings and last year they were hurt everywhere and now they are somewhat healthly.With the 4th pick I am curious to see who they pick up.They signed Houchmangotah from Cincy and that will help at wide reciever,also Cole from Green Bay at DT.Resigned leroy hill.But we need to get a quarterback sooner than later.|`|NKN7HwkYaa	KC.<br>  They are in a division that is up for grabs (SD won it with a .500 record). They have a new QB and coach, and are set to go in a new direction. Not to mention, they lost a lot of really close games last year. They're not as bad off as some of those other teams because they have a lot of talent, on both sides of the ball. It really just seems like the defensive players couldn't adapt or buy into the schemes.|`|KsoUiryAaa	The Seahawks.<br>  <br>  Matt Hasselbeck is a lot better than the record that they posted last year. All of his WR's were hurt last year too so he has nobody to throw the ball to. This is a team that always wins that division and with TJ on that team now i expect nothing but a way better record than 4-12 this year.|`|cmqkErR1aa	the chiefs most definitely|`|cSrWQokbaa	you forgot one the redskins (8-8) we be division champs or a high wild card team this year|`|8x8FIm9zaa	Chiefs...|`|rjuqrHK7aa	The Bengals will be the team to suprise people next season. Most people think that defense is the problem, but that is not true. Last season the defense finished ranked 12th. The defense is young at most positions and it will only get better. They finally have a good defensive coordinator in Mike Zimmer. The entire secondary is all second and third year players. Keith Rivers looked good before his injury. The problem on defense is the pass rush. If they can find someone in the draft to come in and help in that area, the defense might be top ten. <br>  <br>  Offense finished ranked dead last, last season. A big reason for that was the sholder injury to Carson Palmer. He only played in four games. In those games, we alomst beat the Cowboys and Giants. They signed Cedric Benson after the fourth game and he started 12 games. If you look at his stats, he was very productive for them. He was resigned to a two year contract this off season. Carson Palmer is recovered from his injury. Marvin Lewis said that if there was one more game in the seaons that Palmer would have started. <br>  <br>  T.J. left, but that might have been good. He never practiced with the team. He didn't practice during the week. How can the offense get on the same page when he is not practicing. They signed Laveraneus Coles to replace him. Coles is faster and doesn't miss practice. They have a lot of depth at the receiver position. They need to work on the offensive line. That is the major area they need to improve in. The gave up the third most sacks last year. At the end they play two young guys that showed potential to be starters. <br>  <br>  Marvin Lewis is turning things around this offseason.|`|YN8Rbjogaa	the Packers, but they need to shore up the defense, big time. Aaron Rodgers is fine at QB, and they should be ok with the RB's and WR's they have. Cullen Jenkins was missed after his injury, and they had no one to step up and play behind them. If they can get the defense figured out, they should win the north next year.

6sTsDvKmaa	Try looking them up on youtube.  <br>  <br>  Karate (Empty Hand) is a japanese martial art originating from Okinawa.  It is defensive and includes kata, punching, blocking, kicking, etc.<br>  <br>  Judo (Gentle way), is from Japan and originated from Japanese jujitsu.  Today, it is practiced as a sport, much like Kendo is practiced as the sport of swordfighting, judo focuses on the throwing/grappling aspects of japanese jujitsu.  It can be used in self defense, and is considered a martial art. <br>  <br>  Kung Fu is of Chinese origin.  Don't know too many specifics about it, except that it includes kata and uses many animal forms, as well as weapons.  But I reckon it depends on the school.|`|FPuFDrZDaa	Judo originated in Korea, and is mostly based on throws, using your opponents own body weight and momentum against them.<br>  Karate is more of a striking, attacking martial art which originated from Japan. Karate is often meshed in with Tae Kwon-Do (from Korea, like Judo and Hapkido), simply cuz Americans know the term karate better than Tae Kwon-Do. Most american "karate" schools actually teach t.k.d.; cuz it's more defensive (and thus more real-world applicable) than traditional karate.<br>  Kung Fu originated in China, and is much more of a show art than a fighting art. Don't get me wrong- of course there are many useful and even lethal techniques in kung-fu; but there's also alot of wasted movement. It looks really awesome to see kung-fu masters doing all the flip-kick, crouching tiger, circus-type moves; but in reality- they have little or no practical application. That's why the great Bruce Lee took everything that was useful from kung-fu, eliminated everything wasteful, and created Jeet Kun-Do. Unfortunately- due to Lee's untimely death, there still aren't many Jeet Kun-Do instructors and/or schools around, so it's still not considered a "major" martial art, and prob. never will be. I def. wouldn't advise challenging someone who knows Jeet Kun-Do; cuz that means they were more or less trained by (prob someone trained by) Bruce lee himself. So if there is a superior martial art, I'd have to say Jeet Kun-Do; though it will prob. never reach the popularity of karate and t.k.d... hope that answers your question.|`|yqC51KXOaa	Mainly they r just in different parts of the world.|`|3KQRw8sPaa	i'm insulted|`|ehGZwdAtaa	Martial Arts has many different styles and these are just a few of them. Judo is all about close combat and grappling(wrestling) to submit the opponent of it could be used for self-defence.Karate litterally means empty hand  in Japanese, it originated from Japan and there are many style of Karate, for example I study Go Ju Kai, there are hundreds of types and we study kata, self defence, Sparring, Bunkai, and others. Kung Fu originates from china and is all about how to react quickly. This was originally created to protect yourself from samauri's with practically anything|`|r5AMG8g7aa	First let me say that Karate is not from Japan......  It is true that there are styles from Japan, but Karate came from Okinawa. It was introduce to Japan in the early 1900's. There are many different styles of karate in Okinawa and Japan. They vary in emphasis, but all have strikes, punches and kicking techniques. Judo is from Japan an is only a little more than 100 years old. It was created by Dr. Kano from jujitsu. Jujitsu is self-defense that uses throws, joint locks, chokes and some strikes. Judo was created as a sport. Basically the main difference in judo and jujitsu is that Dr. Kano left out some of the more dangerous techniques to create a sport. However Judo can still be dangerous. Kung-Fu in a generic term for many styles of Chinese martial arts. It is estimated that there are between 300 and 400 different types/styles of Kung-Fu in China. It uses strikes, kicks, throws and joint locks. Some styles also incorporate weapons into the training.   It would take several large books to explain in greater detail but this is basically what you asked.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	judo is mostly throws, karate is self-defense, and kung fu is based on the reactions
xQFWjFyZaa	I really like Braun this year, and given the chance, I would draft him over Sizemore every time. <br>  <br>  The thing is, when you draft a first round player, the rest of your draft is building around him. Since you drafted Sizemore, you probably didn't grab much more speed, thinking it was covered. We need to see the rest of your team to really know which way to go. <br>  <br>  A lot of people prefer Sizemore because he's a 5 tool player.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	it really depends on the rest of your team and it's needs.  <br>  sizemore is a leadoff hitter with some power who will score a ton of runs and steal lots of bases.  he still manages to get a decent amount of rbis despite batting leadoff. <br>  braun is an arod-type hitter with lots of power who hits #3 in the order.  he will have lots of rbi opportunities and will get you double digit stolen bases.  <br>  as far as the trade itself goes imo it is pretty even.  with braun you get the edge in power and sizemore gets the edge in speed.<br>  if you already have some speed I say do this trade.  steals are easy to pick up from the waiver wire if you need a bump there or you can trade a lesser player to get a taveras/bourn type guy.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	Who else is on your team?<br>  If you have another 30+ SB player, then do it. If you don't have any SB then you're hurting yourself. The two are even except for SB. Braun hits with a tad more power, but Sizemore has the SB aspect.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you right now, because I don't know your team, but overall the person who gets Sizemore gets a slightly better deal due to SB. If you don't mind losing the SB go ahead and do it.|`|lmhh9bywaa	Braun. I hate drafting 5x5 players in the first round. they put up mediocre stats in each catagory. get someone like braun who will hit around .300 and hit you 35-40 bombs with 120+RBIs<br>  <br>  THATS a first round pick. NOT hanley ramirez, sizemore, or reyes.|`|tARluLEZaa	Smart idea, Braun will get you more points then Sizemore. Grady Sizemore will mostly get you points in only hits and some steals while Braun can get you a lot of points in HRs, RBIs, hits and more.

UbUSth5haa	The WWE would screw Michelle McCool, by making her lose her Diva's Championship to someone with absolutely no experience like Maria or Eve Torres. The WWE is would screw Michelle McCool by not giving her any air time. The WWE is making Michelle McCool a somebody. The face gimmick wasn't working because you can go online and see that the WWE Divas think that Michelle McCool is a b*tch, and on the WWE Universe (fans.wwe.com) they actually have threads saying "The Official We Hate Michelle McCool Thread" she is receiving amazing heat not only in the ring but outside, so turning her into a heel was a smart move.<br>  <br>  P.S. Maryse is the top diva on SmackDown!, McCool is 2nd|`|JiCfYfLraa	um no because michelle mccool is the top female on the smackdown roster now that natalya neidhart is on ecw.<br>  <br>  what are you talking about????michelle mccool is so dominate and she is on a winning streak.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	well i like that Michelle is more fierce, i've been so sick and tired of divas just doing petty slaps. i mean when Michelle beat up Maria pretty bad like one or two months ago, i was SURPRISED that they let it go on for that long.|`|cpSXA0udaa	hell no|`|qwdh7N6saa	I do a little bit. they should have her face maryes for the women's title|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I think the only way Michelle McCool is being screwed is by the Undertaker because she's dating him!<br>  <br>  As for the WWE screwing her I have to disagree I'm afraid.  Within the past 12 months she has been pushed up to main event status, was the first diva's champion and has a huge feud with Maryse.  I think of all the diva's on Smackdown! she's been given the biggest push of all.<br>  <br>  She may have lame storylines at the moment now that her feud with Maryse seems to have subsided and they may have given her a gimmick here and there with her very slowly becoming a heel but overall I think she's one if not the most dominant diva on the Smackdown! roster today.  In fact, i'd go as far as to say she's soaring with no signs of her coming down!!!|`|WQGvE60waa	They will after the Undertaker retires.<br>  <br>  Lets face it she thinks she has everything since she strated screwing The Undertaker.<br>  <br>  I hope it blows up in her face
Mya9LUxuaa	To improve your sprint speed you should do,<br>  explosive squats, box jumps, etc.<br>  Do sets of 50m of all out sprinting|`|yqC51KXOaa	I would get on a treadmill and just run run run. Start increasing time, and run longer. Then watch your time go down. Just make sure you stretch before AND AFTER. that second part is HUGE. Another thing you could do is go to a gym and work out ur thighes and calves. Also, take care of your ankles. runners wear them out.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	First of all, you have to understand that, no matter how fast you run, chances are someone is faster than you.<br>  <br>  About improving, most people that run with no formal training are unaware of the importance of the step. You have an optimum step and you have to find it. The goal is to put your foot against the floor just in time to get the minimum amount of grip to keep you in the air. If your step is short, you get too much grip, your leg has to hold your weight to keep you from falling face down. If your step is too long, you leg strains trying to push you ahead and keeping you from falling back. Those are extreme situations but they give you an idea of how it feels when you're off your optimum step. If you could film yourself running from the side, the optimum step is like gliding. The line drawn by your hip is almost straight parallel to the floor. If you're out of step, your hip goes up and down.<br>  Once you get your optimum step for a certain speed, it's a lot easier to regulate it for different speeds.|`|qObtdFynaa	get on a treadmill run at a whatever amount of miles you feel is comfortable then do it  for a specific time. do it for the same amount of time everyday then the week next increase the amount of miles you're running and time and so on
hxQaqSvkaa	Are you guys starting from kneeling position or just standing? I am a flyer and our half lib was perfect but we couldn't get our straight up full. We were starting from a standing position. At cheer camp they told us to have the backspot and the non-main start kneeling and then push up into it. If that doesnt work the try to build more arm strengh. Try to focus on upper shoulder strengh. Here are some excercises <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/video/86544_cheerleading-stunts-conditioning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/video/86544...</a>|`|YJIkgvtNaa	You probably need more arm strength. So work on that. But also, have your other base step into the stunt more. Have her be right under the flyer and it also helps if her bended knee is... this might sound weird, but right in between your legs. It will allow the other base to be able to help support the flyer more.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

Just keep trying and remember that kickflips are the most frustrating trick to learn in skateboarding and just take time to get and perfect.
vVH2xmLAaa	I am a huge KY fan myself and an ex-college player in the state of KY, so I have a bit of knowledge.  <br>  <br>  Unless they go to the finals of the SEC tourney they will not make it in.  It really depends on which team shows up for the SEC tourney.  If they are clicking with Patterson and Meeks, they can get to the finals.  <br>  <br>  Final predicition:  They are to inconsistent under the helm of the worst hire in KY coaching history.  No tourney this year, and this deeply hurts as a fan.  Until they get rid of Gillispie, they will continue to fall.  He's a great recruiter but a horrible general of coaching.  Why would one of the most historic teams in the country hire a coach who had absolutely no resume!!! The guy went to one sweet sixteen in his life. Seriously?|`|lqjimKfaaa	they'll prolly make it cause the SEC is weak and the NCAA will want som sort of equal representation from each major conference
mtIFZnsHaa	The 66 is not powerful enough to consistently kill squirrels, or even a big rat.  You really need more juice.  I would get a more powerful air rifle, either a break barrel or a PCP.  Something in larger than .177 for actual hunting in the woods conditions.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I found that the pellets make all the difference.  I haven't had to use them in years, but the "pointed" pellets that are available from Crossman and other makers do a fine job on squirrels, rabbits, rats, chipmunks, etc if you hit the animal well (head shot).  <br>  <br>  The flat or domed pellets just don't penetrate well, but the pointed ones stop big Pennsylvania squirrels dead in their tracks!|`|ad5455b2eaa62e2475ecd39a9f4347b6aa	You could but you would still need to be at a very close range! More likely you would not kill the animal but only wound the animal. If you are in an area that allows hunting try using a 22 cal. A great small arm and will make you a much better shot as well.  .......... Good hunting!|`|km9cQNAXaa	I've said it before and I will ignore the thumbs down.<br>  <br>  Air weapons lack the power required for a clean, humane kill. You need incredible accuracy or a fluke to avoid injured game. For rabbits get yourself a .22LR.

8Nlcxf3Waa	In one word, absolutely.  I'll explain my reasoning behind this.  When questioning the playability in irons with any rust on them it tells me that the irons are either very old or not so old but not taken care of.  My personal opinion on what to do to resolve this is to get some new irons.  If you're on a budget you can still nail down some very nice used irons from mizuno for little cost.  Improving the technology in your bag will also make your day on the course much more enjoyable.|`|WjeE4Cx8aa	If the grooves are rusty, you will most likely spin the ball a little more.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	a little rust never hurt anything.|`|faDywnm6aa	sometimes but not realy

rZmiyAqJaa	and if you watched it you could see that it wasn't even nearly as close as the score would suggest. I'm never one to bit*h about calls, but the Cavs shot 28 more freethrows than the Celtics. And with the Celtics scoring so much in the paint.....they sure did not get alot of calls down inside. <br>  <br>  It was  good game though, Pierce proved, once again, that he can play with anybody in the game and Ray Ray stepped up big in the second half.  And to the people that say the Celtics have a weak bench.....what could they say now?|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Statement game for the celtics,and the cavs played horribly,especially defensively against there big men<br>  celtics utilised leon and perkins very well,props to the celts|`|xg4NjusZaa	Ya they shut down lebron he couldn't get anything going.

He doesn't realise that the batsman is meant to hit the ball with his bat, not with his head.<br>  <br>  Bodyline, Ashish? That's why they introduced the two bouncers per over rule.

FLKA2fiUaa	They can be used for taping flags for colorguard, Taping your hockey sticks, pants, shin guards. Mostly anything that wise.<br>  <br>  As for taping body parts, you don't always have to have an injury. You can tape your wrists or ankles if yours are weak and need that extra support. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, if you have shin splints or such I'd tape those up.<br>  <br>  TIP: If your applying the tape to your body, dont just put it directly on there. Find something called pre-wrap and wrap it with that first. Then put the tape on.|`|x6uCeQ5Aaa	Athletic tape has a ton of uses... People often use it if they need extra support for their wrists or ankles and use prewrap underneath. Some people will tape their shins if they have shin splints too. Other people will put tape over their piercings if they are new and can't be taken out. If I get a brush burn or scrape I will sometimes put a band aid on, then prewrap, and then athletic tape to make sure the wound is well protected. Lastly athletic tape can be used to re-tape grips on bats, and sticks. I have even seen people tape over their shoelaces to keep them tied.

ktqnO4wHaa	Burning|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Not fun. You get dehydrated and really sweaty.|`|pzSThTR1aa	It sucks! I run in the heat every day of the year. Its not just hot its like a billion degrees. The only good thing is that it gives you a tan but a bad farmers tan. Running wise I find the cold easier.
ktqnO4wHaa	Icey|`|UMdzRjnHaa	I find that it's harder to maintain a steady breathing rate, and my throat starts to hurt a lot, and I get that taste of blood.  It's not blood, it just tastes like it.  All in all, it's quite a bit more difficult than running at a warmer temperature.  Mind you, i'm from Canada, so the temperatures are quite low here during the winter.|`|YHJcJ0lHaa	It's horrible. it's hard to catch your breath|`|pHsbm3Haaa	...cold
ktqnO4wHaa	Bad|`|gzccNUdkaa	shin splints.<br>  ugh.|`|xPzN6xa2aa	Painful especially if your not use to it and expect cramps.|`|pHsbm3Haaa	umm just like running with shoes on but more comfortable<br>  just go try and see for yourself|`|demzNLi7aa	Crappy, your feet hurt from lack of support.
ktqnO4wHaa	Good|`|cervQlVzaa	They're nice.|`|UMdzRjnHaa	I just bought a pair, and I haven't run in them yet, but when I wore them around the store, they seemed really supportive from all angles, versus cross trainers which seem more free.
vCtCW8ODaa	there's only one way to find out.... 'fight'
qGfAlDd2aa	I really didn't know this was a burning issue . . .<br>  <br>  Leotards are a unisex garment.  Men and women both wear leos.  Gymnasts wear leos, the women have theirs exposed, the men must wear a pair of shorts or pants so it looks like a tee shirt (competition rules).  Male dancers wear leos, too.<br>  <br>  Actually the leotard was invented by a man, Jules Léotard, for himself so it was originally male's clothing  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leotards" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leotards</a> .  So, perhaps your question should be "Why can girls wear guy's clothing but not the other way around?"
AwyL5nBuaa	yes ?<br>  i started in what...8th grade ? yeah, totally.<br>  just enter a beginning class.|`|ULitp0PWaa	Yes, just take a tumbling 1 class. There should be a pretty big range of ages.<br>  <br>  ?

Plus, if you want to do it all the way through college, why not start now? :) good luck!
2HG8tx46aa	They can pop like crazy. All the height in tricks come from how much you pop the board. Then the easy part is keeping the board under your feet. In ollies you just slide your foot up the board and it levels out and makes it look like you glued the board to your shoes|`|SCs2inCsaa	The grip tape allows your foot not to slide off. Also, you pop the board under you while jumping, so it has its own power as well.

8eyDGCGEaa	Makes my blood boil when fans call to see the back of gordan Strachan.  He is only the most succesfull domestic manager we have ever had.  What true fan would want to lose the man who is about to take us to our fourth SPL in a row, even the most hardeved rangers supporters will admit they will be lucky to knock us of the top cos we will if not win at ibrox then draw truth is rangers need a new manager smith saves them he's done his job move on now.Strachan 3x SPL 2x K-O stages Champions lge, yes jock steins lisbon lions but there was home away legs something like 10 games to win European Cup.|`|217ff35a8ea8ca73e63af6072240aa24aa	The ones we signed after the EUROS|`|BdiQPKn0aa	I only heard the game on the radio but from what i heard none of their players were any good but i guess you've got to see it first to make any kind of comment|`|ighVri6Aaa	they haven't had a good player all season, and strachan is responsible for that, i for 1 cant wait to see the back of him come may.<br>  thing is even though they are bad they are still the best team in the spl by a mile no one else is good enough to put in a real challenge,|`|6WhpROH1aa	jan wae the big nose wiz shockin today.......the trebles in the bag|`|nH4TOhGVaa	Saw the second half and they were all mince and well done to the St Mirren.|`|X7FEgCE1aa	St Mirren just looked like they wanted it more. Celtic never dictated spells throughout the game but neither did St Mirren. Defo PK and could have been a sending off.<br>  Celtic failed to create chances and as such there was very little golden chances, for either side.<br>  Bit of a lottery and St Mirren deserved to win in the end. I hope they lift The Scottish Cup.|`|eZMFAsFDaa	Hinkel in the second half.. he never passed the ball to a celtic player at all SHOCKIN!|`|blIXn0Tyaa	They were all crap if you ask me

They played the better football. If Hamilton do the same and put out Rangers will you think it is a disaster, yes because as a fan you want your team to do well.

fzbjRpeJaa	Hell,<br>        This is not something new the banana benders are always trying to wind us up!!!<br>  The only reason it is called NRL was due to the Super league fiasco.<br>  Granted queensland has some fine players but if it weren't for us sydney people they would still be playing in a second rate competition.We let the other states play in our competition and even the kiwis.<br>  The bottom line is this is a Sydney based organisation that allows the others to join in, the ultimate game of the season stays in the home base where it belongs.<br>  Oh and i cant believe im saying this being a die hard dragons fan. I will be at the ground watching the WCC and giving the Eagles my support.|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	I think it would be great why should Sydney teams always have the benefit of Playing the Final in Sydney? all you guys talking bout politics maybe you need to wake up becoz having evry final in sydney is as political as it gets!!  It shud be shared around if not change the name from NRL to SRL becoz sydney is all that seems to matter to these one eyed politicians that have dug our game into the big hole its sitting in at the Moment.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It won't happen. Lang Park does not have the capacity to match the Olympic Stadium. 80,000 minimum at the ground. What is Suncorp's maximimum. 45,000-50,000?  Work it out for yourself, an extra 30,000 plus tickets at a minimum $100 per ticket. <br>  <br>  Kuruki, maybe the banana benders deserve to have a GF but the bottem line is "Show me the money" and Suncorp is just not big ebough.|`|kecdkv6jaa	Like those two up there said, the NRL would be even stupider then they are now if they take the premiers advice. Losing over 30,000 tickets worth of money.<br>  <br>  I think she should just stick to politics and leave our sport alone.|`|mber3JoAaa	Regardless of what happens in the rest of the season, the crowd for the Grand Final is consistently in excess of 80,000. Therefore it should stay at ANZ Stadium. More patrons means more money for the NRL. So the NRL would just be shooting themselves in the foot if they take the GF to a ground which only hosts 50,000 odd.|`|R0NfdgzLaa	agreed, that they won't do it because of money.<br>  <br>  but what if it's brisbane vs gold coast?  more than 50,000 new south welshmen gonna drag themselves to watch that?  i know it's unlikely but it's possible that there won't be any sydney teams in the grand final again.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	It won't happen - just the newspaper looking for a story and blowing it out of proportion.

fvMv1DT3aa	I like to see a wrestler that tries their best each and every week and earns every championship shot that they get. My favorite kind of wrestling is technical wrestling, so I like to see someone that has good technical wrestling abilities. I like wrestlers that can put on a great match no matter who they are working with and when they actually put others over. Outside of the ring, I like them to actually care about their fans and take the time out to talk to them and appreciate them. I also prefer wrestlers that stay clean and don't do any kind of drugs and wrestlers that are friendly and personable people.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	In my opinion, the most important thing is passion.<br>  If you don't have the drive to go further or make an impact, you usually won't be very good.<br>  <br>  I personally like to see wrestlers that are able to be very charismatic and match it with great technical wrestling ability. I am a personal fan of submission style wrestlers but it's always entertaining to see people go to the top rope. Not much of a powerhouse fan unless it's one that backs it up with technical ability which is quite rare.<br>  <br>  Other things that I like to see is respect to fans, co-workers, and earlier wrestlers.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	My dream wrestler should have,<br>  <br>  Technicality of Kurt Angle, Abilities of Chris Benoit, Charisma of Rock, Power of Brock Lesnar, Toughness of Haku Mic Skills of Bobby Heenan and the heart of Ric Flair.|`|OrlQ7leBaa	How about Charismatic, Hardcore, and a Dirty Attitude?|`|qF1oQG7Xaa	This will be in a random order...<br>  <br>  As already said a lot, wrestling skills, they need to be able to do a variety of moves, safely and effectively, and be able to make it flow well, and have good acting inside the ring.<br>   <br>  Respect, to other wrestlers backstage, to fans who support them and to everybody who makes WWE what it is. <br>   <br>  Good role model, since so many children watch WWE, it is important they stick to the rules for younger viewers. <br>   <br>  Good acting, backstage to make storylines seem real and work.<br>   <br>  Can handle the pressure well, they are always organised, always ready, wrestling is hard, they need to up for it.<br>   <br>  Positive attitude, they need to be positive, and like what they do, they probably grew up wrestling fans, so they have to love what they do,<br>   <br>   <br>  I think that's the main points really, and a few minor ones, hope you like my answer.|`|52JcqKJmaa	Great mic skills. There are a lot of talented athletic wrestlers who couldn't give an interview to save there life. Then there are guys like Flair, Nash, Austin, Rock and Jericho who aren't the most talented but gave a hell of an interview and made their matches better. Not because of in-ring skills, but because they got you excited about their match.|`|SCT2sG0Faa	shawn michaels|`|nQHkkR8Raa	They have to have good wrestling skills, can't wrestle well everything else is worth ****.<br>   <br>  My only thought i'm sorry but have a star anyway,<br>   <br>  Edit - and also, they have to be able to bash that gay w4l in easily.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Athleticism, Charisma, Good attitude towards fans, Respect backstage towards colleagues.

khbLZQHIaa	The haters don't have lives.  It's simple as that.<br>  <br>  Without Big Ben will pay a toll defensivly but also allows JJ, and Andy and even Darnell to show their stuff.<br>  <br>  Cavs win a really close one.  91-88.<br>  Edit:<br>  Wait... you want Duncan to play...?<br>  Is it so when we win people won't be saying "the Cavs beat the Spurs without Duncan, so it's not a real win"<br>  That's probably what's going to happen.|`|3teWTOPqaa	When Lakers lose it's like Cavs lose X 100 on here, and what do you mean by "haters", it's pretty obvious it's just one kid with mutiple accounts, I thought no one on here have over 5 accounts until Pepper came on here and proved me wrong.<br>  <br>  BQ: Cavs defense will be slightly affected, but Wallace is easily replaceable. <br>  <br>  <br>  If Duncan plays I think the Cavs will struggle stopping him downlow, if he doesn't it's going to be open lane for LeBron to attack.<br>  <br>  Duncan-less Spurs: 78<br>  Cavs: 91<br>  <br>  Spurs with TD: 92<br>  Cavs: 94<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think Kobe is determined to break that jinx, too bad it didn't come last year, so he could have gotten a ring, MVP, and a gold medal.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Unfortunately, they are.<br>  <br>  Probably quite a bit for the first few games. But once they get used to playing without him, it shouldn't effect them that much.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	i think ben Wallace's career maybe be over...injureis like those never fully heal <br>  <br>  but i do hope the cavs struggle|`|csKyqot0aa	It won't really affect them much. We were fine when Z was out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cleveland wins 101-90|`|l0iCqzlQaa	spurs win 96-87, its okay when you hate on the celtics though right?|`|EKF2HdZKaa	The Ben Wallace thing will hurt our defense,and it might make him less productive in the playoffs,but still i think this is a good oppurtuinity for anderson and jj to get more minutes,which will help their development<br>  i also think this might mean our GM will sign another big<br>  i agree with wut the haters are sayin,its one freakin game in the SEASON,the cavs are still one of the elite<br>  i predict the cavs win since they are good at shakin off losses<br>  wow even u noticed we suk on tnt|`|lWNc9NRfaa	I expect the Cavs to win by something like 95 - 89. Ben is a factor, but not a huge one. After that game last night, they will be ready to play and it is not like they cannot win on the road. The Spurs never really take a regular season game too serious and I just don't think that they will be as motivated as Cleveland.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	Even though are Defense will suffer, our offense will get better. Last night it was like 4 on 5 on offense for the cavs.  Ben really hurts them on offense.  Also I hope they can maybe make a move and buy out Joe Smith or maybe Horry by Sunday.|`|AA11114814	Im a Spurs fan and I think the Cavs should win if Duncan is out.  If not then they may still win.  Its hard enough winning without Manu.  88-82 Spurs<br>  <br>  Oh and I love LeBron.  Would look good in Silver and Black.|`|dDhTMacAaa	slippageeeeee!!!!!<br>  <br>  muahaha :) <br>  <br>  Cavs...get those Spurs (please)|`|UMVWQiYJaa	96-91 Cavs|`|Zt1VDawZaa	LOL How can we be a Cav hater when they dont have real fans?<br>  <br>  More like Lebron hateR?|`|m501HwyWaa	thiers actually a hater...that uses his real avatar pic<br>  <br>  *points above*<br>  man is someone on here knew u|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	I dunno, I'm a Lakers fan, and I think you guys get too many calls at home that you don't deserve, but I don't hate you guys, it is getting excessive.<br>  <br>  STOP THE HATIN'|`|ciQFlpuLaa	the basketball section has changed a lot since the last time i came here. i've been too busy in the Politics Section hating on the Democrats.|`|IKGhRJVsaa	Bennie's injury affecting the Cavs????

x9GODf8eaa	Blades are completely based on preference and position. <br>  <br>  The rafalski is fairly similar to the Easton Sakic, which is a widely popular blade.<br>  <br>  It has a mid curve, moderate depth, lie 5.5 and a round toe. The face is slightly open, so your slapshots won't be quite as accurate as a blade with a closed face, but it is good for getting wrist shots up high, and saucer passes. Good blade for a winger who likes to shoot from in close.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	"How it is" varies on personal preference.<br>  So try it out to see what YOUR personal preference is...
ZRk15H9Caa	I have been to 18 major league parks in my life and i still cant get over yankee stadium.  that is my favorite ballpark|`|WU9q4wNXaa	Ive been to about 8 stadiums<br>  But my favorite is easily Minute Maid Park in Houston.<br>  Its an awesome atmosphere for a baseball game, especially if the Astros have been playing good (which isnt too often unfortunately).<br>  Every seat is a good seat. And they always got some special promotion or tribute going on. And it can get really loud when the roof is closed! Its just an awesome place to watch a baseball game.<br>  Out the stadiums ive been to i'd rate them<br>  1. Minute Maid Park (Houston)<br>  2. AT&T Park (San Francisco)<br>  3. AstroDome (Houston) *wish it was still useful*<br>  4. Baltimore's<br>  5. Angel Stadium (Anaheim)<br>  6. Petco Park (San Diego) <br>  7. Dodger Stadium (Los Angeles)<br>  8. McAfee Stadium (Oakland)|`|i0Exuxi2aa	My number 1 favorite would be the Original Yankee Stadium. It's an old ballpark but that exactly what makes it great. It's all the history and the atmosphere and the cheering fans / booing haters that makes you feel like you never want to leave.<br>  Second would be Fenway because of all the fan support (coming from a Yankee fan). What ruins it is that some of the Boston fans come at you looking for a fist fight.<br>  Third would be PNC park. You're right, the park is gorgeous.|`|QyJBl9aFaa	Great American Ballpark.  The view from the 3rd base side is priceless with the big steamboat in Centerfield and a view of the Ohio River.  GABP has all the amenities of current new ballparks and altho has yet to have the history the the crappy cookie cutter Riverfront did, in time (I hope) we'll have great on the field memories to go along with the aesthetic beauty of that park.|`|fIqwuGWTaa	i like the giants stadium. the got the giants coke bottle the huge glove and the water with all the crazy fans on their boats waiting for a home run out of the right field side of the park|`|0MuRCU5paa	Old Tiger Stadium.

When I traveled to Baltimore however, Camden Yards was awesome, so I'd say Camden Yards.|`|AA11414524	Being a Cubs fan, perhaps I'm biased, but I LOVE Wrigley Field. I would also love to go to Fenway someday.|`|HP75NEbNaa	Interesting Question, a lot of people have different opinions.<br>  <br>  For me, it's Fenway. There's just such a good feeling and it's real baseball played there. Not a game of economics and technology, just the game of baseball. You've got Pesky's Pole, Yawkey's Way, Ted Williams's Seat, and the Green Monster there. It's great to watch a game there, especially on opening day. <br>  <br>  Wrigley Field comes in at second. That place has a lot of history, too.|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Oakland A's (McAfee Coliseum, but the names changing), because they're my team and I like their stadium no matter how it looks. Many people don't like it, but I appreciate the stadium and some of the history it's made. I also like Petco Park and AT&T Park! And, the A's are the only team that's a Coliseum!:)|`|WthJx6Vaaa	Rogers Centre.

rLbkG3Qjaa	Adidas shoes are super heavy! you could hardly find a shoe that is less than 17 oz. Which is a lot! And almost all nike shoes are around 15 oz. or less. Nike Huperdunks -13.9oz hm?? So about Air Max tech-well I think it sucks personally compared to all of today's teches. There is a problem with max air it has a tendency to tear because of high air pressure or just because you scratched them on a sharp thing but it does provide good cushioning. Well if you want performance and not a good look buy a AIR MAx but if you want looks get zoom or AIR. <br>  And adidas sucks!|`|A71U6gNtaa	why not.|`|TnH7OcOKaa	Nike is okay.... but for Basketball, I would prefer Adidas, there SUPER light|`|dB25AQRFaa	If u want to Play basketball Adidas

I know it's only been a few weeks but it seems like an eternity!|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i dunno.. maybe he is in a bad mood..<br>  they have alot of emotions too..<br>  maybe he does not liket he court<br>  or maybe he is in pain with his back.. even though he won easy..<br>  <br>  wish i could ask him|`|AA12034105	He won !!!! :D :D<br>  It was sooooo good to see him back in action and win in such style ;-) haha <br>  I think he was saying about his raquet cause he didn't seem to be happy about it for the whole match lol.  He had a few mis-hits. I think it was cause his strings were too loose or something lol <br>  And Ferrer bet Novak yayy !!!<br>  I'm glad Rafa's match wasn't too long so he doesn't strain his knees too much :)  He's back baby !!! haha :P<br>  What was the guy interviewing him at the end like ? lmao "maybe if the stadium falls down in the middle of the night" lmao :-)<br>  Aww I feel sorry for Rafa havng to put up with questions like them every match haha :P<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I don't think it's up yet but I'll post it when it is :)<br>  Have you seen this one ? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vf-2PkDa28" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vf-2PkDa...</a><br>  Haha he hits Almagro with the ball :P  His facial expressions crack me up haha :)|`|xcR8e8asaa	I thought he seemed unhappy about something too, but I can't understand if it was the court because he has been saying that he's been happy with the court during practice... maybe they practice on different courts though?  But I thought there was just one court that was purpose built for the occasion?  So maybe it was the racquet or something else.  Glad Rafa won easily though.|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	i cant watch it on tv . u no any good sites on da net 2 watch live streaming?<br>  ~go rafa!!!~|`|wx2UfKOdaa	rafa.... u  r back man..... and with no knee problem... thank god.... serbia is a good team too btw with novak
kqP7GwOcaa	Duran's intimidation and lack of respect for all things Leonard in Montreal jumps out at me almost immediately.  It completely threw Ray out of his game, and Ray tried to exact revenge from Roberto instead of trying to win a boxing match.  Duran turned one of the era's most gifted and elegant "boxers" into a slugger, and mugged Ray.<br>  <br>  Ali of course, his antics are the stuff of legend.  Just the fact that Ali pretended to be hurt when he wasn't saved his behind a couple times against some heavy hitters.  The manner in which he irritated and insulted his way into the heads of his most dangerous opponents make's Ali the best example of them all.<br>  <br>  Tyson's aura of invincibility served Mike well until Douglas exposed him in TKO and deserves mention.<br>  <br>  Guys like Hector Camacho and Ricardo Mayorga don't get enough credit, because the antics they brought into the ring were contrived to hide the effort and preparation they put into getting into shape.  Mayorga's cigarettes and beer in the ring were almost as convincing as George Foreman's cheeseburger training diet.  Brilliant.|`|R0J1W3BCaa	I know everyone is going to mention Gerogre Foreman vs Muhammad Ali as an example. One of the most recent fights were I think physiological warfare played a part would be Floyd Mayweather vs Ricky Haton. Mayweather's trash talk and attitude during the press conference's and weight in's had Ricky Hatton absolutely set on beating him. <br>  <br>  I remember at one point during the press conference Floyd was in the UK and the fans were throwing bottles and screaming Flipping him the Bird...while he danced with the British Flag in his hands(LMAO). I think that added with the whole US vs UK rivalry didn't make the situation any easy-er on Hatton. IF you watch the 24/7 and the fight Hatton was so fixed on KILL KILL KILL that when the fight started he wasn't the same fighter. I think he threw whatever "Game Plan" he had out the window and recklessly tried to KILL Floyd and that's what Evenenatully what got him caught and knocked out.|`|dh48AkbCaa	ray leonard completely out psyched marvin hagler before their memorable 1987 title fight, regardless of who you think won.|`|IJfUZeBUaa	Every single one of Roberto Duran's fights.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	The first fight betwen Steve Collins and Chris Eubank for the WBO  super middleweight title in 1995. The run-up to the fight was significant because Collins claimed he had been hypnotised before the fight so he could walk through Eubank's punches and he was invincible. This worried Eubank who has never dealt with something like this in his entire career. He was also undefeated in 43 bouts which meant the threat of him losing this fight was very real. <br>  <br>  The plan worked and it was a real psyche out job. During the course of twelve hard fought rounds Collins out boxed and out muscled Eubank to win his most important victory in his career. After the fight was over, he admitted in a post fight interview he was not really hypnotised and he fooled the whole world into thinking he was. It was a great fight but an even better psyche job behind it was priceless.

Vkbgr94xaa	I agree 100%. Dumb move. Sage is ok, just like Ferotte was, and 1/2 a dozen other QB's out there. The 2 you mentioned Garcia/Leftwich is exactly who I thought they shoule've gone after, maybe more so Garcia since he has scrambling ability and you only need a QB for 2 years or so since this team is built to win now. <br>  <br>  But hey, I'm a Packer fan so this is great news to me.|`|CQcLHR0zaa	I just got done asking myself the same question... <br>  <br>  They offered the Vikings Garcia last season but they said "no we have Frerotte". look how that one turned out...<br>  <br>  I really wish we would have picked up Garcia. Guy has MUCH better TD-INT ratio and a higher rating. not to mention a ring and he has actually been a starter for more than like 5 games...<br>  <br>  +he would be a much better Tjax mentor.<br>  <br>  Vikings staff is really dumb when it comes to finding talent and making player decisions.<br>  <br>  some 2008 stats to compare<br>  Sage:         6tds  10ints 1431 yrds   79.5 rate<br>  Garcia:     12tds   6ints   2712yrds   90.2 rate<br>  <br>  y u would pick the bad backup over the decent starter idk|`|e4ekb1amaa	It's a 4th round pick for a guy who's shown a lot of potential, and has a surprising amount of experience.... if Rosenfels were 26, it'd have cost them close to a 1st round pick!<br>  <br>  Although he's older, it's hardly a bad move. Rosenfels is a career backup looking for a chance to start. The Vikings have an inconsistent starter, and a 39 yr old backup, and they're in need of winning now - their super bowl window won't be open as long as people think. It makes sense to me. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd rather have rolled the dice with Garcia (he has a ton of experience with the offense the Vikes run), but I get the feeling he didn't want to compete to be a starter, which would have been a given because Jackson is somehow still the "QB of the future."<br>  <br>  So... their thinking is that if Rosenfels can be a starter, they'll have him for 4 good years. If they stuck with Gus, they'd have him for... maybe 1? Same would go with Garcia, and Leftwich fits in their offense like a square peg in a round hole - it wouldn't work. They clearly don't want to be stuck with T Jax, so they signed a guy who may end up being a pleasant surprise. Garcia would have made the most sense, but Rosenfels may have the most upside, and therefore may have made their best gamble.|`|PuxP6UzVaa	Tavaris Jackson has a 95.4 QB rating and he has thrown 9 TDS and only 2 INTS.  Sage Rosenfels is there for competition for the starting job and Gus Frerotte will be traded or released because he complained about not starting.<br>       Ray Childress probably doesn't like Jeff Garcia or Byron Leftwich.

IMYl9pvJaa	The guy you like would think your really dorky looking when your in a wheelchair and brain damaged! Either go a different way with the helmet or dont go at all|`|BqonQfreaa	First of all, stay off the sidewalks.  They are for pedestrians not bicycles.  Second you should always ride with traffic, with a helmet on.  Always wear a helmet since it is better to look dorky than be paralyzed or dead.|`|RCpkdx4haa	First, riding on the sidewalk is illegal. Second, if you value your brain staying inside your melon, you should wear a helmet. Plain, simple, easy|`|PSVhBTlgaa	A few minutes?<br>  <br>  For anyone interested, my views:<br>  <br>  I wish it was true that a helmet gave you a lot of protection! I really wish it was! but it isn't.<br>  <br>  Cycling is safe, careless motorists are dangerous. I wear a helmet because not wearing one would make drivers in my city think I'm irresponsible and they might panic. In another city maybe I wouldn't wear one. If you wear a helmet you are slightly easier to see but if you do not wear a helmet you may make other road users pay more attention to you as they realise that you are vulnerable. In a more serious accident a helmet is very, very, very little help but sometimes better than nothing. If you are run over by a car your liver, stomach, lungs, heart etc can be destroyed, you may well be d-e-a-d worm food, even if your head was totally protected. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you fall of your bike all by yourself you will automatically put out your hands and probably not bang your head. No-one likes a bump to the head but your brain has a very good casing called your skull. Ask a doctor. A bump will hurt less if you have a helmet.<br>  <br>  What should you do? Study hard and be good. Education is not dorky, it is cool. I think it will do more for you than the guy you like. And wear a helmet if at least 30% of the cyclists you see wear one.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Go buy yourself a snappy helmet that you'll be proud to wear. Sure don't want you looking dorky, but dorky is a big improvement over being paralyzed, brain dead, or just plain dead.<br>  <br>  BTW, sidewalks are usually more dangerous for riding than the street. Lots of obstacles, blind driveways, etc.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Eastern your advise is about as bright as a 4w light bulb....go away! <br>  Asker: be a dork! Is your head worth the price you paid for the helmet? If you want to be another statistic in the ER then go ahead....no one has a crystal ball that works and tells them what will happen in the near future not even eastern. You want to crack your skull on that pavement and have to learn how to walk or eat thru a straw ? That is up to you but I would rather look like a dork for a while than be one forever!|`|fS8joiTaaa	You will be fine not wearing a helmet. In some cities its a law and its never really enforced in those cities anyways. Second its not very likely for you to hit your head on anything. Ive been bmxing for a while now and i only wear helmets at skateparks for obvious reasons. When im riding around the street i dont wear a helmet and i dont have any breaks either.<br>  <br>  You should be fine just as long as your carefull just pay attention to cars and the road. <br>  <br>  If your really worried though just wear the helmet.|`|xJ9f7ekKaa	umm well it might be a law to wear a helmet. if your friend is wearing one, go for it, if they arent, just dont. probability is nothing will happen to you|`|QQ8p7e1Vaa	wear the damn helmet. Im a guy whos 16 and i think it would be cool to A. see a girl riding a bike and B taking care of her future by protecting her head...|`|fb6b13be35f7817303e37c725d73af37aa	Yes.  Helmets are only good for 1 hit.  I replaced mine on Sunday.

LdJFFvSVaa	You're right about the last two words<br>  <br>  Also, if you look at it the best ten players in the world most of them will be Spanish or Italian, what makes the EPL a better league is all round we've got better quality not just in the top 5 or 6 teams unlike Spain and Italy, and outside of the top 6 our players are predominantly English|`|SuqQJJMLaa	what you say makes sense,except the last two words|`|WxWiP3QJaa	Uh? The transfer market was allowed? ... when? The transfer market has always been allowed, going way, way back - far before the people that put together the premiership were even born. And furthermore, there is absolutely nothing (5+6 and whatever else people wanna bring in) that will stop it from happening.

CttL3LmBaa	I am a road rider and I disagree with the others that think SPD's are easy to use.  On my road bike I use SPD SL and I have SPD's on my hybrid.  I find the SL's much easier to use.  That said -- don't attempt to use SPD SL's on a MTB.  <br>  <br>  DO check into Crank Brothers Pedals.  Egg beaters or platforms with the Egg beater built in.  Stay cleaner of mud and the easiest of (SPD style cleat) clipless pedals to engage and disengage.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	Spd pedals were designed for off road use, they are easy to get out of, and easy to clip into, once you have practiced a bit. As for falling, you usually come right out. If you are worried, just keep the tension near the minimum|`|AA10837556	They are really a must have.  They maximize the effeteness of your leg  strength and keep your foot on the pedal even when it is wet and muddy. (which is the best)  They are simple to get out of with a twist of the foot.  You should practice before going riding by sitting in a doorway on your bike and just clip in and out.  Do this with both feet and try not to let one become the one you always set down when you come to a stop.  Sure there will be a time when you panic and try to pull your foot off with out unclipping,  but you will learn quickly and be so much happier for having them.

uWpwXn6paa	I am a Patriots fan I think the Panthers are mental for letting him go, but i am extremely  glad that the Patriots are thinking about taking him|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, I haven't heard anything specific, but its clear Julius Peppers wants out of Carolina...<br>  <br>  It would be awesome for the Patriots...but it depends on what the Patriots would have to give up to get him...The Patriots aren't gonna give up a first round pick for him, and as far as I know he is a restricted FA...<br>  <br>  They DO need to get younger on D, and they need LBs probably more than anything, since they just let go of Mike Vrabel...|`|e4ekb1amaa	Doubtful. Peppers was franchised by the Panthers, so therefore it'd cost the Pats 2 1st round draft picks to sign him, and not to mention a ridiculously huge contract. Now factor in that they're notoriously stingy with dealing their picks, and that they hate paying players large salaries, and don't like "me" first types of players....<br>  <br>  Isn't going to happen. Not sure where you heard this, but it's not happening this year. If he were just a free agent, I could see it, but there is no way they give up draft picks to get him.<br>  <br>  EDIT: IF they get rid of Cassel, and get those compensatory picks, then perhaps they would get Peppers, but with Brady's knee iffy, and the shear cost of getting Cassel, I can't see anyone paying the price for him and then the Pats turning around and getting rid of what they just got to aquire Peppers who has been inconsistent the past few years. It's simply not worth it, especially not for a conservative team like the Pats. Too many "ifs."|`|UfQhMDeeaa	I think that the Pats should try to trade for him. Since the Cassel-Vrabel trade to KC the Pats opened up over $19 million in cap space while obtaining the Chiefs second round pick (34th overall). That gives the Pats 3 second round picks, all of their late round picks, and plenty of cap room to make a run at Peppers. Additionally, Peppers' speed would benefit the Patriots' defense greatly. But, of course, it all depends on whether or not the Pats are interested (which I hear they might be) and if Peppers is willing to take less of a salary (since the Pats usually don't offer huge contracts).|`|vD3KlbTCaa	yo that would be crazy i hope they do, however im a giants fan and hope they get housmandadadadaddhsdlfjkhasldf or w/e his name is haha|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	you must have heard wrong|`|nlm9Yectaa	Its been a big time rumor and I think that's all we can take it for right now.  The only way it is possible is if the Patriots clear out Cassel<br>  <br>  As to what the other person said about Brady's knee being shaky, I don't see that stopping the Pats from trading Cassel.  I think just if you look at how the Patriots perform business, Cassel's stock will never be higher than it is right now.  The Patriots spent a 3rd round pick because they believe in O'Connel.  If they can get something good for Cassel, they will take it.  <br>  <br>  The best trade I heard about was a potential three way trade.  They haven't released the full info about the Vrabel deal, so I heard that the Patriots send Cassel and Vrabel to Kansas City for their first round pick at #3 and then the #3 pick goes to the Panthers for Julius Peppers who becomes a Patriots.  <br>  <br>  Its all speculation at this point though.  There's no official statements out there from anyone.|`|7IWCVln7aa	i think he is way to old for the NFL.

0BhcnLVbaa	TNA Knockouts because they can wrestle, even Christy Hemme is being pushed as a serious wrestler. WWE just employs most of their Divas for eye candy, regardless of whether they know how to wrestle. They just put up the same old matches every night and in ring work is horrible in some cases. For the women's division, TNA are getting it right and almost everyone on that roster can wrestle. They are also getting enough time, unlike their counterparts.|`|BglekVnQaa	I'm sorry, but is this the only question you know how to ask? This is your fourth time asking this question in less than a year not even a month, but anyway. TNa has the better wrestlers because their woemn actually are wrestlers.

Divas are just for show.|`|4775e6c0ebf9dd97db049b177420eb0aaa	I agree with what everybody else has said TNA Knockout because I feel the WWE ones are there just there for show, while the TNA Knockouts go out there and actually wrestle their hearts out. TNA ones are more believeable then WWE because they are probably having to sleep with the boss to get to the top and the ones who don't are fired probably or don't get the title shots they deserve. Great question.|`|BAurzDXtaa	The TNA Knockouts because they compete in more physical matches than the WWE Divas. The Knockouts are arguably the toughest female wrestlers alive today. They go out to the six-sided ring week in and week out and put on some great matches, granted that some of them could use a little work but a least they try a lot harder than the Divas.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	tna

c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	Depends upon the lid.  The construction of many horse riding helmets will vary.  A simple ￡30 Trolex will have better protection than some ￡200 lids.  (Some hand built show lids actually had the button on the top of the helmet kept in place via a nail which pointed down).<br>  <br>  Your main problem is going to be ventilation.  If you look at many cycle helmets, especially the ones at ￡50 +, you will see that a great deal of thought has been given to ventilation and sweat.  If you are just leisure riding, this is not an issue, but as soon as you start to heat up, the riding lid will suffer.  I know, since I used my riding lid when I started on cycles.<br>  <br>  Weight, as stated in other answers, is also an issue.  For horse riding, this extra weight can actually be an advantage, since you can steer your horse by simply looking where you are going.  The weight of your head is enough to alter your position and turn the horse.  Fine.  On a bike, if you carry extra weight, you have to move it with your legs.<br>  <br>  The helmet that you describe is fine for BMX.  I know the style.  The problem is that it is a very hot lid.  You can use it.  It will do the job.  But it will not be pleasant.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|VT1BSwFcaa	Ventilation will be the main problem, your head gets very hot when cycling and the sweat will run into your eyes which can be dangerous. Try it and if you are OK with it then fine.|`|ZDjmDuuyaa	Yeah definitely go for it man why not and your correct it would be safer.|`|6VFDoSrjaa	Yes, it's better to have some protection than none at all.|`|AA10837556	Sure you can use it. I am not sure of the weight of the helmet you are using, but keep in mind that your posture is completely different when riding a road bike. The weight of the helmet must be supported by your neck muscles. It may take some time to build up those muscles if you have not used them, but it also depends on what kind of riding you are doing. Bike helmets are light and designed to let airflow into your noggin to keep you cool. So if you are riding a bike for a long in a aerodynamic position you may have a issue, but if your just tooling around the local park them it should not be a issue.|`|A9MDoFooaa	yep - its heavier than a bike helmet and will not allow the air to flow in the same way but you're head will be just as protected - so long as its a modern one and not a peaked one with a bit of elastic under your chin ;-) although you describe one that could be used for endurance maybe (?) and not the type i was thinking of - the black skull cap type.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	A proper helmet is adviced. <br>  <br>  If you knock a riding hat hard enough, you shouldn't use it again.|`|2COaydcfaa	why not|`|FD8I4zthaa	The main problem will be the build up of sweat underneath the helmet. Bike helmets are much better ventilated.|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	Any helmet is better than no helmet, Nuff said.
KNTofuxMaa	Political Correctness is what is ruining this country. No matter what you do or say, there will be a certain contingent of people who will be offended.

After that the SEC asked networks not to use the name when it aired. <br>  <br>  Political correctness as a whole has gotten out of hand, but in terms of collegiate rivalries it doesn't really matter what the NCAA says, we as fans will continue to call it what it is.|`|e37b10dd9e41a3d4d901feab990b7e9daa	Once again the "moral" minority runs over the American Majority.

I'm sure you feel the same way I do that calling it the Red River Rivalry just cheapens the greatest rivalry in college football. Shootout is much more descriptive with the ferocity those two teams go at each other. They might as well just call it "that game those two teams play at the Texas State Fair every year."<br>  <br>  LOL!

Next thing you know they will stop keeping score as to not hurt the self-asteem of the loser.|`|AA12103453	Yeah that is getting bad. I figured this was just another anti-Native American Name thing and I would actually defend the NCAA. I know some don't think there is anything wrong with them using Native American names, but I think the tribe should have to approve(like the Seminoles) so I don't mind that rule. I mean everyone knows in Football a shootout is just a high scoring game, no one takes it as anything to do with war. As to the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party I'm not really surprised they made them change it. I didn't mind the name, but for the NCAA to be against underage drinking(and colleges are) they can't have things like that. They shouldn't allow liquor advertised at any events or on TV and they shouldn't have names like that as it would be somewhat advertising liquor. I think it's silly not to let them keep a name that has been around, but I can see a defense to it.

Every game day I wear a Stars shirt and about once a week I'll see someone around who is wearing one too. <br>  <br>  Hockey is becoming a more widely excepted sport here in Texas since the Stars came to Dallas. There have been numerous AHL and CHL teams to watch all over the state and there was even talk of moving the Pens to Houston back when that whole thing was going on. Also, a little piece of history for you, the Detroit Red Wings had their farm club in Fort Worth from '67-'73.<br>  <br>  Now you can find a reasonable amount of city and high school teams in the major cities and suburbs. The greatest evidence that I have see that hockey is taking hold here has got to be that there are high schools along the southern boarder that have ice hockey teams. Yeah I know, even I was shocked to hear that. Apparently there is a documentary out there by a Canadian guy, but I have no idea what it is called.|`|XuGFt3boaa	The Stars do have loyal fans in Texas, but some people that live in other states, also might be Stars fans.

It also adds animation, character and life to the car.|`|Cf7rZsyzaa	yep, i like both of them. but i would have to say my favorite paint scheme of 2009 is Jeff Burtons CAT car....that thing looks awesome.|`|58h70voyaa	YA, TONY WOULD NEVER PICK  ANYTHING BUT A GOOD PAINT SCHEME!

3rmVGqWsaa	Sometimes your opponent can make you mad. Happens to me all the time. They can be bitchy and rude. My advice is to stay in your own game. Don't let them upset you. <br>  <br>  Don't let the confidence thing get you down. It's not about winning.

This isn't the little engine that could. I would strongly recommend taking a lesson from a professional at a nearby club just to freshen you up. I would also recommend hitting with a member of your team before you play, which you probably already do anyway though. But the best advice I can give you, is to NOT BE NERVOUS. If you are nervous, you will tighten up. You won't swing through your strokes and you'll start pushing the ball over the net. You have to stay loose and just hit the ball like you normally do. I can tell you from experience. I have played in many tournaments, and have been nervous for very many of them. There is no quicker way to lose a tennis match than not swinging through the ball like you normally would.<br>  <br>  If you do all of this, you should be in decent shape. And trust me, not tightening up is a lot easier to say than to do. But just try your hardest to remain calm and swing through your strokes. Good luck.|`|dpL2hd8Kaa	simple as it gets.<br>  Just go out and have fun. <br>  dont get too serious its just a match.|`|jracq6Lraa	have a ball

Wood floors you would want softer wheels cuz u grip better. even that depends on the last time the floor has been resurfaced... if recently you would want harder wheels. also there is a big difference between inline skates and roller blades... roller blades have the brake on them and pretty much look to me like a cheap pair of hockey skates. inlines are for competitive racing. the boots alone would run a few hundred. they dont have as high of ankles like hockey boots do either. I use to compete when i was younger and we use to skate on 5 wheel plates... ive been out of the speed skating ring for quite sometime but i do believe they skate on 4 wheel plates with larger wheels now days.|`|NdcisRVMaa	inline skates (rollerblades) have a break. They are recreational skates. Hockey skates have to be better built because of the abuse they take. Inline speed skates are a completely different animal. Most are designed of carbon fiber and are heat moldable so they fit like a sock.  Inline speed skates can also be custom made. Competitive speed skates now have either 3 or 4 wheels depending on the boot size. Most people run 100 or 110mm wheels. Different wheel compounds for indoors and out. There are no brakes on these skates and they cost much more then the hockey and rollerblades. Check out www.nettracing.com to see what they look like.

And the scoring team wins the game.<br>  The Silver goal rule is to end the first half once a goal is scored at any time. And start the second half. <br>  This rules prevents the teams from attacking since they play more cautiously not to concede a goal.<br>  And players going one on one with the goalkeeper has it's own controversies.

If someone else in your class has the same number one of you will have to put a "slash" with black tape across your number plate. That way one of you will be number 10 and the other slash 10 for instance.

NKN7HwkYaa	No.<br>  The only reason there is so much money in sports, is because people put that much money into them. If people stopped going to games and buying merchandise, then you would see players salaries going down. Sports do so much for our economy, because when people go to games, they make it a night out. They go to a local restaurant, they buy things at local shops. Not too mention people that go out to bars just to watch some games. And no matter how bad tight money gets, people will always (and should always) shell out for a night out.<br>  I know sometimes its hard to hear about sports players salaries, but this is how I see it. Reducing players pay at this point, would be like turning the professional leagues into Wal-Mart or McDonalds. You know, the company is making billions and billions, while the workers are barely getting by. The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL are the only companies out there that put the bulk of the money into the hands of the people doing the real work, the players.

In local competitions just by the judges. If an athlete leaves the blocks too early then a false start is called and the race restarted. This is indicated by the starter firing a second shot. In the big competitions there is a time limit between the shot and you leaving the blocks (about 1/1000 of a second) and this is the fastest one can react - any sooner than that and you have jumped the gun. An athlete can cause 2 false starts in a race and is then disqualified.<br>  <br>  Finishing<br>  The athletes torso has to cross the line<br>  <br>  World Records<br>  There are rules about what counts, and one is that the wind should be less than a set amount to count and things like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are more rules than just wait for the gun then run very fast.|`|b20e75fcef005fb19be9a346d77a2fd3aa	run as fast as you can|`|c46a3306019576b6a3287e4193fcde3faa	Don't go out of lane and don't impede other runners.|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	stay in ur lane<br>  cnt take drugs<br>  no dopping|`|fPbjSNEHaa	It is pretty easy, you run in a straight line for 100 metres.<br>  The starter will give you three commands.<br>  Take your marks - get your feet in the blocks and crouch down in position<br>  Set - rise slightly into position ready to move and listen for the starting gun<br>  Fires gun - the race has started<br>  <br>  You must stay in your lane, veering from your lane could get you disqualified<br>  You must not go off before the gun goes, doing so twice you will be disqualified<br>  <br>  At the finish, your time is recorded once the torso (not the limb) crosses the line.

A79MHUNtaa	Michael Curry thought that with benching Hamilton the Detroit Pistons will have a balanced scoring attack. This means the starting five which was Stuckey, Iverson, Prince, Johnson, and Wallace before will balance the scoring with the bench helping along the way which had Hamilton.  <br>  Now Michael Curry decided to add Hamilton to the starting lineup because the previous starting lineup was not doing anything at all and lost 7 straight games. Now that the Pistons have won 4 straight games and against some tough teams, Curry decided to change the starting lineup once more and hopefully it will the final time he has to do this. Today, the current starting lineup is: Stuckey, Hamilton, Prince, McDyess, and Wallace. <br>  They seem to do a lot better know because when Iverson is going to be gone for at least two more weeks, these Pistons were playing for so long now, that they know what needs to be done.

SweUcu3Caa	I wouldn't recommend not filling in the pool.  The water is part of the engineering of any pool. Your in Montreal which means you get some good winter weather. The ground will tend to freeze and thaw just like here in New England. The type of ground that the pool is in and also water tables can come into factor. This is important because without water weight the pool can actually shift and move with the ground and at worse even come out of the ground. Sounds strange but I've seen it happen. Also the liner will shrink and dry up and start to crack. Even when you fill the pool you will always need to get a new liner if you ever reuse it. So in the long run it will be worse if you don't fill it up when you go to sell it.

4maLlESdaa	Most people in my area who do kayak fishing go with sit-on-tops, so given the choice of those 3, I'd go with the Mysto. For one, having a SOT will give you much better access to your gear. Also, the other two boats you list look more like they're designed for calm water. If you find yourself in surf or even just some wind chop, those boats will flood pretty quickly. A sprayskirt might help if you can get one, but then you'll have a harder time getting to your stuff.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people go with longer boats on the ocean (the Prowler series seems popular). If 10' is the longest you can go, it'll work, but you won't be able to go as fast or far and you might have a harder time in the wind.

It was established in 1918 in the Hempstead Plains of Long Island, New York, USA. The facilty was renamed Mitchel Field in honor of former New York City Mayor John Purroy Mitchel who was killed while training for the Air Service in Louisiana.<br>  <br>  Mitchel Field is now a complex located in East Garden City, New York and Uniondale, New York, and home to Cradle of Aviation Museum, Nassau Coliseum, Mitchel Athletic Complex, Nassau Community College and Hofstra University.<br>  [edit] Origins<br>  For almost 250 years the area occupied by Mitchel AFB has played an important role in United States history.<br>  <br>  During the Revolutionary war it was known as the Hempstead Plains and used as an Army enlistment center. In the War of 1812 and in the Mexican War it was a training center for Infantry units. During the Civil War, it was the location of Camp Winfield Scott. In 1898, in the Spanish-American War, Mitchel's site was known as Camp Black.[2]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] World War I<br>  During World War I Camp Mills was located at the site of Mitchel AFB, on the western part, with the United States Army Rainbow (42nd) Division and the Fighting 69th Regiment training there.[2]<br>  <br>  In 1917, Hazelhurt Field #2, was established just south of Hazelhurst Field to serve as an additional training and storage base. Curtiss JN-4 Jennies became a common sight over Long Island in 1917 and 1918. Hundreds of aviators were trained for war at these training fields, two of the largest in the United States. Numerous new wooden buildings and tents were erected on Roosevelt and Field #2 in 1918 in order to meet this rapid expansion. [3]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Between the Wars<br>  Mitchel Field continued to grow after World War I and between 1929 and 1932. An extensive building program was undertaken after the war to turn the temporary wartime facilities into a permanent Army post, with new barracks, warehouses, hangar space and administrative buildings. Much of this construction still exists today, being used for non-military purposes.<br>  <br>  In the 1920s and 1930s various Observation, Fighter and Bomber units were stationed at the airfield. It became a major aerodrome for both the Air Corps as well as various civilian activity. The 1920s was considered the golden age of Air Racing and on November 27, 1920, the Pulitzer Trophy Race was held at Mitchel Field. The race considted of four laps of a 29-mile course. Thirty-eight pilots entered and took off individually. The winner was Capt. Corliss Moseley, flying a Verville-Packard VCP-R racer, a cleaned-up version of the Army’s VCP-1 pursuit, at 156.54 mph.[4]<br>  <br>  In October 1923, Mitchel Field was the scene of the first airplane jumping contest in the nation. During the same year, two world's airplane speed records were established there. In 1924, the air mail service had its inception in experimental flights begun at the airfield. In September 1929, Lt. Gen. James H. Doolittle, then a Lieutenant, made the world's first blind flight.[5]<br>  <br>  In 1938, Mitchel was the starting point for the first nonstop transcontinental bomber flight, made by Army B-18 Bolos. Mitchel Field also served as a base from which the first demonstration of long-range aerial reconnaissance was made. In May 1939, three B-17s led by Lt. Curtis LeMay flew 750 miles out to sea and intercepted the Italian ocean liner SS Rex. This was a striking example of the range, mobility and accuracy of modern aviation at the time.[6][7]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] World War II<br>  In 1940 Mitchel Field was the location of the Air Defense Command, a command charged with the mission to develop the air defense for cities, vital industrial areas, continental bases, and military facilities in the United States (also known as the "Zone of the Interior"). Later, First Air Force, was given the responsibility for air defense planning and organization along the eastern seaboard Under its supervision an aircraft patrol system along the coast for observing shipping was placed into operation.[2] During 1943, Mitchel AAF became a staging area for B-24 Liberator and crews before being sent overseas.[8]<br>  <br>  Mitchel Field was a major source of supply in initial garrisoning and defense of North Atlantic air bases in Newfoundland, Greenland and Iceland. From the airfield the planning for the air defense of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was conducted. Antisubmarine patrol missions along the Atlantic coast were carried out in 1942 by the Army Air Force Antisubmarine Command aircraft based at Mitchel.[2]<br>  <br>  Under the direction of the First Air Force, Mitchel Army Airfield became a command and control base for both I Fighter and I Bomber Command. Tactical fighter groups and squadrons were formed at Mitchel to be trained at AAF Training Command bases (mostly in the east and southeast) before being deployed to the various overseas wartime theaters.

rseD4OG2aa	I would go crazy for a War Games DVD.

There is already a best of Hell in a Cell and recently they've been branching into WCW themed DVD's like the best of Starrcade. A War Games DVD would be fantastic. <br>  I can still remember the War Games matches from 1997 and 1998, when they had teams. It was a classic match type. If only WCW had had regular ideas that were that good.|`|qwdh7N6saa	yeah sure.|`|H3nbC71eaa	I wouldn't hesitate to buy that DVD. That would be a must have for a wrestling DVD collection.

cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Your first line is completely wrong,not all Indian fans have said this.They were only a few who said it.I am a Indian and I didn't say that Indian team will whitewash and I even predicted that India and New Zealand will win 1 match each in T20.I even predicted a 3-2 win for India in the ODI series,so it clearly means that in a way I said that its going to be tough.Just because of some Indians no need to put blame on each and every Indian fan here.Instead of "all" you could have used "some" and it would have sounded much better.|`|OYy82bAYaa	I'm an New Zealander and of course I'm gonna support the Black Caps from Australia... I started a rant similar to this a week or so ago and got crap for running SOME Indian fans down for their over zealous support tactic's....<br>  <br>  But any who I now know that not all Indian fans are like that, they're just cocky and they have every right to be look @ whats in their cabinets....<br>  <br>  Considering our weather back home mate it's a "who knows which way the Game goes". As far as a white wash, there's no chance of that our boys have being playing good lately and they did after all give the Aussie a go for their money...|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Over the past month we have read how the world champs are going to whitewash the kiwis in this tour. Maybe they will now realise that it takes more than hot air to win on the playing fields. India should bounce back. They may get up in the ODIs but the Kiwis will win or draw the test series. It's a strange thing how teams always underestimate the NZ cricket team.|`|GGuXJJeAaa	I think they are still in a dreamy land, it's hard for them to accept the fact ya know..|`|uuHrf7cGaa	OMG!!!! Yes I was in deep sleep when they played these 2 games. I am originally from India but I support all good teams. I was never ranting about the white wash nor have I claimed that India will is going to whitewash. 20/20 is a not game that any team can dominate. It is always a 50-50 chance. Being 20/20WC champs everyone expects them to win and it is not possible. Both the games as I understand were close games and there is nothing to brag about other than taking your rants against the Indian fans. The question itself ask for trouble and I am not going to question it. We have had plenty such incidents in this section and I am not going to get involved. <br>  <br>  But I will be able to watch the ODIs and test matches and we will see how well Indians play. I do not care who wins, but how they win or lose.|`|SvmRWwepaa	Not all Indians infact very few people told that india is going for a whitewash.. Yeah i knw that indians are World champs of T20 format.. Bt it doesn't meant that india will win every match... Australlians r world champ of ODI's bt indians beaten them like a *****... I'll say India is going to defeat NZ, bt i can't challenge. Let's wait and see whats going to be... I wana ask u a question.. Are u 4m newzealand? If yes then be ready for defeat..

He's been in the business for longer than any referee, right now. From refereeing the Hogan vs. Andre match at WrestleMania III and playing a part in the Montreal Screwjob, he's seen and done it all.<br>  <br>  BQ: I did notice that actually. When she returned at RAW's Homecoming she didn't hit anyone. Instead she was given a nice ol' Stone Cold Stunner. Also, when she returned during the Vince McMahon's 'illegitimate son' storyline, she didn't attack anyone.|`|H3nbC71eaa	My favorite referee was Tommy Young from his work in Jim Crockett Promotions back in the 80's with the NWA. He was just a great ref, he would give off great reactions while he was refereeing, making it seem like it was a tough match to referee by doing things like wiping his brow, shaking his head in disbelief when someone would kick out of a pin that seemed like the match could've been over. He basically added a lot to the matches. He would also jump into awkward positions to make sure he's looking at the shoulders while counting if the wrestlers were in a wierd position. For example he would jump out of the ring and make a count on the apron for the pin in the ring just because the shoulders were close to the ropes...great ref IMO.<br>  <br>  WQ: I didn't notice that until now that you mentioned it...lol.|`|cpSXA0udaa	Earl Hebner<br>  <br>  and yeah she hates her family|`|OHBvEYKHaa	Mike Chioda <br>  WQ:no|`|7ImGw976aa	Has to be Earl Hebner, he's been in it so long and he virtually was the ref for most major matches in the history of WWE. Plus he was entertaining because at times he even got involved in matches and wasn't afraid to say what he felt and put his middle finger up at a few wrestlers that have pissed him off in the middle of matches in the past.<br>  WQ- Yea but she's also been hit before by family members. I liked it when she was supposedly disabled and Vince was having a affair with Trish and that match where Vince was fighting Shane because Shane didn't like how Vince was having an affair, she got up and knee'd him in the nuts.|`|Tl76L4pkaa	My favourite referee is Charles Robinson just purley because of his sprint down to the ring during the Shawn Michaels v Ric Flair match at last years Wrestlemania because I thought it was beyond hilarious.<br>  <br>  Nah , I never really noticed that before.

im8xN545aa	I don't know about stupid but he's certainly doing a good job of making Ian Bell and Ravi Bopara look the better option and making one of them gets recall somewhere down the line.<br>  <br>  Shah's scores this series are 57, 14, 7, 21, and 33. I think he's averaging just over 26 for this series so far (overall it's 29.77, which in and of itself is a bit rubbish). I think the 50 he got in his first innings is what's keeping him in favour.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could, then, question whether or not he deserves to be dropped. Personally I think the answer to that is no, he deserves a long(er) run in the side to see if can improve. Despite being an experienced domestic player he isn't all that experienced at Test level yet and so doesn't have the understanding of the international Test game that other, more experienced, players have. <br>  <br>  He's only played 6 matches and this is only his third series. But it's the first time that he's been given a consistent run (his selection treatment in the past has been appalling) so should be afforded the opportunity to see what he can do over the course of a few series and not just a few matches (as has been the case in the past).<br>  <br>  He is a capable batsman and does have some good shots and knows how to play, he just needs to be a bit more responsible with his running and stroke play and gain that all important experience of playing Test cricket. Though I suppose you have to ponder the fact that if he can't make runs against a poor Windies side then what's to say that he will make any runs against better sides. <br>  <br>  He also needs to be more careful and protect his wicket better, after all he'll only get so many chances. He doesn't have age on his side like Bell and Bopara, he's 30 and not getting any younger. Bopara is 23, Bell is 26 and both have longer, international, careers ahead of them. Shah especially needs to be wary of the fact that Bopara has just scored a good hundred and will surely be in the mind of the selectors should a change need to be made.<br>  <br>  As for his cramp, well that's unfortunate, but it happens and when it does it isn't nice (it feels like someone is carving through your muscle with a hot knife). However perhaps Shah could benefit from some extra fitness conditioning as he is prone to cramp and has suffered from it for quite some time.|`|S0dLToYxaa	he still has not got the idea of how good an impression could be created with a responsible & stable performance in a debut test match.....<br>  <br>  he needs to be more responsible & careful as a batsman & also as a player....|`|ms0eYsD5aa	I agree with you owais shah is st0pid and not only him everyone in the england team except petersen and flintoff are what you say they are|`|n13rCdZtaa	He's just inexperienced at test level. I think he'll come good eventually.|`|xPaXWSLLaa	Meh heh eh heh heh?|`|lt8FZ6q1aa	He is a very good batsman on his day, all players have a patch where they are very unlucky and unfortunately for Shah his unlucky spell has come at a bad time. He will come out of it.|`|7z0DFGGoaa	nah he just plays 4 england haha poooooooooofs|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Without being too harsh on him, let's just say he sounds 1 stubby short of a six pack.
tfotPdeZaa	oh come on mate!!!!! Stop withthe conspircay theory already! Abramovich needed someone fast and Hiddink was the obvious choice. I have to go somewher now, but if id dint you would be assured that i would argue more with you<br>  Cheers<br>  <br>  edit: russian-english :)|`|3L6usp4haa	I know Ferguson had a stand in part when he was manager of Aberdeen,but that was down to the sudden loss of the great Jock Stein.<br>   Regarding Hiddink at Chelsea it makes sense,with what better tactician than a national coach to join a club that has England players and also the club he is at have still to play most of the others apart from Man Utd.<br>   good point
3rmVGqWsaa	That's so great you're thinking about playing tennis! I just started last summer for the first time and now my coach is saying that I might make varsity so if you take lessons you will improve very quickly.<br>  <br>  1) You will need court shoes, shorts with pockets (or a skirt with spandex shorts under it), regular tank tops are okay but tennis clothes are best (try tennis warehouse online), and a beginner racquet<br>  <br>  2) Tennis is an expensive sport compared to others. Good racquets start at around $80 or more. The clothes are expensive also.<br>  <br>  3) The price of lessons all depends on the teacher. If you are in high school, think about going out for the JV team. It's free and you make lots of friends. If you are younger you will probably have to take private lessons. I take lessons and they are $15 each and they last for almost two hours. That's a pretty good deal. <br>  <br>  4) Tennis is easy to pick up. You start with very basic shots and you won't have much power at first. The more you play, the stronger your arm will get and you will soon have lots of power.  And if you stick with it through high school it will look good on your college application.<br>  <br>  You can email me if you have any more questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|PZYOTy2Haa	Okay, please ignore the people telling you to get expensive gear straight off.. what if you don't like tennis?!<br>  <br>  You need a racket, obviously. You don't have to spend a fortune on one, mine cost ￡7.99 in the sale and I play school team and inter-club. And balls. Get a tube of something like slazenger, they're good and not too pricey.<br>  <br>  Trainers are obviously important, just get ones that don't slip too much. Then start off playing in trackies and a hoodie or something, if you become keen later on you can start purchasing proper tennis clothes from either tenniswarehouse.com or purelytennis.com<br>  <br>  Also, a membership to a sports club is good. If you are a junior (under 18), you can get this at a very reasonable price. Mine's only about ￡30 a year.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the pricey bit. About ￡20 each but well worth it. Ask someone at your local sports club to reccomend a good coach.<br>  <br>  I didn't find tennis at all hard to pick up, but I guess it depends on the sort of person you are, whether you are sportily inclined, have good hand-eye coordination, and most importantly, are willing to practice.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you enjoy it :)|`|gPqBBfsgaa	for #3 and #4<br>  <br>  3) free<br>  4)easy<br>  <br>  If you go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuzzyyellowballs.com</a><br>  <br>  You have to sign up but it's quick and FREE.<br>  <br>  1) a racket... ya.<br>  2)If you are just starting you don't need to spend to much, maybe $50-$100 I'm guessing? Just get an oversize racket until you catch on and then you can go for the ones that go for $150-$200 control rackets.

439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	If he starts winning majors and dominating the tour, the publicity will come.  That will probably be when Tiger is about 45 years old.|`|ry3f5dxHaa	i think its definitely possible....he definitely has the support and the popularity and the skills. he needs to start winning he does well all the time but needs take his game to the next level and start winning some tournaments|`|VM2b7gq8aa	Ya Kim is a good golfer|`|c819b9c0e601697d9b53e747cb45c707aa	All he has to do is W-I-N and everything else will follow.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	It won't matter how well AK does.  As long as Tiger is playing no one is going to get as much "face time" as him- unless Tiger completely falls off the face of the earth, The Golf Channel and other mediums will put his face in as many places as possible, regardless of how the others do.  That's why they always interview Tiger no matter if he wins or finishes t-45, or put his face on a magazine cover even if he isn't playing that week (like they did in Golf World).<br>  <br>  Blame it on marketing.  Nothing against TW, but the PGA Tour put all of their eggs in Tiger's basket, and it's come back to bite them.  They wanted to target the fair-weather fans, and they apparently thought TW was the only one that could do it.  That's totally inaccurate, however, given the different personalities that are playing.  There are so many on tour that could reach different personality niches, but they went completely ignored until Tiger got hurt.  The golf execs scrambled to get them out, albeit not outside the Golf Channel, and it's hurt their viewing numbers.  <br>  <br>  But now that Tiger's back, I guess everything will go back to the way it was, unless he misses a cut or just doesn't play.  Ratings will be up, but 150+ golfers will go unnoticed.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Keeps what up? Kim is a solid player and we will probably become one of Americas top player. But another Tiger Woods he certainly is not.  If he wins 60 PGA events and 14 majors, he will get the publicity, I promise.

I think The Undertaker can still go to at least the next Wrestlemania.|`|plFyCtm3aa	HBK... <br>  <br>  They are going to keep the Undertaker until he wants to retire... They're gonna do that same Wrestlemania bullshit... They'll say "O NO! THE UNDERTAKER LOST! HE HAS TO RETIRE!" but then in Wrestlemania he'll keep his perfect streak going and then he'll come back.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	No chance that VK's face could go 15 against Larry's jab.  The skin is too thin to avoid cuts.  If all else goes well for VK, he's still going to lose when he starts bleeding like a stuck pig at the abattoir. <br>  <br>  But all else won't go well.  VK is big and strong, and not so clumsy for a big guy.  However, Holmes wasn't small himself, and folks don't factor in Larry's huge advantage in speed.  Holmes will stay a step head of VK the whole fight, and his chin will see him through the rough patches that are inevitable when to big guys go at it.  Holmes, TKO on cuts before the 10th round is over.  He'll be up on the scorecards 7-3 at the time.  VK is not in Holmes' class as a fighter nor an athlete.  His only advantage is in physical strength.  Holmes knew how to deal with that.|`|AA10270018	Vitali Klitscho is very good by today standard. He is the best heavyweight in the world today but Larry Holmes is probably the 3rd or 4th best heavyweight of all time.

RCpkdx4haa	The bikes at retail stores are not bad bikes... They are very poorly built when they are shipped to the store. Also they offer next to zero warranty due to the poor build. A bike shop will typically give you a one year to lifetime maintenance package at no charge. You'll save in the long run, but it's gonna cost about $200-$300 at a bike shop. Go for it though, you'll be happy in the end.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	$300 + for hybrid at lbs(local bike shop.)<br>  <br>  Go to the box store. Try to find somebody that knows bikes to go with you. Ask the clerk when they'll have someone that can fix/adjust the bike after you've ridden it a few times. These bikes are usually assembled by a kid working the night shift. See how long you have to bring it back for a full refund.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, be patient and try on craigs. But remember, fit is very important so be careful there, and without an indepth knowledge of bicycles, how you gonna know what you're getting?|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Here are some hybrid bike prices.

HimBbU6caa	Ford. Simple as that. At that time the costs were starting to hit the ceiling. Ford pulled out and that was that. <br>  <br>  I agree the team did show some promise. Had F1's spending habits been under better control, had Ford been in a better financial state, had Adrian Newey signed on before deciding to stay at Mclaren....hindsight is always 20/20 I guess. I'm just excited about the new age of F1 we find ourselves in now. Even if the overtaking is not drastically improved, for me, just the prospect of having privateer teams competing at a decent level is enough to be happy about. People like to complain about Bernie and Max, but Max was screaming about high costs way back when the new millennium first came upon us. Too bad we had to lose Arrows, Jordan, and Minardi before it was all said and done.|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	1. Their engine was poor, not only down on power compared to other teams but also unreliable at times.<br>  <br>  2. They changed leadership almost more often than they changed drivers. Wolfgang Reitzle, Bobby Rahal, Niki Lauda, John Hogan. Four managers in 5 seasons isn't good in any business. Of course, just when they got the best man (Hogan) in, they cut the budget... <br>  <br>  3. The development of the car was never as fast or effective as it should have been. This was in great part due to the team using a wind-tunnel in California rather than one near the European base. (Take note, USF1.)<br>  <br>  4. Their open attempt to sign Adrian Newey ruined morale in 2001. The resignation of Rahal followed by the sacking of Lauda didn't improve matters.<br>  <br>  5. The drivers were generally not up to top F1 standard and/or not known to be great test drivers. <br>  Irvine: past his best and after the money<br>  Webber: not top-line material<br>  De La Rosa: a real number two driver<br>  Klien: a natural back-marker<br>  Herbert: not top-line material<br>  Pizzonia: a natural back-marker<br>  Wilson: never had the time in the car to make it work<br>  Burti: a natural back-marker|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	The other top teams have the best.

Hanley is a legit number 1 pick.<br>  Your starter is improved<br>  You lose the best closer in the game.<br>  I just don't see this working out for you as the season goes on. CC and Pujols are good, but not THAT good.|`|5VKBBsA0aa	As with any trade, to really know whether or not it is truly fair we most know who you have on the rest of your team. The biggest "red flag" I see is that you are given up K-Rod. He could easily get 40 or maybe even 50 saves. Do you have other closers that are going to get you plenty of saves? As for the other pitchers, CC Sabathia is certainly better one would think that Johan Santana, but CC plays in the more offensive league and it is hard to say how is first year in pinstripes will go.<br>  <br>  Pujols is obviously better than Huff, but Ramirez is far better than Jeter. All in all, I wouldn't except this trade!|`|1XbsUeJcaa	I dont believe its a fair trade because you are trading away 4 good players and arent getting enough in return.|`|gaOSUthbaa	Fantasy Section|`|36e6a3e057253549f1ab611a1b012536aa	yeah, its a pretty good trade|`|BDEVP4qpaa	its pretty even. he might have a very slight edge (2.6/5)|`|VM2b7gq8aa	its fair good for u|`|r67QP0mtaa	no hes getting 3 young aousome players and u get crap|`|JQXCdGHYaa	Do it|`|AA11720887	Not even close. You get some good players but you give up too much. Santana and Ramirez are the best fantasy players at their positions. Rodriquez is in the top four closers. Albert is better than Huff but you lose on 3 out of 4. Don't do it!|`|KXh6YPByaa	You are getting played. <br>  <br>  here's the breakdown.  Hanley for Albert is a swap.<br>                                   and CC for Santana is a swap.<br>  <br>  but you giving up K-Rod and Huff for Jeter is horrible.  Jeter gives you runs and BA and thats pretty much it.  Huff had an excellent yr last year, and he prolly won't perform as well this year, but he still is a better fantasy value than Jeter.  And K-Rod had 60+saves last season.  he won't get there again, but if the mets don't suck he should have at least 45+saves.  <br>  <br>  I would not do this deal.|`|zbQfEua9aa	Yeah, Pujols rocks so does Jeter and Sabathia and Hanley pretty much matches up Pujols Huff and Rodriguez make up Jeter and Santana is about Sabathia. It is fair|`|J9GWbyAvaa	NO.<br>  You give up 3 premier players.<br>  And your getting back 2.<br>  Leave Huff at 1B he will give you decent numbers.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	fair enough he is probably getting a little better deal..but its fair
bSsBGrZVaa	Petey Williams wrestled his last match in TNA on February 19<br>  edition of Impact! when he team with Eric Young to take on Beer Money Inc.<br>  for the TNA world tag team titles & he was pinned in the match & due<br>  to previous stipulation "Off the Wagon Challenge" he was banished<br>  from TNA & he was released from his TNA contract on February 10, 2009|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	he was released from his contract a week before the "off the wagon challenge" and it made it look like a storyline based cut wich it is|`|0BhcnLVbaa	He isn't on the roster anymore. =( Beer Money laid down a "Off The Wagon" challenge in which the wrestler who got pinned has to leave TNA. Petey and Eric Young challenged them and lost after James Storm pinned Petey with the Last Call. As a result, Petey had to leave TNA. In real life, it was due to the fact both parties couldn't agree to a new contract.|`|7ImGw976aa	In real life he was released from contract because he and TNA couldn't agree on the terms of contract in time. Couldn't see eye to eye.<br>  His character left TNA like a week later when he was in a tag team match against Beer Money, loser who got pinned left which ended up being him.<br>  I'll miss him : (  He was a talented wrestler.|`|plhLIIeAaa	Lost to Beer Money in a loser leaves TNA match. He got let go more than likely his contract was up. and they wouldn't resign him.|`|ETkqlgqwaa	He should go to WWE. His finisher is great.|`|smDClNDkaa	technaly he is, since his contract doesn't expire until the end of march.<br>  But he is no longer in TNA.  They couldn't come to terms on a new deal and he got pinned in the  off the wagon challenge to right him off TV.

And that match was between Delhi Giants and Ahemdabad Rockets. Luckily M. Mishra was batting. The cameraman showed his face's close up. That highlight was yesterday.

7Lfa3y8Raa	This man is an amateur fraud who lies poorly. Some of my students have increased their muscle mass greatly, increased strength and increased endurance, and they can tell you how to do it without charging fees. He says he's a black belt in Kung Fu San Soo, whatever that may be. I am Japanese, so I do not speak much Chinese. One of my students has studied Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Tibetian styles. He says that Wu Shu is the proper Chinese term for martial arts and that experts receive red and gold sashes, not black belts, in Chinese styles. Black belts are given in Japanese and Korean styles. This man does not even know that black belts are not given in Chinese styles or that Kung Fu can be applied to any field. Anyone who gives money to him is being swindled.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	It's a fraud.  Besides you can learn to do all that without paying for the information. It is just a well thought out and difficult training regimen.<br>  <br>  You only need skills light that if you plan on fighting in a ring. Real self-defense situations rarely ever last that long so that these become important. <br>  <br>  In any case save your money!|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	All he does is makes claims, that this happened and that happened.  He doesn't talk about who taught him San soo and where. He just says he was taught it.  <br>  <br>  Where's the evidence? We have to pay for it, apparently.|`|lpU2dnqsaa	Well I surely can't trust it with making those kinds of claims, but it looks like it MIGHT have some good tips, and twenty dollars isn't so bad. *shrugs*|`|LFWQiGYkaa	Of course it's a fraud. All of these things are.<br>  <br>  It offers guaranteed results through little work and with "secret techniques".<br>  <br>  There is no secret. The "secret" is to practise, practise and practise.
xqgE4CrBaa	She sounds very devoted and talented. Make sure you respect and love her as a child, not just a gymnast. Since she's very ahead on all of the events, why not take the time to improve the other aspects of her training experience? Such as, give her ballet, tap and jazz dance classes to help with her movement (dancers make good gymnasts and vise versa). Improve her strength training and endurance. And this is the most important thing of all: if she gets through her work early, keep doing it for a little longer. This will help as she will move up grades and when she gets older she will be able to just havee a couple of school hours. Good luck!|`|XZOgfxYJaa	Possibly. Its really really really really hard to get there though.  I mean these people are the best out of the entire billions of people in the U.S.  But, I mean shes five. She could be burntout on gymnastics by the time she is old enough. Although she is probably already old enough for China's team if you guys wanna try her over there!|`|wbHU9pOJaa	Everything is possible :P since she seems so talented so if she practice more and more then when she is older she can go to olympics.|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	if she works super duper hard like she is now there is a possibility <br>  she seems like she loves gymnastics and its her passion  <br>  thats really good for such a strong age <br>  good for her!!!!|`|wybl5IVCaa	Yeagh it does|`|J5CLZxBuaa	Anyone giving this attention is wasting time.  You can't even compete USAG level 4 (the lowest USAG competitive level) until you're 6 years old!  You have to be age 7 to compete level 5 so this question is full of misinformation and/or misleading information.  No way a 5 year old kindergartener is already competiting at that level.  This sort of story would be national news.|`|mAvL6lVOaa	Wow..she's 5? That's kind of a rough life for a 5 year old..but yeah it sounds like she'll go to the olympics. In gymnastics they're always young, and if you're national you can at least go to the olympic trials soo yeah.|`|sLfQ86agaa	she can if she works hard enough. but remember to only push her as hard as she wants to. if you push her to hard she may get sick of it and just quit all together.|`|03EWjCmsaa	O.o  if that's not devotion,  i don't know what is!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I think you are full of it, because there are age limits.  She can not be competing as a Junior at 5.  It isn ot possible.  <br>  <br>  That said, even if it was true-No, it does not sound like she will go to the Olympis.  It sounds as if by the time she is of Olympic age she will have burn out from all of the practicing.  Also, I am pretty sure there are educational requirements for Olympic contenders and while I am not against homeschooling (my children are homeschooled) there is NO WAY she is getting an adequate education in one hour a day-even though at that age most learning should take place through fun.<br>  <br>  If this is legitimate and not some sort of troll post, I think that you and your parents are doing your little sister a great disservice.  There are hundreds of little girls that work hard to make it to the Olympics.  Most never do.  Those that do have a little bit of fame and fortune, but later they need to resort to an education to have a real life and career.
xqgE4CrBaa	She sounds good! Try ballet twice or three times a week for this year. It will build her endurance and technique by a tenfold. After a year or two, add jazz or more ballet. You may want to reduce your ballet classes by a bit then. When it's time for kindergarten, she will have a wider variety of choices. I would also recommend a few days of ballet, and maybe some jazz, tap or modern. Good luck!
1uSoU8Lpaa	I didn't have to, I wanted to. Depends on where you're flying, and what you're flying.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...What?...Sorry, I don't swing that way...|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	Well to be honest I do that because I was tickled to much as a child.<br>  Tostado is not in the mood to fly today, mi páncreas está en mi cabeza|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Sure why not...
uPYgASpNaa	Yeah it was, my eyes wer glued to the tv!<br>  should be interesting tomoz to see if ireland will handle the pressure!<br>  they should win tho!<br>  england are diabolical these days|`|FPJSoxYwaa	One of the best games so far. I hope the next two matches are as good as this one.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Was a great game, both teams played really well!|`|InWWmGtlaa	GREAT GAME !|`|ToxDHYsaaa	im devestated, imirish so really wanted to see what happened however sisters birthday had to go for a "meal". Anyone know where i can find highlights?
BB6HGbnPaa	No it wont. If your obese, you will probably lose some weight and gain some muscle. If your skinny, it will make you eat more because of all the energy you lost while running and make you gain some muscle as well.|`|FN1CjtuQaa	I'll have to see. I just started lacrosse & We ran 2 miles yesterday. I'm not really fat. I'm average for a 15 year old girl & After i run i EAT a lot. I makes me hungry & Nothing really changes about my weight. I don't think it'll make you bulky though. You need a good diet with running if you want to be skinny.|`|B6qNBC4Daa	it will make you skinny as ****<br>  <br>  because you have to do 5 to 7 mile runs 2 or 3 times per week along with 1/2 mile and mile intervals for training. its impossible to keep weight on!|`|fPbjSNEHaa	2 miles isn't long, but running not make you bulky.<br>  <br>  It could make you skinny, provided your diet is adequate.|`|hZ9m6ekEaa	skinny|`|msANNIbxaa	It will make you skinny.
Vyz5YnZqaa	I would say the Steelers but Dallas is #1 because they have been to a record 8 Superbowls, won 5 (really fair and square) and have won more playoff games than any other team and they are the most recognizable team in sports, They are worth more than any other team and they have the largest stadium in North America thats worth over a Billion dollars. The steelers have the worst field in the league thats named after Ketchup.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Let me get this straight, the Pats got caught cheating and were fined by the league, and their SB wins aren't tainted. The Steelers last two SB were won on the field, but because some people here at YA think that the refs missed calls cost the Cards the game their SB wins are tainted. That makes no sense. On the Harrison TD and on Santonio Holmes winning catch and even the fumble (yes it was a fumble) at the end of the game why hasn't Whisenhunt or any of the Cardinal players complained about it? Not one word from the Arizona camp. So if their not complaining and they I'm sure have dissected the tapes of the game why are people here complaining? Use common sense. Don't you think someone on the team or coaching staff would have gone public with their complaint?  Super Bowl XL, don't even go there. Seattle wouldn't have won that game even if the Steele rs played their second team defense. Steroids were legal in the 70's, and even today now that they are banned does anyone really believe that players on all teams are using them? If you want to discuss football I'm all for it (that's why I visit this site) if you want to come on here and rant and rave and hurl insults around we don't need you here, go elsewhere.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Wow. You are one outspoken Steelers fan. First of all, Steelers aren't the best. Ok 2 Superbowls in 4 seasons. That doesn't make them an AMAZING franchise. A good franchise is determined by consistency, Superbowl wins, NFL Championship wins, and how much history is in the franchise. NOT JUST SUPERBOWL WINS. Get your facts straight.<br>  If you were a true football fan, you wouldn't be rubbing these lies in everyone's face. I could name 10 franchises better than the Steelers.<br>  <br>  The Steelers didn't deserve that SB over the Seahawks, and the Steelers didn't win Superbowl XLIII, the refs did.<br>  <br>  Respect other teams and their fans.|`|nDzenpkwaa	You're right the franchise of the Steelers has a much better history.  They have two Superbowls in this decade and always make a good run for the playoffs in a very tough division. <br>  This doesn't change how good the Pats are though.  Your emotions are getting in the way of rational thought.  The Patriots are crazy good and like I said before, the team to beat in the 09 - 10 season.  Your comments about the Patriots sucking are eerroneous and uncalled for.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	A bunch of former Steelers from their 70s championship teams have admitted using steroids, including Terry Bradshaw, and Pittsburgh's last 2 Super Bowls had some very questionable calls (or non-calls) by the refs. I sure as hell can't call that fair & square. <br>   <br>  The true best franchise is the New York Giants.|`|3oUSroiZaa	Patriots are still better.<br>  <br>  We beat you guys every year in the f*cking playoff.<br>  <br>  <br>  Steelers only win if Patriots are not in the playoff which was this year.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:Get off Ben R.d!ck you f*cking pussy.<br>  <br>  We when playoff games.<br>  <br>  Edit:You call us cheaters but at least our players don't use steriods!|`|5VKBBsA0aa	Overall, it would have to be the Steelers. In all reality, they are undoubtly one of the top three of all time. I know, however, that ESPN did some really in depth study like a year ago and they had the Cowboys as the best every. The study took into account SBs, Championships, Hall of Famers, etc. Pittsburgh would have to have moved up at least a bit not, however, with their sixth Super Bowl.<br>  <br>  I don't really think you can say the Patriots won all their Super Bowls by cheating. Unless I missed something, the whole cheating scandal came seven or eight years after the first Super Bowl victory. Nevertheless, teams do cheat all the time in one way or another.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	You give every football fan of any team a bad name<br>  <br>  Football fans have their own favorite team, you shouldn't be saying all kinds of garbage on any team.  Respect every team and all their fans.  People like you shouldn't be allowed to watch football if all your going to do is make fun of another team and rant on on how you THINK your team is better.  Go up, and respect everyone else.|`|AOA8TJraaa	not EVERY position lets see we own them in quarterback, wide receiver, offensive line, free safety, and kicker.<br>  <br>  WHAT!<br>  <br>  SEE NOT EVERY CATEGORY  <br>  <br>  and im not saying the steelers suck, they are better in some category's and they are the better FRANCHISE<br>  <br>  oh and very bad referee calls in the superbowls and u fag the superbowls in the 70's that steelers won, they cheated they used steroids including the quarterback.|`|yQWYe14gaa	There is no true debate here.<br>  It is simply a matter of recorded history.<br>  Champions of the entire world six times.<br>  The Pittsburgh Steelers are the greatest NFL football team on the planet.<br>  Period.<br>  We only use one measuring stick here folks.<br>  We don't care if your RB had more yards than anyone else that year.<br>  We don't care if one team has 536 wins to our 532.<br>  It doesn't matter how many times you won the division championship or how many hot dogs you sold at the last 5 games.<br>  <br>  Nobody cares.<br>  <br>  The Suberbowl.<br>  <br>  That's our measuring stick.<br>  <br>  Six time WORLD CHAMPIONS.<br>  <br>  Pittsburgh Steelers.<br>  <br>  Enough said...|`|KsoUiryAaa	Its obviously the Steelers but you saying that they own the Patriots in every category is wrong. Brady is a way better QB than Big Ben. The Pats offense is amazing!! <br>  <br>  But other than that, yeah the Steelers do have more players in the HOF and are known for the "Steel Curtain" defense.|`|AA10225723	Sorry, while I admire somewhat your passion for the Steelers, this is really getting old.<br>  <br>  Not a fan of either team. But I do think they BOTH have great football programs.|`|g2Xadc0gaa	Patriots do not cheat at all if u r i will slap you|`|GPNeydmgaa	Steeler fans are annoying.
439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	As of this moment, they are 2 1/2 games out of 8th, but, there are several teams between them and 8th place.<br>  <br>  They'll need some luck for sure.|`|NcXSsE9Vaa	very possible i think d'antioni needs to let that young talent just run now and let them beat the crap out of teams that cant run especially older teams i also think if he does this they have a chance of beating the celts first round b/c if u can outscore the celts or get them to play at your tempo they become hopeless so yes there is a chance|`|rZmiyAqJaa	I never understood when a fan ( although hey if your a fan, get excited about your team, go ahead!)  would even care if their team, whom obviously is not very good at all, 'slips' into a playoff spot. Who are they going to beat? Even if they pull off a miracle and beat a one seed, where are they going from there? Why get excited to watch your team get ground into mulch for 4 games by a team that has been substantially better all season? <br>  <br>   Especially in this case, if I was knick fan, unless they all of a sudden win 20 straight or something ridicuolous like that, I wouldn't get all excited about watching them get bitc*slapped out of the playoffs.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	its possible for the Wizards to make the Playoffs, but we both know that won't happen. The Bobcats are going to get the 8th seed. The Knicks NEED to win tonight against the Cats to have a shot, a loss would be devastating.<br>  <br>  But regardless, this conversation is irrelevant, since the Hawks are going to win the NBA championship anyway so.......|`|g8bjrbEbaa	yes i need somebody help please bucks and the dame net blow it the next 15 games then yes
OHBvEYKHaa	ECW -ECW Champion Jack Swagger, World Tag Team Champions The Miz & John Morrison def. Christian, Tommy Dreamer & Finlay (Six-Man Tag Team Match) <br>  Just one week after Jack Swagger triumphed over Christian in an intense match for the ECW Championship, “The All-American American” once again pinned Captain Charisma in the middle of the ring. After Finlay drove the interfering Miz from the squared-circle amidst a fast-paced array of turnbuckle turmoil by all six Superstars, Christian looked to have Morrison on the ropes. But, when he failed to see the blind tag between the legal Shaman of Sexy and the waiting Swagger, the smiling new face of ECW made him pay for it, hitting his unsuspecting foe with his gutwrench powerbomb for the victory.<br>  <br>  Natalya def. Alicia Fox <br>  Although Alicia Fox showed a valiant effort in only her second match on ECW, in the end she could not overcome Natalya, as one of the most technically-sound Divas in WWE made her submit with the dreaded family Sharpshooter. When Tyson Kidd attacked DJ Gabriel after the match, Fox’s dance partner answered back with a European uppercut that sent Kidd packing. Will Kidd choose to tango with Gabriel any further in the weeks to come?<br>  <br>  Mark Henry def. Santino Marella (Money in the Bank Qualifying Match) <br>  Despite Santino Marella’s humorous pre-match analysis that compared his own anatomy to that of Henry’s, the World’s Strongest Man was not amused. After playing with the outmatched Marella, Henry quieted his never-at-a-loss-for-words opponent with an absolutely brutal World’s Strongest Slam. The win gives Henry a coveted spot in the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania’s Money in the Bank Ladder Match (match preview). <br>  <br>  Kane def. Boogeyman <br>  In a monster match nearly as scary as Kane’s movie See No Evil - which makes its Sci Fi premiere this Saturday at 9/8 CT - the Big Red Machine returned to the Land of the Extreme to battle Boogeyman. As the frightening creature from the Bottomless Pit hurled himself off the top rope, tasting the very worms of victory in his mind’s eye, Kane suddenly caught him by the throat and delivered a massive chokeslam for a simply frightening victory.<br>  <br>  The convincing win came just one day after Kane captured a spot in the WrestleMania Money in the Bank Match. And if his display was any indication of what the WWE Universe will witness on The Grandest Stage of Them All, Kane's seven opponents could be in very big trouble. <br>  <br>  smackdown -WWE Champion Triple H def. Umaga (Non-title) (Disqualification) <br>  Although Randy Orton set the stipulation on Monday Night Raw that Triple H could not touch him without being provoked until their epic encounter at WrestleMania, that didn’t stop “Legacy” from coming after The Game this Friday. After The King of Kings had hurled Umaga over the top rope and onto the floor, Orton, Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes emerged from the crowd, stalking the ring like a pack of wolves. Once they moved in, the 13-time World Champion launched a fierce counter-offensive, trying to hold off Legacy both in and outside the ring. But his dangerous adversaries were unrelenting, finishing their target off with four vicious kicks to the head by Orton, leaving Triple H completely annihilated. <br>  <br>  25th Anniversary of WrestleMania World Heavyweight Championship Match Contract Signing <br>  Before SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could get the contract signing underway, World Heavyweight Champion Edge demanded to know the true definition of her relationship with Big Show. But, after a heated exchange of words between The Rated-R Superstar and The World’s Largest Athlete, it looked like their match would become official. That was until John Cena interrupted the gathering, laying waste to both Superstars. The former World Champion then whispered something into Guerrero’s ear that was not audible to the WWE Universe, but clearly shook the General Manager to her core. Later, a very upset Guerrero informed her husband that she was moving the contract signing to Monday Night Raw, leaving the WWE Universe with more questions than answers.<br>            <br>  Montel Vontavious Porter def. Matt Hardy (Money in the Bank Qualifying Match) <br>  Prior to his match, Matt Hardy proclaimed that even though his brother, Jeff, didn’t wish to face him, he would not be able to run from him. He vowed to qualify for the WrestleMania Money in the Bank Ladder Match, destroy the seven other Superstars and finally become a World Champion. But, much to his chagrin, his opponent MVP was instead able to further his new-found winning streak, countering Hardy’s Twist of Fate to score a victory over his long-time foe, solidifying his place at the WrestleMania table. However, Matt Hardy’s night would not end there.<br>  <br>  United States Champion Shelton Benjamin def.

bSsBGrZVaa	I know that many people does not like Cody Rhodes but<br>  i think that he is truly underrated i know that he is not<br>  as good as to be in main-event level but i think that he is<br>  improving since he has debuted in WWE he has improved<br>  alot he does not have good mic skills & ring charisma but<br>  i think he was wrestling ability & his gimmick is fine but<br>  i prefer him as face because i think he seems really worst<br>  as heel thats the reason people hate him i know he got talent<br>  but i think that WWE should concentrate on him & make him<br>  a mid-carder for now & i know he is a future main-eventer<br>  if WWE used him in right way i know many people thinks that<br>  he with WWE just because of Dusty Rhodes but if they look<br>  at people like Triple H who debuted in wwe as a jobber &<br>  become a main-eventer because he is married to Stephanie McMahon<br>  at least people like Rhodes,Orton & DiBiase are not using<br>  backstage politics like Triple H & Batista they are using their<br>  talent & legacy rules for me|`|UbUSth5haa	He has amazing in-ring ability, and I think a Prince of Pro Wrestling heel gimmick as well as a IC Title run could sky-rocket his career.<br>  His in ring charisma is amazing as wel.<br>  His mic skills could use some work<br>  I like his gimmick now, but a Prince of Pro Wrestling Gimmick would be interesting<br>  Heel|`|IzgJpVgBaa	good<br>  good<br>  room 4 improvement<br>  good<br>  heel he has attitude<br>  <br>  he is good lookking and i c a good future aswell|`|WQGvE60waa	Overall he should go to OVW.<br>  <br>  He needs mucle and talent.<br>  <br>  Maybe a few years would  help him develop better., that and I don't want to see him lolz|`|8utgHwgKaa	he looks like a Homo.|`|q0WOUFoRaa	He is a skinny piece of crap who is overrated.

LhDL1RRhaa	Best Jeff Tribute Ive Seen|`|w2nMrQzwaa	not bad, i've seen better, but seen worse.<br>  <br>  It was overall quite good, but there were 2 parts that ruined it a bit for me. One was when you kept showing that whisper in the wind on Randy Orton with different effects, and it was a really weak ending, Jeff doing a twist of Fate to Carlito, you should have ended with something more dramatic and memorable. There are good points, most of the clips you showed were good, most of his great moments were included. I liked it when you showed a picture of him when he was a  young superstar, to when he was WWE champion.<br>  <br>  Good video for your first tribute, i'll give it 7/10|`|PniPsDmGaa	wow you are good!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I gave your tribute 5 stars|`|rH3ylNuYaa	I was hoping for jeff jarret|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	dude that was actaually really good i gave it 5 stars and nice song chice!!!!
XLXncQu9aa	You do realize that the next season hasn't even started yet right?  You said it, its always hard to guess before the season.  In my mind, it could be anyone.  The NFL is so unpredictable.  We saw it this season.  Peyton Manning was awarded the MVP when it should have been someone else like Adrian Peterson.  Manning didn't even win in the first round of the playoffs.  With that being said, I haven't a clue as to who it could be.  It may be the usual suspects like a Peyton Manning or Adrian Peterson, or it could be Matt Ryan.  Truth is there are too many variable to say for sure.  Injuries plays a part in it being so hard to tell.  More over any player can step up at any time.  But if I had to guess I'd say Adrian Peterson just because he's so spectacular and he is going to be great in his career, as long as he stays healthy.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Brandon Jacobs as he will rush for 1634 yards (5.2 ypc) and 19 touchdowns.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	matty ice<br>  i thought he was gonna be mvp this season<br>  im so glad my falcons picked him up!<br>  Falcons - 2009 nfc south champs!<br>  it will not be brady bc hes gonna come back after a season with no skills<br>  hes not gonna be mvp!|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Tom Brady!<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember:<br>  Tom Brady<br>  and <br>  Randy Moss <br>  for<br>  2012!|`|VM2b7gq8aa	NOT Tom Brady his carrer is over he will never be good again. He is horrible but to tell u the truth Larry Fizgald mite have a blow out year but i c Albert Haysworth gets it|`|3oUSroiZaa	Brady or maybe Wes Welker.|`|KsoUiryAaa	Absolutely Matt Ryan. I hate the Falcons being a Panthers fan, but I have the up most respect for this kid. He knows how to manage his team and command respect from then at the same time. he is accurate and turned that team around in a year, something that the coaches didnt even expect.|`|bJikRuXyaa	I would say adrian Peterson if he can produce the same numbers or better than he did last year and not fumble the ball.  This all depends on how well the Vikings do.  Also if Drew Brees or someone breaks passing records and their team wins a lot they will be in.  If the Saints made the playoffs last year Drew Brees was  a lock.|`|51TGO37kaa	I say drew brees if the saints take T.O he will dominate he is a top notch QB.|`|j3iP5iwHaa	CARSON PALMER BABY!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WHO DEY
BB6HGbnPaa	Basically anywhere at your local sport store will have track shoes. Make sure not to get the long distance spike shoes because they are totally different from your short distance spike shoes. I recommend getting Nike for sprinters.|`|YWeCIru5aa	You could go to Big 5, for some track shoes. (My sister just got some two days ago)<br>  <br>  The only problem about Big 5, was they only had two track shoes for girls, and the rest of them were for guys. So if you go to Big 5, I don't think you will have a lot of choices.<br>  <br>  Good Luck (:|`|lpvCxamvaa	You can get track shoes at basically any sports store. But I would recommend Academy for nice shoes.|`|dKwLXjYiaa	Big 5, sports authority, etc. ask an employee which type of shoe is right for your event, my friends have spikes for track but it depends on ur event
lhJvrjIzaa	JBL IS BOOBY|`|7ImGw976aa	He doesn't wrestle good anymore, used to like when he was in the APA but not now. His character his horrible and just seems to find new ways to sink to a new low.

2zfixYIBaa	Not if he keeps buying pot from Ezekiel.|`|lhJvrjIzaa	he could be in the 20-Man Battle royal to determine the final competitor for the MITB|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I don't think he will. He's been having some backstage problems, not listening to management so that could possibly keep him from being part of WM.|`|tkhlRVn4aa	I hope knot.He was amazing when he was with Paul London and now he is a jerk
uuHrf7cGaa	Bottom line - $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ in BCCI coffers - add to it the power they want - they have been dictating ICC and even times bullying around the issues. If BCCI was really for Cricket - in the first place why would they want to stop ICL from being created and that with their legend Kapil Dev in the lead. It is a mockery on the system that a dictate claiming that they are for promoting cricket. Do not consider ICL to be angels either - even they are there for $$$$$ too. Share the $$$$$ is not the game that these two entities want to. It has nothing to do with the game and they are bullying and show off their super powers in Cricketing world. <br>  <br>  It is shame on all such entities. Look what happened to ECB and WICB - as soon as Stanford was listed as fraud every one wants to distance from the crime - even though God only knows how much the games were played in true spirit or were in match fixing. I do believe even today there are plenty of matches that match fixing happens but it is hard to catch because the involvement of very high authorities who cannot be budged. It is the mafia that controls.<br>  <br>  These things are worse than apartheid as they using the fun loving sport in their own hands.|`|N9pKHpngaa	bcci are far too precious<br>  may be if there cricketers were world champs people would respect them but they just make themselves look like *****|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I have said many times here, that BCCI has too much influence over ICC & they are being very childish over Sachin playing in that match yesterday. Anyone would think as you said that ICL members have a communicable disease.Unless BCCi's grip is loosened from ICC's throat I fear for world cricket.|`|AA11088802	ICL is like headache for BCCI .. dont know y.. hope that this conflict will resolve soon
af0e18b2914aee7567d052b96f745b4baa	No...I really doubt that...even though he was a good wrestler, the circumstances of his death and him killing his family overshadow all that he had achieved in his career. As you can see, they havent even mentioned him since the memorial they had for him and I think its goin to remain like that.|`|owfDKuBXaa	well if the wwe put aside his actions against his family nd killin himself then probably but if they dont the chances r really slim|`|IyLnCrpOaa	After what he did to his family & himself, probably not.|`|hVukeVzpaa	Personally, i dont think so.  he was great, but knowing WWE and what he did, i would have to say no.|`|NicFRhhwaa	Hell No!|`|dZ3X26EOaa	i hope so because even thought he killed his family he was a great wrestler and one of my fav and he deserves to be in the hall of fame|`|lr68XuMFaa	maybe 10 to 15 years from now. Even through Benoit killed his wife and son and himself, his achievements in the ring should be honored|`|7ImGw976aa	Sadly I don't think he will because of the incident. It's a shame in a way because him as a wrestler was great and most likely does deserve a place in the HOF, even though there's tons of people that don't agree that he should.|`|6gZynUKzaa	i dont think chris benoit will be in the hall of fame because he murdered his family and he doesnt deserve the invite to the hall of fame|`|AA10561904	maybe, just maybe, they will put him in the HoF unofficially, u know like not annoucing him or something and have chavo(i guess) induct. short ceremony for him, perhaps|`|qwdh7N6saa	I don't thing so. but it would nice if he do be in the hall of fame.
PsWWkwrraa	There's actually been several Wrestlemania plans leaked over the web and Vince has been irate over it. It was said that Big Show saying that on VH1 could have just been something Vince put together to stir things up. Then again, there is the contract signing on Raw so I really don't know to be honest. In my opinion though, I think it should just be Big Show vs Edge for the title. Alot of people, including myself, are getting tired of Cena (as well as the same few people) being the main title runs...|`|wcgkX4lVaa	Yeah I saw that. He probably thought no one was going to see that. Or maybe he just wasn't thinking when he spoiled it, but it was pretty obvious this was going to happen anyways.|`|VENyKvgaaa	o kool|`|qwdh7N6saa	it will be Edge vs Cena vs Big show at WM25.|`|aYnduRsxaa	Yeah lol I saw that too. I think Big Show made a little oopsy, even though we all saw it coming.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	I figured that would happen since vickie said we are having a contract sighning on raw

By doing this you make the racket a little shorter but that makes a huge difference. It makes for a more stable contact because you have more control of the racket by spreading your fingers, less framing, bad contact etc.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	Well you need to hold your racket in the middle and try to shadow every ball. Step in the the volley, don't swing too much|`|TKQZUhPBaa	u want a firm but not to rigid on the racket, also keep the volley compact, not a massive windup, this gives you more time and a better contact point. always make sure the knees are bent slightly and wath your contact point, you want to be hitting it out in front of your body to help control the direction of the ball|`|3rmVGqWsaa	haha. low and hard. we had a joke about that last tennis season.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you are doing a beginner volley where it's like you are giving the ball a high five with your racquet in front of your face or if you do the more advanced volley like the guy in the video. Here it is and I hope it helps you!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7JNrI8IDMY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7JNrI8ID...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|IETH9UEVaa	this is what i taught my team when i'm coaching. stand in ready position using the contential grip (easiest one to use to volley). when it goes to your forehand side, you step into the shot with ur opposite leg (ex. step in with left leg if right hand forehand volley) and vis versa with the back hand. keep ur knees bent cuz thats what keeping you balanced. also keep ur wrist firm or else ur racket will get all flimsy.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well u can hit a big serve and then follow up on it<br>  or u can hit sharply to somebodies back and then step into the backhand side of your court to hit a volley..<br>  <br>  or u can bring someone to the net drop shot them then run up with them to hit the volley...|`|cBjQozuQaa	Its a punch dood. That's all it is. The only way to get better is 2 practice it. And I know it sucks 2 practice something u suck at but it will come with time.
HGAsVI77aa	The organization as you can see already is breaking away from Jason Werth and i am most certain Jason knows that as well. If Jason Werth was a contributer like a Brad Hawpe or a michael Cuddyer, then he would most likely stay but he is just not worth keeping in the Phillies roster who just won the world series. The phillies need to start grabbing younger and more potentially good players like what they have in John Mayberry. Honestly they will prbably trade him either next week or the deadline.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Its possible Werth could be moved, they're trying to get younger.|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	C'mon, you think they are going to bench a guy who they just signed to a two year $10 million dollar contract six weeks ago in favor of an unproven minor leaguer on a team fresh from a World Series win?<br>  <br>  BTW- Mayberry Jr. came over from Texas ... you're thinking of his father.|`|AA11458254	Definitely Not!<br>  I follow the Phillies constantly, and looking at what Werth did last year at the end of the season I don't expect him to even share time with Jenkins.  Jenkins is average and sometimes can hit, but Werth can constantly hit for power and has good speed.  Mayberry is having a good spring, but if you think about it he isn't always facing the best pitchers in the game, because Spring Training is where teams try to look for young talent mostly.  Don't look for Mayberry to play much except to give Ibanez some rest every now and then, because I mean he is like 41.|`|e0M5lpc2aa	Mayberry will be a bench rider. Frankly I think Jenkins and Werth will share time in RF again. If Werth continues to be hurt, then Mayberry will play more, but Werth proved himself to be a legitimate player last year, and for Philadelphia to give up on him now would be foolish. Mayberry will be a great guy to have to PH and give anyone in the OF a day off. Look for him though, with injuries, you never know.|`|AA11720887	Mayberry won't take the job away from Werth. If Werth stays healthy, he has the job for a few years. Not than many players that can give you more than 20 HR's and 20 SB's in a little more than 400 AB's.

kzYdVfifaa	Game play in American football consists of a series of downs, individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is dead or not in play. These can be plays from scrimmage—passes, runs, punts, or field goal attempts—or free kicks such as kickoffs. Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have no more than 11 players on the field, and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.<br>  <br>  The object of the game is to score points by advancing the ball to the opponent's end zone for a six-point touchdown, by kicking the ball through the goal posts for a three-point field goal, or by tackling an opposing ball carrier in their own end zone for a two-point safety. After scoring a touchdown a team may attempt a one-point "extra point," a close-range field-goal-type kick, or a "two-point conversion" in which the ball is advanced into the end zone on a single play instead of a kicked extra-point attempt. The team with the most points when time has expired wins<br>  <br>  A player carrying the ball (the runner) is downed when any of the following occurs:<br>  <br>  Any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touches the ground. This may be as a result of: <br>  Contact by an opponent (called down by contact) where the opponent tackles the runner by pushing him, grasping him and pulling him to the ground, sliding into his legs, or touching him in any manner prior to any part of the runner other than his hands or feet touching the ground. Unlike the use of the word tackle in other sports, if the opposing player fails to down the ballcarrier, it is merely an attempted tackle. <br>  Accidentally touching the ground, such as by slipping or falling without having been touched by an opponent. However, in professional football, the runner is not considered down in this situation, but may rise and continue to run until he is down by contact, as defined above. <br>  Intentionally downing the ball: intentionally kneeling, verbally declaring "I'm down" (except in college), or similar actions. For example, to protect himself from violent hits by opponents attempting to tackle him, the quarterback may choose to slide to the ground feet-first. This slide is interpreted as intentionally downing the ball, and opponents may then be penalized for hitting him. <br>  The runner goes out of bounds: that is, any part of his body (including his hands or feet) touches the ground, or anything other than another player or an official, on or past a sideline or an endline. Note that the sideline itself is out of bounds, so that the runner is deemed out of bounds if he steps on or touches any part of it. Note also that a runner may carry the ball in such a manner that it is over the sideline, so long as the ball or runner does not touch anything out of bounds. <br>  The runner's forward progress toward the opponents' goal line is stopped by contact with an opponent, with little chance to be resumed. The exact moment at which the player's forward progress stops is subject to the judgment of the officials. In particular, for the protection of the quarterback, he is considered down as soon as an official judges that he is in the grasp of an opponent behind the line of scrimmage, and the tackling defensive player(s) will be awarded with a sack. If he is driven backward by the opponent, the ball will be spotted where his forward progress was stopped.<br>  <br>  A scrimmage down begins with a snap, where the center throws or hands the ball backward to one of the backs, usually the quarterback. The down ends when the ball becomes dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot becomes the line of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an incomplete forward pass, the ball is returned to the spot where it was snapped to begin the previous play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.<br>  <br>  A field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked, drop kicked, or free kicked after a fair catch or awarded fair catch (High School or NFL only) between the goal posts behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over. If a field goal is missed, the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage (in the NFL, to the spot of the kick; in high school, to the 20-yard line if the ball enters the end zone, or otherwise where the ball becomes dead after the kick) or to the 20-yard|`|5VKBBsA0aa	My advice, Nick, would be to just try to watch your friends when you can and you'll pick it up pretty easily. Chances are you aren't going to play "real" football anyway. In general, there is a thrower (QB), a few catchers (Receivers), and sometimes Blockers and Sometimes Runners (RBs). At the start of a play, everyone is lined up in a side by side formation with the receivers spread out to the sides. When the QB snaps the ball, the receivers run down field trying to get open. The QB throws the ball and if the WR catches it he'll try to continue to run down field with the ball without getting tackled.<br>  <br>  The defense tries to "guard" the receivers and sack (tackle) the QB. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KsoUiryAaa	My simplest answer for a person that does not know how to play football would to play the Wide Receiver position. All you have to do, if your going to play football, is wait for the QB to say hike (the work that gets the play going) and you run your "route" or for street ball, just try to get open. Try to run as fast as you can and as far away from the person that is covering you. That would be the best position that I would recommend for offense. For defense see if you can try to play a safety position. You stand back from everyone who is covering there own man. Just look to see who needs help covering someone when their QB says hike. You can also try to "read the QB's eyes" watch where he is looking to see where he is going to throw the ball so that you can beat him to the pass. Try to cover any open man and maybe if you pick the right person you will get an interception. I just hope you can tackle.<br>  <br>  Of course these are just some VERY VERY simple rules just trying to help out.
5x5Bpq2Saa	Well since these guns are probably not going to be over 300 FPS, goggles should be ok.  Make sure they are made specifically for high impact.  Most airsoft events will either highly suggest, or require full face protection.  Meaning a complete mask, but anything that has a complete seal around your eyes will be fine.  I advise you not to wear shooting glasses.  Its to easy for the BBs to slip under, or above the glasses.|`|PwnRqFP3aa	i wouldnt use a ski mask, some guns have the fps to shatter them, id get a true mask, you might need fingerless gloves for extra grip, but thats about it|`|268Rwp6zaa	What kind of goggles? Make sure that they are rated for airsoft/paintball. And ski masks can't shatter....but they will help protect your face. It may just be better to get a full-faced mask.

Either get more speed or else crouch as you're approaching the jump and then push down off of it as you're going up it.  Just be careful not to jump too high or throw yourself off balance.|`|CidxR8ONaa	well, I snowboard and i ride a nonpark board, but it rips in the park anyway.

fPyRsRcXaa	crouch touch pause isn't an ELV, and I have no problem with that law anyway.<br>  <br>  Most of the ELV's have had little effect on the game, but I like the free kick rule (as opposed to long arm penalties) which is being trialled in S14 for this and last season. Speeds up the game a bit. <br>  <br>  I also like the ELV which stops teams passing back into their 22 then kicking out on the full, this has meant that kicks have stayed in play and we are seeing more counter attack opportunities.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	Pulling down the maul is stupid. I've heard that the reason for this is to stop teams from easily rumbling over the tryline. If that's the case, then just legalize pulling the maul down within 5 meters of the tryline.<br>  <br>  Rucking with the feet needs to come back. Blocking is very bad and is basically an obstruction.|`|HWmjIOaBaa	I know its not ELV's but...<br>  Bring back Rucking!!!<br>  <br>  Last season when they trialled the 3 count scrum engagement, it was much more successful than the four count one from this year that continually gets reset.|`|Xu0XoB4jaa	hell, watch a game mate. Sh#t load of kicking nowadays huh - i thought the idea was that they would run it more......question is. Are the elvs turning ruggers into aussie football? which by the way bores the hell out of me.....
jSkHquK5aa	Soccer tryout season arrives soon for many players and coaches. Glee and heartbreak will once again prevail, perhaps in equal parts, as coaches and players struggle to organize competitive youth soccer teams.<br>  <br>  Because of the growth of the sport in teams and players, the great majority of coaches who will be selecting youth teams never played soccer in their youth, never took part in a soccer tryout, and don't have enough experience in team management to recognize many common tryout perils. Similarly, most players and parents are driven to tryouts by misguided motivations that arise partly because of the lack of a long cultural history in the sport. <br>  <br>  These players and parents look to their youth experience with other sports and subconsciously use the behavior of coaches, players in these sports as a model.<br>  <br>  Despite their best efforts, coaches will make tryout mistakes that will handicap their newly assembled teams for months or years to come. Similarly, many players and parents will fall into tryout traps that will provide at least a year of regret and, in some cases, lasting difficulty in the game. <br>  <br>  We explore here some common myths about tryouts, and then look at fourteen ways to fail as a coach at tryouts, and how to learn from these failures. We conclude with a practical plan for clearing out problem players before tryouts begin. <br>  Tryout Facts and Fiction <br>  <br>  There are many common beliefs about tryouts that are simply wrong.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The purpose of tryouts is to find the most competitive players.<br>  <br>  Fact: A series of successful tryouts actually sort out the players and<br>  teams so that players are lined up with teams with other players of similar<br>  skills, similar competitiveness, and a similar commitment to training.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches can easily recognize all the best players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Many youth coaches do not have sufficient experience to reliably distinguish between players with slightly varying ability levels. Many do not quickly recognize promising project players, or overlook gifted players who have crucial abilities to read the game or make clever attacking passes. It is too easy to overlook such players in favor of larger and faster players, or players who use the ball a great deal.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fact: An assortment of the best and not-so-best players are selected.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Many players got their position through politics.<br>  <br>  Fact: A few players get their position through politics. The coach's daughter, the board member's son, these are common. In some cases average players make a better team because they provide transportation for the star player who has no ride to practice and matches. It happens.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Good teams don't have vacancies.<br>  <br>  Fact: Healthy teams change a few players each year. Job relocations, injury, and commitments to other sports take a few players away every year, even from the best teams.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Coaches will always want the star players.<br>  <br>  Fact: Some star players have nightmare parents who are never happy and who annoy and disturb most of the other team parents. Better coaches avoid these "stars" for the sake of protecting team chemistry.<br>  <br>  Fiction: Players who aren't on the best teams by U14 will never make it.<br>  <br>  Fact: U16 is more like it. Many U14 stars disappear by U18. Some who depended on athleticism are passed by those who develop skill and tactical speed. Others fall to injury, bad home situations, and interest in other activities.<br>  <br>  Fiction: There is nothing that a player can do to improve at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fact: There are many effective steps to follow in preparing for a tryout. See How to win friends and influence coaches at ODP tryouts. All other things equal, better skilled and more athletic players do better at tryouts.<br>  <br>  Fiction: The best players should try out for the best team.<br>  <br>  Fact: Below U17, it is more important to get excellent training than to be on the best team. Parents and players should seek out the very finest trainers available, even if the trainers don't yet have killer teams. Many early "killer teams" are built by enthusiastic parent coaches with limited training ability but great organizational and recruiting ability. These teams fade away during the high school years, overshadowed by teams that gained their playing ability through extensive training and player development.|`|aJZVwEAsaa	Run Alot.|`|K4xzopIJaa	Not sure of your age, but you will want to increase your quickness and endurance.  Also, with regards to ball handling, your first touch must be absolute.  Mishandling the first touch, means the opponents have a better chance of winning the ball.<br>  <br>  I also pay attention to my players juggling skills.  Reason being, is, if you can't juggle then you can't play/control/receive a bouncing ball.|`|CT2I5W78aa	well to get inn shape you'll want to run a mile everyday at least. work on soccer drills like dribbling, passing, and shooting. those are the basics.....i run track so i run 10 laps around the track everyday so i can build up my stamina.....i also go out to my dads soccer complex and work on my penalty kicks and my free kicks. i hope i helped and good luck this spring<br>  <br>  p.s i have a question on my profile that might interest you on soccer!<br>  THANK YOU

7ImGw976aa	I think it was JBL and Ron Simmons, when in the APA JBL was known as just Bradshaw and Ron Simmons was Faarooq.<br>  They were also known as The Acolytes- APA was a later name standing for Acolytes Protection Agency. They were also in the Undertaker's Ministry and mostly worked as a tag team then. Quite good team and dominated often, fought people like Hardyz and Edge and Christian.<br>  They drifted apart but got back together when they were on split shows in 2002 but were then put on the same show again. They lost a match and Simmons got fired and JBL opted to stay, Simmons left in disgust of JBL. JBL mostly broke up the team in a way when he wanted to be more solo and has gotten to be more of a disrespectful character ever since.|`|qwdh7N6saa	JBL and Farooq|`|Tl76L4pkaa	JBL and Ron Simmons|`|H3nbC71eaa	JBL who was known at the time as Bradshaw, and Ron Simmons who was known as Farooq.|`|0P40aUA0aa	JBL And Farooq A.K.A.

Eventually it was ruled that the Test was valid and all performances counted towards career records."|`|aN4SUKkRaa	If it didn't, hardly any player would have the stats they have now. <br>  "Abandoned" means due to rain, crowd control issues, pitch unsuitability and bad light as well as a team forfeiting.|`|mber3JoAaa	Yes, as soon as the coin toss is completed the stats for that match will count to his career stats no matter what.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Of course|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Yes It Dose, <br>  every single Run Scored,<br>  every single Ball Bowled.<br>  <br>  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is pretty much where the quarterback throws the ball or sometimes runs it AND you catch or run run run and make a touchdown [in the end zone]<br>  OR if your 3rd down and dont get that far you get a field goal. That = 3 points.<br>  Touchdown=6 PLUS a field goal=1 [that's with the touchdown]<br>  Make sure your quarterback doesn't get a saftly...=2 points for the other team|`|AA12103453	Yeah wrong section but you could make the same basic argument with American Football(paid thousands/millions of Dollars instead). They are being paid by the team though in this Country, I guessed it was the same all over. So if teams can afford to give them that much then isn't it their problem? Sure they start charging more for tickets, but the people are paying to go.

KyShUk8kaa	Absolutely, provided he plays his whole career with the Sox. He has been the model of consistency, has been a part of the 2000, 2005, and 2008 playoff teams. He has made multiple all-star appearances, has been a leader, and the fans love him. He has been the cornerstone of Sox pitching for almost a decade now.|`|6T90F8mNaa	Not right now. In order to be on that wall, or have a number retired, you need to be great. That's why Ted Lyons, Harold Baines, Nellie Fox, Luke Appling, Luis Aparicio, Billy Pierce, Carlton Fisk, and Minnie Minoso are there.<br>  <br>  In order to get up on that wall, you must play with the White Sox for much of your career, which Buehrle is accomplishing. However, he recently stated he may retire after 2011, because he gets homesick. If he retires that early, he wouldn't stand a chance.<br>  <br>  And to be on that wall, you need to be great, not just good. Buehrle has struggled somewhat, and didn't have all great years. He gives up a lot of hits. Even though he has done good for the White Sox, I'm afraid he won't get the honor unless he plays for a while longer, and plays great.<br>  <br>  But good is not great. Frank Thomas will be the next to have his number retired. And I want Ray Schalk to have his picture up on the wall.|`|U3KAgO0baa	No! lest face it the Guy was Great for 2years, Good for about 6-7 years, but is not one of the best players 2 ever suit up for the white sox...|`|0XTSsephaa	If they can give Harold Baines a statue, then they can retire Buehrle's number.  So sure.<br>  <br>  Not saying Buehrle is one of the greatest White Sox pitchers ever though, he is basically an above .500 pitcher, but he has a rubber arm, is a career White Sox pitcher, and helped us get a World Series.<br>  <br>  --Now Frank Thomas should have his number retired, a statue, his face on the wall, and possibly a room somewhere in the Cell.  That was a great player.|`|BDEVP4qpaa	He's been pretty good and consistent throughout his career but nothing too astonishing to be honest except maybe his 05 season. I don't think they'll do go that far as to retire his number.|`|Ng0MKmxaaa	He still has some work left to do before he gets that honor|`|YRRXtVXeaa	AS MUCH AS I HATE THEM, YES! HE IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS THOSE BUMS HAVE EVER HAD!|`|SuXAhw1eaa	yes, he is my favorite pitcher in the MLB<br>  and if he keeps up his good work<br>  and he will no doubt have his pic on the wall. if he stays with the sox for 4-6 more year then yes it will be retired<br>  GO WHITE SOX|`|r67QP0mtaa	i dont think so because he was good but i dont think hes to comparison with hall of famers

xRQfCdKOaa	What was your slo pitch stance? Did you keep your feet together, then step into your swing? If that's the case try having a wider stance. With the ball coming obviously faster, you don't have as much time to step into it. Try starting with a wider stance. You might want to stop by a hitting cage before going to a try out. Good luck, I hope you do well.
TMVHdNpbaa	the reason they call it odd is because if you have 1 game and you opponents has 2, its odd, because 1+2=3, so that means that you switch courts. Know you play the next game and you win the game, so the score is 2-2, 2+2=4 then that's not odd so you don't switch. You play another game and you win, the score is 3-2, 3+2=5 that's odd and you switch again...and just so on, you just add up the score of what you have and what your opponent has, and it it's odd then you switch courts. hopefully this help!|`|x5N1PO4haa	No I think it's a pretty much even game!!|`|LhvYjIfuaa	an odd game---interesting question. in a set, it is games 1, 3, 5 out of 6 games.
p5eT0n4Vaa	back handspring, Back flip, front flip then side flip in that order
2sLQideeaa	a sideflip is hardest to learn and a front flip is easiest to learn
3MKmare8aa	front flip is by far the easiest to learn.very easy off a tramp or something. side flip is probably second hardest because your orientation is changed... the hardest (it was the hardest for me to learn at least) was butterfly twist. cause you have to spin horizontally and land on your feet at the end.<br>  <br>  However, if your in martial arts, butterfly twist might be easier cause they do alot of spins and such anyway.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what sport you do already or what your good at, be it twisting or flipping.<br>  <br>  also there is a special name for a side flip.. its called a side semi usually|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	hardest front flip second is side flip next is butterfly twist

T1vgsbyKaa	Eat foods high in carbs the night before a game or practice. Also drink at least a cup of gatorade the night before. Carbs give you more energy because they allow more for your body to burn off. Electrolytes are a source of energy you get from Gatorade that help prevent dehydration. <br>  <br>  Right before a game, i would avoid eating anything high in sugar or caffeine. Although food and drink containing such will give you a short burst of energy, you will also crash, and be left feeling even more tired then you did to start with.|`|CT2I5W78aa	well you can eat pretty much anything before a game as long as you eat at least 2 hours before a game.....but you might want to try fruits and vegetables for energy<br>  <br>  p.s. don't eat anything right before a game because you will get really bad cramps. trust me it has happened to me:D|`|Ff7lRKHiaa	i can't really say what to eat but do not eat<br>  1. steak<br>  2. beef<br>  3. milk<br>  4. any food that is hard to digest|`|c4GykfVkaa	nutela?:)|`|oTtRLkjEaa	banana, potatoes stuff like that becasue the release the energy slowly throughout the whole game.

5GI6hmFpaa	There cannot be step by step instructions given without knowing what your abilities and resources are.  I have considered doing this with some sandals for the effect while skating in the summer.<br>  <br>  The only mechanically difficult item is the frame and if you have a metal shop or with a little more work with a few basic tools.<br>  <br>  The frame is actually very simple, just an upside down U with the appropriate width and a few holes.<br>  <br>  If you look at the cheaper skates with metal frames, you will see that they make the frame from three main pieces.  Two sides and a cross plate for mounting the sides.  Depending on how your axles mount, you may or may not need a few lower cross pieces to keep the sides straight.  <br>  Screw the sides to the plate and attach the plate to the shoes.  <br>  It will help if the shoes have a stiff sole like a bicycle shoe.  If not, you will probably want to make the plate a little larger and fasten the shoe to it in more places.  Most racing skates have shoes made of fiberglass or carbon fiber and mount to the frame with two screws.<br>  <br>  The easiest axles to create are just plain 8 mm bolts with nuts.  <br>  Drill matching holes in both sides.  You need to have some sort of small spacer outside of each bearing to keep the wheel from rubbing on the frame.<br>  <br>  The first inline skates made by Rollerblade company just used two pieces of steel angle like the ones used to make up shelving.|`|uAhy5TOtaa	buys some rollers, then buy some blades and glue it :D|`|vrlTxHimaa	well i dont know how to make roller blades but i know how to make a hover board<br>  First thing's first. Find a snowboard that is the right size for you (from ground to nose level). The nice wooden ones are ok but the lighter they are, the better(i.e. plastic cheap ones)note: this will completely ruin your board, so don't use an expensive one(i.e. burton) <br>  Buy 3-4 leaf blowers. The 250 dollar ones work best, but the cheaper 50 dollar ones are fine, too. You should have at least 2 for the bottom, and one smaller on to act as a thruster. <br>  This is kind of tricky. Remove the tube that concentrates the air in one direction, this will just get in the way. Now with the leaf blowers facing downward (the part that shoots air out facing the ground), attach two of the blowers to the bottom of the board. You will have to find your own way, because all models are different (screws work the best). Test this out by turning on the blowers and see if you have lift. If you do, try siting on the board in the air. If this doesn't work, add more blowers depending on how much you weigh. (1 blower should lift 150lbs easily). Note: always have a spotter with you to prevent injuries. <br>  Now, to ride forward, you must attach the third blower to the back of the board. This should be done with the part that shoots air facing backwards. Test this out by holding the board and turning the rear blower on and feeling for a forward motion. If you don't feel it, you might need a more powerful blower for thrust. <br>  The board is now ready. If, when it goes in the air, it seems impossible to balance, place 2 pieces of balsa wood (extremely lightweight and delicate) on the sides for stability.

I think I'm actually starting to like Cena again.|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	That pop pretty much pooh-poohs the notion that only little kids are Cena fans.<br>  <br>  Cena has been getting a lot of big pops as of late, and it's not just "little kids" cheering the man.|`|lr68XuMFaa	Yeah, whoever was there when it was live on Tuesday or the ones watching it on T.V. heard it.|`|lGIL36faaa	wat pop? plz tell me i want 2 know|`|smDClNDkaa	Biggest pop I herd was Raw a few like 5 years ago in Montreal.<br>  HBK in the ring with the mic getting his *** booed, HBK being HBK bashing Montreal and Bret Hart, they play Bret Harts music.  Loudest pop I ever herd since Summerslam 1992 at Wembly Stadium in London England when the British Bull Dog beat Bret Hart for the IC Title.|`|aEB5p3pPaa	i don't give a damn about Cena.the POP that turned out to be great is Taker's Promo specially when he said ''SHAWN MICHAELS'' the crowd booed HBK.|`|WQGvE60waa	Ehh.<br>  <br>  Pop or No Pop.

FFE9Qztzaa	Ok first, the spots on the Champions League does depend on the rank of a league. The better (ranked) league, the more clubs from that league are allowed in the CL.<br>  <br>  Strongest League<br>  -England --- 4 teams allowed max<br>  -Italy  ---  4 teams max<br>  -Spain -- 4 teams max<br>  <br>  other  "lower" league participation<br>  -France, Germany, > 3 teams<br>  - Portugal, Greece, + other countries > 2 teams .. ?<br>  ( im not sure on the data above.. ^^ ) <br>  <br>  In the english, italian, and spanish leagues, the clubs who placed<br>  1st and 2nd previous season get direct entry.<br>  The ones placed in 3rd and 4th, must enter this sort of qualification round in order to get into the group stages.<br>  <br>  <br>  DUBYA- Thanks for correcting me.... :)|`|mK06dus9aa	I would recommend the web site of Bert Kassies, he is a UEFA football nut and compiles all kinds of related statistics on qualifications, seedings, rankings, team and country coefficients etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kassiesa/bert/uefa/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xs4all.nl/~kassiesa/bert/uefa...</a>|`|OVIlekcVaa	The European Leagues are broken down into ranks of strength. <br>  Leagues ranked 1 to 3 have four positions,<br>  Leagues ranked 4 to 6 have three positions,<br>  Leagues ranked 7 to 15 have two positions,<br>  Leagues ranked 16 or lower have one position.<br>  Also where your league ranks it depends how far your teams are placed. So La Liga is in the top 3 so they get 3 teams in the group stage and 1 team in the third qualifying round.<br>  Every league in Europe gets at least one team into the CL. Teams that start in the first qualifying round have to play 3 series in order to make it to the group stage, which most don't make it that far.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think it's just how the WWE creative team is working the storylines right now and besides it can be difficult for the fans to get involved in the match as they don't know who to cheer for.The heel vs heel feuds have already been done before back in the Attitude Era with Stone  Cold vs The Rock for instance and maybe the WWE just wants to move on now.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	The audience has no one to truly cheer for in those feuds so they make it quite rare for that to happen and when it does happen, it will usually be for an upcoming face turn.<br>  <br>  If a crowd can't get into a feud, the company can't make money off it.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	The Big Show is the WORLD'S LARGEST ATHLETE and at Wrestlemania *25* he will become the WORLD'S LARGEST WORLD CHAMPION! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plus, at Wrestlemania RANDY ORTON will become the WWE Champion and The Age of Orton will continue at 'Mania!|`|fnzaYmYJaa	Edge vs Big Show vs John Cena<br>  Heel  vs Heel          vs Face|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I agree with J, heel vs heel in theory sounds great but crowds just don't respond.|`|8utgHwgKaa	I HOPE EDGE VS ORTON HAPPENS AGAIN|`|7ImGw976aa	I think having them more sometimes would be nice and a little less boring. Like with Cena, Cena is such a face that whoever he fights seems to turn into the heel because there's no way in hell Cena could be a heel, which is so boring and he's predictable.<br>  Some heels can evolve though, like Christian and he was a heel but got massive fanbase and got lots of response, making him able to fight heel and face quite easily.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	edge vs big show is heel vs heel<br>  and at the biggest stage of them all WM 25<br>  and<br>   Edge vs Big Show vs John Cena<br>  Heel vs Heel vs Face  is not for sure yet|`|XFyIssKjaa	The Big Show and Edge are kind of feuding but no one ever knows who to root for.|`|ogGHl836aa	Because they need someone to boo and someone to cheer <br>  but that would be cool

JWjonDNqaa	You don't really need to bulk up, but you need to speed up. It may sound weird, but you don't need to bulk up (excessively) to build exponential speed increases. Run distance daily (4 to 6 miles) and do speed drills (sprints and monster miles (running around the track and up and down the bleachers)). Plus, if you want to focus on anything in particular, focus on your calves, they build up the potential fo you to spring off, increase your stride and (if you buy spikes instead of flats) work the most when you're running on your toes (spikes force you onto your toes). Good luck with track and if your from FL, I look forward to seeing you at some competition.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Bulking up is kind of useless in track unless your doing like the 100m or 200m when you need to swing your arms really fast and legs to push off the blocks. 400m isnt really needed as long as you can keep to constant and dont lose your speed.|`|dFHkSkCpaa	Whoa you are skinny<br>  I would say yeah. Bulk up a bit.<br>  Not too much - girls find that gross.<br>  Just do your best, good luck!|`|q57LZ6XWaa	Runners need lean muscles, not bulky ones. Lifting weights is good, just do not overdo it. Good luck in XC!|`|EsWJo0OZaa	Not for track!!|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Well if you're thinkin of trying to work your way into sprinting (100 & 200) then it would be a good idea to build up a moderate degree because sprinters rely more on raw power rather than endurance. Having a good muscle:weight ratio is essential for power sprinting. <br>  <br>  However if you plan on stayin in the 400 and 4X400 then, while still building up necessary muscle, you dont have to take it to a ridiculous degree. Once again try not to sacrifice raw power for agility; muscles will propel you to the finish line but bulk will get in your way, and you also need time to adjust to the dynamic changes brought on by having a new physique. Gettin bigger will change the way you run and you will need to become accustomed to and develop a new style for maximum performance.|`|5b90bc866933aa473f3c30b1a379fc07aa	I wish I could provide a better answer, but "That  One Dude has the best.<br>  Thirty years ago the only people that bulked-up were shot putters.
KXh6YPByaa	Good team.  I would look to upgrade at 1B and OF if possible, but you are good with the team you have so you are a buyer.  Don't stretch to get a deal done. If its good take it but don't overpay for anything.  Also you could look into so other pitchers but you should wait till the year starts and see who is hot.  depending on what you need (wins, saves, K's) you will probably find someone available|`|Jx2oBYmlaa	you have artwork team except with percival he might be replaced by dan wheeler for closer so might be a thought but other wise good|`|ITq5FNXuaa	that is a unbelivable team if utley is healthy if not is decent|`|tak6xnfVaa	great, except for percival|`|VM2b7gq8aa	You will do fine|`|tARluLEZaa	Good team, the only thing I can say is Percival is on the downside of his career and I would get ride of him. The only other thing is you could get another outfielder.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Decent team. You could really use some speed outside of Hanley Ramirez. OF is also a bit of a weak spot. Try to trade for a Jacoby Ellsbury type. It would solve your OF issues, and give you the needed speed.

QtjnmEzoaa	I hope you're right. As a Notre Dame fan I'd love to see him be a huge success. <br>  <br>  But honestly, pull your head out of the clouds. Even if Quinn does end up with the starting job, Mangini likes to play musical quarterbacks (look at what he did with Pennington and Clemens in NY) and it won't be long before he's back to holding a clipboard. My only impression of Mangini is that he's indecisive, and that's not the best situation for nurturing a young quarterback.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Heh, heh...I want to see him do well...Quinn seems to be the fan favorite, but is it me or do Mangini and the Browns brass seem to favor Derek Anderson?...<br>  <br>  That could be a problem for Quinn...I'm hoping not...But if thats the case, Quinn may demand a trade eventually...It would suck, cause Quinn is an Ohio kid...<br>  <br>  But it would be funny to see the Mangenious fall on his a*s if he picks Anderson over Quinn...No offense to you and other Browns fans...I'm a Patriots fan, and its just that I can't stand Mangini...Nothing against the Browns...<br>  <br>  I suppose there's always the Bengals for Quinn if they give up on Carson Palmer...|`|3oUSroiZaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:Hey Stern haven't seen you in a long time.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	Do they even sell his normal jersey??|`|4KTe107Yaa	I love to drink this early too|`|Boc1Buuwaa	No offense to Brady Quinn or anybody on the Browns team but, Eric Mangini just got hired as the new Head Coach. As a 20 year Jets fan, I had never seen a worse coach in my life. He is horrible because Thomas Jones would get 3 touchdowns, 175 yards rushing with 25 carries one game, and then Mangini runs him 5 times the next game and ends up with a BIG FAT LOSS. The man can draft good players but he cant coach for SH*T! Jets had the best team in the NFL last year, but then all of a sudden they lost the last 5 games... oh wait, they lost 4 of the last 5 due to getting lucky against the Bills. It was PATHETIC! How do you have a corner make the pro bowl when your dead last in pass coverage?

f3b513a0133713ab68cfda8b8b712c06aa	Well yeah potentially, if you dont work out anymore you start to loose your muscle mass. It wont happen right away, however, it will begin whats called Atrophy. Which is what happens when you start not using certain muscles. So to again answer your question, yes it will eventually start to shrink.

l7iZhjoSaa	These cramps are natural, when you first start running long distances. Make sure you're well hydrated, cause that could also be the issue. Give it some time and soon enough you will stop feeling them. If you have to stop and stretch it out before continuing. If you don't start feeling better after about a week I would consider going to see a professional about these problems, you could potentially have a strain.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Tips: Eat 2 hours before running to give yourself some energy while time to digest the food to prevent cramping. Drink tiny sips of water, dont drink a whole bottle of water at one time. If you still get a cramp, try to lift your arm and stretch out where the cramp is. Ex. If you're cramping on the left side, life your left arm up and stretch to the right. It will help open up on the left to allow the cramp to go away.|`|d385a8d8c7fb7864f805ea62eecdc7caaa	You need to strengthen your abdominal by doing core work. Crunches, sit-ups, russian twists, planks, etc...will help build your abs and lessen cramps. I do this for cross country and track, and have not had terrible cramps in a long time.|`|C9GFXZBtaa	I found that if you breath heavily in and out, it will prevent the cramps.  But don't drink water right before you run, either!  That's a bad idea.  But still drink water, but just not right before you run.|`|e937b00635efe3f3ae128aa4d3682db1aa	never gulp down water right before the race, instead take ocasional drinks during school, so your body will stay hydrated throughout the whole day and for the 2 mile run. Also, try eating a bannana one hour before running, because it prevents cramps, and makes lactic acid build up slower/less.|`|E2DhXryxaa	DRINK WATER.<br>  That is the main cause of cramps.<br>  I am not talking about during practice, I'm talking all day, the day before, basically all the time. You should be drinking 2-3 bottles a day.<br>  You also need to make sure you do not eat too shortly before practice, but enough time so that you are not hungry (and your stomach isn't empty, therefore full of air). Give yourself an hour and a half to two hours, depending on who you are, before you go to practice.
7pddTi6maa	Your team looks good and is loaded with stars, but whats the point of a 4 team league.  I play in a 12 team league that actually requires you to draft well rather then just picking an all star every round.  A four team league doesn't seem like it would be fun.|`|dDas43FZaa	Ummm, hell yes it's good.|`|e7052195cbb6160d8b7fdcbb12c9b5c9aa	at first glance it looks great but seeing that theres only 4 teams id have to see the other teams to truly rate it.|`|OBcvu93uaa	Yes, that team is amazing. Although I would play Mauer over McCann. You have a lot of power, and could use Mauer's average instead at the Catcher position. Also, Jake Peavy has always scared me. You have 3 killer 1st Basemen in Pujols, Teixeira, and Berkman. I would try and trade Teixeira for another killer SP, and maybe a RP or something.

l2qtG4yfaa	Your 400 time is very good for a 15 yr old. Your 100 meter time is not that good but it is not horrible either. You should focus on the 400 that time is pretty good try to get down to a 52 and you will be great.<br>  <br>  Training for the 400 won't necessarily hurt your 400 but it won't improve it that much.<br>  The 400 is a mix of speed and endurance but once you get to the higher levels it is just a full out sprint the entire way.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	No..400 will not slow down your 100. Your 100 is pretty good for a 15 year old. You can probably hit under 12 sec. But your 400 is alright.. not impressive tho. Try to hit around 55 sec.

Jr9j5f6naa	yes, it does sound like he/she is loosing confidence in you. if it helps, mentality means "a habitual or characteristic mental attitude that determines how you will interpret and respond to situations" so work hard and do good on the 600, and they will notice. you could try telling them your sorry about your attitude lately and will work hard, and you would like them to give you another chance at the 4x800. <br>  <br>  Anyway, a 600 isn't that much of a difference from the 800, really. If anything it should be easier for YOU, but for example, I would do terribly. I do the 2400 & 1600. I'm not good with middle distance, so it wouldn't be easy for me, specifically. but then again, for you, the 2400 might be hell. it depends on what your used to running, and what you like to run. what the other guy said, there's no "easy" event.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	No such thing as a easy event. They are all hard depending on how you run it. 100m can be easy if you Usain Bolt. But there is no such thing as a easy event.|`|rW7fiXtdaa	look all you can do is what u can do...ur coach cant ask for anything more than that ur trying ur hardest<br>  but the 600 is about as difficult as the 800 caz u wanna run it a little faster than ur 800 time...good luck u'll do fine!
tvuhGTD9aa	1. Length of service tenure, in particular how this sorts a player into one of three bins -- team-controlled, arbitration eligible, and free agency eligible.<br>  <br>  2. Skill set (including defensive position) / past performance.<br>  <br>  3. Age, for predictive modeling of future performance (which is what the team will be paying for, so they want an accurate notion).<br>  <br>  4. Local market -- NYC will generally pay better than Tampa/St. Pete.<br>  <br>  5. For free agents, general market conditions -- if there's eight good first basemen in a given off season, their negotiating leverage is lessened. If there's only two good left fielders, however, demand for their services may be higher, and they'll get bigger offers.<br>  <br>  6. Overall economic conditions. In the 2000-02 window, we saw contracts of seven, eight, nine, even ten years signed. Those are not happening now; teams are negotiating much more conservatively, with two, three, maybe four year deals.<br>  <br>  7. Brinksmanship ability of a given player's agent. "Playing hardball" doesn't only refer to what happens on the diamond.|`|AA11720887	Boros!|`|tARluLEZaa	How good they are, how many years that are on there contract and how much money they signed for.|`|j3iP5iwHaa	Its all about how good they have been in the recent past, and how long they are going to be singed for

Oh yeah don't forget about Deron williams, whose averaging about 10 plus assists a game.  They are 6th in scoring, 3rd in FG%, and,#1 in assists and steals.  They are definate contenders for the championship, but i think the Cavs will win it this year|`|AA10504968	Any team that makes the playoffs, gets hot, puts it together and leaves everything on the court can win it.

0XTSsephaa	The Cubs are the only real "lock."<br>  <br>  AL East too hard to call, Al Central too hard to call, AL West I think the Angels (But some experts think they dropped off a bit), NL East too hard to call, and NL West too hard to call.<br>  <br>  The NL Central however, all of the teams are mediocre except for the Cubs.  Not saying the Cubs are going to win the World Series or even win a series in the playoffs, but they should take their division easily.<br>  <br>  --Anyways, maybe someone could also make a case for the Angles being a lock, but I am 100% sure the Cubs are a lock.|`|LbJqU82waa	THE PIRATES ARE LOCK FOR CENTRAL AND ROYALS ALSO|`|VXpXNRJDaa	Yankees<br>  Royals<br>  Mariners<br>  <br>  Nats<br>  Pirates<br>  Rockies<br>  <br>  AL WC Orioles<br>  NL WC Reds|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	AL East: Red Sox|`|4Fh0mHmPaa	NL East: Nationals<br>  (don't count out the Nationals to make a run in the NL east.<br>  remember they are still young.)<br>  <br>  NL Central: Cubs<br>  <br>  NL West: D-Backs<br>  <br>  AL East: Yankees<br>  <br>  AL Central: Twins<br>  <br>  AL West: Angels<br>  <br>  These are the teams that will win there divisions.|`|VM2b7gq8aa	tht is all true except the Rays have a huge shot in the A.L.

30591Ebkaa	It is not to allow or not.

But they do not want to play in Pakistan because of the danger of terrorist attacks. Terrorism in Pakistan is a daily event, and they would wish to target many western countries (e.g. england, australia), or of course Indians. The only country nice enough to come to Pakistan despite the danger was Sri Lanka. They were promised good security. However, last week the SL team bus was shot at, and several players injured. Now every country's fear of coming to Pakistan has been turned into a reality. And no country will want to tour Pakistan for years to come. Maybe when it becomes a safer place things will be better.  (see the link before it describes everything)|`|rxRFQlLXaa	Pakistan is a safe haven or a heaven for Terrorists,<br>  Now answer this, if you were a player, would you ever want to go to a place where u might get shot or bombed in the hands of a terrorist,??<br>   i would assume, the answer is, NO!!!<br>  Peace!!!~~~|`|keaTjhN4aa	well basically<br>  you go to pakistan<br>  you get killed<br>  <br>  i do not think you would like that to happen to you<br>  stop acting dumb<br>  watch the news<br>  stop living under a rock|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Have I missed something here?<br>  <br>  I believe that teams can still tour if they wish.

4NE4kPGpaa	No.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	heck yea and screw lebron getting the mvp award wade should get it|`|15ffd7adf8caf120b0a8331ff718983baa	Kobe didn't win it way back then when he had that 81 point season and got his team to the 8th spot, so why should Wade?|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	if he keeps it up, then yes, but remember you still have LeBron that is currently at the top of that list and a sneaking Kobe that can really get it on. If Wade does lead his team to a 4th/5th spot, I think he should be MVP, but he needs to play the entire season like he is playing after the all star break if he even wants a chance.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	This guy has been playin out of this world lately<br>  i would consider this guy a serious contender only if he can get his team to 50 wins,then we got to leave it in the hands of the voters.....<br>  still its too early to tell|`|Ga11Abmzaa	yeah|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  Kobe has Pau Gasol and his team can win most games without him.<br>  <br>  LeBron's team can do the same thing.<br>  <br>  Wade's team cannot win without him. Also, his team is young, which is all the more remarkable. Most people said that his team wouldn't even make the playoffs this year, and it looks like they WILL be playoff bound.   <br>  <br>  Also, look how Boston completely stopped LeBron WITHOUT KG and GLEN DAVIS. As good as LeBron is, he mainly relies on his strength to power over opposing players...just like Shaq did. Notice that when Shaq stopped relying only on strength to dominate opponents and began learning to shoot free throws, began learning to shoot quickly and at better angles rather than only power dunking his point totals increased--especially since he lost weight and his strength can't carry him as much as when he weighed more than every big man in the league. <br>  <br>  LeBron is similiar. His strength lets him run over and through opponents while Wade, Kobe, Iverson (in his prime), Chris Paul and others had to work on their speed, agility, twisting layups to get most of their baskets. That's what makes these players more remarkable in my opinion. LeBron can be shut down when his shooting is off or when his path to the basket is cut off by players who are stronger than him. That's not to say that he will be completely cut off, but he will be limited to All Star status rather than superstar status. The Knicks, Boston and other teams realized this and have done it. <br>  <br>  Wade just isn't on a good team. But he has carried his team high as opposed to Kobe, who tried to carry his team without any stars or good players and failed. Kobe is very good as well, but I think Wade connects with the players around him much better. His willingness to pass, block shots and steal, in my opinion, places him above Kobe in certain respects.  Also, the players on Wade's team rarely score above 19 so Wade does most of the work.  Without Kobe, the Lakers might still be playoff bound but probably not as high as they are now. <br>  <br>  LeBron and Kobe have great passes, but Wade has increased his blocked shots, his steals, his rebounds and his assists to become an even better player than he was before.  He's doing what Alonzo Mourning, Shaq, Walker, Payton and others did for Miami during their championship run.  He's the entire team and yet, opposing teams still lose to Miami.  <br>  <br>  Both Wade and Kobe score easily and differently and LeBron's passing is as exceptional as Wade's but as an all-around player, Wade has not only more than improved his game, he's one of the best.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Of course, but all of the NBA crew want LeBron to get it. Cause of his team record. Not knowing that LeBron isn't leading his team as much  as Wade. Look at Wade's team, full of rookies, or sophomores. The only good guy other than Wade might be Jermaine O'neal, but he's playing like ****. Well you have Mario chalmers with the defence, you have Michael Beasley with the rebounds and the hustle. You got Moon,  Haslem ect. But when it comes down to a team, Miami heat is not complete. There team is worst than the team LeBron has ever had, or Kobe. And they are still competing for the 4th spot in the east!!! All because Dwyane Wade. But I wouldn't get mad if he doesn't win the MVP, because I know that next year when Wade gets a better team, he'll win it.|`|kG2c19r3aa	No doubt.  He might not be on the best team but mv stands for most valuable.  Without d wade the heat would be worse than last year.  D Wade is the only lifeline for the Heat not becoming the Detroit Lions of the NBA.  Flash for MVP.|`|qqt6caPyaa	he should win it because of his stats but hes not winning enough games over lebron and kobe. and everybody knows mvps been going to just top 3 teams for the past years. now i think he should win all defensive team over kobe but he wont because coaches are on kobes dick|`|oTmylEGUaa	They are certainly MVP worthy numbers but his team is not winning enough.|`|Fh0shlVLaa	He deserves it.<br>  <br>  If only his team can get a better record.|`|9EYyNZrraa	yes he does! i mean he scored 50 point by himself in one game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|VM2b7gq8aa	ya mayb i mean he is 3rd in MVP for me|`|gX6U6gimaa	He has a very good chance because he's carrying his team and they are doing much better than what they did last year being the 5th seed in the east. I would say he's MVP worthy. Not to mention his stats.
AA10421436	Have you ever seen pictures of Jordon's parents?  Look for pictures of NBA players with their parents and then decide.<br>  <br>  Never give up on your dreams!  It's not whether or not they come true, it's whether or not you've tried, that make life fun.  However, always have a backup plan or other options.  In other words, study hard in school and be the smartest NBA player out there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|5MyUHybJaa	As long as you try hard and never give up, you can do anything. As far as I know, NBA competition is picking up, and the need for shorter-speedy players is becoming increasingly important. If I'm not wrong, the shortest player in the NBA is about 5 5. I'm also 14, and I'm currently 5-6, but you have got to make sure that you do not allow your height to be an obstacle to your dream of getting in the NBA. If you work hard, get the stamina, muscle, skills for the NBA, you won't have too much to worry about. But, you must also remember that you must have exceptionally high skills than an average tall player in the NBA, if you want your to dream to have even a chance of coming true. I also want to get into the NBA, which is why I'm starting to work hard to become a speedy player, full of stamina and muscle, so maybe we might meet each other in the future. The key is to work hard. Good Luck!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	“I can accept failure, everyone fails at something.

7ImGw976aa	Definitely, I believe it's real downfall was starting like at the beginning of 2004 and it has just kept on descending ever since. They've kept on losing their better wrestlers and things and didn't really replace them well. Plus I think the older and been there longer wrestlers have basically been carrying most of the weight of the company for quite a while now. Sadly with the older wrestlers they've tonned them down to much in character and have banned moves that were more interesting and actually looked like they could do damage and shortened all the matches, making them look boring. PG era's just made it from slipping to worse.<br>  Plus the diva's there now are nothing to what was there, the recent one's can't even wrestle and all they are is bitchy and there to look pretty, wrong business to be doing.|`|YQUrWyH3aa	i think the superstars of compared to those of yesteryear aren't stars they're not even super.if wwe had allstar shows with people from 2000-2004 wrestling would be much better|`|6gZynUKzaa	i think the superstars are still good|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	This Is All Cause WWE Gimmicks Suck<br>  <br>  <br>  Put Some Mask On CM Punk<br>  <br>  Make Him Wear A coat<br>  <br>  And Make Him Ambush Top wrestlers....<br>  <br>  Biggest Wrestler In WWE History.....<br>  <br>  <br>  WWE GIMMICKS SUCK!|`|GVyM27Jqaa	of course, they need to come up with some good character superstars that would have people watch wwe again
xNdcvH40aa	i absolutely hate cena more than anyone in wwe. like all those guys like batista and him arent good entertainment. Jericho, Orton, and Edge are my favortie because they actually have skill, theyre entertaining, and dont care what people think. If cena went through what they did hed cry like the little woman he is.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	Cena= little kid love him, as well as women, or new to wrestling all together <br>  not real wrestling fans|`|oTmylEGUaa	I don't like John Cena and I don't understand people that watch the WWE.|`|owfDKuBXaa	well even though his jokes rn't funny 2 us they mayb funny 2 the lil kids dat make up the wwe audience its a shame dat vince made it kid friendly|`|ogGHl836aa	Well he mostly attracts kids under 12 and women over 30|`|09YK9Zboaa	First of all Cena has more charisma then most of the other people in the WWE locker room, his mic skills are in the top 5, and also the only two big names to emerge from this decade are Cena and Orton... but wait i actually forgot somebody i am going to change my answer from Cena to.. wait for it, wait for it... BATISTA|`|B9h6VhQOaa	fans are soo easily manipulated. if vince says he wants cena to be the good guy all the fans start to love him. i think he f***kin sux as a wrestlers he has no charisma, people always choose to cheer for someone who doesn't ever tap out at all or never gets pin. when was the last time cena tapped? i think it was back in 2005 against kurt angle who can actually wrestle and has charisma but people choose to cheer for cena. nothing is special about cena. They boo edge who is a great heel. he's done so much for the business, has a lot of charisma. I want to get a good answer from every fan of cena on why he is so great. i doubt ill get 1 single good answer|`|8utgHwgKaa	CENA IS BOOYAKA BOOYAKA|`|LbJqU82waa	HOPEFULLY, THIS PUNK DOES NOT GET TO WRESTLEMANIA AND ALSO  WILL QUIT ACTING, BECAUSE HE STINKS!|`|0Sj2K6Msaa	I also wonder the same thing.

1vz9V6rOaa	I prefer him better without facepaint. I was so glad when he wasn't wearing it last night! And I am a fan of him. He is my favorite wrestler. :)|`|qNHMcRL4aa	i preer him with the face paint. although he is wearing it he is more himself than jeff hardy the wrestler, as you see him outside of wrestling like at home or something he is hisitchweed character and he has facepaint.<br>  i am a fan<br>  he is better wit face paint because it is different everytime!|`|WQGvE60waa	I perfer him not being in the main event.|`|09YK9Zboaa	Jeff hardy with facepaint is going back to the old days, he used to always wear facepaint, and yes i am a Jeff hardy fan<br>  <br>  he is so much more bad *** with facepaint|`|DufCLIMsaa	I hate the face paint.  He thinks he looks good but he doesn't.  What is the point of it, really?|`|E7TkNO00aa	I like him with it and without it.

I think he looks completely rediculous with it.  Yes I am a fan of his.  In fact, he's my favorite wrestler.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Well he is not the only Heath Ledger fan, me too. So I like him with that face paint, he is really cute so its needed to make him looks extreme.|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	I like the facepaint.<br>  It takes me back to his RAW days like 2002, he was really extreme.<br>  Yes i am a fan of him.|`|HBiStvacaa	i prefer him without paint. he looks better that way.i love him too.hes one of my favorites=)|`|EAZv468Xaa	I like him without  it cuz I like seeing his cute face!|`|fkG4cflhaa	i like him with out the face paint|`|dtpY4BEraa	he is so sexy i hate it when he covers his face with the face paint|`|nC9EqWvuaa	WOOT! Go Jeff! uh huh, obviously I'm a fan. I love the time when he jumped off that metal thingy onto Randy Orton. My fave episode.<br>  lol anyways....<br>  to answer your question I also think he looks better without face paint. I was glad last night to finally see him without the face paint. I really like the way he shaves it looks cool he leaves sections and cuts others off. Sounds messy but its cool.|`|86d01e82b8c9db2eee8837febe33a602aa	I agree with you. He is so gorgeous that he doesnt need the face paint, I like to see his beauty.<br>  I am a big fan of his, I just think hes the best thing ever and could go on and on about him till people get bored. I of course could never get bored talking about him.|`|lz7oTQNXaa	i personally think the facepaint suits jeff hardy, he needed a character really and his face paint gives him that in my opinion, reminds me abit like a sting.<br>  <br>  im not a fan of jeff hardy im afraid, never have been.|`|F0l9JxoAaa	He'll only rock the face paint during a intense, somewhat dark mood. You will know something is going on in his head.|`|zjeNJVy2aa	With or without the paint I love him. But if I had to chose I would say without the face paint;  because you can see his awesome face!|`|As5UBfaNaa	it dosent matter he is beautiful with or without facepaint!|`|owfDKuBXaa	yes ima fan nd hes better w/o the facepaint he looks like a murderous clown wiff it|`|Qswzc6w7aa	Definitely with face paint|`|aEB5p3pPaa	i prefer the Jeff Hardy with a toilet paper in his back pocket.|`|O5KOwhovaa	I prefer Jeff Hardy without drugs.|`|SdpHXzObaa	I like him without the paint,so I can see his sexy face!|`|5lLLDK4Laa	It's not scary, it's awesome. I'm going with the facepaint.|`|gaOSUthbaa	Without the paint. I'm a fan|`|lt8FZ6q1aa	with paint because he is in a murderous mood.|`|Q55DpZ3raa	Without - he is a very good looking young man|`|YQUrWyH3aa	i like him with the paint because he's been more intense

His heart and all other internal organs are in good shape. <br>  <br>  On a footnote, there's only a match between him and Jeff coming up pretty soon...|`|CaqdDzQZaa	Matt hardy is getting old and the pounds don't come off like they use to but he will do fine in any match because of his heart|`|EB1oqP0Xaa	Yea,I Have Noticed That.

f7qVtYfaaa	you are like those short guys who rant and rave trying to over compensate. get over it and enjoy your football team. i have no idea why you are so insecure about the steelers but you might want to try to have faith and enjoy them.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Now I get why people say all those things about Steelers fans.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	good point. but remember the steelers were horrible before roethislisberger came.|`|3oUSroiZaa	We beat you guys like everytime and you beat us when everyone of our best players were injured.<br>  <br>  <br>  We when playoff games.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	You are retarded...It is because they are the team of the decade as far as Super Bowls and total wins...|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Loyalty. Not a bad trait actually...|`|yxaOg0QDaa	they dont want to admit it, i just talked about this in another question topic<br>  <br>  the pats havent won a superbowl since 04...in that time they lost to the colts in the biggest comeback game in championship history...the colts were down by EIGHTEEN points late in the game, and came back to beat them and eventually went on to win the superbowl<br>  <br>  flash forward the very next year...they go 18-0, and lose to a 10-6 wild card team in arguably the biggest superbowl upset in nfl history and go 18-1<br>  <br>  they do exceptionally well during the regular season, but they just cant close it out in the playoffs anymore, espn and the pats fans would like you to believe that the patriots are still the biggest threat in the nfl but they have nothing to back that up with, rings are what matters, the steelers have gotten 2 in the past 4 years, the pats have 0, i think its safe to say the steelers are the team that needs the most looking out for|`|AA11058500	hahahaha...thats pretty funny. it really is, i hate the patriots with a burning passion, and ive never really thought of that. its a good point. the patriots are a very, very good team. the most consistent team in nfl. however, they will not be nearly as good as they have been the past years this season for a few reasons. One, they got rid of Vrabel, a highly intelligent linebacker. two, brady is coming off a terrible ACL tear. and every semi-logical NFL fan knows that any quarterback coming off of an ACL tear will never be as good as hes been. Not only that, but Brady isn't 100 percent, he had a fairly shaky rehab. In fact, he almost missed this entire upcoming season because he fell behind in his rehab. They wont win the superbowl anytime soon in my opinion.|`|xg4NjusZaa	Like other people said everyone says their team is the best. Just cuz we haven't won 1 since 2004 its still 3-2 Patriots over steelers. Also, even though they lost in the super bowl last year they were still the most dominating team over the season. The Steelers easily could have lost 1 or both of their Super Bowls if not for questionable officiating|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Do you know how stupid you and your questions are<br>    The Patriots have won 3 Super Bowls and have been ot 4, Steelers 2 and they've been to 2<br>    They went 18-1 and last year and lost the Super Bowl by 3 points.<br>    Your just an idiot that can't choose a favorite team.  I'm almost 100% positive that in 2004 you were a fellow Pats fan.  You shouldn't even be a fan of football if your favorite team is just going to be whoever won the Super Bowl.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Ok shut up!<br>  The Patriots  are still good with out Brady but not great. They didn't rely on the QB all the time, they established a firm running game. If the secondary of the Patriots weren't injury infested they could have one or two more games last season.<br>  They had an injury plaqued season!|`|SCiY5JESaa	BECAUSE THEY ARE LOYAL FANS , I LOVE THE REDSKINS AND SAY THE SKINS ARE GOING THIS YEAR ALL THE WAY|`|kzYdVfifaa	That's good fanship, every team claims to be the best.

SO u should probable brag less about how good ur team is even tho they are talented they are WAY overrated<br>  <br>  watch out for the vikings tho in upcoming years they r headed 2 the top|`|L0AZ6tHGaa	i'm not a Patriots fan, let me just get that out there...the reason they say they're the best is because of how many championships they've won in recent years, AND their consistency. They've had one of the best records in football (including the amazing 16-0 season) since 2001. You just cant see that because you can't get off of Big Ben's c*ck|`|YlZAb19uaa	cuz patriots have gone 16-0 which ur beloved steelers will neveer achieve.

He might join Barcelona again later in his career but not for another few seasons. I think that Fabregas wants to win a few trophies at Arsenal first and then he might consider joining Barcelona if they still want to buy him.|`|wurimjbnaa	He might if Arsenal don't win any trophies.|`|A6P5ibwJaa	No, I don't think so.<br>  <br>  But what I think does not matter in the end of the day does it?<br>  Fabregas, hopefully will stay in Arsenal for his entire career. I know that seems unrealistic, but I HOPE. He said his future is in Arsenal, without Arsenal I would doubt he would be where he is today. It was Wenger who gave him chances and trusted in him. He would probably sit in the bench for Barcelona. <br>  <br>  Let's just hope he doesn't! If he does, he will just be another player Barca has stolen from us and probably ruin him too.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	why in the hell would he go barca,they ruin players he will never leave arsenal besides barca haven't the money nor afford his wages|`|ZZFa4FHMaa	no he wont have a look at their MF fabregas is no where near there form. he wont want to be bench warming|`|ZbnppWIGaa	i think he will do like what henry did.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	I think he wont go.............|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	well he has stated that wen wenger leaves, he will as well.<br>  arsenal r not that big a club tbh. they're challenging for a europa league place. they might as well b fulham...

HP75NEbNaa	He's healthy and still has talent so he'll help a team out. <br>  <br>  They're saying that he doesn't really want to play on a team for cash. Most veterans just want to increase their legacy. Pedro wants to do this, but he also wants to go to a team where he still has family time, considering his father just passed away.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think he'll go to the Dodgers. He still wants to win a National League Championship and with them, he could have family time. I also think that he'd like to play with Ramirez again because they had good chemistry when they were Red Sox teammates.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Where all the great 7 inning pitchers go.

TXe7XqUlaa	No England have to declare with about 10 overs to spare at the end of today. At their current rate they will probably have 550 by then. Don't forget they need to take 20 wickets, and they have to maximise the time they have to do that. If they bowl at WI today, the west indian's tiredness may cause them to make mistakes, and they could take 1-2 wickets tonight. Time is of the essence, they already have plenty of runs.|`|AA11088802	no|`|uuHrf7cGaa	The way this series has gone so far - what England needs a quick score and declare asap. Most importantly they need to take 20 wickets in the next 3 days. Can they do it? With Flintoff - bowling is average or below average, unless the new comers swing into action and knock of WI batsman. They need the wickets of 3 important batsman as early possible - Gayle, Sarwan and Chanderpaul. If they allow them to settle then the match is gone as a draw. WI have been playing for a draw and could very well back fire. So England needs to take this opportunity to start knocking WI batsmen.|`|zjzq6VS3aa	Yes, 650+ is  more than sufficient to put them in a comfortable position unless they reach there quickly which is very important. The faster the reach that score the better there chance of winning.
U3ZBUOWaaa	I agree with you. When did DW say that??? Are you sure?? He had one good year and Jeff Gordon, Dale Sr., Richard Petty, Jimmie Johnson etc...all had numerous good years.  I wonder what DW meant??  Do you have a link to the story???|`|7RUMbREoaa	DW will say anything when he gets excited.Kyle is a great driver but that is a pretty bold(and totally untrue) statement.To say that would mean that Kyle is better than the likes of Dale Earnhardt,Jeff Gordon,Jimmie Johnson,Bill Elliott,DW himself,and others that are far greater than Kyle as of now.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I dont agree with DW! He is a good driver but one of the greatest is still to be determined. 13 wins doesn't make you the greatest in 30 years. Heck, DW thought last night during qualifying that Kyle was running in all three of the upper series that are at Atlanta. That would be ok but the Nationwide series has the weekend off. He is in love with Almandinger and Kyle.|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	That may be the smartest thing DW has ever said.<br>  <br>  Look at Kyle's age. I can't only name one driver who had this many wins at age 23. Not Earnhardt, Petty, Allison, Pearson, Richmond, or Gordon...<br>  <br>  Only Kyle Busch...and this is only the beginning.<br>  <br>  DW will be proven right within the next few years. Which is odd for him|`|XNdDrXAzaa	he may be right|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	DW has had his lips all over Kyle's behind the last couple of years.  Yes, Shrub has really picked up on the COT faster than anyone else but he STILL has no championships to show for it in any series.  He is probably the best there is at car control but to be a complete driver you have to learn patience and self restraint at times.  If Shrub can ever do that he will undoubtedly be a champion but he has a long way to go to be considered the best driver in the last 30 years.  By my recollection that means DW is saying that he's better than the winners of multiple championships including Dale Earnhardt Sr., Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson.  I would not put him in that company now and possibly never, I want to see what he does over the long haul.  Heck, I had him 3rd on my draft board THIS year for fantasy racing, behind Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I think he could end up being the best in the last 30 years, but it's too early to say.  He's definitely got talent though, and he generally knows how to use it.<br>  <br>  DW and Richard Petty both have stated that Kyle Busch is the best driver they've seen in a long time now.  That says a lot to me considering the careers they had.|`|uouq4KCvaa	Well DW says a lot of things, LOL!!<br>  Now I will admit that Kyle had an awesome year, and yes that boy has talent but I think it's a little early to be saying stuff like that. So I agree with you totally!|`|FtkoBEVpaa	That's a bold statement.  Let's not crown this guy yet.  Going back thirty years there have been many drivers I can think of who had many more accomplishments.|`|SXwlw9N2aa	Kyle is a good driver. Kyle still has alot to learn.DW is a retard. I wish he would retire so we didn't have to hear his stupid comments during the race.|`|TifUsG4Maa	I tell you Kyle B is good...He may just surprise us all this season.I would like to see a new face holding the cup at the end of the season.|`|f7a43215a7f6f4f9aeaca2b290934e46aa	Kyle Bucsh is bad *** though and though. He is hungery and driven. DW is just telling it like it is.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I guess it depends on how you look at it. He may very well be the most talented, yes.  But he hasn't begun to really accumulate the wins and championships.  So we'll see. DW, like him or not, certainly knows more about talent and racing than either you or I. That comment also sounds like it was taken out of context somewhat.  I doubt DW is saying he has had a better career than Earnhart, Gordon, etc like people here are trying to say he was saying.  "Greatest driver in 30 years" if he said that , can be interpreted in several different ways.  And I can't believe how many people here are saying DW is a retard?!  Just because you don't agree with some of what comes out of his mouth?  The guy has been there, done that in Nascar.  I guess most of you other guys and gals here have won dozens of races and a championship?|`|xkGfxn70aa	DW is certainly no expert. He's got some knowledge, but no expert.  Kyle has got balls, you've got to give credit where credit is due.  But you have got to remember DW thinks his brother is a great driver.  But then that goes back to the Greatest intimidator because he gave Michael a chance when no one else would.  A lot has got to do with luck, equipment, and the big man in the sky , lord knows he has some of the greatest up there racing around.|`|d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	He is a very good driver, but IMO it's hard to compare a driver that's only been in the sport for 5 or so years to the likes of multiple champions such as Jeff Gordon. Jimmie Johnson and Dale Sr.<br>  <br>  Kyle has the potential to be one of the greatest drivers in history, but he hasn't even won a dang championship yet.<br>  <br>  DW has lost it.|`|c16PCaCmaa	I think it's easy for television commentators to get carried away with someone like Kyle.  He gives them a lot to talk about.  People love him, and people hate him, which makes for good TV.  However, it does seem like Kyle gets a lot of praise from older drivers from Waltrip's era.  It's kind of tough to compare driver's from different eras because the sport has changed so much.<br>  <br>  I just thought of this:  anyone who watched the pre race show on Fox last Sunday, saw an interview with Jeff Gordon in which he said "I wish I was as talented as Kyle..."  I guess that can give everyone something to think about.|`|V3deprUCaa	He's a hell of a driver. Don't get me wrong. I can't stand him. But the boy can drive a racecar.<br>  <br>  However, I think that all good things must end sometimes. And I think that if Kyle is gonna be the legend that everyone says, he's got A LOT of maturing to do. <br>  <br>  Time'll tell|`|YHYT8qMKaa	That's interesting. I believe Kyle is a great driver and could be one of the greatest in the future, but I don't think he is the greatest right now. He still has a long way to go. I think Dale Earnhardt, Sr. and Jeff Gordon are the greatest drivers from the last 30 years.|`|b7f2a1f896da50f40a80adc987669ea3aa	In the last 30 years Dale Earnhardt won 7 championships, Jeff Gordon won 4 championships, and Jimmie Johnson won 3 championships in a row. Not to mention Richard Petty who won 4 of his 7 championships since 1972.<br>  <br>  Kyle's good. He's won a lot of races. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if he lives up to DW's claim.|`|58h70voyaa	Kyle is a very good race car driver however he has alot of good competion like, Stewart, Gordon, Edwards, and Johnson so  to say that is pretty far out there.  However everyone has a right to there own opinion.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	He's one of the best I've seen the last 30 years. He may be the best some day. He's had several good years since he was 17. Don't give me that one good year crap.  He made the chase twice in the 5.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	Kyle is a great and talented driver but we can say hes the greatest yet we just have to wait and see in the future years to come :)|`|Eq5JJMvJaa	Kyle is not the best in 30 years,1 good year,a couple so so,this question needs to be asked in 5 years!|`|Tu1R9YPzaa	Kyle is a great driver, but it's definitely too soon in his career to tell.|`|TvTg82wyaa	He's good, but I am TIRED of DW. He is so obviously biased toward a few certain drivers.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	D.W. is a few bricks short of a full load , Busch is good but i don't think that good yet !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|D69XI2LLaa	He is pretty darn Good... We will have to wait and see about the best in 30 years thing though!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	In my world it's true...in reality, it's a bit premature to say about a 23 year old. He is good though..
XcZgG9y6aa	Because every single year he has put on the best match of the night and steal the show, no one else has had so many memorable moments at wrestlemania. <br>  <br>  I. E The first ever ladder match, Shawn vs Bret in an epic iron man match. He put on a classic with stone cold with a broken back! He retired Ric Flair and he came back after a 4 year hiatus from the ring and beat Chris Jericho.<br>  <br>  He really gives 110% at wrestlemania|`|PniPsDmGaa	HBK has given 110% in every WM match he has been in. he has been in some of the biggest WM matches in history like the Iron Man match with Bret Hart. and He also competed in the first ever ladder match! HBK also ended the career of Ric Flair. Whenever Shawn Michaels is in a WM match, he makes sure he entertains the fans, and gives them a show.|`|WQGvE60waa	He beat Bret Hart in a controversial iron man Match..<br>  <br>  We all know he waz sucking up to Gorilla Monsoon.<br>  <br>  The true Mr. Wrestmania will always be Macho man.<br>  <br>  He put on better matches than hogan Did<br>  <br>  I don't care what anyone says.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Because Taker will go 17-0 by kicking his a**.
JWjonDNqaa	Well I run track and I do it in 5:15, but that's not important, the important part is that it gets easier if you do it daily. Don't run a whole mile daily if you can't do it during your test, but work your way up. I run 6 or 7 miles daily, but that's because I'm physically able, for you I'd recommend running about half a mile, maybe three quarters of a mile. Work your way up though, try half a mile for two weeks, then move up to three quarters of a mile for two weeks, then go up to a mile for two weeks and if you feel up to it then keep going up in distance like that until you reach a respectable distance for your age (about 2 miles). Also the type of shoes you use influence how fast your run and the pain you experience afterward. If you ran in, I don't know, something like Converses, then you'd really feel it later. If you ran in a specific running shoe (like a Brooks, Mizuno, Asics, etc. shoe) then you should experience less pain the day after. To get the pain away, after a race I ice my legs (dip them into a tub of ice water, the temperature of the water should be around 50 degrees, no higher than 60 though). I'm sure that if you stick with it you can run a 7:30 mile by the end of the summer, and by next year you'll be getting even better. It's always good to run, it keeps you in shape and those who run are (on average) much happier people (because they are confident in how they look, how they feel and running releases endorphins which trigger a euphoric (incredibly happy) feeling. Good luck with running and I hope you start running and keep it up. America is too out of shape now and days, and it's good if you help break that trend.|`|RMMwK30iaa	For me it takes just over 6 mins. <br>  I've been training for a couple of weeks now and the pain the day after has virtually gone. However to have an impact on your cardiovascular fitness (stamina which affects your time) you need to get your heart rate to about 160 for at least 20 minutes 3 times a week. This is hard work! Its about a solid 20 minute run or half an hour uphill cycling! With the improvement in cardiovascular fitness there should come an improvement in muscle endurance and strength which had caused the pain as the muscles that you use for running aren't used to being worked so hard for so long.<br>  Basically run more and the pain should go away and your time will improve after just a couple of weeks of training three times a week. If you don't train three times a week it will take quite a bit longer to improve your fitness.<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|31N3gl6Iaa	It depends on if I'm in shape or not, but last year I ran it in 6:55. I was in shape then. Sometimes I'll run it in 8:35 or even higher. It helps if you run it often, and it becomes easier.  It hurts a ton at first, but you'd get used to it after running it a lot.|`|lpvCxamvaa	When I ran the mile for the fitness test I ran it in 8min and 5 sec and after that it doesn't hurt that bad my legs are just barely sore. But my first time it took me 10 min and 22 sec just  keep running and you'll get a better time<br>  <br>                                                                     Mari, Age:11|`|4jbVgo4aaa	so i just turned 13 like a month ago. i tried out for this basket ball team and i made it. we had to do warm ups like running and i was the slowest on the team. the coach always shook her head.i ran the mile like in 14 minutes. then i got better. the pain does go away trust me.and it builds up mussel...good luck...=)|`|j6MyoCluaa	I am a boy, I can run it in 9 minutes, but even though I run a mile every few days it doesn't hurt as much. The more you run the more your body will get used to it. The only way to make it hurt less you would need to build up the muscles in your legs.|`|EK9gSqnGaa	it takes me 9 minutes with half walking. I am on a Lacrosse team and i run alot. It will hurt alot at first your body just has to get use to it. Keep running it is Great ex cerise and a good calorie burn. Plus my self-esteem has gotten better.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	You probably just not in shape. The more you run, the more your body adapts to it and it will hurt less. Once you start to run regularly, it would hurt at all because a mile would be easy for you.|`|EbMy8B79aa	the more you run the more you can decrease your time and pain..its almost like everything else. you kind have to build up a tolerance (does that make sense) to it.|`|46ZPVW22aa	Well if you run every day naturally the pain will stop. Maybe you you stretch be for running that also helps.|`|xTsbN9YXaa	ok well 10 minutes is pretty common and since ur sore it probably means ur muscles just arent used to working so hard and if u run more then yes ur legs will hurt less if u run more and u will also be able to run the mile faster|`|q57LZ6XWaa	I run track and my times are usually around 6 minutes 30 seconds. Your time isn't bad (especially for your age, im 15). If you run every day your time will get better though. Good Luck!|`|IZthxK2Raa	I believe it hurts you because you either may not be sued to it or your pushing yourself too hard|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	nobody wins a marathon over night just work at best u can and no time you'll get there and your legs and ft will be sore until you build up the muscles.|`|BddRfJ2caa	i used to run a mile in about 10 min. but that was before i started get into  doing athletic stuff and playing sports. Now i run an 8 min. mile|`|zMIePgsraa	3:52 seconds no it does not hurt|`|wjeMsLk8aa	you should warm up your muscles before you run the mile then stretch out really good before you run it. then when you are finished running the mile stretch out the same as you did before you did the mile.yes if you run the mile ore often you muscles hurt less and your time gets better.|`|ZKu7Tmrmaa	rofl idunno<br>  run more,get it over with<br>  umm 6 and a half minutes is lying|`|SpXyKFx3aa	i once ran a mile in 4 and a half minutes, i doent hurt much hun|`|Fysq3Kb2aa	I think if you're a beginning runner finishing the mile in 8 to 9 minutes is a little extreme to start out. In my experience the way to make it hurt less is to run regularly. You will be sore in the beginning but after awhile your body will adapt as you get into better shape. Once again, that's just how its been in my experience.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	I can run the mile in 5 minutes 30 seconds<br>  I wouldn't be that tired but if I ran it my fastest I could probably get down to 5 minutes but I would be dead afterward<br>  <br>  I'm 16|`|FN1CjtuQaa	i remember fitness testing !<br>  In 6th grade i got about 9 min. <br>  In 7th grade I was really into cross country & I did about 7-8min<br>  & Then in 8th grade, I stopped caring & I think I got around 8 minutes. <br>  -------------------<br>  Yes, if you run the mile regularly it will stop hurting. As long as you pace yourself. I play lacrosse for this season & We ran 2 miles yesterday ! I haven't ran that much in like 2 years ! I was dying and I walked a few times & Today my legs hurt SO much its like incredible. But, if you rest for a day or 2 it should get better & Then if you run a mile again then it will definitely hurt less & maybe you won't walk as much !|`|h9Mq5NwMaa	well, i had/have that problem too. The school i went to was into athletics. everybody had to be 'physically fit' to go there. we ran the mile all the time and i hated it. One time there was a heat wave. Some schools even got out for the heat wave. what do you know, we were running the mile outside. 8:30 at our school is considered bad, and thats what i run. I only got faster, but the pain kept getting worse. good times were considered 6 minutes to 7:30. was the slowest person in the grade. btw, i am a girl. Your either over weight, dont run the mile, out of shape, or a combo of the 3. now, i am under weight, but i am really short. To help they say to stretch your calves before you run. just touch your toes and dont bend your knees and all that stuff. it works on and off for me so you should give it a try. also you gotta run more to improve your time.|`|tNfsKZwgaa	i ran mine on Thursday in 9 minutes and 33 seconds, but I didn't wear too great of shoes. =P|`|EfaQpsd5aa	doesnt hurt me. my fastest mile was 5:17 (i was 13)|`|MUDLsPpHaa	uhmmm well i have to run it every thursday and i get 8 or 9.<br>  but for fitness testing i always get like late 6 early 7.<br>  so you really shouldnt walk either, and im 13 and it should be so hard for you.<br>  but i play soccer too, so maybe thats why.<br>  idk|`|5a79d339ada52abdf0ba28aaebb4c86caa	my first try was when i was 12 and it was 7 min. 3 sec. but now its like 8 min. (i'm 15 now) and its expected to be sore. just push through the soreness and go run. you have to work the soreness out of your muscles.|`|gYmQSIaZaa	the more you run, the less it will hurt. you just need to build muscle. and i run a mile in a little less than 7 minutes, im 15.|`|ntPUkeaNaa	Once you start running on a daily basis, that mile don't hurt no more and you can run it faster. It would take a few weeks. The last time I ran it, I got 5 minutes. I'm 19.|`|fLaHQhakaa	it all depends<br>  if I'm running from wolves or something then like 5min<br>  if at gym like 7min<br>  <br>  and yes it does get your legs sore next day|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	when I was 12 my time was about 6 1/2 minutes, im 25 now and its around 5 1/2.|`|LQtqYMP3aa	ice  bag|`|4CMx1uzXaa	I run a mile when I see alcohol or my fiance at the other end
MDmpNumVaa	I totally agree with you, the Patriots are a great team and no one should make fun of them. Obviously people have there own opinion, but if its negative just keep it to yourself.|`|IoCK2bEnaa	Great fans? Lol! You didnt have any fans till Brady came along and won you three superbowls. And the spygate scandal also brought down their popularity by a buttload. Belichick's explanation for it was really bull **** so people really hated the patriots a lot more after that. And of course, winning franchises get a lot of hate too. So id say the main reasons are..:<br>  <br>  1) Bandwagon fans<br>  2) Spygate<br>  3) Winning tradition (since Brady came along at least)<br>  4) And also, i believe Rodney Harrison was voted The Dirtiest Player of the Year once or twice. So that doesnt help.|`|luG0kqMtaa	I'm a packer's fan and I think everyone hates the patriots because they've won so many times in the last few years. If the steelers won a few more time soon, everyone would probably hate them too. Having a character like randy moss doesn't help either.|`|vURKBxvWaa	amen brother. its childish. thay are a professional team with professional players and deserve respect. i cant understand how grown adults could be so disrespectful and immature.|`|VM2b7gq8aa	i hate the pats i am a colts fan and i abously hate the pats they think there better than everyone|`|W5qZ1NKGaa	Im sorry i hate them too.

If you had been on here last season, you would know that's not even CLOSE to the truth. They were so arrogant and condescending towards fans of other teams, not saying that I haven't seen fans of the other 31 teams do it, but they were a special breed. The thing that pissed me off about most of them is that they really were bandwagoners. They would claim to be the best fans of the best franchise in the NFL, but couldn't tell you anything about their team or their (recent) history. In fact, the majority of the Pats "fans" that were on here during their 18-1 run last season have either jumped ship (especially after NE QB went down in week 1) or just left the board completely by now.<br>  <br>  "and anyone who is a fan of football shouldn't make fun of any other team, that is stupid, anyone who makes fun of another team constantly shouldn't even be allowed to watch football, that's just stupid and immature."<br>  <br>  You obviously don't watch much college football or have a favorite team if you do; those rivalries are INTENSE and get ugly. Not saying it isn't stupid and immature, but now you just seem like someone with their head in the sand.|`|PfXHhp3Haa	Because they pay with riots
Q55DpZ3raa	Well it certainly does look like it will be a legend of some sort and I think it will be either - Stone Cold or Hulk Hogan. Stone Cold because he will have a chance to have a big send off as he gets inducted into the HOF and Hulk because the 25th anniversary of WM would only be complete with the man who laid the foundations for Wrestlemania|`|hNKMHHiiaa	Ric Flair, Rowdy Piper, Ricky Steamboat, Dusty Rhodes, Honky Tonk<br>  Man and Stone Cold Steve Austin, (3:16), let the legends kick his a$$!!! is what I say!!!|`|7ImGw976aa	I'm hoping for Stone Cold.

FLKA2fiUaa	No, do not push it. I know it's not the answer you want to hear, but trust me from experience, if your injured TAKE THE FULL HEALING TIME. Talk to your coaches, and explain to them your situation. They may allow you to do some things, like cheering or handing signs and such. You could also probably work for your splits if it doesnt hurt. <br>  <br>  But, please do not tumble or stunt with it. <br>  In may you should go talk to your coaches and ask for a private tryout.<br>  They should allow you that.|`|2tn8EALqaa	uh wow maybe you should talk o a DOCTOR...!|`|PxtmMAMnaa	im really not sure, but if you had tumbling and all the skills prior, it will take pretty fast. my friend had surgery and could do her bhs tuck in little time. if you are on the right track but arent exactly to where you were prior to your cheer tryouts, talk to the coaches and let them know that you had just had surgery and you are working hard to get everything back.|`|qT5rKKYKaa	my best friend was a gymnast and had the same surgery and can no longer do back handsprings D: (well she would probably injure herself trying with metal rods in her back so she's not going to) sooo if it's middle school most don't require back handsprings so you are fine. but if it's high school tryouts you are talking about you can't learn a  handspring for it if it's required...<br>  <br>  yes you are still be able to do spits and cartwheels.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	That is something you need to discuss with your surgeon or specialist. I would say a good positive attitude and being as physical as your doc allows or is safe will help. Don't be upset if things don't work out for you with cheer leading...more important is health and body and mind. stay positive.
yEhQc16vaa	The weak-side LB is exactly that he'll play the outside LB and he'll be on the weak-side of the defense either the side w/out the tight-end or the side the has no running back shifted towards him if no tight end or the side with the fewest receivers on it.  to the other posters that say the he is relatively unimportant have either never played football or have just watching it.  since he is the one that follows the runn play to the strong and is supposed to stop any and all reverse chances or the running back from cutting back.  on pass plays he could be the one who spies (watches) the faster QBs or he'll also be called on to be a blitzer if your team actually does blitz.|`|S28mZ2Vzaa	A weak side linebacker is usually smaller and faster than the other two linebackers. His job is to contain cut back running backs who come over to the weak side. He will also help out with coverage in the passing game.|`|VM2b7gq8aa	a weakside is where there isnt as much linebackers on the side and bc they sneak up|`|tWUQU4Juaa	It used to be that most teams had offenses that were either right handed or left handed and the side that had their tight end was called the strong side . So the LB who played on that side was the strong side LB . Today's offenses are much more complex and calling someone either weak side or strong side has lost a lot of meaning . The same thing happened with running backs . Instead of halfbacks and fullbacks , they kind of morphed into just running backs .|`|ljRE5MeAaa	A "Weakside" linebacker is a linebacker that lines up to the side of the Offensive Line where there is usually no tight end.<br>  But  with today's offenses, they will usually shift the Tight End to the side of the line where the better linebacker is, or in some cases run a 2 tight end set.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	The weakside is the side without the tightend on offense.  So the weak side linebacker is the linebacker that does not have the tight end lined up in front of him.|`|VckdHm3Qaa	A weakside linebacker is a Left Linebacker(LOLB)<br>  usually they dont see that much action on the field cuz they dont have big assignments on defense<br>  usually they do QB spy or assigned a RB|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	Plays opposite of the tight end, usually smaller and more athletic. Usually who covers running backs and slot receivers during a passing play.|`|S81fac8haa	a weak side line backer is the will linebacker  the linebacker that plays on the side with no tightend

FLKA2fiUaa	First of all, don't listen to half the retards below.<br>  Your height is PERFECT for a flyer, and I base a girl right now that weighs a little over 120.<br>  Trust me, your fine. You'll have 3 girls supporting your weight.<br>  <br>  Second of all, you don't just have to be a flyer in college so don't think thats your only option. There's plenty of all girl squads, and things like that so do not just think this is your only hope.<br>  <br>  Third of all, if you want your coach to start seeing you as a flyer. Start showing your flexibility. Stretch every night and get your splits. Start practicing on getting your balance right for a liberty, or a heelstretch.<br>  <br>  Everything will come into play, just give it a little work.|`|PxtmMAMnaa	im 5′4 and i weigh 120ishh and im a flyer on my varsity team. you could probably be a flyer, it just depends on your skill level, flexibility, and the size of others on your team. being heavier means that you need to stay even tighter to make up for the weight! you need to get over low self esteem to be a flyer though because a lot if it is confidence in what you are doing and if something goes wrong, its usually the flyers fault.|`|ja7kdPIGaa	You sound fine to be a flyer :)<br>  <br>  If you want, maybe see if you can change up stunt groups for a bit and try working with bigger bases. <br>  <br>  I'm a backspot, 5'8 and my flyer is 5'6, 125<br>  :) don't worry|`|jwuZmBrRaa	118 is a lot to hold,<br>  you might be too big .|`|g3nYc4EYaa	um.... you maybe just over the weight line.. you could ask you coach if you could try to be a flyer... but i think that you should just stay as a back-spot. not to be mean but i think that you have to be under 100 pounds....<br>  <br>  i hope that helped!!!|`|2tn8EALqaa	You aren't small enough. Get over it.|`|FN1CjtuQaa	Hey. Trust me. It all depends on the people around you. <br>  If your team is made of girls smaller than you then of course you will be a base or backspot. In middle school  I was kind of bigger than some of the girls [6th & 7th grade] I was a back spot & Entering High School they wanted me to try and be a flyer since the upperclassman were all taller/bigger than me ! But I ended up being a base since still there were smaller girls ! <br>  If you really want to, Your height seems good enough you could try to lose weight. Remeber, if you wnat to cheer in college, EVERY GIRL IS A FLYER !

8bTder08aa	First off, regarding the idiots who say Secretariat carried 140+ pounds during his career:  This is a link to Secretariat's past performance chart, and you can clearly see that Secretariat never carried more than 126 pounds, which is Jockey Club scale weight for age, in any of his races:  <a href="http://www.secretariat.com/past_performance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.secretariat.com/past_performa...</a><br>  <br>  It's rare for a horse running on the flat to be assigned more than 130 pounds even in a handicap race, for the simple reason that if a racing secretary assigns too much weight, the horse's trainer will probably decline to run him.  This isn't just being picky;  a horse that wins under a high impost will be assigned even higher weights, until he loses.<br>  <br>  On the flat, one of the most noteworthy weight assignments was in the 1931 Melbourne Cup.  The great champion Phar Lap had won the race the previous year, and the handicapper assigned him-- and his trainer accepted!-- the unbelievable impost of 150 pounds.  Yes, you read that right:  Phar Lap carried 150 pounds.  In a two-mile race against the best horses Down Under.  Phar Lap tired under this crushing weight and finished 8th, and his connections decided to send him to North America to avoid the high weights he surely would have continued to be assigned had he stayed down under.<br>  <br>  Other high weight assignments for flat-racing horses:<br>  <br>  Man O' War carried and won with 130 pounds five times as a TWO-year old.  At three, he won with 131 pounds in the Miller Stakes, 135 pounds in the Stuyvesant and 138 pounds in the Potomac.  In one of his races, he gave away 32 pounds to the next highest-weighted horse.<br>  <br>  The New York Racing Association has since 1914 offered the Fall Highweight Handicap stakes, in which the conditions of the race require the highest-weighted horse to carry at least 140 pounds.  This race has been won several times by horses shouldering 140 pounds, most recently in 1985 by Mt. Livermore.  The great sprinting filly Ta Wee, Dr. Fager's half-sister, won the Fall Highweight back-to-back in 1969 and 1970, under 130 pounds and 140 pounds respectively.  <a href="http://www.nyra.com/aqueduct/stakes/FallHighweight.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyra.com/aqueduct/stakes/Fall...</a><br>  <br>  Steeplechasers typically carry higher weights in their races.  The Grand National Steeplechase, "grand-daddy" of all major steeplechases, has several times been won by horses carrying 168 pounds-- most recently by the immortal Red Rum, who carried 168 pounds to his second win in the race in 1974.  <a href="http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/racecharts/GrandNational.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/...</a><br>  <br>  Here in America, the Maryland Hunt Cup, a timber race run over very solid, fixed fences, requires horses to carry as much as 165 pounds over 4 miles, jumping solid post-and-rail fences as high as 5 feet.  <a href="http://www.marylandsteeplechasing.com/main/mhc/conditions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marylandsteeplechasing.com/ma...</a><br>  <br>  I believe that there are steeplechase horses that have been required to carry weights as high as 171 pounds, but I can't recall the specifics.|`|7mdbyjVEaa	Well in 1973 i know that Secretariat carried about 140 pounds and thats the most ive ever heard of a horse carrying.|`|zywy6vOGaa	The very first winner of the Melbourne Cup carried 142 pounds and it was Archer, and 1890 winner Carbine carried 145 pounds to win.|`|ioVIAewjaa	one time seabiscuit carried oprah right to austrailia.|`|LbJqU82waa	145 POUNDS!

Companies like Classic Army, and other high grade brands, inspect the product far more closely and in-depth before shipping it to the distributer.  They aren't just mass producing cheaply made guns.<br>  <br>  Next, the gearbox.  The high end guns have gearboxes with complete metal parts.  Which lets you upgrade to your liking for the most part.  For example, take KWA.  They pre-upgrade their gearboxes.  Everything is reinforced, most of the parts are close to the best quality you can get, even after market.  They're also LiPo compatible.  And I guarantee you KWA only sells guns that are in perfect condition when shipped out.  Quality control.<br>  <br>  Last, FPS does not equal quality.  Yeah the JGs might come out shooting 400 with .20s.  Springs are cheap.  Yes, its attractive to put on the gun description ~400 FPS+ and so on.  But the it will create so much extra tension, that the cheaper parts won't be able to handle for an extended amount of time.  Usually, key word here usually, people spending above $200 on a gun will know what they're doing, and will want to upgrade themselves anyway, so the spring strength doesn't matter to much.|`|6f36240af8847ca83ec28b5f2b425b32aa	Don't worry you will get the chance to spend just as much as the people that bought the more expensive guns.  I have had my Classic army for about two years now, I play every weekend, so the gun is well used. I payed about $400 for it. All I had to do to get it shooting 400 fps was to buy a new spring, it set me back a whole $20 with shipping.  since then I have had to replace the spring once.so tack on another $20.  I also have added a new precision barrel another $40.  So far I have spent about $480. <br>  One of my teammates on the other hand got one of the JG P90s, about 6 months ago.  He paid $200, He has had to replace the spring 3 times.  the first time it was the stock spring, it wore out after a month.  he also had to replace the piston, the piston heard, the air nozzle, the spring guide, the gears, the gear box, the battery, the barrel, and the hop up.  In all he has spent over $400 just on replacement parts.  Bringing his total up to over $600.  the funny thing is that mine is still more accurate, has a higher FPS, and ROF.  all around mine is still better, even though he has put more more into his gun.|`|39SZUJj3aa	they are awsome and better than any other

Tjw7bbCeaa	Well yes. It seems the Crusaders haven't found their mojo without Carter and I'm sure some of the players are missing Robbie Deans.<br>  <br>  I went to the blues game and from what I saw they weren't playing as a team. <br>  <br>  For the 7's it seems like we have been struck down by injuries such as Victor Vito. <br>  <br>  There's a chance the Black Caps will pull out a win but we can expect a lot out of India's lineup.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	The Crusaders going down 6-0 is a shock.

kv4ksj1Taa	Your team looks pretty good now...how many teams in your league? That is important to know when trying to judge how good your team looks. The less teams there are, the more talent that will be on each team. So if you are in an 8 team league, your team looks above average. If you are in a 12 team league, your team looks great.
ZCHmhuFQaa	Gordan had 34 points not 27. That was a good game. I wish there are in the playoffs.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They're good,Derrick Rose had 27 points,6 assits,2 steals|`|dcNT65mTaa	I think the addition of Salmons and having him start instead of Deng helps as well. he's much more consistent and gets his numbers quietly  while Gordon and Rose put on a show. I think this team can get up to possibly 6th if they can put a run together. We shall see though|`|HtYGxZcCaa	Im glad they finally have, Ive been waiting for this for a while.

IDK why you ask that but if you are trying to act "hot" to get a guy, please don't. then he'll only be interested in you cuz he'll wanna "do you" if you really want a deep relationship with a guy, just be yourself let him get to know you. then'll he'll care about you. not just your behind.<br>  but then again IDK why you ask that question so....<br>  just in case.|`|bIvZknnbaa	I find lips and hair very sexy, find a hairstyle that compliments you and lick your lips a lot.|`|gaOSUthbaa	In the Football (Soccer) Section?
NG6eeCfuaa	The combine does focus heavily on speed and lifting, yes, however, you'd be surprised at all the other things that they put these athletes through. You have to take the mental faculties test (The wonderlick test I believe it's called. Only a handfull of players have ever gotten all 50 answers correct). They measure the length of your arm from shoulder to finger tip, from elbow to finger tip, to measuring the length of your fingers alone! Vertical leap is measured. You'd run more agility drills during the combine than since your freshmen year two a days. The combine focuses on so many things, it's not just 40 time and bench press. Remember when Jim Drunkenmiller benched more than any other QB had ever benched at the combine. He was out of the league by time I put down my coffee after reading about it.|`|j3iP5iwHaa	depends on what kind of reciever you are.<br>  <br>  speed is important. you should be able to bench 240+<br>  and squat 320+

mr0Hb5fvaa	unfortunately it is hard to be shorter in rowing. if you want to improve your 2k, just set a goal and try to be 1-2 seconds faster each time you test. remember that just because you are shorter, you can't speed up your slide. it will only make your technique go downhill when you are tired (during the test) and hurt your time. don't rely on your arms to do all the work, they are your weakest muscle used in rowing. instead use your legs to push against the foot pad, the same as if you were jumping up (except you are seated) for your age, you are on the right track. just keep working hard!|`|DXP8bTzbaa	Practice, practice, practice! I'm also a 9th grader (guy) and I'm also pretty short (5"10, but comparing to the 6"0-6"8 guys on the team), but I can still compete with them because I erg every day.  Set goals<br>  And work towards them.  Exercise often, eat right, and you'll be there in no time.  For example, I erg'd at least 8k every day over the winter and was able to drop 22 seconds off of my 2k and nearly 50 seconds off of my 6k.  Motivation, determination, perspiration.

1jmXT4Vvaa	Looks like the other poster listed the sites.  To answer your first question, a paintball gun is considered an air gun.  So you must be 16 (in most states) to buy paintballs, co2, or the markers.  It might be a good idea to call the local authorities, because certain jurisdictions might have more strict laws.|`|UN628Af7aa	www.pbnation.com<br>  <br>  www.techpb.com<br>  <br>  www.zephyrpaintball.com<br>  <br>  www.ansgear.com<br>  <br>  www.paintballgateway.com<br>  <br>  www.mcarterbrown.com|`|9Djep77Vaa	The general rule is 16. However, many places won't sell anything to anyone under 18. Just don't act stupid with a bunch of friends when buying things. If you are a minor, then make sure your parents are ok with it (Heck, I was 13 a long time ago and my parents trusted me enough to let me have a paintball gun). However it pans out for you, I hope you are very responsible and safe and above all, have fun!

I think the only instance in which a camera would be an issue, would be if you were sitting courtside (or very close to the court), and you were using a flash, as the flash could distract the players.

rV4uJVWmaa	You dont drag spinnerbaits, you keep them moving, so that blade can spin, which reflects light, and sends ripples through the water to attract your fish. I use them on cloudy days. I wouldnt use one in a river, unless it was a huge river with still water.<br>  <br>  You need you  a crankbait, plasic worm, or rooster tail.<br>  Live bait would do the job to.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	If your fishin' rivers with spinners then the best ta' use would be the Inline type (link). As already mentioned the blades are what gets them fisheee's attention and by draggin' the bottom they loose their whole effect, plus ya' the big headache of snags.

If you want to drag bottom use a Crappie jig I use a sixteenth of an ounce.
rV4uJVWmaa	Nah dude you dont need a leader to fish in a river. That lure wont work either. Too Big. All those blades on it are designed to get still water, stirred up. Rivers are already stirred up. It would be a flook if anything hit it. But to answer your question. At the far right of your picture you see that little loop in the wire? Thats were you tie. You seem new to fishing, so i would deff check into tying lure knots, so nothing takes that nice lure of yours.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Best ta' tie it directly to your main line with either the Palomar and or Clinch knot ;)...<br>  < ' ( (( > <<br>  <br>  Palomar:<br>  <a href="http://animatedknots.com/palomar/index.php?LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&Website=www.animatedknots.com" rel="nofollow">http://animatedknots.com/palomar/index.p...</a><br>  <br>  Clinch (Improved):<br>  <a href="http://animatedknots.com/improvedclinch/index.php?LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&Website=www.animatedknots.com" rel="nofollow">http://animatedknots.com/improvedclinch/...</a><br>  <br>  Note: When I did Largemouth bass usin' a spinnerbait, the Clinch was my preference ie., the Clinch eliminated havin' ta' get the bulk of the spinner bait "safety pin" extension and double blades through the loop of the overhand knot, on the Palomar. Don't get me wrong the Palomar is fine, it's just that over the years I personally have gone with the Clinch on the SB...<br>  <br>  Added: Josh got it right on where your line is tied;)... Sorry but, didn't even give thought that you may be just startin' out??
oMjVp4zGaa	the baits have been covered by the preference enthusiast now lets cover the best way to fish for bass in a river.<br>  always cast upstream always cast upstream. all predators will be lying in ambush facing the current waiting for a certain bite to eat rolls downstream into their view. ( be the bass ) ok so you are facing upstream, and you like being in shade and or both hidden in cover. you always cast past a logical area for a bass to be and let the water present your bait naturally as is rolls or swims by. I use lead heads and swim baits and my trick is to hook the swim bait so it's not (the hook) coming out the back, but off center, out the top of the side. this actually says to the bass almost dying easy meal going by. grubs, worms, lizards, frogs, crawdads All are possible baits of seasonal local forage. I must recommend colors as well: in spring use white, yellow, chartreuse, Motoroil, green, lime, lime yellow. In summer follow the yellow to orange, orange red and brown oranges. In fall I like normal bait colors as the bait has all grown up and taken on their natural coloration. especially shad colors, orange crawdads, green frogs, I will even going into fire-tiger, parrott and purple colors. I also use alot of topwater and poppers, plugs and buzz baits in the fall. The winter gets the blues, purples and magenta going to reds and around the horn and color spectrum back to spring. I cast to places the river will take my bait back into, under, or sink to it a stike zone I anticipate as holding a fish. I love standing on a point where I can cast up onto a high area (shoal) and let the river roll my bait off the shoal and into a deep (pool) area I like doing this off of points and along steap and deep trenches as well. I know every cast has a bite potential ahead so casting has to be precise and true. When the rivers water heats up I will swim bait faster through to summer where I switch over to topwater presentations as the water begins cooling again. Have a great year and don't forget to go get a book about river fishing at your library.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Bass you may think will not take an in-line spinner, but they do. Most bass are caught in rivers, when fished with in-line spinners. If you want a good sized one, try a 1/4 oz. Rooster Tail, in a natural shad color. Those are pretty hot for smallies, and even smaller largemouth's love 'em.<br>  <br>  I also like a variety of soft-plastics, including worms, crayfish, & lizards.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|mLuz6QzGaa	well by me the current isn't that bad so we take chairs and put them in the middle of the river(this is in the summer when water is low) and sit and fish usually with crawfish we caught in our stream. oh this is the Mississippi River and it's in my back yard|`|rV4uJVWmaa	I use rooster tails. 1/8 in size. Fire tiger in color. Cast down stream, pulling your lure against the current about 12 inches deep. Cast around debree, logs, rocks, etc. Good thing about rooster tails, anything will hit them.|`|xApAWlshaa	these are a few sites that will help.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	I use spinners and spoons.  Try to drag up past obstructions or other slower current areas where the big boys tend to hang out.|`|LfOjYX14aa	it all depends on how deep water is, weather, what structure is in water. i use just normal bait like worms or minnows and they work fine. of course cast near spots that are deep and near structure that fish can hide under.|`|BRLSPIZLaa	i use pumpkinseed salamanders with a 4 foot leader and a slide sinker above the swivel find a good spot (best spots ive found is along the wall and around the boat docks) cast just over it let it hit bottom and slowly reel in

I'd go for a pair that's lighter than air, try for the Brooks Mach 10, or the Mizuno Osaka (the Osaka is a bit heavy, but it's really supportive). If your going for mid-distance though, I recommend the Mizuno Wave Kaze 4. If your doing anything on a concrete track though, I don't recommend using spikes. Spikes are good for rubber tracks and for unpaved surfaces. If you're going to run primarily on paved surfaces and concrete tracks, then go for some racing flats. Mizuno is the best for support, Brooks is the best in shock absorption, and Asics is the best for weight. Personally I do the 400 in the Brooks T6 Racer, it's a good shoe and you may want to give it a try, (I've seen people doing the 100 in them too, they're versitle flats). Good luck with track and I hope that this answered your question. (oh and for websites, try www.mizunousa.com , www.brooksrunning.com , and, www.asicsamerica.com )|`|hZ9m6ekEaa	try the asics site :D
HgBvRwjraa	Prolly not live.
FLKA2fiUaa	Make sure you are warmed up. Without this you could harm yourself. This can be done by doing a seated pike, or a standing one. <br>  <br>  <br>  Reach forward,holding on to your toes. Hold for a slow count of 20 seconds minimum. It may hurt, but just bear through the pain as it will drastically increase your hamstring flexibility. You will find that after repeating this stretch several times, you are able to easily touch your nose to your knees whilst in a seated or standing pike. <br>  <br>  Continue stretching by standing with your feet together. Reach down and try to touch your toes. Do not bend your knees at all (you may not be able to touch your toes... it’s alright). Bring your body down to your leg. <br>  Rounding your back so that your hands are closer does not help your stretch, so try to keep a straight back and bring your abdomen closer to your feet. <br>  Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Reach over your legs towards your toes. Once again it is important to keep a straight back and get your chest and not your arms closer to your legs. <br>  Hold your right foot and bring it up to your mouth and hold it there for 30 seconds. Then do the same with the left. Do not actually touch it to your mouth. <br>  Repeat the last step, except this time bend one leg behind you in order to stretch the other. Do this with both legs. <br>  Stretch your Sartorius muscle. This is the muscle, in a split, that you feel in your back leg between your leg and body. One tip on how to stretch it, is to sit in the butterfly position. Your feet should be together, and toes can be pointed. Then, slowly, try to push your knees down to the floor. You should feel the burn right near your 'buttocks'. Hold it for a count of a slow minimum of thirty seconds. <br>  To do this you have to kneel down, put your hands on the ground, and then straighten out your back leg. You may put your knee on the ground but remember that if you do this then you have to try to bring your crotch closer to the ground. This stretch will need to be held a lot longer than most (1-2 minutes on each side) <br>  Standing with your legs in an "A" position, reach your arm over your head towards the opposite leg. <br>  Sit in a straddle on the ground and reach out in front of you, trying to get your chest and stomach as close as you can to the floor. <br>  bring one arm over your head and towards your leg,while sitting in a straddle, keeping your body sideways to your leg. Do this on both sides. <br>  Sit in butterfly position (like Indian style but with your feet together). Press down your knees to the ground with your elbows or your hands. Press your abdomen closer to your feet. <br>  If you have an extremely flexible body, put one foot behind your head and lean back, pressing your leg into the floor. Have a friend push on your streched leg to make it easier. ONLY TRY THIS IF YOU ARE VERY ADVANCED. <br>  Once you can do the splits in every direction, you can stretch farther past the split line. This is important for advanced dancers, gymnasts, and cheerleaders, but should only be worked on if you can already do the splits well: <br>  Use an 8-inch mat. Put your front heel on the edge of the mat. Stretch through the splits and hold for 100 counts. It also helps to have someone nice press down on your shoulders as you do this, so you can stretch even farther. <br>  Kneel with your back knee bent up against a wall or mat and your front foot on the floor, knee bent. Stretch through the splits and press down then release, down, release, for 20 counts each. <br>  Make sure you don't try to bounce to reach your toes. That can BE DANGEROUS! <br>  If you cant do it in less than 2-3 weeks dont give up keep trying. <br>  Repeat these steps daily, or at least every other day.|`|7ZsD0Irtaa	u stretch ur legs it takes a long time

sCHUFUXsaa	a good mvp doesnt just have good numbers<br>  but still lead the team. a good team leader.<br>  <br>  kobe has good numbers and still the lakers are no.1<br>  and look at this, kobe could have like the same numbers as dwade if kobe plays all of his 4th quarters..<br>  <br>  he didnt play most of his 4th quarters so he has less minutes<br>  <br>  lebron and kobe are definitely will get it..<br>  well one of them..they are in a tight race right now|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Wade.  <br>  <br>  Kobe has Pau Gasol and his team can win most games without him.<br>  <br>  LeBron's team can do the same thing.<br>  <br>  Wade's team cannot win without him.  Also, his team is young, which is all the more remarkable.  Most people said that his team wouldn't even make the playoffs this year, and it looks like they WILL be playoff bound.  <br>  <br>  Also, look how Boston completely stopped LeBron WITHOUT KG and GLEN DAVIS.  As good as LeBron is, he mainly relies on his strength to power over opposing players...just like Shaq did.  Notice that when Shaq stopped relying only on strength to dominate opponents and began learning to shoot free throws, began learning to shoot quickly and at better angles rather than only power dunking his point totals increased--especially since he lost weight.  <br>  <br>  LeBron is similiar.  His strength lets him run over and through opponents while Wade, Kobe, Iverson (in his prime), Chris Paul and others had to work on their speed, agility, twisting layups to get most of their baskets.  That's what makes these players more remarkable in my opinion.  LeBron can be shut down when his shooting is off or when his path to the basket is cut off by players who are stronger than him.  That's not to say that he will be completely cut off, but he will be limited to All Star status rather than superstar status.  The Knicks, Boston and other teams realized this and have done it.  <br>  <br>  Wade just isn't on a good team.  But he has carried his team high as opposed to Kobe, who tried to carry his team without any stars or good players and failed.  Kobe is very good as well, but I think Wade connects with the players around him much better.  His willingness to pass, block shots and steal, in my opinion, places him above Kobe in certain respects.  Both score easily and differently but as an all-around player who should win MVP, Wade should win easily.|`|Ga11Abmzaa	Wade|`|qtwYHyH5aa	WADE|`|qqt6caPyaa	coaches love to dick ride kobe so i wudnt be surprised if he wins it. but i think lebron should win it besides the stats is better ten erybody in the league overall. hes team is competen for number one. even if he dont win 1st place he should get it..his team isnt as good as the lakers but still competen..plus his team is dealing wit injuries throughout the season.lakers barely have besides bynum.lebron is playing better d and erythin else|`|Aj4nKWVXaa	wade is on fire but he is much too late to kepp up with lebron and kobe.<br>  <br>  Both lebron and kobe have led their teams to top records. if they were to judge the mvp by how good they were late in the season then wade or lebron would win.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surley it will be King James that wins it.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	LEBRON EASILY|`|ks54akugaa	MVP= BEST PLAYER ON THE BEST TEAM<br>  AS OF RIGHT NOW, KOBE|`|gaOSUthbaa	The better player|`|8PRZpfSMaa	I go for Kobe Bryant he is a better player than Lebron|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	wade most likely|`|Or43gwRjaa	The league is going broke so they are going to give it to the guy that sells the most jerseys.

They are still a good team but with the coaching and personnel changes, it may take them a season or two to adjust.<br>  <br>  My surprise team is the 49ers. If they can get a good quarterback in place, Singletary seems to have the drive to create a very good team. Their defense itself has improve 3 fold over the last few seasons.

AA10504968	Bette Davis was a legendary actress from the 1930's to 1960's.  She had the most incredible blue eyes.  If someone said that about you, then you are something special.  Take that as a big compliment.|`|skgN9TJLaa	Ruth Elizabeth "Bette" Davis (April 5, 1908 – October 6, 1989) was an American actress of film, television and theatre. Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters, she was highly regarded for her performances in a range of film genres; from contemporary crime melodramas to historical and period films and occasional comedies, though her greatest successes were her roles in romantic dramas.<br>  <br>  After appearing in Broadway plays, Davis moved to Hollywood in 1930, but her early films for Universal Studios were unsuccessful. She joined Warner Bros. in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances. In 1937, she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style. Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and her confrontations with studio executives, film directors and costars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style and ubiquitous cigarette contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and satirized.<br>  <br>  Davis was the co-founder of the Hollywood Canteen, and was the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. She was the first actress to receive 10 Academy Award nominations and the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and thrice divorced, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from breast cancer, with more than 100 film, television and theater roles to her credit. In 1999, Davis was placed second, behind Katharine Hepburn, on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female stars of all time.<br>  <br>  I'd take it as a compliment she was beutiful with gorgoues eyes.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	WHY IN BASKETBALL CATEGORY?|`|EgLdNAusaa	Is this a basketball Question?

jSkHquK5aa	To become a better soccer player you need to develop your skills every day. However, you also need to know how to avoid making unnecessary mistakes while playing soccer. In this article I will present some common mistakes that you should try to avoid while participating in your regular soccer games.<br>  <br>  Many professional soccer players tend to put themselves in difficult situations and you probably wonder why. Well, usually these players become too comfortable with their way of playing. For example, a full back that have played well during the whole game probably have his mind on some other place (if you consider that his team is having a 3-0 score with 5 min left of the game). <br>  <br>  However, if he misses to mark an opponent and that opponent manage to score 3-1 then the opponents may have an advantage in the return game. This one is a simple example on how the brain of a soccer player actually works. Now, let’s take a look at common mistakes you can’t afford if you want to become a better soccer player;<br>  <br>  Dribbling as the last man - This one is pretty obvious. Simply, never dribble while playing as the last man. If you lose the ball to one of your opponents you can be pretty sure that he will beat your goalkeeper and score. Instead, try to always play the ball simple and choose safe passing alternatives. If you feel that you don’t have anyone to pass the ball to, then kick it far away from you with a powerful cross.<br>  <br>  Clear the ball safely - Try always to clear the ball far away as possible. I always prefer to kick the ball at least 40 yards away from my goal in order to have enough time to organize my defense and prepare for the upcoming attack.<br>  <br>  Play the ball safely - Always try to pass the ball safely to a near standing teammate. With safely I mean that you should not try to execute some 40 yard crosses if you have at least two non marked teammates near you. That 40 yard cross will be lost in 99% of the case and your teammates will blame you for playing the ball without reflecting over the situation properly. <br>  <br>  Don’t keep the ball too long at your feet - While playing soccer, you can’t expect that your opponents will let your receive the ball, gain control over it and then pass the ball safely to an teammate without having them attacking you. Simply, the faster you play the ball, the easier you will have to perform maximum on the soccer field. One rule you should have is to always play the ball on the first touch while being on your own side of the field.<br>  <br>  Summary Things mentioned in this article are only few things among many others that you need to know in order to become a better soccer player and avoid mistakes in soccer. However, if you stick to things mentioned here I can ensure you that your mistakes on the field will decrease greatly.|`|c4GykfVkaa	practice and work veeeery hard. then you'll achieve everything|`|09SjyOHkaa	i must have answered at least 50 of this same question...<br>  <br>  PRACTICE|`|ksya426Uaa	practice practice practice :)<br>   *said with an english accent just like David Beckham :)|`|pJmNhH15aa	you practice.<br>  run some more with a soccer ball its helps you with your dribbling..|`|esPAi8Dfaa	practice makes perfectoooo!!! :D|`|OO6eUiSpaa	practice Son practice!!<br>  <br>  Watch video's on yourtube of professionals and watch their moves, you can pick up alot.|`|vjiQLaaQaa	practice definitely. but also train. it helps build up strength so that your practice can really pay off!|`|OHAVzQNCaa	...practicing.

HP75NEbNaa	This is party true, but remember it's not always true. Sometimes good teams do good and bad teams do bad.<br>  <br>  But for the most parts, less-talented teams trade away veterans and try to acquire young stars. Good teams on the other hand, play their second-string and AAA prospects to see how good they are because those teams already know the talent of their players. In summary, the players playing for bad teams in spring training will most likely be the regular players on the team's regular season roster and good teams' spring training players will be second-string and in the minor leagues.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Agreed, for the simple fact that its somewhat of a try-out period for some of the top prospective players that are battling for a roster spot.  <br>  Spring Training can be considered a conditioning period for the veterans and probable starters.   Similar to pre-season football where you see the starters play the first quarter ONLY, the top players play like 2, mabye 3 innings- easing into it without a care about who wins the game.<br>  Usually, the game is determined in the first 3 innings and the scrubs come in a settle the score.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	That isn't always true. A spring training record does not indicate how a team will do in the regular season. Sometimes the players of the ML team don't play in the games. Some teams paly their ML players all the time and others don't. There might be some experimenting. I've watched spring training games in person and it can feel like you're actually watching three or four games instead of one game.|`|0XTSsephaa	Not sure if your assessment of bad teams being good and good teams being bad is true of not, but if it is I'd guess this.<br>  <br>  Bad teams have more players competing for spots on the team than good teams, therefor bad teams have more players that are playing harder than good teams.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	BECAUSE BAD TEAMS TRY TO GIVE THEMSELVES HOPE AND GOOD TEAMS REALIZE THAT PEAKING AT END OF YEAR IS VITAL AND NOT IN PRESEASON EXAMPLE??? LAST YEAR, IN PRESEASON. LIONS WENT 4-0 IN PRESEASON AND THEN????????????? THOSE BUMS WENT 0-16 WHEN IT COUNTED!! HA!!!!!!!! HA!!! RAIDERS IN FOOTBALL DO IT ALL THE TIME! GO 4-1 IN PRESEASON AND THEN LOSE 12!!|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	Because good teams don't want to risk injuring their good players during preseason. That's why the Yankees for example only play their Major League players for no more than 3-5 innings. Also, usually pitchers are usually on like 30-50 pitch counts. Also, since good teams have GOOD players, they wanna give minor leaguers a chance to see Major League pitching and look to see if any are of Major League caliber for the real season. So, bad teams usually have mainly bad players and so these players need more time to warm up for the season since they aren't that good. Just look at any bad team and any good team. Good team will hav e 3-5 of their actual MLB players playing only 3-5 innings and bad teams have 5-9 of their MLB players playing from 4-8 innings.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	I know what you mean. It certainly seems that way. But it's probably because the good teams are less interested in winning in the spring as they are in experimenting. They'll try different lineups, play small ball more often or less often, change the order of the pitching staff. . .stuff like that. Last Ichiro had a bad spring and everyone was asking if he'd lost it. He was using spring training to try out different things and when the season began he was, well, obviously not washed up.
