My skin developed reddish, raised, bumpy patches.  As time when on, it got worse and itched like crazy.  I had to take antihistamines and soak my skin in cool fresh water with no soap.  I was having a reaction to biological washing powder.  By the next day it was gone and i switched to a regular soap powder.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what your meds are for, but if it's not a life threatening condition, If I were you I would stop taking my medication and see the doctor as soon as possible to get checked out.  Oh and DON'T take antihistamines until you've been advised by your doctor, they may affect your current meds.

Your lifestyle will have an affect on your thyroid to a greater or lesser extent. The one certain symptom would be swelling in the throat.

It is variously quoted as an average of three measurements: just below the glans penis, in the middle of the shaft, and at the base<br>  A study published in the September 1996 Journal of Urology concluded that average erect length was 12.9 cm (5.08 in) (measured by staff). The purpose of the study was to “provide guidelines of penile length and circumference to assist in counseling patients considering penile augmentation.” Erection was pharmacologically induced in 80 physically normal American men (varying ethnicity, average age 54). It was concluded: “Neither patient age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length.”<br>  A study published in the December 2000 International Journal of Impotence Research found that average erect penis length was 13.6 cm (5.35 in) (measured by staff).Quote: "The aim of this prospective study was to identify clinical and engineering parameters of the flaccid penis for prediction of penile size during erection." Erection was pharmacologically induced in 50 Jewish Caucasian patients who had been evaluated for Erectile dysfunction (average age 47±14y). Patients with penis abnormalities or whose ED could be attributed to more than one psychological origin were omitted from the study.<br>  A study conducted by LifeStyles Condoms found an average of 14.9 cm (5.9 in) with a standard deviation of 2.1 cm (0.8 in) (measured by staff).[7] The purpose of this study was to ensure properly sized condoms were available. 401 college students volunteered to be measured during 2001 Spring Break in Cancún, Mexico, of which 300 gained an erection to be clinically measured (without pharmacological aid).

b6xj91RQaa	Il mio consiglio è che la cazzata la stai facendo sempre!<br>  Mangi malissimo, mangi troppo poco. Cosa stò per suggerirti, non è una dieta per perdere peso. <br>  Perdere peso velocemente e repentinamente non fà bene, anzi è dannoso per vari organi.<br>  1) Per il fegato, perchè al suo interno ci stanno tutti i nutrimenti immagazzinati. C'è dallo zucchero per breve consumo, fino alle proteine. Per un pò di tempo stanno lì però se in un secondo momento non vengono utilizzate, l'organismo fà in modo che si trasformino in grasso, perciò se te con una dieta drastica e non sana metti a rischio di sconvolgere  tutto questo equilibrio.<br>  2) Ai reni se modifichi il naturale ricambio dei liquidi, rischi di far troppa pipì, oppure rischi di non farne. In poche parole rischi la gotta; che è una malattia del metabolismo, è simile al diabete. Con la gotta tutto l'acido urico finisce nel sangue perchè i reni non funzionano più, il collo ti cresce e ti viene paragonabile a quello di un bue.<br>  3) La pelle si rovina; se dimagrisci molto velocemente, possono venirti le smagliature. Ti succede proprio come ad una donna che partorisce, dopo quasi sempre viene le smagliature sulla pancia.<br>  Quindi ti scrivo un modo di mangiare, non è per perdere ma è per normalizzare il peso. I miei sono consigli, magari uguali per tutti, ma non dico diete con pane pesato. Io dico circa lo stesso per tutti, perchè tutti sbagliano la maniera di mangiare; un pò per la fretta, un pò per la disattenzione e forse un pò per ignoranza in materia.<br>  Prova a mangiare: verdure prima di pranzo e cena, mangia anche la frutta ma come spuntini. Di verdura prediligi le verdure in foglia, tipo: insalata, carciofi, spinaci, eccetera........<br>  Ti aiuteranno a snellire, poi abbinaci delle belle camminate oppure qualche nuotata e il gioco è fatto.<br>  Questo schema lo seguo anche io, gli allenamenti li faccio a ciclo di giorni alterni, cioè: lun-mer-ven-dom-mar-gio-sab e poi ricomincio! Allenandomi così ho risolto il problema del superallenamento.Poi per il bere: Circa 2 litri, di quello che vuoi, però non aranciata che è piena di zuccheri e ha calorie inutili. Perciò l'acqua resta la migliore bevanda, è la più economica e anche la più sana. E importante per la colazione, non c'è un alimento principe. Io la faccio in maniera quasi classica: una mela, uno yogurt bianco, caffelatte con biscotti Plasmon (che sono i più proteici in assoluto che puoi trovare un pò in tutti i negozi) e un bicchiere di succo all'ananas.<br>  Ma per un risultato migliore, dovresti praticare assiduamente un pò di sport, il nuoto è ottimo. Cioè nuotando muovi contemporaneamente tutti, ma proprio tutti i muscoli del corpo. Muovendoti in quel modo, stimoli tutte le parti del corpo, quindi vai ad eccitare pure i punti dove si è formato uno strato adiposo. Poi un qualsiasi sport và bene, anche jogging, bicicletta, corsa o camminata. Fai 4 allenamenti di almeno 45 minuti l'uno ogni settimana, ricordati che un giorno in piscina è un solo allenamento. Se il giorno dopo non hai voglia di nuotare,  vai a correre e vale per il secondo allenamento. Non 4 allenamenti per ogni sport, puoi alternare, almeno li fai con più passione!<br>  Le verdure in foglia hanno fibre, poi le foglie aiutano a ripulire l'intestino. Invece la frutta, ha si fibre buone per te ma, ha anche tanti zuccheri, non mangiare più di due-tre frutti al giorno.<br>  Poi mangia in modo normale, è meglio per tutti, per chi cucina, per te che non ti stressi con se ghe mentali. <br>  Ricordalo che un pò di sport è importante, perchè se fai una dieta lo sport è fondamentale. Se dovessi seguire solo la dieta e non fai niente, avrai solo risultati penosi; tipo l'effetto "gelatina di frutta".<br>  Risulterai con un fisico non tonico, avrai la faccia grassa e nessuno più ti guarderà.<br>  Ricordati anche che la frutta in eccesso, causa lo squilibrio del metabolismo. Cioè troppi zuccheri posso causarti il diabete, poi quello te lo tieni.<br>  E cosa ti ho detto non è per un sesso specifico, lo può fare sia lei che lui.<br>  A dimenticavo bevi da 1,5 litri 2 di acqua tutti i giorni.<br>  Cosa importante: la verdura che consiglio di mangiare, è solo come aperitivo e non come solo pasto.|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	ma guarda che così non dimagrisci<br>  se non mangi non sparisce il grasso ma il muscolo<br>  se mangi ancora meno muori....<br>  se vuoi perdere peso devi avere pazienza e mangiare bene non meno<br>  devi mangiare a metà mattino e metà pomeriggio un frutto o uno yogurt così tieni il metabolismo attivo<br>  bevi tanta acqua<br>  mangia verdura possibilmente lessata<br>  evita i dolci i condimenti e i salumi<br>  va bene la pasta il riso la carne il pesce i legumi<br>  evita di metterci troppi condimenti e fatti una tabella<br>  ad es. la carne una volta a setimana, il pesce due il pollo due la pasta due etc..<br>  e fai movimento , cammina, fatti un a passeggiata la sera|`|AH4jJyCdaa	Con calma..Mi sa che tu più di seguire un'alimentazione controllata pasticci abbastanza..Quindi ti consiglio di affidarti a un buon dietologo che valuti il tuo peso-altezza e stato di salute e ti dia uno schema corretto e vario.Arriviamo ad oggi:non hai fatto colazione e per una volta passi e hai subito pranzato:però se ti è venuto un attacco di fame significa che solitamente mangi davvero troppo poco per il tuo organismo..In ogni caso hai preso il pollo che senza pelle ha 110 kcal ogni 100 g + il panino al prosciutto (considerando che il pane arabo non è un pane consito ed è abbastanza leggero perchè ha poca mollica) avrai preso circa 250 kcal + gli altri 2 panini vuoti altre 350 kcal. Quindi in totale circa.....710 kcal.Il problema è che ti manca totalmente la frutta e la verdura.Per rientrare in una dieta ipocalorica da circa 1200 kcal ne devi consumare ancora circa 500.Quindi stasera mangia una porzione piccola di pasta (60 g) più la verdura .Hai detto che non puoi fare movimento perchè studi:ma una pausa la farai no?Quindi esci e fatti una passeggiata anche di 20 m o accendi la musica e balla così ti scarichi e bruci lo stesso!|`|at2SKXAZaa	concordo con Pastura.

cNDTDVm8aa	you probably have a corneal abrasion. I had one of those and it was very nasty. Id go see a doctor before it starts bulging and becomes swelled.

glZlmkCsaa	Sonicare is great for use around braces! Any type of electric toothbrush will work wonders for plaque control. The bristles may wear out quicker because you are brushing around a lot of sharp appliances, but they definitely work better than manual toothbrushes. Do keep in mind to not be too rough when brushing to avoid popping off brackets. Sonicare is so subtle, you shouldn't have any problems. We recommend them for patients in braces all the time!

zLBWZRKnaa	The same medication dispensed to men as Viagra is being researched in the US for use with women.  So far, the research has shown that Viagra helps women whose otherwise normal sex drives are temporarily and artificially decreased as a side effect of treatment by Selective Seretonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).  Research results have so far been inconclusive as to Viagra's effectiveness on women with isolated hypoactive desire.|`|PrymSbQwaa	It's called "romance"<br>  <br>  The female sexual response is much more mental.

b36dff2830b01401f63d011b8b7d4148aa	First of all, most doctor's offices are not equipped to test blood. They usually give you a prescription to take to a Lab to have your blood drawn. You just have to look at the labwork to see what was ordered.<br>  <br>  If the doctor thinks you are at risk for HIV and thinks you should be tested, he will have to discuss this with you. In fact, many doctors have patient's sign a consent form--authorizing testing of HIV/AIDS.<br>  <br>  HIV/AIDS is a very sensitive disease. For that reason, doctor's take every pre-caution when ordering this test. They will ask detailed questions.<br>  <br>  I had a horrible infection and was in the hospital. My doctor wanted to do an HIV test. He spent about 10 mins explaining why he felt it needed to be ordered. I signed a consent form stating that I had been informed  thoroughly why the test was being ordered.<br>  |`|gSo4dR7oaa	No. It is against the law for someone to test you for HIV without your written consent. You would need to request the test and sign the consent form. |`|VYS8OHGcaa	I would think you'd have to ask.  Did you have any blood taken?  <br>  |`|kJHH8zthaa	No. First of all they need to draw blood.<br>  The way usually goes; on your physical you can get a request toward the lab what type of labwork they need to do, like cholesterol, glucose, liver function etc. The lab wont test for others than listed on your doctor's request.|`|5ylMZR1Qaa	No you have to give legal consent. They will not test without your consent. Its a good thing to get a routine HIV test especially if you are sexually active. Every 6 months.

iMoTw1wIaa	Although I sadly can not suggested a free dentist unless you are receiving welfare of some form, I can suggest a cheaper way to get dental work done. Aside from going to Mexico where you really can get amazing work done for half the cost, what I would suggest is you look up the local dental schools in your area. I know that might sound really scary but believe me, it isn't. They are not first year students that do any major procedures and there is ALWAYS a teacher who is a dentist right there just incase. I have had friends that have gone to the colleges to get dental work done and saved thousands doing it that way. It is a longer wait though, you can not just go for a walk in appointment. What might be a good idea as well is to look into some of the dentists in your area that offer payment plans and seeing if you can get something that way. A lot of them don't even require that you have good credit. Aside from that, I would strongly suggest you do go and get some private insurance of some type as soon as you can afford it. Some of them are very inexpensive for people under 25, it can just be hard to find. I am sure you are feeling as though this is an up hill battle and believe me, the idea of a young girl having her teeth fall out because of a calcium problem is not something anyone should see as a minor problem... the other thing you can do is contact social services in your area and talk to them. Because you are a single mother and under 25 there are TONS of programs out there to help you that you might not be aware of, and it never hurts to ask. Call them. Tell them the problem. Instead of saying you are scared your teeth are going to fall out though, say you are in horrible pain and can not sleep or eat. Do not make it sound like a cosmetic issue, because its not. If your teeth fall out you will be in the worst pain you could imagine and you should not have to deal with that alone. You work and pay taxes and that is the point of these programs. Good luck and I hope you find some help out there. I also found a link to a group in your area that has low cost dental service for low income families. If nothing else, they might be able to point you in the right direction.|`|ffpdB1tzaa	Can't add too much more except to add amen to what Annastajia had said.  When you call around to the governmental places (you can also try your city's health department) act like you are DYING from the pain.  You can even call a dental school and do that, and they might move your appointments up more quickly.
ivH8tRtsaa	Ear infection. You need to get a doctor to prescribe an antibiotic called amoxicillin. Very common, very treatable. Go see your doctor. Left to it's on devices an ear infection can lead to more serious problems, even causing deafness in the infected ear. Any clinic should be able to fix you up. I used to have ear infections on a regular basis when I was younger. The doctors told me to rinse my ears out with alcohol every time I went swimming or bathed. Since the first drop of alcohol entered my ears, I have never had another ear infection. That was twenty years ago. But, I am not a doctor. You need to go see one.

a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	Your Hymen is very delicate. It is possible to break it by falling , or even riding a bike.|`|MeOOUhHkaa	Riding a horse, bike riding, falling, doing stretches, gymnastics... The list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  It sounds like it actually. If you really want to know, then you can kind of feel it at the opening. I know it's nasty, but if you really want to know the answer, if you feel something stretchy that hurts a bit when you push on it, then you still have your hymen. You can feel it if you have ever inserted a tampon at the wrong angle and pushed on it.<br>  <br>  Isn't a big deal to have lost it. Many people have broken theirs on accident.|`|dkMceLYhaa	omg lol your story was interesting lmfao!!! 13 year olds thinks sooo differently. Anyway go to the doctor.|`|AFXE4cmxaa	lmfaooo . i could't even read the whole thing without laffing . iit sounds painful tho . tell ur mom and then go to the doctor .|`|syVPYmXWaa	lmaoo<br>  well if blood came out then you maybe did but other things that people say break your hymen are tampons or if you ride horses |`|b5kw4znQaa	haaahhhahaha|`|BF4xMoLpaa	ha. okay well you might have, but it depends if you started bleeding. and even if you did it could have been from a cut. 'popping your cherry' means that you tore your hymen from stretching and you can do that from horseback riding or gymnastics, etc...|`|0212cda3531558b21ee35f899e14eebfaa	it depends if you popped ur cherry.. did u bleed? if not then no you didnt pop it. others ways to break it is by playing sports, horseback riding, using a tampon, riding a bike. |`|S6MJmz58aa	No|`|3UoBWOqaaa	i lol'd...no u didnt..enuff said|`|BdVu1nw2aa	It's possible but you know some women don't actually have a hymen, they simply aren't born with one. Did you notice any blood down there at all? If you broke your hymen it would likely have bled, only a little bit though. Not sure how well you knew your bits before this happened but do things look any different down there?! <br>  <br>  Basically, hymen or not, you can consider yourself a virgin with an unpopped cherry until you have sex for the first time. Which, as an old woman of 29 I sincerely hope won't be until you are older, wiser, love and look after yourself well, have finished school and have dreams and goals for your life to work towards. Men are a beautiful but potentially terrible distraction! xx|`|Qf1NST8Uaa	Just out of curiosity... are you 13 years old today, or are you 14 years old like you were the day before yesterday?<br>  <br>  And if you're really just a depressed and wannabee-fashionable pseudoEmo who want to cut herself, what on earth could possibly make you care even one *whit* about the state of your hymen?<br>  <br>  That doesn't even consider the fact that you'd have to dislocate and almost completely destroy an entire ankle joint (and most likely wreck a couple of small bones and need several surgeries to fix it all) in order to get your own big toe into position to rupture your hymen in the first place.<br>  <br>  The moral of this story is: "Don't tell lies about how your bodily injuries happened (if they ever happened at all) before you know human musculoskeletal anatomy pretty damned intimately, because your lies will not stand up to examination, just like your worldview doesn't."
sIClzijCaa	ciao^^<br>  allora...ti dico tutto ciò che so!!!Il<br>   gothic non è una setta, né un culto!<br>  E un modo di vivere. Tutto quello che è buio, nero, tenebroso, è apparentato al carattere gotico.<br>  Il goth è di nero vestito, tuttavia si può essere goth e non vestirsi di nero: è uno stato spirituale.<br>  I cimiteri sono luoghi favoriti dei goths, senza per tanto fare della morte un'adorazione.<br>  Non ne hanno paura, tutto qui. Si ritrova il gotico nella musica, la letteratura, nell' abbigliamento. L'originalità e la creatività sono delle caratteristiche del goth: nelle  poesie, pitture, scritti, abigliamento...amano creare e provocare.<br>  Una precisione è da notare: il gotismo non è satanismo<br>  ma si rifà a uno stile artistico e periodo storico che si può inserire nel periodo vittoriano a cui si ispirano molti dei capi che indossate!!Tipicamente, le caratteristiche della moda gotica consistono in un uso massiccio del colore nero con dettagli argentati ma questo schema può variare. In linea di massima si ha l'uso di un trucco marcato, principalmente nero, anche se possono essere utilizzati altri colori solitamente rosso, viola ecc come scarpe usate borchie, stivali pesanti con talvolta inserti in metallo (come quelli New Rock, considerati la marca di stivali gotici per eccellenza) oppure gli ancora più classici pikes (stivaletti a punta di pelle o velluto con le fibbie laterali), gonne stratificate con dettagli in pizzo, pantaloni o jeans neri molto aderenti e rigidi, mantelli, giubbini di pelle, spesso decorati con scritte o spillette, cappotti molto lunghi e calze a rete. Sono inoltre comuni piercing e tatuaggi, anche se inseriti nella moda gotica a partire dalla metà degli anni '90. I capelli vengono spesso tinti; dal nero come colore di base, aggiungendo blu, viola o rosa talvolta. Non c'è molta differenza tra la moda gotica femminile e quella maschile; ad esempio non è molto comune trovare un uomo o ragazzo goth che veste una gonna vittoriana, ma non è raro vederlo con kilt o gonne corte, magari abbinate a dei pantaloni. Inoltre il trucco è usato da entrambi i sessi ed un paio di calze a rete può essere usato da un uomo tagliando alcune parti e facendone una sorta di maglietta.<br>  Una caratteristica molto importante di questo tipo di moda è la produzione artigianali dei vestiti, o la loro produzione e diffuzione su piccola e media scala, con il forte uso della personalizzazione, dato che la sottocultura gotica si oppone alle convenzioni su come un goth dovrebbe vestire. Anche se possono essere identificati temi ricorrenti, si possono osservare dei capi molto diversi e unici nel loro genere . Tra questi estremi, si può osservare di tutto; dal moderno, al classico, da abiti con un taglio conservatore, tipici del periodo vittoriano, a capi logori e intenzionalmente sofferti. La natura dell'evento infatti in genere detta la scelta dell'abbigliamento, anche se in genere l'espressione di uno stile personale è più importante; infatti non è così raro per un goth vestirsi in modo formale o elaborato e scegliere gli accessori con cura senza una ragione ben precisa, ad esempio per andare a comprare qualcosa.<br>  Esistono somiglianze con altri tipi di moda, correlata a movimenti analoghi, sia musicalmente che antropologicamente. Può essere quindi difficile per un occhio esterno, distinguere le varie sottoculture a cui appartiene un individuo valutandolo mediante l'abbigliamento.<br>  Ovviamente tutto ciò tende a variare data la semplicità di base dello stile ed è spesso combinato con elementi provenienti da altre subculture; si creano inoltre dei sottogeneri all'interno che anche se hanno dei punti in comune, sono connotati da molte differenze. Gli stessi sotto-stili non sono da intendersi come regole severe; la quasi totalità dei goth infatti tende ad unirli, utilizzando dettagli di molti sottogeneri, senza contare i riferimenti alle subculture diverse da quella goth.<br>  cmq tra goth e dark esistono delle differenze!<br>  io personalmente se decidessi di vere questo stile prenderei uno stile goth romantici mi piace davvero moltissimo^^o anche vampire goth!!!<br>  <br>  io so tutto questo^^ spero sia sufficiente!!<br>  ma ti hanno criticato pe ril tuo stile?? vabbhè la gente non capisce niente ognuno è libero di esprimere ciò che è e non capisco come pensino io personalmente ho amiche emo ,dark e goth e andianmo tutte daccordo ci rispettiamo e anzi ti devo dire è bellismo così perchè si ci confronta e ci si arricchisce!!<br>  cmq comlimenti adoro il goth stile!!|`|sUy17rvjaa	E un modo di vivere.

Dall'?le-de-France le novità si diffusero con modi e tempi diversi in Inghilterra, Germania, Spagna, Italia, Austria, Boemia, Ungheria, Scandinavia, Polonia, Transilvania, Moldavia, diversificandosi ed adattandosi ad un grande numero di committenze e scopi diversi. Per esempio in Spagna e in Inghilterra il gotico segna la nascita delle monarchie nazionali, mentre in altre zone è espressione dei poteri feudali, o ancora dei liberi comuni dominati dalla nuova borghesia urbana. In epoca gotica fu stretto il rapporto dell'arte con la religione, ma fu anche il periodo nel quale rinacque l'arte laica e profana. Se in alcuni ambiti si cercarono espressivi effetti antinaturalistici, in altre (come nella rinata scultura) si assistette al recupero dello studio del corpo umano e degli altri elementi quotidiani.A causa della sua provenienza francese, in età medievale l'architettura gotica era chiamata opus francigenum. A Venezia, invece, venne conosciuta come modo di costruire "alla todesca". Il termine "gotico", in senso dispregiativo, fu invece coniato da Giorgio Vasari nel XVI secolo come sinonimo di nordico, barbarico, capriccioso, contrapposto alla ripresa del linguaggio classico greco-romano del Rinascimento.<br>  <br>  La perdita della connotazione negativa del termine risale alla seconda metà del Settecento, quando prima in Inghilterra e Germania, si ebbe una rivalutazione di questo periodo della storia dell'arte che si tradusse anche in un vero e proprio revival (il Neogotico), che attecchì gradualmente anche in Francia e poi in Italia.|`|wfjmVKxoaa	è fantasticooooooooù<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmyYBxGLyGAmJveDXdK4asvwDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080815133342AARt7Uk">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  vi pregooooooooo|`|N205cDzFaa	sicuro/a che non sapessero nulla?|`|dqOnCfamaa	beh, sicuramente fai finta di leggere e capire Nietzsche.|`|JIWEaGUUaa	Se uno vuole fa una ricerca su google e ti dice tutto anche se non ne sa un H...|`|wTbi5wQZaa	non sono la persona adatta!!! |`|lPbeUHh9aa	Beh, io non sono ultra informata, ma non rientro nella cerchia di persone che ti ha instultato credo (ti riferisci a quella domanda su Religione&Spiritualità, vero?).<br>  Beh, allora, vediamo.<br>  <br>  Abbigliamento:<br>  da una semplice predilezione per il nero, ad una selezionata mistura di abiti per l'appunto gotici, che possono preferire vestiti fuori dal tempo, pieni di pizzi, corsetti, gonne lunghe a sbuffo, stoffa trasparente o strappata, con fiocchi e fibbie, cappotti lunghi e semplici, anfibi enormi oppure tacchi esagerati accoppiati a calze a rete o strappate, per quanto riguarda le ragazze. Non c'è bisogno di dire che i ragazzi sono solitamente più sobri, e comunque non è detto che rientrino nella categoria dell'abbigliamento descritto sopra. Dopotutto ognuno predilige cose diverse e veste a modo proprio, quindi un dark può essere sia un tizio tutto anfibi pesanti e borchie, che uno con la maglietta dei The Cure. Oppure può anche non vestirsi di nero, anche se avrà comunque uno stile tutto suo e personalizzato. Ah, e mi sono scordata che le ragazze amano portare i vestiti, soprattutto quelli che accentuano le forme, di velluto o seta (tipo quelli medievali).<br>  Per quanto riguarda gli accessori, direi che è d'obbligo un pendente a forma di croce rovesciata (ma anche normale)! Oppure altri simboli esoterici o celtici, che richiamano cose macabre, oscure, spaventose, morbose e romantiche. Negli accessori possono rientrare anche piercing e borchie varie, collari, bracciali, amuleti e anelli molto appariscenti.<br>  Il gotico ama il nero come ho detto, e quindi ama fare contrasto tra il suo abbigliamento ed i capelli (solitamente neri, liscissimi e simmetrici oppure acconciature bizzarre e ambigue) e la sua pelle, spesso pallidissima. <br>  Il trucco anche questo è spesso pesante, con tanto di eyeliner e rimmel, ombretti di colori scuri e appariscenti, rossetti di un rosso intenso oppure nero, sopracciglia ben marcate. Unghie, quasi esclusivamente nere, oppure anche spesso rosse, in quanto ricordano la passione, il sangue, la raffinatezza.<br>  <br>  Bene, andiamo ai modi di fare.<br>  Non vorrei dire baggianate, quindi mi limito a dire la mia su come IO immagino una persona dark.<br>  Tranquillo, o per lo meno assolutamente non aggressivo, accondiscendente, spesso pensieroso con tendenze all'embleaticismo che può provocare depressione o apatia.Vive in un mondo completamente suo. Ha un pensiero di concezione romantica e libera, vede le cose da un punto diverso da quello degli altri. E' profonfo, sensibile, dannatamente sensibile, e trova conforto in cose oscure e misteriose, che fanno di lui una persona agli occhi degli altri "poco raccomandabile". Altro conforto è la musica, quella triste, profonda, maliconica, solitamente gothic o gothic metal, in cui trova rifugio e l'ispirazione. A modo suo è un artista, e ama vedere il mondo tutto tinto di nero. E' solitamente estraneo al mondo che lo circonda, alla politica, ai media, allo spettacolo, alla religione, a qualsiasi aspetto che lo condizioni.<br>  <br>  A cosa siete contro?<br>  Beh, questo non lo saprei dire di certezza. Ma posso cercare di indovinarlo. Avete uno spirito romantico, quindi non siete razionalisti nè esaltate a destra e a manca la ragione, ma il puro sentimento e la passione tra di essi. Non amate essere condizionati, quindi ogni cosa che limiti la vostra libertà è un danno. Non credo possiate essere a favore della religione, perchè essa include l'accettare molti dogmi per verità assolute e vivere secondo una certa etica e morale, che non permette la libertà totale di pensiero nè la vita secondo i propri comfort. Comunque, questo non vuol dire che non siate persone a vostro modo spirituali, al contrario il modo di vivere è profondo e quasi mistico, che comprende una vasta percezione del mondo e delle sue meraviglie. <br>  <br>  Ho dimenticato qualcosa?  <br>  Beh, spero di no, perchè tutto quello che sapevo l'ho più o meno messo per iscritto.<br>  Ho cercato di fare una panoramica completa, ma la cultura gothic è davvero ma davvero vasta e complessa, che va dalle influenze post-punk al fetish, cybergoth, al vampiric goth e ad altre influenze (neo)romantiche o postmoderne. Come vedi ci sarebbe troppo da dire, e comunque sarebbe quasi impossibile farne una panoramica completa e allo stesso tempo varia, dato che ogni individuo si differisce dall'altro per carattere, stile e gusti. <br>  <br>  Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto.<br>  Ciao!|`|uxHV8rH3aa	intanto lo stile gotico è uno stile architettonico. <br>  <br>  poi se ti riferisci a gente che si veste tutta strana, quella è una domanda che devi porre in abbigliamento|`|JZllqdeLaa	bo non lo so...<br>  me lo dici tu?

Just buy them at the bathroom vending machine at your local gas station or convenient store.<br>  <br>  A box of 12 can cost around $6-$8. When trying to buy them go to a young male clerk to purchase them.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Welcome to the real world, Bubba!  Why can't you go to Walmart where they are out on display.  The price indicates the cost.

c4aoCsp9aa	Sounds like Temporomandibular joint disorder to me. Do a Google search for TMJ and see if it looks like it to you.<br>  <br>  With me, my jaw started locking up and then every time I opened it past a certain point it would crack. Anyone can get it, but it's more common in people who tend to grind their teeth in their sleep.<br>  <br>  I was 14 when it started happening to me, and my Doc just recommended wearing a cheap mouth guard when I slept to prevent anything getting worse.<br>  <br>  No, it won't change what your jaw looks like on the outside, but it can lead to other problems like headaches etc so I'd get yourself checked out!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p5wTtH3taa	sounds like you have TJS.  go to webmd.com and look it up.  I don't remember what it is off the top of my mind but its like some infection that attacks the jaw joints.  
64qFLAw2aa	generally you feel cold/shivery and weak. You probably have achy muscles and feel tired. A fever does not just appear on its own though. It is caused by infection, so other symptoms that are from the infection will also be apparent, possibly red eyes, loss of appetite, vomiting, it can really be anything. Feel better :)|`|6k6Si9Kzaa	When you have a fever your body temperature is above 99.5 degrees Farenheit. General feelings involve shivering and weakened immune system. Drink lots of Vitamin C and water!
ZQxCcG6qaa	you shouldn't be afraid to talk to your mom. just tell her your concerned about the appearance of your lips. its actually good for women to be aware of how their vagina's look so the can know if something changes.<br>  because your uncomfortable with your male doctor you can request a female one. you should always be truthful with your doctor and not be embarrassed to tell them exactly why your concerned..they can't properly help you if they don't know whats wrong or how it happened...don't worry they don't have to tell your mom if you don't want them to, just have the doctor tell her that you weren't sure how your vagina was supposed to look and you though you were malformed.<br>  the lips of the vagina vary by person so yours could be meant to look like that however prolonged stretching of tissue is know to cause deformities. i would advise you to stop pulling on your lips and perhaps get a stress ball or other means to occupy your hands while bored.|`|rUS4Ydkeaa	You sound very normal "down there". There's nothing to worry about. Your "lips" are there to protect and surround your privates, and some people's are naturally longer than other people's.|`|jaGU3zyyaa	Yes, surgery can be performed there when you're older but you are not done growing yet, so you might "grow into" them.  They are called the Labia Minora|`|bmWKETgWaa	This is a question for a gynecologist.  The inner lips of your opening may shrink back toward their original size over a few months, if you don't pull on them any more.  If they don't become smaller, there are probably surgical options when you get older, or you could just live with the condition.  <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to tell your mother.  You could say that you think your vaginal lips are too large, and they are bothering you.  No doubt she will be willing to bring you to the gynecologist for an examination.  If you are really distressed by the idea of an older, male doctor, ask if she can find you a female one.   In any case, the doctor does not have to tell her the details of what was discussed if you say not to.<br>  <br>  If surgery is indicated, your mom will have to know, of course.  Perhaps you could convince the doctor to call it a malformation or overgrowth so you don't get criticized.|`|1dI1QiVJaa	1) im an older male and saw ur ? when i was scrolling down the categories.    anyway U SHOULD TALK TO UR MOM.  there is no reason to  be embarrassed about talking to your mom .   2) u said u cant talk to ur mom or dr. I am assuming though that the dr is a female right? OR IS IT A MALE? if its a male then its understandable why u don't want to talk to the dr.  BUT REALLY if u don't want to talk to ur mom then maybe an older sis or older cousin etc someone whom u feel comfortable talking too   i hope ive been of help and if u need more advice or help etc then please feel free to email me.|`|Qxpza56paa	don't be embarrassed to tell your mom. i could completely understand why you would wanna trust your new doctor before you tell him about this. maybe someone can get you a girl doctor and maybe a gynecologist appointment. and yes there is a surgery that they can perform when you are older to make the lips back to there normal size.|`|TC0LmbG4aa	Well know matter how bad it is im sure the doctor has seen worse. and also you can't expect for it to get better if you dont allow anyone to help you. i understand why it is embarrising but no one is going to critize you or think badly about you. especially not your mother. i think you should just sit down with her and just tell her the story just like you told us. <br>  Best of luck!|`|62mBBb6paa	You really need to speak with your mother who can take you to a doctor to be examined.<br>  It is really important to speak with her about it.

Fixation of braces will not take much time and will not be at all painful. They will put braces and fix wire.

Yyiypk3kaa	It can be.  <br>  <br>  Yoga includes deep, full breathing, which can help calm and quiet the mind.  Yoga also encourages one learn to focus on the moment, rather than fretting or feeling anxious about the past or future.  <br>  <br>  Unlike many other forms of exercise, yoga also encourages you to accept where you are on a given day without judgment. So if you go to class today and you're a bit tired or feeling less flexible than yesterday, you're encouraged to do your best today, without worrying or comparing yourself to others.  <br>  <br>  Many classes also end with a relaxation segment, which gives your mind a chance to slow down.<br>  <br>  Also, there are many forms of yoga.  Some are gentler and quieter, which may be what you want, but if you prefer a more rigorous routine, ashtanga or hot yoga can give you a very challenging workout.<br>  <br>  The best way to find out if yoga really works is to try it out.  Many libraries carry yoga cds or dvds, or try a free yoga podcast.  Hope you find something that works for you!|`|c2bS025Xaa	Absolutely! Yoga takes practice though.

But if you’re preoccupied with “what ifs” and worst-case scenarios, worry becomes a problem of its own. Unrelenting doubts and fears are paralyzing, not motivating or productive. They sap your emotional energy, send your anxiety levels soaring, and interfere with your day-to-day life–all this with no positive payoff! The good news is that chronic worrying is a mental habit you can learn how to break. You can train your brain to stay calm and collected and to look at life from a more positive perspective.<br>  In This Article:<br>  Why is it so hard to stop worrying? <br>  Accept uncertainty <br>  Create a worry period <br>  Challenge negative thoughts <br>  Learn how to relax <br>  Take care of yourself <br>  Related links <br>  Print  Authors<br>  Text Size<br>  Why is it so hard to stop worrying?<br>  Why You Keep Worrying<br>  You have mixed feelings about your worries. On one hand, your worries are bothering you - you can't sleep, and you can't get these pessimistic thoughts out of your head. But there is a way that these worries make sense to you. For example, you think:<br>  <br>  Maybe I'll find a solution. <br>  I don't want to overlook anything. <br>  If I keep thinking a little longer, maybe I'll figure it out. <br>  I don't want to be surprised. <br>  I want to be responsible. <br>  You have a hard time giving up on your worries because, in a sense, your worries have been working for you.<br>  <br>  Source: The Worry Cure: Seven Steps to Stop Worry from Stopping You, Robert L. Leahy, Ph.D.<br>  Constant worrying takes a heavy toll. It keeps you up at night and makes you tense and edgy during the day. You hate feeling like a nervous wreck. So why is it so difficult to stop worrying?<br>  <br>  For most chronic worriers, the anxious thoughts are fueled by the beliefs–both negative and positive–they hold about worrying. <br>  <br>  On the negative side, you may believe that your constant worrying is harmful, that it’s going to drive you crazy or affect your physical health. Or you may worry that you’re going to lose all control over your worrying–that it will take over and never stop.<br>  <br>  On the positive side, you may believe that your worrying helps you avoid bad things, prevents problems, prepares you for the worst, or leads to solutions. <br>  <br>  Negative beliefs, or worrying about worrying, add to your anxiety and keep worry going. But positive beliefs about worrying can be even more damaging. It’s tough to break the worry habit if you believe that your worrying protects you. In order to stop worry and anxiety for good, you must give up your belief that worrying serves a positive purpose. Once you realize that worrying is the problem, not the solution, you can regain control of your worried mind.<br>  <br>  Worry and anxiety self-help tip #1: Accept uncertainty<br>  The inability to tolerate uncertainty plays a huge role in anxiety and worry. Chronic worriers can’t stand doubt or unpredictability. They need to know with 100 percent certainty what’s going to happen. Worrying is seen as a way to predict what the future has in store, a way to prevent unpleasant surprises and control the outcome. The problem is, it doesn’t work. <br>  <br>  Thinking about all the things that could go wrong doesn’t make life any more predictable. You may feel safer when you’re worrying, but it’s just an illusion. Focusing on worst-case scenarios won’t keep bad things from happening. It will only keep you from enjoying the good things you have in the present. So if you want to stop worrying, start by tackling your need for certainty and immediate answers. <br>  <br>  Challenging intolerance of uncertainty: The key to anxiety relief<br>  Ask yourself the following questions and write down your responses. See if you can come to an understanding of the disadvantages and problems of being intolerant of uncertainty.<br>  <br>  Is it possible to be certain about everything in life? <br>  What are the advantages of requiring certainty, versus the disadvantages? Or, how is needing certainty in life helpful and unhelpful? <br>  Do you tend to predict bad things will happen just because they are uncertain? Is this a reasonable thing to do? What is the likelihood of positive or neutral outcomes? <br>  Is it possible to live with the small chance that something negative may happen, given its likelihood is very low? <br>  Adapted from Accepting Uncertainty, Centre for Clinical Interventions<br>  <br>  Worry and anxiety self-help tip #2: Create a worry period<br>  It’s tough to be productive in your daily life when anxiety and worry are dominating your thoughts. Trying to stop worrying doesn’t work - at least not for long. You can distract yourself for a moment, but you can’t banish your anxious thoughts for good. Trying to do so often makes them stronger. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do to control your worry. You just need to try a different approach. Rather than trying to totally suppress an anxious thought, develop the habit of postponing worrying. |`|XnNhY38Taa	Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.<br>  <br>  Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.<br>  But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction...

A3Oh0PRxaa	Yes, it works for me! I went in for migraines - I would get severe migraines once or twice a week. I was already using Imitrex and that works to get rid of the migraine - but I wanted something prevent migraines. I'm a pharmacist, so I knew of several alternatives including several of the ones you've listed. I asked for Topamax because I knew it had the least side effects. I've been on it for a little over a year now and not only have my migraines improved, but I don't have the pesky daily headaches anymore. I wasn't even expecting that improvement, but that was a bonus - I am VERY pleased with the Topamax. I started at the same dose and have been increased to 100mg twice a day. The one side effect I have had is it has really decreased my appetite, so I have also lost some weight, but I needed to do that anyway, so that was another plus. |`|hwYyaYukaa	Yes it helps somewhat.  It may take awhile for the drug to build up in your system so it's not an overnight cure.  The doctor may adjust your dose once you get used to it, for maximum effectiveness.|`|66AlfbWiaa	Have you tried seeing a chiropractor?

A couple of the girls had heart conditions and died.  Thousands of women have received the shots and most who reported side effects reported pain at the injection site.  <br>  <br>  More people die every year from taking birth control pills.  Even more from crossing the street.  Gardasil is meant to help prevent 4 of the HPV strains, specifically the one that can cause cervical cancer.  Although cervical cancer has a high cure rate.  Anyone who has ever gone through cancer will tell you that it is a horrible treatment, far worse than the most common side effect of Gardasil: pain at the injection site.  |`|ZAg5bc6Iaa	i took all three of them and i feel fine...and didn;t have pain at the injestion site...haven;t heard ne one dying from it either|`|nCcWWsMIaa	i took it nd i feel fine , no i havent
AA11020187	What a frustrating situation and you are right to question your care. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you things work very differently in the military than they do in the private sector. This includes medical care. Although I’m sure there are many good physicians in the military, my ex-husband was a flight surgeon in Vietnam, but there are many that are not. Doctors and hospitals under federal jurisdiction do not have to follow the regulations the doctors and hospitals in the rest of the country do. This allows doctors who have lost their license to practice to work in military and VA hospitals. It is a disgrace to treat the men and women who risk their lives to defend our country this way and it has gone on for years. I’m sorry to rant. This is another subject, but I thought you should know. If you are concerned about a particular doctor you can check on their license with the Medical Board in the state they were licensed in. Most states have this information online.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to your question. The doctor who ordered the ultrasound is not the doctor who makes the final call, the radiologist is as this is their specialty. The doctor who ordered the test should be going off the report from the radiologist. Having copies of the reports from both your ultrasounds should be proof enough to make your point. I hope this ends up being a problem with the nurse you are speaking to rather than the doctor.<br>  <br>  You are correct in thinking birth control will not help in your situation as it is only helpful with functional cysts. A CA-125 may be helpful and you should ask for it, but you should know if you are under 35 it is not unusual for it to be elevated for non-cancerous reasons. However, it is indicated for someone with a complex or a dermoid cyst. You should also know it is not sensitive enough to diagnose cancer regardless of your age. It is simply another tool. A pap smear is not helpful in this situation as its primary use is for cervical problems.<br>  <br>  Its been 3 months obviously it isn’t going away on its own. I would want it removed. I really hate to say this as I normally do not advocate such things, but if you are going home for Thanksgiving go to an emergency room at a private hospital and tell them you have nausea and vomiting, sudden severe abdominal pain, low back pain, dizziness and weakness. They will see you right away and hopefully correct the problem. If you should really get these symptoms go to an emergency room right away. Best wishes. I hope you feel better soon.|`|e91a21f82aa8659a9edfc4344d58d422aa	A functional cyst is the type of cyst that all women get every month right before their period, and most times are directly related to the ovulation process.  A complex cyst might be an Endometriosis cyst (or chocolate cyst) or a cyst that grows every month rather than go away after your period (like a functional cyst would).<br>  <br>  I was first diagnosed with Endometriosis, on-post while in the military stationed in Ft. Huachuca, Arizona, 15 yrs. ago.  I suggest you try to get your Gyn to do some more tests related to Endometriosis, since it sounds like Endo symptoms to me.  And I should tell you this: the ONLY way to diagnose Endometriosis is thru a Laparoscopic Surgery.  Don't let them fool you with other tests, Ok?<br>  <br>  BTW, a CA-125 should only be performed during your period and it doesn't really tells them anything unless you have cancer.  Other than that, a CA-125 is useless.<br>  <br>  You might want to get more information on Endometriosis.  I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.endometriosisassn.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.endometriosisassn.org</a> or if you or anyone you know speak Spanish, you could visit <a href="http://www.endopuertorico.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.endopuertorico.org</a> or Endometriosis Puerto Rico in Facebook.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't be stressed on talking to your doctor.  Remember your doctor is human and is prone to make mistakes and misdiagnosis.  Push and push until you are comfortable with the diagnosis and the treatment.  |`|edEaaHbvaa	For a start I agree with Puerto Rico Best's response. <br>  I must assume you've been told this cyst is on an ovary? You said you had a pregnancy test. I assume it came back negative? If so then it's unlikely, but not out of the question, for you to have an ectopic pregancy in your right fallopian tube. <br>  <br>  From radiology it can be hard to diagnose 'lumps' but if two different radiologists give the same diagnosis then I'd tend to go with them. Your other doc is probably going on the results as assessed by another doctor and standing by that doc's diagnosis. <br>  You didn't say if the pain is constantly there or if it's getting worse or easing off. This can be important because it may be related to your cycle if it's easing off and, therefore, much less to worry about. <br>  <br>  Really, the best way to diagnose it more accurately is for you to have a laprascopic investigation. That way they can actually see the mass and make their final decision based upon that. However, if the pain is subsiding I wouldn't rush into the laprascopic exam just yet and see what other treatment they recommend. I might even be tempted to try the pill first although the efffectiveness of this treatment may take a month or two before it makes any significant changes to the size of the cyst. Can you put up with it for that long? 
B9ZbNGSTaa	You should definitely call the doctor before then and discuss this!<br>  <br>  Taking the bottom group first, these are the findings when the urine was spun in a centrifuge to concentrate it and examined under a microscope.<br>  <br>  WBC stands for "white blood cells".  >50 means there were more than 50 of them seen per high power field when they looked at the urine under the microscope.  Having more than a couple of WBCs in the urine indicates inflammation, most likely from a bacterial infection in this case.<br>  <br>  RBC stands for "red blood cells".  10-20 is a moderate amount, but likely not enough to make the urine look red.  The blood is coming from the site of inflammation/infection.  This is most likely in the bladder.<br>  <br>  1+ bacteria just means there were some bacteria seen under the microscope.  Again, it usually means that a bacterial infection is present.<br>  <br>  "Squ Epi cells" are "squamous epithelial cells".  These are the cells that line the ureters and the urethra.  They can be sloughed off when the area is inflamed.  However, 0-1 is a relatively small amount.<br>  <br>  The top group of figures are the results of the dipstick test done on the urine.  The numbers usually go from 0 to 4+, with 4+ being the most.<br>  <br>  The test shows a small amount of blood (that we know from above).<br>  The "trace" amount of protein is again likely a sign of inflammation (the inflammatory cells produce a number of proteins when they get activated).  <br>  "Leuk ester" stands for "leukocyte esterase".  Leukocytes are another name for white blood cells, and the produce a substance called esterase when they get activated to fight an infection.  Again, this all makes sense.<br>  <br>  So the urine tests generally support what you already apparently knew-that he has a bladder infection.  It is very important that he get treated with antibiotics to clear the infection before it gets worse.  It's also probably a good idea to repeat the tests once he's been treated to make sure it all gets better.  It's also a good idea to ask the doctor whether your son's kidneys and ureters should be checked to make sure there's no abnormality to make infection more likely.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Call your doctor today!|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Only a doctor can tell you this and there aren't any on here. If you can't be seen by the doctor until next monday and don't have antibiotics then you NEED TO GO TO THE ER before it ends up in the kidneys! GO NOW!

That this something for ur own health.|`|mu3hKxugaa	its nothing to worry about! haha relax...<br>  i know quite a few people who didn't have there period till their 20's, but if you are worried about it you should schedule an appointment and just talk to the doctor, they will probably say the same thing though. Good luck girl|`|Mao1uyhFaa	well consider yourself lucky<br>  but no actually u go to the gyno for a lot of stuff not just cause your sexually active <br>  maybe just tell him you wanna get checked out because u are havin really bad craps <br>  or you need a shot <br>  so good luck just talk to him and try to make him understand<br>  i wish u the best|`|0212cda3531558b21ee35f899e14eebfaa	you should go to the doctor because their might be something wrong with you. you could have some type of disease that would unable you to have children. |`|sB54XCACaa	Good thing for late period so less time with sports but yea go to the doctor b/c there might be something kinda wrong with that pic!! I got mine when i was 12 going on 13 in like 3 days|`|BFo4vDFYaa	I don't mean to scare you but you should have your period by 16... at the latest. And as for your dad brushing you off ask an aunt or another girl relative that understands. You actually really should see a gyno (or if anything just your doc) to make sure everything's okay. Usually when you don't have your period by 16 (or, in this case, 18) then your hormones are off balance. But, no worries. Your doc can prescribe a med to help this. <br>  <br>  PS- Yes, you will be able to have kids!!! I mean as long as you get your period which I can promise you you will get! Every woman does!!!<br>  <br>  PSS- Periods are kinda suckish (with cramps and all that) so be thankful you don't have it [yet]!|`|wNbXkgrtaa	that's awesome!! you can have as much SEX as you want without getting pregnant!|`|Dh23WJt5aa	you are lucky im twelve and got my first period on wendsday it sucks<br>  <br>  so to me you are lucky|`|geVD6OR0aa	omg go to the doctor.|`|5ztECYZDaa	ive never had one either|`|jsD8WaQbaa	I know a woman who went to a doctor when she got to be about your age and hadn't started yet. He was a quack and just told her to count her blessings that she didn't have to worry about it. When she got married several years later and wanted to have kids, they went to another doctor, who freaked out because she should have been having a period for over a decade by that time. Your body NEEDS to flush itself out regularly or all kinds of problems could develop; she was lucky in that nothing too bad had happened yet, but she's had to have all kinds of hormone therapy, which about drove her out of her mind because she had never had to deal with PMS before at all and now suddenly she was getting a ten-times dose of it. It was extremely difficult for her to get pregnant, and although she was eventually able to have a baby, the whole thing was a nightmare.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to a doctor as soon as you can. It's possible you could go to some sort of clinic and leave your dad out of it entirely. Especially once you turn 18, when you're not a minor anymore. You definitely need to get looked at.|`|XWdc2qk4aa	school nurse you could see? maybe you could see a gyn through a local health department... also, are you really active? some female athletes who train extensively don't have their regular cycle. are you eating right? an unhealthy diet or anorexia could be a cause. your best course of action is to see a health care worker. |`|Qbczt3ivaa	If you didnt have your period by the time your 16, then you should seriously see a doctor. I know its hard for your dad to understand(what dad would unless their a doctor) lol Im sure youll have it sooner or later so dont worry! |`|7ciDto6Daa	Well, i would say making an appointment with my doctor..<br>  |`|nMW6f9fzaa	All I can say is OB-GYN.  In other words, to hell with the bo0k.  Go see a gynecologist .|`|F12ekJ7Saa	Hi hun, don't feel bad. I'm 17 so I can somewhat understand what you are going through. You need to tell your dad that you need to be checked up. Tell him that it isn't normal for a 17 year old girl to still not have a period. You need to be checked up in-case something is wrong with your body. If he doesn't understand im sure there is someone who you trust and love that can help you through this, maybe and aunt, or cousin, sister, or best friend? I'm sure nothing is wrong, it might just be that your body isn't developing at a normal speed and it will just take more time for you and your growing body. You can call a OBGYN and ask then questions about what your situation is and they can probably give you a solution. Good luck and dont worry, you'll be fine. You're just one of the luck ones that doesn't have to experience a period as such an early age.<br>  <br>  ---Don't listen to Stephanie! (the person below me) You can still get pregnant even if you dont have a period. Your body can still ovulate and you CAN get pregnant!

I would definitely do pads for a while before you switch to tampons. You don't want to use those too young or too soon. <br>  <br>  Take pain medication even if it doesn't hurt right this minute. It will definitely hurt soon. Tylenol Extra Strength or Midol. Tylenol is good because you don't have to eat a meal just to take it, like Aleve and Advil.<br>  <br>  Check yourself every couple of hours and see how heavy your flow is. That will help you figure out how heavy duty your pads need to be. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a woman at home, approach your school nurse or some other woman you trust and ask them a billion questions.

L4VWOVjcaa	You'll be okay lubing to insert the tampon. The only drawback to this plan is that the lube will likely the tampon less absorbent, so you'll probably have to change it more often and you might be more prone to leaks. I would use a panti-liner as a backup. <br>  <br>  I would get some lube on your fingers and insert the lube into your vagina right before inserting the tampon. If that's not enough lube go ahead and put some on the tampon.|`|MeOOUhHkaa	Lubricants can be used for inserted tampons easier.<br>  <br>  Just take the tampon out of the wrapper and put some lube on the tampon cover and it should go in much easier and be more comfortable.<br>  <br>  |`|0212cda3531558b21ee35f899e14eebfaa	EWWWWWWWWWW|`|X76BnjUlaa	You can definitely use tampons and pads alternating them. To lubricate the tampon you would put the lubrication liquid on the tampon. It would be just a little hard to put the lubricant inside the vagina. You can also get a lubricant from your drug store with an applicator to insert  for dryness.|`|a5oDGgiDaa	I suffer from the same thing. It does indeed irritate your skin, especially if you are a heavy flow-er. First things first, Make sure you are using plastic applicators. I guess you could use lube if it was really uncomfortable, but most of the time these are fine. Also, upon insertion of the tampon you can stimulate your bladder and sometimes get a trickle of urine. That in itself lubes the tampon applicator sometimes. :) <br>  <br>  Pads are good for back up. Not saying they shouldn't be used, because when I am on my period for the first 3 days I am so tender I can't insert a tampon, but use a tampon and then put a pad in for back up. Good luck. Talk to your Doctor about the vaginal dryness. Just tell him you are uncomfortable and ask if he can give you maybe a cream or possibly some oral medication.

XrZxEhsjaa	First. Breathe easy. The reason for all these so called problems your having is that you have not reached puberty yet. What i mean by that is your penis will start growing to its appropriate length once you hit puberty some people dont hit puberty till they are almost 16. And besides i can garuntee you that your penis will increase in size by at least an inch or more once you have reached puberty. It is likely though that by the end of puberty you will gain several inches. An important thing to note is that the vagina is only 3 inches deep or 4 when aroused so as long as you are more than 4 inches (easy accomplishement) by the time you get laid she wont even feel the size. However width (or girth) does give a different feel.|`|ypVrHE1iaa	Hey! <br>  Well first off your only thirteen!  I'm 16 and I am 7 inches and I don't remember what I was back then but you'll get bigger, you just aren't all the way into puberty. For the hair, you don't really want it anyways its annoying and nasty, but it will come too! and when it does DON'T shave it, because your going to get razor burn and your crotch will itch for days and it comes back longer and thicker, you don't want that LOL! I hoped I've helped dude!<br>  If you have anymore questions I'll be glad to help without being mean like some ppl on here haha! :P <br>  |`|hNgc2Ynyaa	It all sounds fine to me.

Some guys don't hit it untill 15.|`|t9t3ovyraa	Everyone if different, I first ejaculated when I was 12. Now I'm 14 and touch my self ever day.|`|C970lCIvaa	its ok..i was like that when i was still 14 too..i think it will grow when u hit puberty at 15..thats my experience so it will more or less the same.|`|gwoyQSRIaa	Don't worry at all. Your only 13 and you have plenty of years ahead of you to grow. If anything your a late bloomer. Lots of my friends were late bloomers and grew when the were older. Just eat right and wait until it grows bud you'll be fine.|`|M6mMm7SNaa	It's normal for a 13-year-old to be 3-5 inches when erect, and be virtually hairless.|`|CsDHbGxBaa	you have plenty of time to grow, just dont have sex anytime soon, cause that is small but dont sweat it by 18 you should be fine |`|0212cda3531558b21ee35f899e14eebfaa	your just a late bloomer thats all. just wait it will happen soon :]

Like SOME (as in a little sometimes) alcohol is actually good for you. I'm not sure if that applies to pot or not, but I've heard it's less addictive that some legal drugs, but that might not be completely true. Also depends on your age and if you get caught. It's not illegal for adults to drink, pot on the other hand, not pretty when there's cops involved.<br>  <br>  But really, in heavy doses neither is good, so I would go with none of the above, but that's just me.|`|gwoyQSRIaa	As long as you don't get completely hammered and start throwing up everywhere, pot is worse for you.

NPpalf1Gaa	I'm sorry, I don't know what a splint is.. but if you have been diagnosed with TMJ then yes your smile may have changed a little bit because of the jaw realignments. If you've had oral surgery to correct TMJ, then your smile should have significantly improved. <br>  <br>  If you have not had facial or oral surgery and think you may need to, go to your dentist and ask them to refer you to an oral surgeon. Once you see the surgeon, he can help you determine the best route whether it may be proceeding with surgery, or by wearing braces. But if you have TMJ you will most likely need surgery. Unfortunately most insurances will not cover this process because they consider it to be cosmetic rather than facial. I recommend going to the emergency room and telling them you have jaw pains and it hurts to chew or open/close your mouth.. this way they can diagnose you with TMJ and you will have it on record to submit to your insurance company. This surgery is quite expensive and the cheapest I've found so far is where I live in Texas yet is still $15,000. So if you plan on getting the surgery, go to your dentist to get referred to an oral surgeon, and talk to him there to find out what hospital he will do the surgery at and then go to that hospital's financial aid/assistance building. This surgery takes a year and sometimes more to prepare for due to bone growth, braces and other things.. so get started NOW! <br>  <br>  Also look up Orthognathic surgery for more information and ask your dentist about it.

B12E4rYiaa	To get the best results with weight training you need to do several types of sets instead of the same set over and over.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  1st set of bicep curls- 8 reps with dumb bell<br>  2nd set  8 reps preacher curls<br>  3rd set  8 reps cable curls<br>  <br>  Do all muscle groups this way for best muscle development|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Try hand stand push-ups.<br>  How you ask?<br>  Face the wall, check to make sure there aren't any nails in the area.<br>  Touch the wall with an open hand (palm) step back until your arm is <br>  extended to the max where the elbow is straight.Stand perfectly erect<br>  and place the other hand on the wall. Take one step back look at your feet then put your hand on each side of your foot.<br>  You may need someone to help you put your feet against the wall<br>  and probably hold you up as you do them.<br>  At first you won/t be able to do one but within the hour you should be able to do at least 5 if not 1.|`|gFq4QwYuaa	Keep in mind that in order to build muscle mass you need to do higher weight at fewer reps. The appropriate amount of weight to do a workout that will increase muscle size should make it difficult to get through 10 reps of the bicep curls or triceps exercises, but not cause lingering pain.<br>  <br>  I would say something that lets you do two or three sets with ten reps each. Make sure you do them nice and slowly, doing the exercises too quickly decreases the benefit from them. Same with the push ups and sit ups, do them more slowly to gain greater benefit from them.

OmUlmhPvaa	If this is something that is unusual for you, I would bring it up to a gynecologist.  They would know best.  It's hard to say what it could be since there are so many factors that could cause this, besides pregnancy.  And it may not be anything at all.  Also, everyone's period is different so really getting a good answer on here maybe hard.

I have experienced the same type of pain whenever I have had an ovarian cyst and currently have 2 ovarian cysts (one on each of my ovaries).<br>  <br>  I have had a number of bilateral ovarian cysts (which included functional, hemorrhagic and endometrioma cysts) over the past 11 years.

One of the ovarian cysts that I had drained/removed measured 8.1cm x 7.7cm and was on my left ovary.<br>  <br>  I recommend that if you have any concerns regarding this pain you are experiencing or think that you have another ovarian cyst, that you consult with your doctor/gyno for further evaluation ASAP.

It seems to me that lately, whenever I do anything fun when I should be working on homework, I feel tremendously guilty. <br>  <br>  However, it really is important to find a balance. You're only a teenager once. Time, once gone, is gone forever, and thus, I would suggest simply living without regrets. Try to find some time in every day to enjoy yourself while still getting what you need to get done. Working hard in school is very important; as my parents have stressed time and time again, what college you go does make a difference. However, in the end, since you only live once, you ought to enjoy your life as well. You just have to learn to manage your time wisely. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, you'll have to make sacrifices for the future, but it is something we all need to do or at the very least, should do.

AA11423609	Try the deer exercise (google it). This helps for the ejaculation. Also, when masturbating, right before you squirt, stop jerking and sqeeze so you don't shoot out, then once your need to release semen goes away, start again and stop before you squirt and keep doing the same thing. It hurts to stop before you squirt and it will take alot of control to stop when you want to squirt, but keep at it. This helps to train your system to last longer, so the ejaculation period increases. There is a technique called jelqing for your penis to increase in length and girth, but I wouldn't do it if I were you coz it breaks your penis wall cells so they can heal as longer cells and your penis will increase. But this can cause your penis to become crooked or maybe even smaller! Also keep in mind that it doesn't matter how big your penis is on a flop, but it's the erecction that counts and also how you perform. To have a harder erection, also tense your anuss for a continuous period, as though you are drawing water up it, and this helps to increase strength. The more you practice, the longer you'll be able to hold it. Do it daily, when you're eating, watching TV etc... Good luck!|`|AA12030383	There are some treatements with can help you to increase your penis.It is important to find the best ones and with no side effects.In the last several years some corporations developed herbal pills for that kind of problems with no side effects and 100% natural.<br>  <br>  <br>    You can find here: www.msherbalpills.com/MXMAN.php more informations about and the whole treatement.Keep in touch.
AA10998088	Ultrasound is a great field to work in, but getting in can be very competitive! You can look to see if your local community college offers it.

You can do a search on their site to see schools in your location with a major in Sonography or Ultrasound. Or you can try College and Universities.net, I added a link on here, it's the last one. That has a bunch of different schools that provide training in Ultrasound/Sonography. If you want to learn more about the program a certain school offers, ask to meet with the head of the Sonographer/Ultrasound department (It might be someone who is also a head of another health department) and ask them more about it, or even a college advisor.

If you start to see more of them, or if they start to get seriously itchy or cover a larger area, then it's not a bad idea to go see your doctor.  Even if it's not an STD, it could still be some sort of infection that you got from something as simple as touching yourself when you go to the bathroom, and there's no reason for you to have to deal with it.

She used DDR as *part* of her weight loss plan.  <br>  <br>  One thing you should check is the size of your food portions--most of us have a distorted idea of what a "serving" of something is, and so we over-eat without really thinking of it.  Even if you are eating healthy food, you might be eating too much for your body.|`|d0b7c399f000b3f194aa7397d0d6288baa	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry it's just that I feel the same love for DDR as you do. I have one and it's so addicting. If it's the weekend I play for 6 hours straight, no joke. What level are you on? I'm on challenge. It sucks though because not a lot of the songs are challenge. Sorry again, I'm not answering your question am I. But now I will. I do think that everything you're doing is perfect for losing weight. You probably won't see results immediately though. It sometimes takes your body a couple of weeks to actually get rid of the fat. But since you're doing so much exercise you really need to watch what you eat. You have to be getting all the vitamins and energy your body needs to exercise. I suggest supplements. If you're not losing ANY wait at all, then you may have a VERY rare case, I don't know what it's called but I saw it on TV. It's this sort of case where you barely eat and you exercise like hell and you keep getting fatter. If you're not getting fat, then you don't have the "disease".

However, if you exercise and eat well, you CAN tone up the muscles in problem areas.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many people also have body issues due to genetics that are difficult or impossible to overcome regardless of how hard they try (don't know if this is your case or not). For instance, some women can't get rid of the cellulite from their hips, thighs and buttocks no matter how much they diet and exercise. And for many men (and women too), a thick waist and/or belly bulge is something they have tried for years to get rid of (non surgically), to no avail.<br>  <br>  Not trying to get you down. There are plenty of exercises you can do that are less impactful on the knees than running (biking and swimming are two that come to mind) and they will still help you lose weight/tone up.

You can also get cranberry pills, and UTI pain relief pills called AZO. One thing though: If you drink enough juice, you will feel better and it will seem like the infection is all flushed out of your system. But you should still go to the doctor for antibiotics, as the bacteria is still in your body even if the pain is gone. When I had one, I drank tons of juice and water until I felt normal, but I still want to the doctor. And the doc didn't give me a strong enough antibiotic, and a week later, my infection was back. So if you don't go to the doctor at all, its very likely it will flare up again.

Elimina todo lo blanco: No harinas, no azúcar, no papas, no arroz, etc.[Respecto al alcohol, acuérdate que el alcohol se metaboliza como azúcar, por tanto es blanco asi que hay que evitarlo]<br>  2. Toma sólo agua entre mas tomes mejor todos dicen que 8 vasos pero puedes tomar 10 y genial pues el agua elimina la sensación de hambre.<br>  3. No vayas al super con hambre pues compras todo lo que engorda<br>  4. Procura comer en tu casa o llévate tu comida en envases plásticos y prepárate una enorme ensalada, un consomé (funcionan genial esos de consomé concentrado en polvo, pues le pones 1 cucharadita a una taza de agua y ya tienes una rica sopa) acuérdate que lo caliente también quita la sensación de hambre.<br>  5. Puedes tomar todo lo que quieras de especias: pimienta, eneldo, canela, romero, en fin lo que se te ocurra, vinagre, vinagre balsámico, limón, eso si reduce tu consumo de aceite de oliva a una sola cucharadita.<br>  6. Abusa de los vegetales: por ejemplo prepárate una lasagna de calabacitas, sólo las rebanas a lo largo, les pones un poco de queso mozarella y salsa de spaguetti y tienes un platillo delicioso y muy satisfactorio sin que engorde nada. Puedes rebanar jícama y le pones limón y preparas una salsa de pico de gallo y eso se lo pones por encima y la comes como si fueran tostadas, en fin recetas con vegetales hay infinidad.<br>  7.Toma todos los días algo de proteinas: puedes tomar un bistec de 100 grs. o sea que mida el tama?o de la palma de tu mano, o bien le pones surimi a tu ensalada, o le pones atún (del que viene en agua).<br>  8. En cuanto a los lacteos únicamente toma un poco de queso de Oaxaca o mozarella a mi me gusta mucho hacerme unas gelatinas y tomarlas con una rebanada de queso como postre<br>  9. Fruta toma dos piezas al día pero olvídate de las muy dulces como el mango o el plátano..<br>  10. Algo que funciona sensacional es ir a comprar tantas bolsas de kilos de arroz o de frijol como kilos tengas demás y esas bolsas las colocas   junto al refrigerador incluso sobre la mesa donde comes y asi visualmente ves el sobrepeso que tienes, te juro que al verlas se espanta uno y te sorprendes de andar cargando tantos kilos de más y le da a uno mucho gusto ir retirando las que uno va perdiendo.<br>  11. Por último te diré que todo es cuestión de proponérselo, la fuerza de voluntad es indispensable, es tomar la decisión y todo se reduce a DDT = Dejar De Tragar.<br>  12. Paciencia los kilos de que disfrutas los ganaste en mucho tiempo, una dieta es un largo proceso, las dietas que te bajan 5 kg. en una semana si lo hacen pero para adelgazar permanentemente hay que cambiar de hábitos.<br>  Mucha suerte Mercedes|`|98280fa3c6ab1d2fa96ab0312f97056faa	asi te ves bien ...|`|aeacf0c2411ee31b0277dbadbe03df9daa	Bebe jugo de toronja antes o después de cada comida. Esto quema los rollitos que se acumulan alrededor de la cintura y disminuye el exceso de peso. El jugo de toronja produce saciedad debido a su contenido en pectina, un tipo de fibra vegetal que, además, disminuye la absorción intestinal de grasas y azúcares, y favorece la eliminación de líquidos sobrantes a través de su acción diurética.<br>  Esto tiene que ir acompa?ado de una dieta baja en calorías, o sea come un poco menos, y camina por lo menos media hora.

Esto genera una mayor utilización de energía y un mayor trabajo físico de los músculos.<br>  Lo debemos hacer cuando estamos trabajando en nuestra rutina de ejercicios cardiovasculares. O sea, durante nuestro trabajo aeróbico, contraemos los músculos del abdomen (los ponemos “duros”) durante los últimos minutos de cada parte de la rutina. Esto lo podemos hacer mientras caminamos, corremos, subimos una escalera o cualquiera sea la rutina.<br>  La contracción debe durar unos treinta segundos, y luego un periodo de relajación de quince. Lo podremos repetir unas tres o cuatro veces durante los últimos tres o cuatro minutos de la rutina. Luego pasamos al siguiente ejercicio que debamos hacer, y repetimos las contracciones al final.<br>  Puede parecer que no estamos trabajando demasiado, pero al otro día sentiremos la diferencia y con el paso del tiempo será realmente de mucha ayuda para endurecer el estomago. <br>  <br>  Levantando peso<br>  En realidad, el levantar pesos o hacer aparatos no ayudará a bajar la panza, por no ser ejercicios pensados para este tipo de trabajo. <br>  Pero, siguiendo la lógica anterior, podemos trabajar los músculos abdominales realizando las contracciones como se indicó. Sólo hay que prestar atención y recordar contraer y relajar en los momentos adecuados.<br>  Como beneficio adicional, las contracciones de los músculos abdominales nos ayudarán a mantener una postura correcta durante la realización de los ejercicios. <br>  En tensión<br>  Lo esencial con estos ejercicios, como con casi todos, es hacerlos correctamente. Si los hacemos mal, lamentablemente, no servirán de nada y sólo lograremos dolores y problemas físicos. <br>  Para hacer los abdominales correctamente, es importante mantener la tensión de los músculos durante todo el tiempo de ejercitación, evitando el frecuente error de relajar los músculos al final de una serie de ejercicios abdominales.<br>  Es imprescindible mantener la tensión todo el tiempo que dura el ejercicio, pues de otra forma, estamos ganando aire, pero perdiendo forma y trabajo real. <br>  Alimentación<br>  Condimentos <br>  La otra parte importante en este combate contra la panza es la alimentación. Un gran enemigo de una buena alimentación son los condimentos, los aceites, las grasas en general. <br>  La mayonesa, las cremas, las salsas con aceite cocido y la manteca están prohibidas en cualquier dieta para combatir el exceso de grasa corporal.<br>  Pero hay algunos condimentos que los pueden reemplazar y que mantienen nuestras comidas un poco más interesantes.<br>  -Mostaza<br>  -Ketchup<br>  -Salsa de soja<br>  -Salsas caseras, con un poco de aceite crudo<br>  -Salsa picante<br>  -Salsa de tomate natural<br>  -Margarina<br>  Estos, igualmente, son sólo algunos ejemplos. Lo importante es ver las características del alimento que vamos a consumir y elegir en base a esto, para mantener una dieta baja en calorías y grasas. <br>  Suplementos dietarios y píldoras para adelgazar <br>  Los suplementos dietarios y las píldoras para adelgazar no son imprescindibles, y deben ser tomadas con mucho cuidado, de una forma controlada, preferiblemente por un médico con experiencia en el tema.<br>  Es cierto que pueden colaborar con nuestros intentos de estar más flacos, pero también es cierto que, consumidos de forma indiscriminada y sin los recaudos necesarios, pueden causar problemas físicos y de alimentación (por ejemplo, náuseas, mareos, presión arterial alta, insomnio, escalofríos y diarrea).<br>  Muchas de estas píldoras están compuestas de estimulantes menores. Por lo tanto las podemos tomar en días en que nos sintamos un poco débiles o faltos de ganas para realizar nuestras actividades, ya que nos darán un poco de esa energía extra que podemos necesitar.<br>  El otro mecanismo al que apuntan es a aumentar nuestro metabolismo, haciéndonos quemar mayor cantidad de grasas de lo habitual. Sin embargo, jugar con nuestro metabolismo suele no ser una buena idea si no sabemos lo que estamos haciendo. Así que las píldoras y los suplementos dietarios deben ser tan sólo un últimos recurso, y siempre muy controlado.<br>  Pero todo esto no es nada, no tiene ningún valor y no nos va ayudar en nada si no mantenemos en nuestra cabeza una palabra clave: <br>  Disciplina <br>  Si, debemos ser disciplinados en nuestros hábitos alimentarios y en nuestros ejercicios, ser más fuertes que nosotros mismos para cumplir con todas las recomendaciones y hacer todo lo mejor posible. No sólo lo mejor posible, sino hacerlo bien.<br>  Debemos alejarnos de los alimentos con alto contenido de grasas.<br>  Y tener en cuenta que durante la noche el metabolismo reduce su funcionamiento, por lo que los alimentos con alto contenido graso que consumamos durante el final del día serán más perjudiciales para el logro de nuestro objetivo que aquellos que consumamos temprano en la ma?ana. <br>  Dormir con el estomago muy lleno es terrible, ya que toda esa comida se almacena rápidamente en los depósitos de grasa del cuerpo. <br>  La disciplina en la dieta, combinada con la ejercitación regular y bien realizada es la clave para ganar este combate.<br>  Disciplina no es lo mismo que matarse de hambre. Es más importante comer bien y en los momentos adecuados que comer poco y mal. <br>  Siempre hay que mantener el organismo funcionando, por lo que hay que consumir alimentos, no saltearse comidas alegremente con la presunción de que eso nos ayuda a bajar de peso|`|91416e8c843d35eaafa5dad9cc49af2faa	pues realmente no te aconsego tomes cosas naturistas para bajar por que podrias tener algun rebote y todo sera pero, mejor es el ejercicio <br>  surte saludos??|`|a079decbcef2b3ac5edbe260d4c4af00aa	esta facil mija FUMA fumar  adelgaza   o no?|`|add35376f4856d551d11fc017d244ebaaa	mira, ninguna cosa facil te ayudara, no olvides ke todo esfuerzo tiene su rekompensa, piensa kuanto tiempo te tomo subir y no creeas ke bajar sera facil, debes tener un estilo de vida diferente, kon komida balanceada, ejercicio y agua..... piensa ke si todo lo ke venden en la tv funcionara, no habriamos tantos gorditos|`|fbdc5bf0ff53c7ee093f5522c54daa3baa	hola!!!!<br>  primero que todo tienes que comer moderadamente ..podrías remplazar las arinas por verduras y frutas ,por ejemplo en el almuerzo solo comer una arina porque solo una ariana pues fíjate que si comemos (arroz , papa, apasta,como suele ser un almuerzo ) el estomago solo asimila una de ellas lo cual hace que el espacio de tu estomago crezca mas y hace que te salga estomago y gordos en los lado por eso te aconsejo que en el almuerzo, la comía etc en tu plato solo debe haber una arina , trata de comer mas verduras y frutas y tomar mucha agua , dejar una pocos los lácteos las carnes rojas osea puedes comer eso pero moderadamente o debes en cuando , y lo mas importante hacer ejercicio...<br>  <br>  suerte y saludos!!|`|svXdXz2Iaa	Lo que tu buscas es un milagro! y lamento comunicarte que eso es imposible, NADA en esta vida se logra sin esfuerzo.

Y MUCHA SUERTE|`|34bdaa0709889dc4a24de4722189a153aa	Hola!!<br>  Bueno, mucho de cómo bajar de peso no sé, además Mercedes P ya dio la mejor respuesta (desde mi punto de vista).<br>  Quería sólo agregar cosas q convienen y no convienen hacer:<br>  1. Eso de tomar mucha agua es muy bueno, ayuda también a tener la piel más humectada, a tener más energías (sobretodo cuando hace mucho calor), a no tener retención de líquidos, es bueno para la celulitis y muchas cosas más. Recomiendan 2 litros (8 vasos) por día. Si podés tomar más (incluso 3 litros), mejor. <br>  2. Es conveniente no comer entre las "4 comidas", es decir el desayuno, el almuerzo, la merienda y la cena. Si tenés mucha hambre podés comer cosas chikitas, livianas, q se yo, alguna fruta chica, una gelatina (buena para las u?as), una barrita de cereal... o mejor, lo q intento de hacer yo, cada vez q tengo hambre entre comidas tomo un vaso de agua. Muchas veces sentimos hambre, pero en realidad es sed. Y si es hambre, bueno, con el vaso de agua llenás un poco la panza y te conformás, de paso tomás agua, jaja.<br>  3. No comas poco, comé lo necesario, nunca olvides las proteínas en la dieta diaria (carnes, leche, huevo y otros derivados del reino animal tienen proteínas). Pero prestá atención q los vegetales son muy importantes.<br>  4. También es verdad q es conveniente reducir (o eliminar) la ingesta de alcohol (incluso para la celulitis) y diría q las gaseosas también, de paso no ingerís gas (q por lo menos a mí, me hincha, así q dejé de tomar gaseosas).<br>  5. Hacé ejercicio, es importantísimo... vas haciendo abdominales, para aplanar la pancita... también hacé algo q sea aeróbico, una danza por ejemplo... algo q te haga sudar. De paso te llevás una botella de agua y tomás jajaja.<br>  6. No te confíes de esas dietas q te dicen de bajar mucho y rápido... quisás algunas funcionen, pero yo no confiaría mucho... mirá, acordate tampoco de no reducir alocadamente lo q comés... xq a una chica le pasó q agarró y adelgazó un montonazo en poco tiempo (estaba flakísima) y después cuando dejó de cuidarse, claro, empezó a comer más creo yo... o no sé q hizo, pero en otro poco tiempo engordó lo q había bajado, y más!<br>  7. No hagas caso a eso q dijo veneno, es una tontería fumar. El cigarrillo arrina la salud, y cuando querés dejar engordás.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos.... espero q te sirva algo d lo q te dije... y que puedas bajar esos kilitos! ... ah... pero no aspires a quedar así super flaca... xq no es lindo. Según sé, a los hombres no les gustan las huesudas, jaja, como dice mi primo "a los hombres les gusta agarrar", y si sos puro hueso no te van a poder agarrar.|`|49e97ddb0990cea69d972f7df47f34a7aa	hola.<br>  mira has ejercicio y yo te recomiendo que vayas con un nutriologo pero mira a ver no comas entre comidas  ni pan,ni tortillas  y toma 2 litros de ugua todos los dias|`|f92cf9953143effbe760d90c6e1ad17daa	adelgamate podes tomar para producir la secrecion de grasas corporales, pero sin hacer ejercicio no vas a ir a ningun lado, de ultima que quedandote sentadam, adelgasases, serias algo parecido a un flan desimflado, espero no haber sido duro, te recomiendo mucha fru, adelgamate, y ejercicios....|`|rnw373RRaa	pues si deberas quieres adelgazar, practica mucho el sexo, esa es la mejor solucion  por que aunque te esfuerses mucho ni cuenta te daras y podras quemar muchas calorias, es en serio.<br>  <br>  tan solo quemas mas calorias con los besos que haciendo 10 minutos de caminada.<br>  <br>  ademas tu piel va a estar mas humectada, vas a tener mas limpia la cara, por que los poros se limpian durante la faena.<br>  <br>  tienes mas produccion de feromonas asi que vas a atraer mas a las personas, y como el sexo es anti estres vas a vivir mas a?os.|`|uoVZoAeaaa	es tu dia desuerte hay te va una reseta infalible<br>    <br>  por las ma?anas te vas atomar un licuado<br>  <br>  es una rueda de pi?a sin el centro<br>  el jugo de 6 naranjas<br>  una taza de nopales en cuadritos<br>    <br>  <br>  lolicuas todo y te lo tomas en ayunas recuerdalo es por un mes y me dices lo q quieras si no te resulta|`|6beec817c852c8fa894db9f954dc4fc8aa	Todas las cosas buenas requieren esfuerzo<br>  te recomiendo<br>  ejercicio y comer cosas sanas como frutas y verduras disminuir grasas y alimentos basura ademas de ir a ver a un nutriologo|`|3e92a6f1e9c64ed49ea179b4758d0b9caa	Mira el mejor libro que he encontrado para adelgazar es.<br>  The Body Restoration Plan by Dr. Paula Baillie-Hamilton (expert in human metabolism) Cuesta menos de 7 dolares.<br>  Siguiendo las instrucciones he adelgazado (desde el 21 de Septiembre, 2006 hasta hoy Enero 25, 2007) 63 libras, (28.64 kilos) he comido como nunca (5 veces al día) y espero seguir bajando.<br>  De la talla 44 baje a la 38 (medidas americanas de pantalones), de XXL estoy en Large (camisas)<br>  Este libro habla de las calorías química como mas da?inas que las calorías de la grasa.<br>  Enumera las 12 comidas mas da?inas (las que da?an el cuerpo humano y hace que uno suba de peso por las calorías químicas)<br>  Here are the dirty dozen (las comidas mas sucias llenas de químicos que te hacen da?o al cuerpo y matan los "catecholamines" que son los que hacen quemar las grasas del cuerpo<br>  1.

59196925dc0ffd7d1db0ba0f1c412327aa	I would say no.  He may know that you don't have a lot of experience, but a virgin?  probably not.  Especially if you have popped.|`|f97b8fda569e8e29554fa9c50704fecbaa	i don't like the way young ones say "cherry being pop" and what they think it means. it refers to a bit of skin in the vagina called a hymen which can break even from horse riding. its nothing that you can really feel. and yes a guy will be able to tell because it will be most difficult for him to get his penis inside you. besides why lie. hell prolly like you more if you tell him your a virgin guys seem to like that.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	There is no way he can tell and you most likely did NOT break your hymen with tampons as the hymen has a hole in it that lets the tampon pass through.|`|4e309178eb9eead935f22beee55a5204aa	Yes, he will be able to tell when he enters you by how tight you are and when you bleed after.  He'll be mad at you that you LIED.  Never lie to a guy about sex.  He will never see you again.<br>  <br>  You cannot lose your hymen from tampons.  They aren't big enough.|`|67caeeba37104210ac71bf955eb9da3eaa	no, there really is no way for him to tell which is lucky for you since you lied!!!|`|e1d81ab1b0252d8330ceda63a8386c7faa	No, there is not really any way that he can tell that you are in fact a virgin. Only if you aren't relaxed or are scared if you guys have sex. That's pretty much the only way :)|`|00d6b5f6f6aae4166113bfda4f07e386aa	no|`|0e051207eb28f215974534459f38626faa	eww dont share that with us please it would all do us a favor to keep that personal!!|`|495481f28575ce0a7b26acf7554b09a2aa	Yes. Don't lie to him. Let him know that you are a virgin. He must be gentle, as the first time hurts like hell. You do not want him to be rushing into you without making you ready. The first time should be special. Enjoy. Else, I could assist pop your cherry if required|`|84c073d4574cdfd2b7b9e149a8ba5132aa	If your cherry hasn't popped, then he will know.  Plus, some women bleed during their first time.  Unless you pretend that you started your period!?!?<br>  <br>  You shouldn't give something to someone just like that.  You should be honest about the whole thing.  Most women during their first time just lie there.  If he thinks that you have experience, he might just think that you're a dead fish in bed!  No one wants that persona!<br>  <br>  P.S.  Make sure birth control & STD protection is something you intend on using.|`|f937adff5f3c4cccb61efe94f84f8a09aa	well its sorta not very common for tampons to break your hymen. stretch maybe but break no. tampons are small compared to guy parts to i doubt you really did break it but you could be one of the few who have it happen. also he might be able to tell if you are or not. becuase even after your first time of having sex it still hurts a few times after wards so if your going ow ow or are in pain then he may be able to telly ou are a virgin. he may also be able to tell f you are inexpieranced depending on whether hes a virgin to or not. but you should really tell him the truth because you should never lie or keep a secret from your boyfriend. y ou should just tell him the truth and say look.. i no it sounds stupid but i lied to you. im a virgin i just idnt want you to think i was a prude. he should understand. hope this helps :]
bQ49KWYyaa	You should see a doctor.|`|4Sl2P0xgaa	YES you need to visit the doctors office and try to talk w/ your mom about what is going on...
W5pzvZP8aa	It's not likely.  The bacteria that cause your UTI are in your urethra and bladder - it is not possible for the bacteria to travel up your intestines.  <br>  <br>  However, it is possible that your UTI is misdiagnosed and you actually have an internal infection which could cause a stomach ache and painful urination.  You could also just have a UTI with a stomach bug.  I suggest going to the doctor if you're unsure.|`|AA11368070	Stomach pain isn't common, but pain may radiate.  A UTI can progress to a kidney infection that will painful in your lower back.  This might cause some referred pain to your stomach.  I would say no if you're talking about nausea kinds of pain though.  If you're being treated, check the antibiotic you're on, most of those can cause some stomach distress especially nitrofurantoin.  If that's the case, take the med with full 8 oz. glass of water and with a large meal.|`|Efr3KdzMaa	Yes, if the UTI has progressed into the bladder you could be having what is called suprapubic pain, pain just above your pubic bone that radiates over the whole abdomen. Women have very short urethras (compared to men) and the bacteria does not have to travel very far up your urinary tract to reach your bladder. This can be very serious and could progress into your kidneys. It could also circulate and cause a blood infection (septicemia) which is very dangerous. Please go to the dr ASAP! You need antibiotics if you are not already on them

La otra razon principal es una mala función digestiva por excesos alimentarios. Hay muchas causas: insuficiencia hepatica, infecciones respiratorias, infecciones periodontales, caries, consumo de cigarrillos, inclusive intoxicación por metales o hasta cancer e4sofagico, pero no te preocupes por el momento.<br>  Te recomiendo acudir con un MEDICO, para ver si es prudente dar un ciclode antibiotico con amoxicilina y metronidazol. si con eso no mejora, un remedio menos ortodoxo, pero muy efectivo es una purga con aceite de ricino o un enema de agua hervida con linaza o manzanilla, o mejor aun, de cafe de grano molido fresco (no nescafe eh!) que se utiliza mucho en la medicina china.

AA10573602	First, find out (about) how many calories your body burns per day on average based on your age, gender, weight, physical activity, body type etc..you should go to a good nutritionist for that info.  <br>  <br>  Once you find out how many calories your body uses per day, begin eating 100 calories less than that per day.  For example, if you find that your body burns 2000 calories per day, begin eating around 1900 calories per day.  Every week, drop your calories per day another 100.  What I mean is, week 1, eat 1900 calories each day for 7 days; Week 2, eat 1800 calories per day for 7 days, Week 3, eat 1700 calories per day for 7 days.  Then for week 4, start all over at 1900.  Complete the cycles until you've lost a sufficient amount of weight, but don't go below 300 calories under what your body burns in a day.  I mean if your body uses 2000 calories in a day, don't eat less than 1700 calories in a day, because that's not healthy. Don't eat more than 2000 cals per day or however many calories your body burns in a day or else you won't lose weight.  It's the simplest concept in the world.  If you eat more calories than you burn in a day you will gain weight, if you eat less calories than you burn in a day you will loose weight.  But just don't eat too little calories in a day because although it will seem like your losing weight, when you starve your body like that, your body not only burns off fat, but also muscle.  Actually, whenever your not getting enough calories, your body is burning a combination of fat and muscle, but when you get way too few calories, your body begins to burn lots more muscle.  The problem with that, besides the obvious ones, is that the muscle you have burns lots of calories each day.  That means, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn and the easier it is for you to lose weight.  When you go overboard on a diet and get way to little calories, your body goes into overdrive and begins breaking down and burning up your muscles for energy.  Therefore, since muscle burns calories very well, as you loose more and more muscle from reducing your calorie intake too much, your body doesn't burn as many calories in a day as it did before.  Therefore, you have to work even harder too lose weight and eat even less calories and the cycle will go on until you either give up and gain the weight right back or get sick and gain the weight right back.  So, basically, reduce your calories, but not so much that you begin burning off all your muscle as well as fat.  <br>  <br>  Next, not only must you eat less, you need to eat healthy.  Look to the food guide pyramid and adjust the portions for the amount of calories you want to eat per day.  But make sure your eating from each food group everyday, fruits and veges are included..  And no matter what all logic tells you, you must eat a healthy amount of fat per day to stay healthy...not the bad fat of course, the good fat...there's is a big difference between the two.  Do some research on that.  Make sure to eat lots of protein also so that you prevent as much muscle loss as possible while you're losing weight.  So eat healthy along with eating less.  Do lots of research into what it means to eat healthy.  It can seem complicated but if you take the time, it becomes pretty simple.  Most importantly, don't get sucked into any fad diets...no southbeach diet crap, no atkins diet crap...none of that.  Eating a well balanced diet is the healthiest way to regulate proper body health and weight!  <br>  <br>  Exercise, but don't over do it.  You are losing weight, meaning you are depriving your body of it's proper daily caloric intake.  Physical activity is absolutely necessary, but don't think you are going to gain lots of muscle at the same time you are losing weight.  The human body doesn't work like that.  Do physical activity to help you lose weight but don't pump too much iron when you are trying too lose weight because then you are just going to begin breaking down your muscles instead of building them up and that will lead to less muscle and then that will lead to the failure of your diet.  So physical activity yes, but lifting heavy weight every day for 2 hours is a big no no while losing weight.  Worry about getting buff when your diet is over because in order to build muscle, your body actually needs to RECIEVE MORE CALORIES THAN IT BURNS IN A DAY, which is the opposite of dieting to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are only 14 and your body has lots of growing to do, so you don't want to deprive yourself of the growing fuel of food for too long.

First... everyone already knows the basic diet of eating healthy and exersice daily. But do they follow it in the meant to be way??? What I"m trying to say is, some people treat themselves to sweets and goodies more than what they need to be. An easy way to excersice healthily and eat good without killing yourself is to first train yourself to make the right choices. If your swimming and your trying to make a decent amount of laps in the pool, don't settle for 5 or 7 laps. GO to the extreme and do more like 10 or 15. Easy choices like that will help you gain self confidence. Now, for the eating part. Other than the regular of chips and a can of pop, try to eat yogurt with water, or carrots with lemon. Yum!! If your all in for the whole entire 'diet' thing, then you have to believe that you can loose the wieght. It helps!!!!! Use your resources.... the ab cruncher and the treadmill. Try going on the treadmill for like 3 times a week. Getting into those small but healthy routines are sure to prepare you for your goal!!!!|`|nAFYg4fDaa	Well, um...

AA11652335	Yep, it sounds like you have hereditary eye circles. My cousins are just like that. Since it is naturally causing you can try under eye circle cream. There is one (I think it's rather expensice) but I hear it might work. I think it's called Hylexin (about $95.00) There is "Eyecircle"for 60 dollars and so on.<br>  Because these are soooo expensive, I use a cheapo one for about $20. I cant remeber the name but I will include a link to a beauty website that can help:|`|0e3100826245be14af775478a72646c1aa	I have the same problem.<br>  It's called makeup.|`|161db62198d995197d1e8c2773f7f278aa	wel,this is maybe so cuz of iontensive reading or watching t.v.or surfing aslot on net.do u do any of these thgs?anyways i m 15 and ive the same problem but i ve dark circles cuz i am always reading.do u wear spectacles,if so,the circles are bcuz of this!|`|61e9bf8d1e42c3d8c9fe19944792aa2caa	I think if you are taking enough sleep and not taking tension also then u should take care of your nutrition, what you are taking whole day. it should include juice and soup with a proper balanced diet. Dark circle appear due to deficiency of haemoglobin and certain vitamins. you can take vitamin n iron capsule also.  As a home remedy you can apply cucumber and potato juice under your eyes. It will lighten your dark circle, if used continuosly. I hope it will work.|`|7789b3971ade0474b2052b8f9447a244aa	believe it or not, prep.

My wife and I are a big fan of Devita Skincare.<br>  <br>  They have an under eye cream that is great! Its Aloe based and Fragrance Free.<br>  <br>  The area under the eyes is very sensitive, so you dont want anything harsh.  It has a small amount of Hyluronic Acid, which is great for the circles and the puffiness.<br>  <br>  You can get Devita at any Health Food store (Whole Foods etc)|`|AA11498624	First, what do you consider enough sleep? Teenagers need different amounts of sleep than adults, it's suggested at least nine hours if possible. Then consider maybe you're not getting good sleep, like you have a sleeping disorder possibly. Second, consider if you're under lots of stress or whatnot. If these two do not prove to be correct, then it must be a genetic thing, and if you use make-up, like concealer, it should help with the circles. When looking for a concealer go with a concealer that is lighter than your natural skin tone because the dark circles will make the concealer look darker and you want to lighten those circles up.|`|a0fb406b8d6cbfacec0f3df4771ba77faa	It looks like it is genetic.  But maybe you can try obagi eye cream, get enough sleep every night, drink plenty of water, never rub your eyes, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and do a regular exercise.  That is the best you can do, if the black doesn't go totally, at least you will be healthy.|`|13f714b5ba67567790a2982701d064c5aa	You may need to take the inititive and talk to a Doctor.  I have had allergies all my life, but they do not generally cause dark circles under eyes.<br>  <br>    The fact that all three of you have this may be a symptom with an environmental cause.  I honestly do not know, but I find it.....interesting, were I a Doc, I would want to know what you three have in common, besides being related.<br>  <br>    Could be genetic disease, but the odds are against all three of you sharing a disease, so I would look to environmental toxins.  Perhaps Molds, bad water.......you need a pro to look at this.

Tu problema puede ser simple caspa (ti?a capitis) es decir un hongo que ataca la el cuero cabelludo de la cabeza, pero tambien se puede tratar de otra cosa.<br>  <br>  Como identificas la ti?a capitis?<br>  Facil, comezon, partes de cuero cabelludo irritadas y con huellas de rascado, descamacion de la parte mas superficial de la piel, que se identifica como polvillo blanco, fino, al sacudirse el cabello a contra-luz, o notar estos residuos en la ropa. Si este no es el caso, te sugiero visites a un medico, ya que la caspa no es causa frecuente de caida de cabello.<br>  <br>  Todos los shampoos que se anuncian en la television, se manejan unicamente como coadyuvantes en el tratamiento de la caspa, lo que tienes que buscar es Ketoconazol (o cualquier otro antimicotico) en shampoo, aplicarlo una vez al dia por unos 14 dias, procurar mantener la zona lo mas limpia y seca posible.<br>  <br>  Se ha notado que la caida de cabello guarda mucha relacion con los estados de animo, por lo que la depresion o el estres intensos pueden ocasionar su caida.

Otherwise your calories wont burn.  Second stay away from processed foods.  Try to stay as fresh as possible.  Eat large portions of fruits and veggies.  Smaller portions of meat and even smaller carbs.  Third eat 6 small meals a day.  You will be less likely to snack and take on calories that you dont need.  Eat slow, it takes 20 min for the stomach to send the signal to the brain that you are full and you will be less likely to over eat.  Also before meals drink 16oz of water, it will help you feel full without the extra calories.

Así disminuirá la grasa y se fortalecerán los músculos, las articulaciones y se mejorará la postura.|`|y64oC5I1aa	Bueno primero que nada el problema con nosotros los hombres es que la escasez de ejercicio durante la juventud debilita los musculos abdominales y esto a la postre da la famosa panza masculina presente en casi todos sean gordos o flacos. Te recomiendo ejercicios para fortalecer los músculos del abdomen es decir todas las variedades de abdominales que existen, empeza con poco y vas subiendo de intensidad eso si debe ser constante. Ahora con el pecho si tenés volumen y no es de músculo entonces es grasa y tenés que bajarla con ejercicio, luego tonificarlos con pesas o lagartijas.

i9YNS5jcaa	The simple answer is "It Depends." <br>  <br>  You should be aiming to consume from 1.5 - 2 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass, spread out evenly over the day.<br>  <br>  That said there are really four key times during the day that you need to make sure you have plenty of aminos in your system:<br>  <br>  1.) In the morning when you wake up. Your first meal should be a scoop or two of whey protein. Isolate or concentrate or a mix of the two, it doesn't matter. Whey is quickly digested so it's ideal for consumption in the morning, when your body needs quick fuel. Remember, you basically just fasted for eight hours.<br>  <br>  2.) 45 minutes before your workout. You want to have protein circulating in your system during training. Again, because whey is quickly digested, have around 20 grams of whey protein prior to your workout. Include some complex carbs as well. A small bowl of oatmeal is ideal.<br>  <br>  3.) Immediately after your workout. Consume 20-40 grams of whey as soon as you are done working out. Some simple carbs are also good at this point as well. Gatorade or even a bowl of rice chex work well. The carbs will help spike your insulin and drive the aminos into your muscles. Because your body is primed for nutrient uptake during the "anabolic window", very little of the sugar will be converted to fat. This is the one time during the day that sugars are good for you.<br>  <br>  4.) Right before bed. Here's when you want to skip the whey and go for something that digests more slowly. The best choice is a cup of lowfat cottage cheese, which can literally take 6-7 hours to completely digest. This means that during the night, you'll have a steady supply of protein.<br>  <br>  In between these key times, eat whole food sources of protein, like lean chicken, turkey, beef, pork or eggs, as well as beans and low-fat dairy.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|oIBOoYBvaa	Twice daily between meals.  Drink alot of water and dont fart near your girlfriend.|`|rmkwwUYcaa	I read just yesterday in Men's Health (Australian Edition), that it is actually better to take protein before your workout. Protein is really hard to digest and it takes time, so if you consume before your weight training it will be ready to be absorbed by your body by the time you finish. Interesting huh.|`|AA11928621	Right after you workout is best.<br>  <br>  But, obviously, you can't take it all at once, so you need to break it up throughout the day.<br>  <br>  I usually have some before AND after I workout (and I workout at the crack of dawn and at late night, so that's 4 times a day).<br>  <br>  Aim for 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight if you are really serious and have a stable weight lifting routine.|`|w9AHaAl3aa	Make sure you take a 100% whey protein ISOLATE powder, that hasnt been mixed with a whey protein concentrate, or other type of cheaper whey.  Allmax Isoflex is very good, and has NOS, glutamine and IS factors.  Its @ $50 canadian, so it should be cheaper in the states.  Its way better than alot of costly powders that mix concentrates with isloates. Take it 2-4 times a day, and before and after a workout.  <br>  allmaxnutrition.com

3df80d305b6e0b66e16f1f47c7d4ba39aa	Your pores are clogged from sweat and dead skin and probably a combination of other things that turn into pimples/blackheads.  People tend to overlook their back because it's kind of hard to manage and so it doesn't really get the care other parts, like say, your face does. Also, people with thicker and more coarse hair have a little more work than people who have little or no body hair because their pores tend to be bigger. Try exfoliating with a body scrub (preferably one made for body acne) a few times a week and then when you see the problem improve, twice a week.  Start getting into the habit of exfoliating and you'll see less and less blackheads. For the pimples, try a cream that is specially designed to dry out pimples.|`|e6c9e706aed539194d71ef3c48748d02aa	Pimples are eruptions of a few millimetres diameter occurring on the face, shoulders, chest and back during the adolescence and young adulthood. They are common between the shoulder blades as well as the chest. Some girls may have pimples between the breasts too. These result from blocked pores which are loaded with oil secreted from specialised oil glands in the skin.<br>  <br>  They appear naturally as a result of hormonal action. A sudden crop can also result from intake of cetain medications, corticosteroid tablets, oral contraceptive pills etc. Locally applied ointments may also result in pimples. <br>  <br>  <br>   You should consult a skin specialist / dermatologist to understand the cause and treat it.

qg8GOlEqaa	A stroke is serious - just like a heart attack. A stroke is sometimes called a "brain attack." Most often, stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain stops because it is blocked by a clot. The brain cells in the immediate area begin to die because they stop getting the oxygen and nutrients they need to function. It doesn't matter the age of the person.<br>  <br>  What causes a stroke?<br>  There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke, called ischemic stroke, is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke, called hemorrhagic stroke, is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. <br>  <br>  What disabilities can result from a stroke?<br>  Stroke damage in the brain can affect the entire body - resulting in mild to severe disabilities. These include paralysis, problems with thinking, problems with speaking, and emotional problems. <br>  <br>  Know the Signs. Act in Time<br>  Stroke Symptoms<br>  Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)<br>  <br>  Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech<br>  Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes<br>  <br>  Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination<br>  <br>  Sudden severe headache with no known cause<br>  <br>  What should you do?<br>  Because stroke injures the brain, you may not realize that you are having a stroke. The people around you might not know it either. Your family, friends, or neighbors may think you are confused. You may not be able to call 911 on your own. That's why everyone should know the signs of stroke - and know how to act fast. <br>  <br>  Don't wait for the symptoms to improve or worsen. If you believe you are having a stroke - or someone you know is having a stroke - call 911 immediately. Making the decision to call for medical help can make the difference in avoiding a lifelong disability.|`|54dc70f570668dbdfd75c05c65d40115aa	A stroke is the sudden death of brain cells due to a problem with the blood supply. When blood flow to the brain is impaired, oxygen and important nutrients cannot be delivered. The result is abnormal brain function. Blood flow to the brain can be disrupted by either a blockage or rupture of an artery to the brain. There are many causes for a stroke:<br>  <br>  Blockage of artery-<br>      * Clogging of arteries within the brain (for example, lacunar stroke)<br>      * Hardening of the arteries leading to the brain (for example, carotid artery occlusion)<br>      * Embolism to the brain from the heart or an artery<br>  <br>  Rupture of an artery (hemorrhage)-<br>     * Cerebral hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain substance)<br>      * Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding between the brain and the inside of the skull)<br>  <br>  Basically, the blockage of an artery in the brain by a clot is the main cause of a stroke. The part of the brain that is supplied by the clotted blood vessel is then deprived of blood and oxygen. The cells of that part of the brain die as a result.<br>  <br>  Another type of stroke may occur when a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque (cholesterol and calcium deposits on the wall of the inside of the heart or artery) breaks loose, travels through open arteries, and lodges in an artery of the brain. When this happens, the flow of oxygen–rich blood to the brain is blocked and a stroke occurs.<br>  <br>  Most common cause of a stroke is high blood pressure. Other things that can increase the risk is diabeties, high cholesterol certain heart conditions.  Other causes in younger adults are as followed: drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, ruptured aneurysms, and inherited (genetic) predispositions to blood clotting. Smoking and second hand smoke can increase the risk even more so if on birth control. Heavy use of alcohol is also a risk factor (more so for binge drinkers). And being physically inactive or being overweight.<br>  <br>  A stroke is a serious thing and can get worse overtime. I know my mother has had 5 mini strokes and one bad one. It has completely messed up her ability to think or talk straight. It is something I am dealing with at this moment in my life. Some patients return to a near–normal condition with minimal awkwardness or speech defects. Many stroke patients are left with permanent problems such as hemiplegia (weakness on one side of the body), aphasia (difficulty or the inability to speak), or incontinence of the bowel and/or bladder. A significant number of persons become unconscious and die following a major stroke.<br>  <br>  I will keep your friend in my thoughts and prayers and if you need someone to talk to you can contact me on here.|`|82fe063c61ca01ede53b9733ddc9bf77aa	Sadly no one is too young to have a stroke, and my Mum was the same age (32) when she had her first one.  No one here will be able to tell you how bad it may be.  But remember that physiotherapy does work if you put the effort in!  After my Mum's stroke she no feeling/movement in her left side, but within two years she was walking and driving.  Good luck though, and I hope your friend pulls through.|`|c86e8bdf5fa50d091ae5a7648d6a2805aa	Any stroke is considered serious, but every stroke is different.  Some are very small, and don't have a major effect on the body, and others can affect functioning.  Unfortunately it's difficult to say without further details.  <br>  <br>  Hope she's ok!

You have to be aware of your eating habits when taking it, you may realize that you have not eaten in a whole day or a day and a 1/2 and when you do you may have to choke something down.<br>  <br>   Tenncare will not pay for a diet drug, it is not a regular insurance Co.
oHXhgaNEaa	Stop with the bike the entire time. You will never develop a tone body. <br>  <br>  You need to lift 25 pd free weights. shoulders, chest, biceps and triceps.

Do alot of reps per set on relatively low weight like 20-25 pd free weights. <br>  <br>  6 days a week is great. do the weights for at least half your workout. The bike and running machine are for girls. <br>  <br>  Do that half the amount of time.<br>  <br>  You need to eat low fat as well or you will  never achieve a lean toned look.<br>  <br>  Lean chicken, fish, turkey, rice,  fruits, vegatables. Anything low fat high protien.<br>  <br>  Immediatly following a work out it is critical that you have a 50 gram protein shake. A low fat, High protein shake is the most essential part of maximixing the muscular tone from your work out. <br>  <br>  You should work out with low weights, hi reps thirty minutes a day at least and consume at least 150 grams of lean protein a day along with a low fat diet and you will be cut, ripped, lean and tone.

At any rate, I started masturbating and haven't stopped yet - and my penis is not big.  Go figure.

Agora vc deve estar se perguntando como é que se pega doen?as como a Aids ao se fazer a tatuagem... bom, pelo o que eu entendi qdo eu li sobre o assunto, é que há tatuadores que podem ser "sacanas" e utilizar a mesma agulha em 2 ou mais pessoas... por isso antes de fazer a tatuagem vc deve conhecer muito bem o lugar, o tatuador e principalmente ver se ele troca as agulhas durante a sess?o...<br>  <br>  Bjsssss...|`|ljaK7NGzaa	Olá!<br>  O que eu sei, é que realmente n?o pode, entretanto apneas durante um período de 6 meses.

What a great time to make a resolution to lose weight! I wish you the best of luck in it. <br>  <br>  You really have to look at two areas of your life and adjust them to match your goals:<br>  <br>  *   Diet<br>  *   Exercise<br>  <br>  You simply can't get around these two facts. You have to consume fewer calories than you burn each day to loose weight. So if you don't change your diet, then you'll have to exercise more. Frankly, it's easier to adjust both things. Eat less, or eat smarter and exercise moderately. You don't have to go overboard. A 20 minute walk around the block is exercise.<br>  <br>  Find someone who can share the goal with you. Another overweight friend who will walk with you. That helps a lot. You can encourage each other.<br>  <br>  Here are a few other resources that might be helpful to you:<br>  <br>  Lose Weight and Gain Muscle -> <a href="http://watersaffl.burnthefat.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS" rel="nofollow">http://watersaffl.burnthefat.hop.clickba...</a><br>  <br>  Weight Loss for Dummies -> <a href="http://watersaffl.4idiots.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS" rel="nofollow">http://watersaffl.4idiots.hop.clickbank....</a><br>  <br>  Weight Watchers -> <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!

Cut down on the calories you drink, they really add up quick.  Eat breakfast it speeds up you metabolism for the entire day.  If you snack and you know you will...substitute light popcorn for chips, or if you want sugar snack on cereal.  Don't ever, ever deny yourself anything, just modify.  If you deny yourself things than you will be focused on them.  Try and stay active.  Remember...small changes.  Just wiggling your foot instead of just sitting there could save you 20lbs per year.  Don't eat within 3 hours of bed.  Your body won't be needing the the extra, therefore it will store it the quickest way possible...around your intestines.  When your eating take smaller bites...slow down and enjoy it!!!  Try not to stuff yourself, just eat until your satisfied. These have really worked for me.

A good idea is taking up a sport, that way you are committed to excersize everyday, rather than just whenever you feel like. With sports, you'll be loosing the calories that you normally would have kept. I do track in the spring and i can continue to eat everything i like, but not worry about wight. A sport will also keep you in shape. You may also want to set up realistic goals, such as not drinking any soda. If you drink a lot of soda, it may also help to cut back, I heard taht people who don't drink soda or diet soda, weigh ten pounds less then those who do. Whatever you decide to do, good luck!

El efecto puede ser de placer y algo de euforia manifestada en breves ataques de risa. No se alucina, sólo hierbas de variedades con mucho THC (tetrahidrocannabinol, principio activo de la marihuana) podrían provocarte alguna clase de alucinación. Se tiene la impresión -y es parte del efecto- de tener más percepción sensorial, por eso al fumarla nos agrada escuchar música, salir a caminar, observar la naturaleza, comer, etc. También puede provocar una especie de "alargamiento" temporal, es decir que 10 minutos te parecen 40. Básicamente esos son los efectos cuando es placentero y a corto plazo. También te falla la memoria, olvidas peque?os detalles, pero eso cesa cuando se termina el efecto o dejas de fumarla. A largo plazo, su utilización puede provocar paranoia, crisis de ansiedad o pánico, los fumadores al menos una vez han experimentado un ataque de pánico, sientes que vas a ahogarte. Claro que, hay personas a las que esto nunca ocurre. No hay sobredosis por fumarla, no importa cuanto fumes. Sólo te puedes intoxicar seriamente con ella si la comes y has comido en exceso, es la única forma de sufrir una sobredosis. No causa impotencia. Da?a menos que un cigarrillo pero la combustión afecta el sistema respiratorio. No provoca dependencia física y es más fácil que dejar que el alcohol o el cigarro, o incluso que el café. Excepto los ataques de pánico, la paranoia, o las crisis de ansiedad, la marihuana no tiene otro efecto nocivo comprobado. Los efectos pueden variar de persona en persona. <br>  <br>  ?Saludos!|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Primero te pones bien locote<br>  y uno de los efectos es que te sangra la nariz mucho en cualquier momento|`|37064f873be65cc04a8d393c03a0b4a5aa	LA MARIHUANA, ENTRE OTRAS COSAS, CAUSAN MULTIPLES PROBLEMAS NEUROLOGICOS, PSICOLOGICOS, SOCIALES Y HASTA BIOQUIMICOS.

9d43efa89b1d518e37f1b078e018fa83aa	Pues, héte aquí que una vez se me ocurrió depilarme  (rasurarme) antes de la consulta a la ginecóloga y cuando me revisó casi se escandalizó... como diciéndome si yo estaba medio chiflada, de haberme depilado tanto... Desde entonces, nunca más me rasuré (ni mucho menos depilarme, por Dios, qué dolor). Y los diferentes ginecologos/as que me han visto en mi larga existencia, jamás me dijeron más nada al respecto. Lo que es natural, es natural. Lo que sí debes hacer es darte una ducha común y corriente, y llevar bombacha y corpi?o limpios ( o mejor, nuevos) para la consulta, no porque el médico se vaya a asustar o a extra?ar, sino por tu propia seguridad, te vas a sentir más tranquila estando limpita y también por respeto al profesional. pero no ensayes nada de duchas vaginales, o jabones perfumados especiales, o desodorantes, porque esto entorpece el correcto diagnóstico del profesional y aparte, porque no son saludables. Lo que también te recomiendo, es que anotes todas tus dudas en un papel, y lo lleves contigo a la consulta, así no te olvidas de nada y le preguntes al doctor si te puede proporcionar un número telefónico donde encontrarlo  para consultarle alguna otra cosita. Si es un buen  (o buena) profesional, no tendrá ningún problema en ponerse a tu disposición. La mayoría de los médicos tienen una gran vocación. Ah! Y si por algún motivo no te satisface ese profesional, estás en tu derecho a cambiar cuantas veces creas necesarias para conseguir uno de tu entera confianza. Es una relación muy larga la que mantenemos las mujeres con el ginecólog@, por lo tanto, hay que poder elegirlo a nuestro gusto y conveniencia.

A veces me canso de responder preguntas como la tuya aquí. Pero bueno, supongo que la educación sexual no anda muy bien.<br>  <br>  Si, puedes quedar embarazada. Sólo basta con un espermatozide que entre a tu vagina. No es necesario que tu pareja eyacule pues el líquido preseminal que suele lubricar el pene de tu compa?ero también puede contener algún espermatozoide aunque son muy pocas las posibilidades, digamos que de 1%. Lo del himen, mira igual el himen es tan frágil que puedes o no tenerlo. Si anduviste en bicicleta, montaste a caballo o practicaste algún deporte de contacto es posible que ?Bye Bye Hymen!, así que eso déjalo de lado. Lo mejor es que tu compa?erito se ponga un condón y usted se deje de "ponerle las peras a 25", se ponga flojita, abra bien las piernitas y lo hagan de manera segura y deliciosa, sin más preocupaciones que las caricias y el goze.<br>  <br>  Si tienes dudas sobre estar o no embarazada, puedes para mayor seguridad consumir una pildora de emergencia, funciona hasta tres días después del coito. De lo contrario espera a ver que si llega tu periodo en la fecha calculada, sino lo hace practicate una prueba y sales de dudas.<br>  <br>  Pienso que lo tuyo es puro susto de principiante, así que relájate, si te asustas podrías retrasar tu regla por el stress y provocarte un susto mayor. La regla también se retrasa por estar nerviosa o asustada.<br>  <br>  Bueno...<br>  <br>  ?Suerte!<br>  <br>  Y para la próxima...<br>  <br>  usen un condón y sólo disfruten.<br>  <br>  Ciao.|`|sWnsbjRFaa	la respuesta a tu pregunta es que si puedes quedar embarazada por que siempre los hombres expanden una gran cantidad de espermatozoides y lo que conocemos como semen y si tu estas expuesta aunque no te penetre y aunque estés con ropa tienden a dentrar y contraer alguna enfermedad venérea también además de  quedar embarazada  mi consejo que si lo hacen usen un condón para mejor protección|`|64e0be42648b9f131d280bf366f6e537aa	Primero lo que tienes que hacer es ir a un ginecologo que te dara informacion mas detallada . segundo debes usar un condon por si la situacion pasa mas alla que una caricia y por ultimo te digo que si realmente no hay penetracion y liquido (semen )no tienes porque quedar enbarazada.<br>  Recomiendo si quieres tener actividades sexuales recurrir al medico de confianza para que te indique el mejor anticonceptivo que puedes utilizar segun tu edad ,ect.pues no solo existe el condon tambiern hay pastillas . suerte|`|71083d7bc8d4851ed3ab4b0478e9c52baa	mi hermana quedó embarazada tan sólo por echarse miradas cachondas con su novio|`|EILvVw8Laa	Existe el riesgo, sí. La vagina segrega una mucosa que es perfecta para que los espermatozoides naden hasta el útero.

It stinks a lot of the time, but I use a heating pad and take ibuprofen. Also, the cramping in your legs and knees is from your menstural. Because the cramping is so great in your tummy it is also knotting up muscles in your knees and thighs. Again, use a heating pad... Sometimes mine get so pad I can't walk. My doctor said there was nothing I could do about it. There is the pill which will monitor your period and help ease your cramps some of my friends use that... and I have worse cramps than they every did but I don't want to be on the pill... It's just a matter of choice. But anyway, don't worry it is normal in some of us unlucky ladies to have a very heavy period... The heavier the period the heavier the cramps. Use a heating pad; that's my best advice.. and try to literally sleep through it.

kIMMC09Yaa	hey wapa aki os dejo una respuesta favorable espero ke os guste<br>  significado de del sue?o de mi amiga <br>  Tener uno cariado, pérdida de cosas materiales. Un diente extraído, alejamiento de personas queridas. Flojo, abatimiento y depresión. Sano, buenas amistades y cari?os verdaderos. Sanos y ense?arlos quere decir que se avecinan tiempos de prosperidad y de riqueza, exito en todo lo que iniciemos. Que sobresale de los demás, cambios radicales que se manifestarán en su vida y muy pronto. En general, para los autores modernos la caída o pérdida total de la dentadura advierte que vamoa a recibir riquezas insospechadas y que en el futuro vamos a ser muy felices, ya que estas riquezas nos van a permitir llevar la vida que deseábamos. En el aspecto afectivo la pérdida total de los dientes significa que serremos felices, pero que debemos trabajar muy duro para mantener esta felicidad y, sobre todo, tener mucho cuidado con las personas que nos importan si no queremos perderlas.|`|1VNE8Zwtaa	Yo tambien he so?ado eso muchas veces, se sue?a porque estás preocupada por algo, no tiene relacion ninguna con que se te vayan a caer. <br>  Si se me cayese y no tuviera dinero para ponerme otro trabajaria mas horas o pediria un credito, pero yo sin diente no me quedo.

Por ejemplo mucha gente afirma que es se?al de muerte y te espanta y esas cosas, pero yo te puedo decir que cuando a mi me pasa es se?al de problemas internos muy fuerte, y créelo que es verdad.

Si lo deseas, puedes adquirir el tan popular corazón plástico con resorte, y a?adirle a estos ejercicios varias repeticiones presionándolo y soltándolo frente a tu busto. <br>  <br>  1. Reafírmalo <br>  <br>  Este ejercicio es ideal para redondear su forma. Siéntate en una silla, pon tu espalda bien recta, y contrae el abdomen y las pompis. Flexiona tus brazos frente a tu pecho y cierra los pu?os. Haz círculos muy rápidos con los brazos, cerca de 100 giros por minuto, durante unos tres minutos. <br>  <br>  2. Levántalo<br>  <br>  Inclínate sobre una banca, recarga una rodilla y forma un ángulo recto. Del lado de la pierna doblada, coloca la mano en la banca. Toma la pesa con el otro brazo, flexiona el codo y gira la palma de la mano hacia adelante. Levanta despacio la pesa hacia atrás y hasta el nivel de tu busto, mantenla diez segundos y bájala despacio. Haz diez repeticiones con cada lado. <br>  <br>  3. Auméntalo<br>  <br>  Con ejercicios no es posible aumentar el volumen del seno, pero sí el del músculo que lo sostiene. Acuéstate boca arriba con las piernas dobladas, los talones en el piso y toma las pesas. Flexiona los brazos a la altura de tu pecho y estíralos. Haz dos series de diez repeticiones. <br>  <br>  4. Fortalécelo<br>  <br>  a. Acuéstate de espaldas en la banca, junta las rodillas y contrae el abdomen. Toma las pesas, levanta los brazos frente a ti y con los codos ligeramente flexionados, formando un círculo.<br>  <br>  b. Inhala y baja despacio los brazos hacia los lados hasta el nivel de tu pecho. Exhala y sube a la posición inicial.

The opposite situation, in which the TSH level is low, usually indicates that the person has an overactive thyroid that is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).Individuals who have hyperthyroidism will have an elevated FT4, whereas patients with hypothyroidism will have a low level of FT4.

Or you can pull it back down.<br>  <br>  This is usually as a result of not pulling it back when you were younger, so what you have to do is when you shower, slide it back each time so it'll 'stretch' out.

1mYDmIftaa	Extreme dehydration will cause those symptoms; Headaches; backaches; constipation.....<br>  Are you lips dry/cracked?  and have you been under allot of stress lately; more than usual anyway.   Because when I get to feeling like this, its due to high amounts of stress or I'm not taking care of myself the way I should.   Here's some suggestions to relieve it, try them for one day and feel for the difference.<br>  <br>  Feel the spine at the bottom of your skull, does it feel like a knot on the side of your spine (your vertabrae could be twisted as well) mine does that every now and then when I'm under stress....it cause me headaches until my neck pops.   I do stretching exercise, as follows: <br>  <br>  1. Take your chin put it down to your chest, put your hands on the back of your head and gently pull it more toward your chest (if you feel pain, like a burning) then your neck probably needs adjustment.  Keep doing the exercise.<br>  2. Rotate your neck in wide circles both directions, big big circles; lay your head down on your shoulder and roll it all the way around.   At least 8 times both directions<br>  3. Turn your head to look back over each shoulder at least 8 times each way.<br>  4. Tilt your head down to your chest then back to your back; do this at least 8 times.<br>  5.  Drink a 1/2 gallon of water, at least, within the next couple of hours.  Keep this up everyday.....to avoid it.<br>  6.  Take a multi-vitamin/mineral along with a multi- B vitamin  & extra potassium (to relieve muscles, if your low on any vitamins especially B's & potassium this can cause muscles cramps anywhere in your body)  also if your dehydrated you low on vitamins<br>  7.  Take Dulcolax to soften your stool, until your bowels move.   Then just keep drinking the water and that will help to avoid constipation.<br>  8....also another very good stretch for your back to relieve muscles in your lower back.   Sit with the bottom of your feet together on the floor....butterfly position.   Hold on to your feet with both hands, push your knees toward the floor, and pull your nose towards your toes.....arch your back for a minute then straighten for a min.....repeat pull down toward your toes, hold for awhile to get the muscles good and stretched and relieve tension.  Do this for about 10 minutes.....This is a miracle stretch for me.   When my neck/head/back start hurting, it relieves a whole lot of tension.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps....|`|UXEnuXVWaa	This is something that you shouldn't ignore.

You're then going down the slippery slope of more pain medicines followed by more headaches and migraines. To stop this vicious cycle you have to stop the medicine which means you're going to go through a severe and painful detox that will last for about three days.<br>  <br>  Since even medicine like aspirin and Tylenol type substances can trigger the rebound effect, Dr. Fred Shiftily, the director and founder of The New England Center for Headache, believes the situation to be so serious that he thinks there should be labels on these and other drugs warning of the rebound effect.<br>  <br>  So for an effective natural treatment, ...Shiatsu works FAST, and you can learn it yourself, without recurring drug costs and complications. <br>  <br>  For a video demo you can go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.instantheadacherelief.com/select_connection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.instantheadacherelief.com/sel...</a><br>  <br>  Other help: (triggers,vitamins, natural chemicals in the body);<br>  <a href="http://www.instantheadacherelief.com/migraines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.instantheadacherelief.com/mig...</a><br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|e595460767275bca49d6fa36fd2310b2aa	Don't plan anything drastic until you revisit your Doctor.<br>  I had a brother with those sympthoms once!

It was just that the little things seemed to push me over the edge. I have been in counseling for a long time, and the best advice i have got is. "Don't let it upset you, you have a choice. Think about it. Do you really want some stupid little thing to ruin your day." It is not easy, but if you don't let them, they cannot upset you. Sometimes i walk in the house and it looks like a bomb has hit it, the boys are laying on the couch doing nothing, and ask what"s for tea. I really want to go berserk, but i take a deep breath, ignore them, and refuse to look at the mess until i have calmed down. They soon learnt that i was pissed and eventually they only left a small pigsty in the corner. It"s not easy to do, but i have found that it works for me. Hope this helps. Good luck|`|Bb6Jr1Eeaa	Dude, there's probably something underlying the anger problems.  Maybe stemming from your childhood, something to do with your relationship with a loved one or friend, or even work stresses.  If not any of those things, it might even be just life in general.<br>  <br>  I have been desperately trying to help out my partner how has anger issues.  He'll get annoyed even if he cant find the remote control in the 5 seconds he decides he wants it.  I know what his problems are.  His dad left when he was younger, his mum blamed him although he was only 12, how could he have been to blame.  He also has aot of animosity for the world.  He doesnt like the fact that he cant get a good job because all the *good* jobs go to immigrants who will work for half the wages they offer in the first place.  He worrys about me because I have various health problems including glaucoma and he worries that I might have an accident walking to work because I cant see things to the left or right of me in my peripheral sight because I have lost that much vision.  He worries that his grandmum is getting ill and there's nothing he can do because its old age.<br>  <br>  You need to realise that people around you do not want to hurt you emotionally.  They are there to help you, and we are only human, there's only so much we can do.  If you have a loved one who you can talk to, or even just a friend, you will find that talking to them about any problems or insecurities you have helps.  It will get the problems off your chest, but more importantly, you will understand what the source of your angry feelings are.  Knowing what causes it is the main key to overcoming it.  If you are brave enough, or if friends and relatives are not the right people to be speaking to, it is always a good idea to try to see a counsellor or psych.  This doesnt mean there is anything wrong with you mentally as some people think and so take offense to what I have just said, but rather, they are the professionals.  They will know in very little time what is the cause of your problems.  They will do their very best to help you, and with a little willingness to overcome this yourself, you will pull through it.<br>  <br>  Good luck x<br>  <br>  <br>  One more thing....MEDICATION DOES NOT HELP.  OK you may feel all great and floaty whilst you're taking it, but one day you're gonna come off it.  What happens to your problems?  They're still there.  All you have done is surpressed them.  What is the point in that?  You'll just have to delve deeper, and you'll be angry for not knowing why you're angry.  taking meds for anger is pure stupidity.|`|VYdeDVn4aa	prozac! i cant believe the differance it made! i used to blow everything way out of porportionj until  i started taking it GOOD LUCK!!

6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	The rash from poison ivy/oak/sumac doesn't spread.  The reason it may appear to spread is because more sensitive skin tends to break out sooner and less sensitive skin later.  Or you may be re-exposing yourself from unwashed clothes, shoes, pets and other things that may be contaminated with the oil.  Once you wash the urushiol (the chemical in the sap that causes the allergic reaction) off your body and anything else contaminated you shouldn't get any more.  Wash with a grease-dissolving soap such as Dawn dish detergent.  Regular bar soap is not very effective in dissolving the oil and may just spread it around.  It's very important to do this in a shower not a bath.  In a bath the oil simply floats on the surface and will get on your skin when you get out of the tub.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	use rubbing alcohol|`|9jNFc3TNaa	See your family Physician.

(example: if you just love ice cream, imagine you are eating a frozen kidney or something that will disturb you. criticize the food as much as posssible like thinking: ew this texture is so nasty and its too cold. yuck!) even though ice cream is delicious, these negative thoughs will help a little bit.<br>  -keep busy so you are not always thinking about food. keeping your mind occupied will help you think about other things.<br>  - learn when you acctually feel HUNGRY, not just bored or just want to eat just-because.<br>  - eat 4-6 small meals everyday of about 2-300 calories each. it will keep your metabolism working and its easier & better for your body to digest smaller portions at a time.<br>  - dont just cut out your favorite foods. indulge sometimes so it doesnt stack up; and eventually you burst and have 3 gallons of ice cream.

AA10847653	Although most of us associate AIDS with severe illness, on January 1, 1993, the CDC expanded the definition of AIDS to include people with a T cell count of 200 or less who have no illness or symptoms.

(3) Since 1993, more than half of all new AIDS cases diagnosed each year have been among people who have no clinical symptoms or disease. (4)<br>  <br>  It is only through expansions of the AIDS definition that the number of new AIDS cases has grown. The definition of AIDS in America has been expanded three times since 1981.

So strong that it can be quite scary actually.<br>  <br>  The problem is that you build a tolerance and dependancy quite quickly. You need more and more to feel good. Once you have a dependancy, you need to do it just to feel normal or you will become REALLY sick REALLY fast.|`|fd020c86a836b3dc33ccbe894dbbe784aa	I wrote this in my journals about heroin:<br>  <br>  'You have no idea how much fear resides in you until you are relieved of it entirely.'<br>  <br>  That is what it is like to be on heroin.

It isn't too extreme and it does the trick. Cardio is good for burning off fat.|`|a5m0zLeZaa	To be honest with you, I would focus most importantly on your diet.  Eat smaller portions.  Most cannot do this 1st step.  Make sure you do 30 min. of cardio exercise 3 times a week.  And most importantly be consistent, do not give up, or be lazy.  You must put constant effort in if you want to get something out of it.  Results only appear after YOU put in the hard work.  Be patient give yourself more time than you think you need to see results.

Some people have only a few symptoms, while others may have many symptoms at once. Symptoms of depression include:<br>  <br>      * A sad feeling that will not go away<br>      * Restlessness or slowed movements<br>      * Changes in appetite or weight<br>      * Changes in sleeping patterns<br>      * A lack of interest in activities that usually provide pleasure<br>      * Fatigue or lack of energy<br>      * Feeling worthless, or feeling guilty for no reason<br>      * Trouble concentrating or making decisions<br>      * Repeated thoughts of death or suicide <br>  <br>  Both adults and children with depression can have their depression get worse and/or they can become suicidal. This can happen if they take an antidepressant or not. Patients treated with EFFEXOR XR should be watched closely for signs that their condition is getting worse or that they are becoming suicidal. Such signs should be reported to their doctor right away.<br>  <br>  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)<br>  GAD is characterized by feelings of excessive anxiety and worry that can't be controlled and are present for at least 6 months. Other symptoms of GAD include:<br>  <br>      * Restlessness or feeling on edge<br>      * Fatigue<br>      * Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank<br>      * Irritability<br>      * Muscle tension<br>      * Difficulty sleeping <br>  <br>  Social anxiety disorder<br>  People with social anxiety disorder have an extreme, constant fear of one or more social or public situations. This fear severely disrupts day-to-day functioning. Other symptoms of social anxiety disorder may include:<br>  <br>      * Avoiding social situations<br>      * Intense self-consciousness in social settings<br>      * Physical symptoms such as blushing, sweating, trembling, fast heartbeat, and nausea<br>      * Unreasonable fear of embarrassment

f849296caf2addd55be65fe21f395d13aa	Non sarai Rocco ma non penso che i tuoi 12cm ti impediscano di avere una vita sessuale normale...<br>  l importante all fine e usarlo...|`|AA10201034	A livello medico (fisico) non hai nessun problema, perchè anche peni di dimensioni minori possono copulare e fecondare! Al di sotto dei 10 cm. si comincia a porre qualche problema di "stimolazione" vaginale in quanto la donna prova meno "piacere & sensazioni". Il problema è totalmente psicologico sia da parte dell'uomo che ne è vittima che delle eventuali future compagne. Per fare un paragone banale, è come quando si ha il naso aquilino, si respira e si può vivere benissimo.... ma ci si sente menomati e non a tutti piace vederlo! Consigliarti di andare avanti come se niente fosse significa essere grossolani e semplicistici, non valutando le profonde implicazioni psicologiche e sociali che un simile caso comporta e, comunque, di non prevedere, come già accennato, anche una possibile insoddisfazione di un partner pù esigente. Come qualcuno ha già scritto, di sistemi o medicine non ve ne sono e quindi il primo consiglio è quello di non fidarti dei "venditori" di illusioni che trovi a decine in giro sul web. Qualcuno parla bene del metodo "Jelq" che trattandosi di semplici e gratuiti esercizi, potrebbe avere qualche fondamento di verità, ma richiede pazienza e molto ... molto tempo per dare deboli risultati (se efficace!) In ultima analisi rimane l'intervento chirurgico, che una volta era poco consigliato.... oggi non sò e dovresti ovviamente parlarne con un buon urologo.|`|gxBx59QOaa	vabbe sarai un po sotto la media ( che e circa 14-15cm) pero non devi assolutamente fartene un problema, certo se trovi la p.uttanel.la allora magari te lo fara notare, ma se trovi una ragazza con cervello fidati che non avrai nessun problema.|`|036ddc84a8ee13c6f35cbf1861cc5960aa	preoccupato di cosa? rientri nella norma! e poi ricorda che l'importante non è la dimensione ma come lo si usa!|`|4D2yVZuAaa	ciao,non preoccuparti,in genere il membro cresce fino a circa 24 anni,almeno cosi ricordo di aver letto da qualche parte,ad ogni modo un pene di 12 cm fa il suo lavoro egregiamente,so di interventi chirurgici mirati all'allungamento del pene ma l'allungamento non è visibile quando il pene è in tiro,è visibile solo col pene a riposo,si tratta di recidere un legamento che praticamente fa fuoriuscire quella parte di pene che non fuoriesce naturalmente,ma ribadisco che il vantaggio lunghezza è osservabile solo col membro a riposo,in condizione di erezione l'allungamento non è apprezzabile!|`|Qu0XMdZIaa	la sessuologa dice che il pene dovrebbe misurare esattamente 12 cm quindi nn c'è da preoccuparsi|`|JZllqdeLaa	devi tenertelo così com'è. l'imporante nn è la dimensione ma se funziona e se 6 capace di farlo funzionare bene<br>  TSK|`|ROtXErEjaa	Cavolo stai messo proprio male,condoglianze!quando fai pipi'ti porti la lente d'ingrandimento per ritrovarlo?Ehi per prenderlo usi le pinzette?<br>  Poveri noi,ma leggi le dimensioni medie?Sei nella norma non ti fare problemi che non esistono,se andassi da un chirurgo ti riderebbe in faccia,ciao mandingo.|`|VJDxfHDxaa	Credo che l'opinione di una donna valga doppia..al di là che i preservativi sono mediamente preformati per un pene delle tue dimensioni, quindi perfettamente nella norma, la verità è che la maggior parte delle terminazioni nervose di una donna sono poco dopo l'ingresso della vagina. E inoltre non vorrei essere banale, ma l'eccitazione in una donna è più emotiva che meccanica, dunque potresti far raggiungere il massimo piacere alla tua girl soltanto parlandole piano in un orecchio e accarezzandola dietro ad un ginocchio..Ora faccio una battuta per sdrammatizzare ulteriormente, che davvero non hai di che preoccuparti..casomai fai che la tua girl sia orientale, che senza dubbio sarebbe più stretta e meno profonda di una caucasica :-)Un abbraccio|`|cW1SBiGvaa	cmq anke con 12 cm funziona lostesso sei nella media però se ci tieni tanto vai da un dottore e lui ti saprà spiegare tutti i modi ke ci sono|`|jmMJ6PwZaa	mi dispiace ma ha 19 anni hai il pene di uno di 11 cmq non ascoltare le cavolate ke dicono su internet dei metodi o sulle guide di ebay sono semplicemente stupidi metodi ke non funzionano ma ke fanno male e danneggiano le mucose interne e i te*ticoli e quindi lo sperma... riskieresti di diventare sterile l'unica soluzione è la chirurgia estetica ciao!|`|pzeqHmcpaa	l unico metodo naturale e quello di usarlo tanto.se ti manca la figa usa la mano.|`|qiF3mAZWaa	che ridicolo ce l'hai solo 12 cm ?? .....ahahahahahah|`|vbaM3VkNaa	ma k te frega...a te deve solo interessare che il pene per far piacere alle donne dev'essere largo, lungo è piu o meno inutile e soprattutto l'importante è k superi gli 8cm (distanza tra labbra e vagina vera e propria) per quanto riguarda i metodi per ingrandirlo lascia perdere tt sono tt nocivi e nn risolvono nulla, lascia tt com'è nn te ne pentirai,pensa se dovessi fare qualke casino da quelle parti...se ti trovi una ragazza se gia nn ce l'hai nn ha problemi su quanto c'hai il pisello lungo... la vita nn è fatta solo di sesso

A orienta??o profissional é que a urina seja da cor amarelo-claro, transparente o suficiente para que seja possível ver através do líquido, mas sem perder a cor amarelada. Se a sua urina for deste jeito, é porque você está ingerindo a quantidade de líquido ideal para as fun??es básicas do corpo. Caso seja amarelo forte ou pouco transparente, você precisa beber mais água; e se for claro demais é porque você está eliminando água em excesso.

QHAKgwqBaa	With all those decaying teeth and cavaties I would say you should start watching what your child eats and brush his teeth better to keep it from happening in the future.  Sounds like he is biting his arm because the pressure will make his teeth feel a little bit better for a second or two.|`|VT0YGdK2aa	Your dentist is probably telling you the truth, there is no alternative to removal.  He may be responding to the pain by biting.  You may need to give him some tylenol or a topical numbing gel like ambesol.  If he feels that biting makes it feel better, give him a damp rag to bite down on.  make sure you watch him when he is doing this so no risk of choking occurs.  Good luck.  To prevent this in the future, brush his teeth twice a day and no milk, sugars, sodas, or any thing else at bedtime.|`|MYXt4J97aa	Take him to another dentist to get a second opinion.  I can't imagine a 15 month olds teeth to already be rotting, unless you feed him soda out of a bottle or tons of junk food.  Does he get himself to sleep with a bottle?|`|foBbvk85aa	It could be because his teeth hurt. Don't give him a bottle of milk to go to bed with, and brush his teeth every time after he eats something! It sounds like he is going to have allot of dental problems if you don't start dental hygenie now! If you have ever had a toothache you can only imagine what he feels like.|`|qA5z1ErJaa	WHOA! No 15 month old should have decaying teeth. He also shouldn't need cavities filled or crowns... These are baby teeth. They don't usually fill them, and they definitely don't crown them. You need to get a second opinion.
KIHah5uvaa	la nicturia, che ci si creda o no, è un problema più diffuso di quel che si pensa. lavorando in ospedale a  stretto contatto con gli urologi provo a darti qualche consiglio. le cause possono essere tre 1) psicologica 2) mancanza di percezione dello stimolo 3) incontinenza dello sfintere della vescica. vai da un bravo urologo per vedere se il problema  non è "fisico", farai sempre in tempo a rivolgerti dopo allo psicologo. bevi poco la sera, vai in bagno subito prima di coricarti e vacci a metà nottata (eventualmente punta la sveglia le prime volte)... non avendo la vescica a lungo piena dovresti evitare di bagnare il letto. puoi fare esercizi per aumentare tono e sensibilità dello sfintere vescicale chiamato "pee-stop" (dall'inglese pee-pipì). quando vai in bagno, mentre urini prova a "fermare a metà" il flusso, cioè smettere di urinare quando la vescica non è del tutto vuota. all'inizio non è semplice, ma aiutain ultimo esistono farmaci che aiutano i casi di nicturia|`|3dhu7bmwaa	la sera prima di andare a letto  mettigli un laccio al collo del tuo pistolino ma stai attento se lo soffochi hahaha|`|4AzR7REIaa	prrrrrrrr :p|`|D4Xbm1I2aa	Uppo squaiatu... cmq potrebbe essere sia una cosa fisica che psicologica... in ogni caso se ci stai prendendo in giro ti faccio schiacciare dall'ippopotamo della pampers :P<br>  <br>  Tranqui che risolvi... ma non sottovalutare la cosa... sei in età da ragazza... che figura ce fai....|`|JZllqdeLaa	fa un buco nel materasso compreso un sistema per lo scolo delle acque nere e vedrai che ti sentirai stranamente asciutto|`|Nnni7ZaUaa	èotresti chiedere asilo nel pagliaio del vicino.|`|gEgCppT0aa	Scherzi  su  di  un  problema  molto  serio  ,conosco  una  persona  che  lavora  in  un  centro  per  disturbi  di  questo  genere  e  credimi  quando  ti  dico   che  sono  molte  le  persone  affette  da  questo  grave  disturbo,  io  ho  letto  la  tua  domanda  pensando  di  poterti  aiutare  veramente.|`|puGqCwuGaa	Tranquillo mio nonno c' ha 79 anni e anche lui fa la pip a letto|`|O7RmS045aa	un pappagallo da compagnia!!!|`|XUD46lf0aa	pensa positivo<br>  la pipì evapora presto, le feci rimarrebbero in eterno!|`|bnuWK6Onaa	ahia. prendi i pannoloni quelli del supermercato, dovrebbero andarti bene, costruisci una dispensa vicino e potrai addirittura vivere in camera tua!!|`|sOHRVMfuaa	hai mai preso seriamente in considerazione l'idea di andare da un urologo?se stai postando qui vuol dire che lo senti come un problema... quindi ti consiglio fortemente di rivolgerti ad un medico, almeno per appurare se sia un problema fisico o meno|`|vOzsxU9naa	lo fai per dispetto alla mammina|`|ylXLBGj7aa	PAMPERS BABY DRY ULTRA|`|6zwTE1psaa	comprendo tuo problema<br>  <br>  perciò non capisco come tu sia potuto arrivare a 17 anni senza tentare di risolverlo.............<br>  <br>  datti da fare, e segui i consigli qui sopra...........<br>  <br>  ce la  devi fare!|`|xSqA3dPtaa	è tutto normale stai tranquillo io ne ho 40 e faccio anche la cacc-a a letto pensa un pò XD|`|026fcce579a0f0ba2197e85b50910e90aa	.........prova ad andare a dormire sul cesso......|`|1XM16rfOaa	ma ke soffri di prostata?a 17 anni? :)))|`|6Dg8WhKmaa	Cosa ti turba?|`|BTDSU9Njaa	non bere prima di andare a nanna!

There are plenty of books you could get, I think that would help the most. try searching other websites and also I recomend wikihow they can show you how to meditate and how to relax how to not have a stressfull day etc.<br>  <br>  I can relate to this I have stayed up all night panicking myself. A good friend of my dads helped me and talked with me. Try talking with someone you know would be good with helping you out. Yes ofcourse they will say the only thing that can cure it is you but what they are trying to say is you really have the power you dont even know about. I think everyone has a little some of self power, self control yuh just gotta find the techniques. Take a day off school if you can, Trust me it helps Alot! take a few days off of school to think. To get yourself back.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you'll be alright|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Of course that quote "pointless and useless bullshit" end quote..would be what?....what had happened during the day? What will you be up to the next day? Which girl you like best? I tell you what to do. When you switch that light off at night....start thinking about the best time you had in your life so far and calm yourself around it/them....you had sex with this gorgeous woman?...or you had a holiday in a paradise?..whatever it is..think about it...and keep thinking until you will fall asleep. Make sure though that you think of..good things which happened to you|`|AA10044154	I listen to nature sound CD's like gentle rain, thunderstorm or ocean waves.  When it's playing you can just doze off to the sound or sometimes when my mind is active I'll let it drift off to ocean waves while imagining myself walking on the beach or floating on a raft.  If listening to nature sounds I imagine hiking through the woods.  It keeps my mind off the bullsh!t and I fall asleep pretty quickly.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Check this site out - <a href="http://www.forgetanxietytherapy.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.forgetanxietytherapy.com.</a><br>  <br>  Been where you are for 13 years with all sorts of anxiety disorders and this sorted me out.<br>  <br>  Don't make my mistake and do nothing about it - boy did I suffer from my own macho stupidity.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|aMdLmbRwaa	Muslims love to fly into buildings.

Make sure you use separate towels to anyone else in your house and not wear your contacts until it clears up.  You really should go to your GP, you may need antibiotic drops for your eyes which a pharmacist can't give you.

fmdWrtBaaa	Boredom stems from a lack of stimulation. Write down a list of the things you really derive pleasure from. Make sure that you include at least 3 in each day or more, depending on what they are. Boredom also occurs when we do not feel emotionally engaged by what we are doing. Speak with your therapists about the meds you are taking. Many, especially for depression, can cause your mood to just flatten right out. Impact by aircraft wouldn't interest you! As for the house work, try blaring up your favorite music, set a timer and try to finish it faster each time, treat yourself to flowers afterwards and enjoy them in your nice, clean home.<br>  <br>  Regarding jobs, I noticed that you wrote your question very well (it shows that you are intelligent and educated). Why not give freelance writing and/or editing a try? You can post a free ad on craigslist if you are in a college or university town. Mention your degree and specialize in academic papers, theses, etc. Writing takes longer for the income to appear, but writing content for online markets is usually pretty fast. There is a ton of work on the web! One good site is guru.com. They collect the money, take their percentage and then pay you. It saves you some hassle. I read an article on writinghood.com recently about online writing sites. Go there and search for it. Literary translation may also be something for you or even being on call with a local translation/interpreter bureau could garner you some work. Internet research also pays - often bigtime. Go slowly and build up your portfolio. Try out different things to find your passion or always have a selection of different things that you do to earn your income  in order to counteract boredom. <br>  <br>  (Never agree to work for an agency that wants you to pay money upfront - these are always cons.)|`|olopisx7aa	Get some good books.

For work, you can ask potential employers if they will hire you on a "trial" basis--maybe work one week for free to see if you can do the job.  As far as focusing to get tasks done, try setting a timer for maybe 15 minutes and know that in those 15 minutes you will to get the task at hand done.  When the timer goes off, move on to something else.  If you feel comfortable with that, try 20 minutes, then move up to 30 and so on.  Good luck, and also make sure you follow what your doctors tell you and keep taking your meds.

aWQLJ1p9aa	Previous answer was spot on.<br>  <br>  Yes you can check yourself into a mental ward, but how long depends on the country you live in\supplementary insurance you have\what disorders you may be suffering from\how severe are your symptoms\and so many more.<br>  <br>  Here in the states, you can check into a mental health unit for up to 72 hours without insurance "claiming indigent" (no money for insurance). After this point in time, you'll be released on your own. The only way you would be held longer is if you are deemed a major threat to yourself\society. You can leave whenever you want though if you aren't too large of a threat (ACA against clinical advice).<br>  <br>  I've heard that the countries that have universal health care allow you to stay for a much longer time, and I wish that whatever supreme being would make universal health care happen here -but I digress.<br>  <br>  How it works is another can of worms. I work at a 28 day rehab, which ends up costing around $50\mo for four years or less. We have fun activities, but its definitely not a vacation home lol.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Not really sure, but I think you can ask for an appointment so they can determine if you really need help.  I'm pretty sure you can't just walk out on your own, tho.|`|YB3ULPPeaa	Yes, it is true. That is a responsible person who does that and realizes they are sick. Now there are those who do it because they want a "vacation". They usually have group activities and games and alot of mental clients view that as social/vacation time.|`|t8gYx9LIaa	Im sure if you walked into one and said that then they would certainly evaluate you.|`|tmj2iaCsaa	Depends how fucked up<br>  in the head the person is.

You sound like the type of person who really needs to eat in the morning.  If you do, most likely no more shaking.<br>  Low blood glucose can also make you tired, drowsy, and unable to think well.  If it continues for any length of time, you should really see your doctor and be checked for diabetes.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	It means you may be hypoglycemic. You should be tested.

You are learning more about things and understanding why people see them another way, which makes you reevaluate.  It's actually smart to reevaluate theories/beliefs in the face of new information.  There's nothing wrong with you at all, you're just open-minded, and maybe even smart!

If he's going to press the issue, tell him you have a yeast infection, that should stop it right away. If that ruins your chances with this guy, then he's a dick and you don't need that anyway. Sounds like he's getting mad about being blown off though and he's not going to believe you if you give him too many more stories so you might as well be honest.

WVAd2l7Xaa	Sorry if I come across sounding rude, but for your height, you shouldn't weigh much more than 120lbs.<br>  <br>  Cookies are full of sugar, which is full of calories, so I would assume you're not going to see results, again, assuming you truly do eat them every day, lol.<br>  <br>  I love chocolate cookies. There was a time where for a couple weeks where I was eating like 2-5 safeway cookies a day, lol (the small ones).<br>  <br>  I now eat VERY healthy and I know how a sexy young women is supposed to look, lol ;)|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	Yes, don't eat too much cookies though.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Vegan here too! If the rest of your diet is PERFECTLY healthy, then I see no reason why you wouldn't lose weight especially working out 90 minutes a day.|`|udUzdU7Raa	Losing weight and getting fitter is really quite simple. All you have to do is a few simple things. Firstly, clear your fridge of fatty junk foods. If there’s no temptation, you cannot fall. Secondly, stock up on watermelon and other fruits. Watermelon is excellent because it clears out your digestive system of toxins and waste, leaving you feeling and being healthier. Next, begin exercising every day. Do not go too hard. If running, don’t go fast or uphill, unless you want bulky muscle. A steady pace each day for a minimum of 30 minutes will allow you to shed fat and tone your body. Set a day each week when you each junk food, but try not to go overboard and ruin the work of every other day. Drink plenty of water, often when you think you are hungry, you are actually thirsty. If you are getting cravings, have a glass of water, wait 5 minutes, and then see if you still want food. This usually gets rid of those nasty afternoon hunger pangs for me!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you get the results you want!!|`|kdXTunqgaa	Cookies are sabotaging all your efforts. I would stop that and reap even more benefits. The cookie is gone in a second but you have to work out bg time to remove it. My friends and I are following weightlosssecret.info. to the letter and I have lost 8 kilos now since December. It is three meals a day with absolutely no snacking. Loads of water between meals, water or herbal tea or black coffee only between meals. Each meal is well balanced and I am not hungry at all. My other friend has a bit more weight to lose than me and she has lost 11 kilos since she started. All info is at the site. You should consider it. It was recommended to me by a natropath friend. I feel really healthy and now I am eating this way and I dont eat cookies any more!|`|05OjWUyCaa	Depends on how many cookies really. It shouldn't be a problem as long as your working off more calories than your eating.

You then will loose that one.  At the same time, the teeth on both sides of the one lost, begin to tip in, and they as well are lost.  the process continues until you have not teeth with which to chew....<br>  <br>  And you are likely asking, "how long does this take?"<br>  <br>  The process of tooth movement begins almost immediately.<br>  <br>  All I can tell you to tell him to do is to suck it up, and make some sort of payment plan with a dentist, or borrow the money, and pay it back.  Once you opt to not replace one, crumbling tooth, your entire mouth goes to hell.... that's why you see so many people by age 40 with full dentures... there were so few teeth left, that the only option was to pull those left.<br>  <br>  But, dentures are then just the beginning of your problem..... I promise|`|hWc65sEtaa	Call a local dentist and ask them if they give discounts for cash payments.  Some will give a discount.|`|eU8hbBICaa	Sound like an extraction is needed or a root canal. I once was in that same situation many years ago from a molar that I chipped. At least $1000 for root canal and crown or $150 for extraction. Or I paid only $350 for my root canal because this great I have that I believe that could benefit you in either decision you make. I would encourage you to visit this great site: www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago now and they have saved me thousands of dollars since. From root canals, xrays, exams...to my braces. They even had my very affordable benefits active in 2 hours and was able to use them the very same day. good luck and hope this helps.
uFRIsdC7aa	WHAT IS VIRAL HEPATITIS?<br>  Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver caused by medications, alcohol, or a variety of other agents including the viruses that cause mumps, measles, herpes and infectious mononucleosis. However, when health professionals talk about viral hepatitis, they usually mean hepatitis caused by the hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C virus.<br>  <br>  HOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF FROM INFECTION?<br>  Because the different viruses that cause hepatitis enter the body in different ways, there are several steps you can take to protect yourself from infection. Good hygiene, proper food preparation, and safe sex are good first steps. For more specific information, see the individual sections for hepatitis A, B and C.<br>  <br>  WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF VIRAL HEPATITIS?<br>  Early symptoms of Viral Hepatitis include:|`|wbSGa7m8aa	Viral diseases in most cases (unlike diseases caused by bacteria which are treated by using antibiotics) are effectively dealt with only by the body's immune system. Now this is a paradox, because antibiotics destroy good as well as bad bacterium, which leaves the immune system open to more infections.<br>  <br>  The reason for this being viruses cause diseases in a different manner as compared to bacterial infections; viruses are essentially parasitic in nature and require a host organism. They primarily invade bodily cells of the host organism and cause the cells to replace their normal functions with replication process of the virus. <br>  <br>  Probably the best anti-viral preventative solution on the market today, is New Silver Solution.

eMPeOsRBaa	viral rashes can be caused by toxins, drugs, or viruses/ bacteria. diseases like the chicken pox cause a viral rash however the common cold also can produce a viral rash.<br>  in most cases, it's the common cold. there are roughly 200 viruses that can cause the common cold so there's a big chance that he'll be just fine. as for you, it is most likely that you won't get any symptoms because viral rashes usually occur when you're a baby or infant thus meaning that you've probably already had this particular virus before when you were littler. good luck, hope that i was helpful.|`|AJXyQa17aa	Are you sure its not a cold sore, or herpes?

7xVid0zJaa	The faster you lose weight, the less likely you are to keep it off.  If you lose weight to quickly your metabolism slows down and it becomes harder and harder to lose weight.  I read somewhere that you should never try to lose more than two pounds a week.  This means that if you want to lose 100 lbs it will take an entire year of commitment.  You might be able to lose it a little faster.  The main thing is you have to be ok with the fact that it is going to take a while, and still be able to enjoy life while you are  in the process of losing weight<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080708143155AA0qOqD&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHzJb9jEeg8QO8k33oevU.FdT1CA3P.LpD1lQ--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|xWqKKp0Naa	my husband gained alot of weight after quitting smoking . he has found "The fast way " doesn't work . you should safely be able to loose 2 lbs a week on a restricted calorie diet . if you do it slow but sure , the pounds have a better chance of staying off .   good luck and have a good day .  oh , and he also goes on an evening brisk walk , everyday and it has worked for him .|`|kuAjbDmlaa	Losing this amount of weight will take some time.  Don't do it too quickly, or you won't keep it off.<br>  <br>  The Fat Loss 4 Idiots diet may be good for you.  It is very easy to follow, and is healthy.  So, you won't be losing weight the unhealthy way-with diet pills, prepackaged foods, etc.<br>  <br>  You will be eating 4 times a day, and you will be eating foods such as chicken, fish, fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy, nuts, beans, etc.<br>  <br>  You can lose up to 9lbs every 11 days, but most people lose about 4-6 lbs every 11 days.  They average about 10-15 lbs lost a month.<br>  <br>  This diet is based on "calorie-shifting".  You have to eat the right "fat burning compatible foods" at the right times and in the right cycles.  This will maximize your metabolism and enable your body to burn calories and fat constantly.  Therefore, you will lose weight quickly.<br>  <br>  All you have to do with this diet is choose your favorite foods from a list.  Then the "diet generator" creates an 11 day menu for you, based on these foods.  You follow the menu for 11 days, and then you get 3 cheat days to eat whatever you want.  Then, you create another 11 day menu.<br>  <br>  I personally know quite a few people who have lost weight on this diet and kept it off.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fatlossforidiotsplan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fatlossforidiotsplan.com</a>|`|AA10150940	First off, the weight went on slowly, so the best way to take it off is slowly as well.  Also, there is no one perfect way to lose weight but there are some basic concepts.<br>  1. Either Portion control or calorie count.  Diets like Nutrisystems and so on are big into portion control but you eat pretty much what you want (within limits).  Diets like Weight Watchers often work with calorie counting or a similar point system.  Either can work but it will depend more on what will work for you.<br>  2. Just read that keeping a log of what you eat every day typically will double your weight loss because you are more aware of what is going in your mouth over the course of a day.<br>  3. Do Not drink diet sodas or use anything with artificial sweetener.  Research has found that along with being dangerious to ingest these products actually prevent weight loss because they fool your body into thinking that it has taken in less calories than what it actually has taken in and so your body goes into storage mode.  A resonable replacement for sweeteners is a natural product named Stevia but it comes in differnt forms so you would need to figure out which works best for you.<br>  4. Drink Water - no calories, fills you up and is something your bodies needs.  About 8 - 8oz glasses a day.<br>  5. You have to exercise but that does not mean that you have to go to a gym.  Roller Skatting, Dancing and a number of other activities can provide different levels of exercise find something you find fun to do.  Or join a gym.  At the gym you will want to do both Cardio work outs (tread mill, bike and so on) AND a weigth lifting routine.  Even a light weight lifting routine will help.  Building muscle burns fat.<br>  6. Eat about 5 or 6 times a day but SMALL meals.  Don't eat any meal larger than your closed fist.<br>  7. When eating out (other than fast food) if you ask many resturants will bring half of your meal in a go box.  Then only eat half the meal.<br>  8. About once a week don't worry about your diet.  If you are continually forcing yourself to watch what you eat with no break, eventually you will start cheating and your diet will break down.  Allow yourself a scheduled break from the diet and if you go back up a pound don't stress about it, just buckle down and take it back off.<br>  9. This really depends on your emotions but if you can handle the ups and downs consider weighing yourself daily.  That way you know exactly where you stand.  But is must be at the same time and using the same scale otherwise the results may be wrong.<br>  10. Try to find a partner to lose weight at the same time and agree to help each other without judgement.|`|FhmEGBvyaa	Firstly you can lose as much weight as you want in a short time period, however, you will gain it back. I am speaking from experience from someone who has been there done that with fad diets. There is the obvious liposuction, however, the recovery time is 3 – 6 months and it sounds as though that you’re in a rush to lose the weight for possibly an event with no downtime to spare. I am and have been on weight watchers for 2 years and lost 25 lbs. It was a slow and steady race, however, I haven’t gained the weight back ‘cause my diet has been stabilized and so was the weight loss from 0.5 – 1 lb/week. <br>  <br>  Remember the weight gain didn’t happen overnight, it happened slowly over time, the same is with proper healthy weight loss, you can’t have/perform miracles over night. <br>  <br>  These are some things that I do.<br>  <br>  1. Drink lots of water as it kept me full longer. <br>  2. Used an appetite suppressant like hoodie to make sure I don’t go over my daily calorie intake. <br>  3. Did cardio and toning 3 – 4 times a week. <br>  4. Made meal and recipe modifications as I cooked. <br>  5. When I dined out, I made sure that I wasn’t shy about asking the kitchen to make modifications like dressing/sauce on the side, half portion ordered the kids meal etc. <br>  6. Brushing teeth after every meal, the mint acts like an appetite suppressant and without the taste in your mouth, you can easily forget about the food. <br>  7. Never drank diet cola, the aspartame actually made me crave food more for some reason. <br>  8. At work I take a break before lunch and either take the stairs in the building or just general toning without weights. We have a gym at work so I do about 15 minutes of weights which not only gets my blood flowing but releases tension from a**hole customers. <br>  9. Bought snacks in bulk (to save money) and properly measured what a cup or portion was and made individual baggies. There are some snacks on the market that are 100 calorie snacks, however, I find those to be too expensive than just buying in bulk and separating the portions yourself. Also by physically separating them yourself, you get an idea of what a portion is supposed to be and you  learn to properly eye ball correct portions.|`|rsMCAlEfaa	go to this site: <a href="http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...</a><br>   it will tell you how many calories you need to intake in order to maintain, lose, or "extreme lose" weight. create a meal plan based on that number and exercise for at least 30 mins five days a week. before you know it people will be complimenting you on your weight loss.|`|qwg36SEmaa	You need a fitness program.

HEAHsW5taa	you are correct but the dentist is only seeking approval for the funds at the time he calls, he doesn't know if your insurance is due to expire or not. you're only talking five days since the insurance was approved to when the tooth was extracted so in reality the dentist really had nothing to do with it|`|d2RV8HTmaa	This isn't the dentist's fault.

Why wasnt it pulled at the original visit?  Most dental offices do call to see if you have the ins., but they do not know when coverage will end.

You should definitely know that you didn't have insurance on June 10 when you went in there.  Seriously.  You had no idea that your insurance was ending?  Come on.  So, now you are stuck with the bill.  Call your dentist's office and talk to them, politely.  Tell them that $440.00 is very high and explain the situation.  Ask them  if this is the full rate or the rate they would get paid by an insurance company.  Ask them to at least reduce the fee so you have some chance of getting it paid.  If they argue tell  them it's not right that you as an individual should have to pay more than what an insurance company as a corporation would have to pay.  If they say it's illegal, they are lying.  Set up a reasonable payment plan and stick to it.  As long as you are nice and reasonable they will work with you.|`|ljOuygUeaa	It was a blind-sight made by the office who pulled your teeth.  They should have done the necessary follow-up with the insurance company and correct verification --- however it is also the responsiblity of the patient to do the same, as people make mistakes.  <br>  <br>  What you can do now is go back to the office that pulled the tooth and have them submit a "retro-active" claim or see if they can resubmit the approval information.  The office might be able to write a letter on your behalf saying they had to change the date of your extraction.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, the office goofed up and you overlooked the situation too.  They should have checked before you went in and you should have called to verify, as the patient is ALWAYS responsible for what the insurance does not cover.  The office can only verify benefits, not promise coverage - which is what happened.  As a patient, you have to do it too.|`|6N4aayVOaa	It sucks, but you should've been more proactive. You should have checked with your insurance previous to your extraction appointment. Or you could have asked the dentist when did he check and if you were still covered.<br>  Plus, if you knew your insurance was about to expire, you could have insisted in having the tooth extracted in your first visit.<br>  Dentists are very busy and absent minded and unfortunately they service first and bill second.|`|qQ4AnZpQaa	I was drilled by mine once.|`|BTqGFvgkaa	As someone who has been doing this, insurance claims,  for over 8 yrs, I can tell you that unfortunately, this is not the office's fault. Ultimately the insurance policy is your responsibility and is a contract between you and them. I understand your frustration, but.. The office only checks your policy as a courtesy so you know what your out of pocket expense would be, but of course to see how we are going to get paid. We would not check again on  the day you come back because if the policy were going to be cancelled, you should have that information and then it would be your responsibility to tell us, so we could give you what your other options were. If they called on the 5th, they would not even be told by the insurance company that it was going to be cancelled on the 10th.. (sometimes they would have that information, but in most cases they don't)  So the office wouldn't have known that it was cancelled, unless they did happen to call and was told and decided to pull it anyway without telling you.. (Then that would be screwing you.. royally!!)<br>  <br>  I am sorry this happened to you.. I would call the office and see if you could work out something with them.. remember.. be sweet...It really isn't their fault, plus if your sweet enough, they may work out a lower fee for you..like only charging you the lower insurance fee, instead of their regular higher office fee. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!

PiLRsxtwaa	If she thinks that way, then she doesn't deserves to be seen. I mean, who could be comfortable with anxiety? Of course you're not comfortable with the way things are. I know you wanna change. Sometimes the way things are can't be helped. In that case, seek a new counselor.|`|N89HLv92aa	I think you need a different psychologist. She is not doing her job. Also taking that many different meds can mess you up more then you already ar. xanax is very addictive. I have heard the seroquel is good.  Good luck and God Bless!!!|`|qBkJAlQ1aa	are you taking all these meds at the same time?<br>  if you are. somthing is amiss here..<br>  <br>  zoloft and seroquel does the same job, so are xanax and valum?<br>  hmnn. i'd refrain from that much polypharmacy. Medicine do have side effects. the more you take, more likely you experience them.<br>  <br>  with side-effects, the harder it is to deal with anxiety..<br>  <br>  Hope, you can follow my reasoning here.<br>  <br>  another thing, more therapists (particularly if not working as  a team) is like having more cooks preparing a meal. it tends to destroy the meal rather than prepare it well...<br>  <br>  anvil ltd.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	This is only my opinion - You sound like hard work. Some people love their illnesses - it makes them unique and gives them something to cling to. If you don't like the way life is panning out for you, you are the only one who can make changes in the right direction. Is this really where you want to be at this point in your life or do you want something more? <br>  Medication should never be a permanent option, it should just see you through the rough patches. Counsellors and psycholigists can help, but ultimately, it's up to you. You can overcome anything and be anything you want, but YOU have to want to do it. Good luck :)
BLD9EEWNaa	Maybe tell her some of this- she may be a bit annoyed, but she'll understand (she sounds very understanding).  Just let her know that you have been struggling to get everything done and that you have a huge amount of stuff (I understand by the way- paranoid schizophrenia in my senior year, missed four months), and that you will do better.  Definitely do get some sleep and don't try and do it now though.  Just tell her that you are still trying to pull things together and it is slowly stabilizing. Good luck.|`|qBkJAlQ1aa	like you, i know many people who are good but have "short spurts" as you describe it. What they did was have a list of " to do things". Everytime, they finish one task, they reward themselves by attending to other things not in that list and are actually pleasurable. Some of them actually answer questions on yahoo answer as their sort of "break from the regular routine".Some scan randomly you tube and make remarks, some even engage in mmorpgs for limited time, say 10 minutes. then back again to do another task in their "to do list".<br>  <br>  and don't worry abou us, because like you we need a break from the monotony of life and that we do by answering yahoo questions, lol...<br>  <br>  good luck though....<br>  <br>  anvil ltd.|`|GwbFgThXaa	Just try and do some tonight so you at least have something to show.

( This I Must Earn ) N.A. is a self help program for drug addicts but you can go there even if you do not do drugs. It teaches how to live a 12 step spiritual life. I also think you should stop worrying about school, I use to make over $120,000 a year and I never got past the 9th grade. Remember every thing that is good for us we don't want to do, we have to push our self's to do them. Like go to meetings or exercise. N.A. has a lot of young people in it now, who are making their lives better. Ask any one of them. Get involved in what is going on in government, I know that this sounds stupid but it is a way that you can help others. Helping others is good for the Psyche. I think it is because of parenting instincts. Do not listen to authority they want you to be a sheep so you will do nothing. Forge your own path! Do not get into a relationship, It will mess up your head. but do go out and have, you know. The thing that makes N.A. work is called H.O.W. Honesty, open mindedness, and willingness. Plus it works for thousands of depressed people as well as drug addicts.|`|U0wNL79Zaa	I was having this same situation in a sense.  I was in school I was going to be a senior and the summer before my boyfriend moved out to where I live..we had talked online for 4 years and we so excited to finally be together so I was so in love. (by the way I suffer from deppression too) anyway, when he moved out here things went wrong and I moved out of my moms on my own and quit going to school. I also had a miscarriage incident...so that whole next summer was so horrible...but I felt lke I needed to go back and finish so the next year I did and I messed up. I just started ditching, not going and I would procrastinate school "ill go tomorrow ill go tomorrow" and as time went on it was eventually months of no school...I got myself in deep when I should have just held my head up buckled down and shown my face before it was too late.  I was scared though because I felt like i had NO RIGHT going in there after missing weeks and asking for work after all they had done for me because they understood my situation but you cant give up...don't not go because of what you think they'll think of you or what they will say you just have to suck it up and go! do not ruin school you it matters these days and is so important. Now I live on my own and cant pay rent because I got fired for quiting school my guy got fired now he has job but I cant get no good job because they all need GED or highschool diploma...GED isnt worth it. Show your face, get your **** straight and stick with it, youll be so proud in the end.<br>  I hope you do what is right<br>  xoxo|`|EvP6vMx6aa	I'm sorry I don't know how to answer this, but at least you know that my thoughts are with you.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|kJDgxXS7aa	tell her the truth and she will understand|`|307d5bf70f327c6c67cdc66c0a7c5a14aa	Wow, you sound like someone whom I'd be very interested in talking to. Isn't life ever so peculiar? As you put it, most people won't read your question, others will read part of it and not respond, in the mean while, others will read it and not understand; the pool of people is intriguing. I've needed help before, help like the one you seek. I've felt like I was literal drowning, and solitude only made that worse. At that moment, all you wish for is for the anxiety to go away, to things to become better, and/or for someone to be there with you sharing your pain and understanding exactly how you feel.<br>  <br>  I would like to get to know you, maybe we can become good friends. Also, about your work, instead of worrying about it (and I know you can't stop) and making your being believe you are still going to do the work, making you ever so miserable as the deadline approaches and you still haven't done it--admit to yourself that you won't do it. Instead, get a good night's rest as the other people here suggested and go talk to her tomorrow. Tell he the truth. Tell her you just couldn't do it and that you need another chance... help. Of course, you don't have to be dramatic about it, or use it as an excuse. All you really need is honesty. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should try going to sleep and then waking up to do your work. For me, that only worked a few times in high school, but at that time, I knew what I was doing and what I had to do--your case sounds more like my college time when I didn't know what I was doing, I kept procrastinating, I kept telling myself I would do my work later, I would suffer from anxiety attacks and be all alone in my own thoughts with no one to share my feelings/emotions/thoughts and understand them... I was simply miserable. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I think it's better to admit defeat and save your sanity than to keep worrying about something that we both know won't happy. <br>  <br>  I would be happy to talk to you sometime. =)<br>  My thoughts and best wishes are with you Dylan.

I know many people who are fine with disorders and many people who have never sought help though I know they are not fine.  <br>  <br>  Tell her you screwed up, because you were worrying and be prepared to accept your fate, most likely she will understand.  You can't control everything, but you don't have to.  <br>  <br>  People will understand if you are not perfect.  Trust them and don't be negative about yourself.

You need to buckle down and start putting some structure in your life. When your math teacher assigns you homework for a week you should be dividing it up to be done over the next 5 days, leaving one day to review/finish hard parts, and one day as a just in case buffer. This is not the time to decide, "I'm just going to sit down and just do as much as I can and hope it's all done by next week." If you can't do it yourself you need someone to keep you accountable whether it be your parents or your friends. You need to set yourself a regular bed time, and you need to be getting at least 8-10 hours of sleep a night.<br>  <br>  Your teachers are putting in a lot of their own time to help you, especially your math teacher, it sounds like. Work with them, and if you think you're getting more work than humanly possible, by all means maybe you need to talk to them so they know how much work the others are given, but this may be due more to poor organization|`|qN6vYJiUaa	I really wont be any help<br>  I read it, but nothing is going into my head really atm.<br>  <br>  Why don't you sit down with her and explain your situation or something like that. <br>  <br>  Why don't you repeat the school year or something like that instead of trying to catch up?|`|eltOHwk5aa	Life is very difficult for those of us suffering mental disorders I went 10 yrs w my bipolar disorder before getting any treatment. The best advice I can give you is to find ways to make your issues like OCD work for you. Set up your schedule as much as possible to take into account each of your issues. Personally I set tasks so my limited attention span will cause me to get other things done by assigning myself the lower priority ones first. Then when my attention wavers a more important task is there. You might also ask your teachers if you can get credit for the work by exam instead of the massive amounts of homework.
p9rMlaTdaa	It's possible that your other symptoms are a result of your insomnia. It's temporary.<br>  <br>  Try these things before going to bed:<br>  <br>  - Drink warm milk.<br>  - Eat one or two cracker with peanut butter on it (the peanut butter makes you body relaxed and tired).<br>  - Try listening to orchestra music, not music with words because, when you'll listen to the song, you'll know the words, which makes you use your brain, and to sleep, you need to have your brain relaxed.<br>  <br>  Do this every night.

I get anxiety if I skip breakfast, and it's worse if I then have a sugary snack, as I get shaky 40 mins later! <br>  Also, do you smoke, because that can cause anxiety.<br>  For the knot in your stomach, When I had that, breathing exercises helped. Breathe in through your nose, gently for a count of 3 or four, whatever is most comfortable, and out for six or seven consciously relaxing your stomach muscles and bringing your ribs down. If you are anxious you are probably breathing from somewhere up by your shoulders which will make you feel tingly,. spaced out and hyperventilated. Not good with anxiety.<br>  The dread thing is truly horrible I know, but it does sort itself out once you look at other things that are not helping. <br>  Oh, and I wanted to say try to go for a wee walk.

As you know, when you add hot water to fat or oil, you see some of the oil seep out and become smaller.<br>  <br>  It is known that Fat is consumed better when it is in smaller pieces...I have heard that drinking tea with a meal breaks the fat in your meal into smaller pieces that the body can easily process rather than store.<br>  <br>  Drinking cold drinks with your meal can make the fat congeal, which is not good for immediate use this becoming storage.<br>  <br>  Just don't pay heaps for green tea, tea is meant to be cheap!

AA12266052	An air embolism, or more generally gas embolism, is a medical condition caused by gas bubbles in the bloodstream (embolism in a medical context refers to any large moving mass or defect in the blood stream). Small amounts of air often get into the blood circulation accidentally during surgery and other medical procedures (for example a bubble entering an intravenous fluid line), but most of these air emboli enter the veins and are stopped at the lungs, and thus a venous air embolism that shows any symptoms, is very rare.(Wikipedia)<br>  Arterial gas embolism is a potentially catastrophic event that occurs when gas bubbles enter or form in the arterial vasculature and occlude blood flow, causing organ ischemia. Arterial gas embolism can cause CNS injury with rapid loss of consciousness, other CNS manifestations, or both; it also may affect other organs. Diagnosis is clinical and may be corroborated by imaging tests. Treatment is immediate recompression.(Merck)
sQu3LLqtaa	You are probably about 60 lbs overweight.<br>  <br>  At 5'4 anything above 140 lbs could be regarded as overweight.|`|AA10736671	yes u r 200 lbs is to much u have to be in between 60 to 70 lbs as compare to ur height. some tips are<br>  1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Never ever go for any type of Diet pills or any drug which claim that it will reduce the weight quickly. Taking Diet pills will kill u.<br>  23) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenien|`|3ERx4opSaa	Unless you have a very muscular build, you are overweight.|`|85KL0eUUaa	you're obese<br>  bmi is 34.2<br>  you SHOULD weigh 120lb to be at your ideal weight (not too fat not too skinny)

AA11678263	I'd ask them if the voices bothered them.  If they did and they had not sought help, they should be supported to do so, if they heard voices and had sought help, I would support them to deal with them, and if they heard voices but they weren't bothering them, fair enough - it's far more common than you might think.

(-The Fray - How to Save A Life)"<br>  <br>  Look, your friend may have been going through some tough troubles - not physically spottable - but mental thoughts running in circles.<br>  <br>  I myself am schizophrenic. Before I was diagnosed as Schizophrenic (a person with Schizophrenia), I worried about a lot of things that I couldn't say to anybody.  Like religious stuff and what might happen - being paranoid - if I go to Hell.  Is hell a place I'll go from a chain reaction.  What happens if I walk over there, is it going to lead to some subconcious chain reaction from say the dent in the ground dirt where I walk where people see subconciously and try not to slip there, all causing other people to walk a different path, and that branch I moved might be seen or heard and cause someone to say something nice/bad/good/joking and then that person replies and says something and then another person joins in and says something and soon the world will never be the same, but I got this gut instinct that it'll lead me to hell after all is said and done.<br>  <br>  Then I had another gut feeling that if I don't touch any item any numerous amounts of times, the number of family members I have will die.  I was on a camping trip at the time and worried they might be dead when I get back.<br>  <br>  And I had all these annoying words in my head that tease me from people teasing me to me laughing at myself.<br>  <br>  And eventually I became a person that thought I was psychic and could read minds.  *Look right here - It is all normal and been happening to a ton of other people.*<br>  <br>  This is schizophrenia.  You can't tell people you hear voices.  What would they think.  You're already a person who is embarassed and shy and to say stuff that makes no sense is scary.  Fortunately I went to the hospital and saw a doctor who directed me to a psychiatrist.  You're not going to think you're crazy even though you have these thoughts.<br>  <br>  I suggest you google : schizophrenia and bipolar.<br>  <br>  Guess what, I don't hear voices anymore.  I heard them in 1996, went on meds later that year, the time when I went to the hospital, and from then on never heard voices *except* from a minor time when I lowered my dosage but went back up right away and the voices were gone.<br>  <br>  What do you have to tell your friend.  Just be nice to the person and tell them to see a doctor and followingly a psychiatrist.  People that are crazy aren't mean people.  I have a few friends who are mentally ill and they don't want to hurt people.  They are nice people with problems.  They might not be able to talk coherently or they worry a lot, but generally human nature means humans are good whether they're ill or not.  They're not crazy.  Never will be.  They are just going down a road of thinking that's a little off.  They are in touch with reality pertaining to most issues.  Just off with some reality such as worrying about paranoid satellites watching them, people reading their minds and finding out their secrets.<br>  <br>  Hey I saw on tv about these people with schizophrenia and they looked normal but they have symptoms.  If you have schizophrenia and don't know it, my doc says it's better to know all you can but I personally believe it's good to not know too much in the beginning because you might think I'm reading your mind and this is a game or something.  My proof: people that do drugs think there are insects crawling over them.  If one person says that it's strange.  If a lot of people say that it must be true right - - - wrong!!!  The same with schizophrenia, us people think in similar ways but we don't know others think this way too.  That's my point of the bug example.  What you're experiencing occured to countless people.<br>  <br>  Why? -Genetic make-up.  Genetics means you're like in some ways different in others.  How else do we know to eat when we are born.  Or to walk and run.  We're born to just do that.  Well sadly sadly but not a problem who cares, I'm just born with an issue where I think funny.  But with prescription medication for my illness, I'm perfectly fine and can work, study, function.|`|029f9c671ce18d1de916e291863989e9aa	I for one would believe it. I know someone who has been dealing with these issues for 20 years. They have episodes that could last years and years at a time. It's a horrible thing to witness. They often have to be medicated over and over to find the right drug that may or may not work for them. Outside they seem perfectly fine but inside their mind it's a whole other different kind of world. My friend right now is going on her 2nd year with an episode. She hears a voice ( her deceased brother) it's a constant 24/7 unwanted intrusion in her head. Some days she has thought about suicide just to end the frustration and invasion of her mind.( But, she would always check herself in to the hospital when she felt that her life was in danger.) Hearing voices, having hallucinations and delusions is not part of normal behavior. I would ask your friend if he/she has seen a doctor.Your friend may be suffering from bi-polar/schizophrenia and should seek medical attention ASAP. There are medications to help with these disorders but, the sooner the better.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	There is more than one possibility.  <br>  <br>  First, I would want to know if this person is being seen professionally and their diagnosis.<br>  <br>  If they are not, then I would ask them how often they hear voices.  Thirty percent of us will hear voices while falling asleep or waking up at some point in our lives.  It is not really a problem, but it can lead a person to feel crazy.  This person might be looking for help with a simple but worrisome problem.<br>  <br>  It is also possible that they are experiencing psychosis.  Either way they need to go to the doctor.  And, I would not think any less of them for it, because it is an illness that they are not choosing.|`|6wBe0XTGaa	Well one time this kid in my math class told me that he heard voices. I asked him if he was serious and he told me yes. Just for the note, this kid was a freaking GENIUS. He made over 95's in all of his papers. So naturally I thought he was joking. But he explained what they sounded like and what they looked like to him. <br>  I got kind of worried about him so during the week I would question him about the voices and what they normally told him what to do, what they said, how they sounded, ETC. <br>  We even would talk at lunch and he seemed like any other person. I thought at first when he told me that <br>  a. He was joking<br>  b. He was crazy<br>  c. He had problems. <br>  But as I started to talk to him more, I accepted that he might have just had a tiny problem. I mean, we don't think people that have high-blood pressure or diabetes are weird or avoidable in anyway. <br>  Voices seem like a big problem, but deep down its just another imperfection that us humans unfortunately have. <br>  <br>  However, if the voices were to tell him to bring a gun and shoot everybody, then I would be seriously worried. Fortunately, his voices only seemed to be a figment of his over-excited imagination. Who knows? Everyone thinks differently. Maybe some people think with voices. As I stated above, its just another imperfection.|`|e97vt0Slaa	I would be conserned. That is a mental health issue that can only be helped by going to a doctor.

fHjSonssaa	I got interested in what this might be- so I tried to do a little research myself.  There isn't a lot of "defined" information about it out there- <br>  <br>  all I could really find was the assymetrical ventricles and Asberger's  (an ASD) probably come from the same origin- so perhaps she has a form of mild autism?  You did mention in another question she goes into her own little zone and lost developmental milestones- which are common symptoms of Autism.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes babies have assymetrical ventricles and it means nothing.  I also seemed to find more information that they tend to notice these assymetrical ventricles on ultrasounds in the womb.<br>  <br>  I eliminated the word "stable" from my search- and saw no information mentioning anything about stable.  Perhaps stable means they aren't thinking her AV are causing the problem?-- maybe they are sending you to a specialist to sort this out and determine exactly why she is having the symptoms she is having.<br>  <br>  My prayers are with you and your daughter.|`|vqtpF1Q5aa	-- I am sorry.....<br>  <br>  I went digging on information for you on this and I can not find a think that would give a definition to what it is.....My only suggestion is call and ask the doctor to explain to you exactly what it is and what it means as well as....<br>  <br>  I am really sorry I can't be of more help to you I really did go looking as the more I looked and couldn't find anything the more determined I was to find something.....<br>  <br>  -- I wish you the best of luck in this and many blessings to your daughter....

GWQXdw2qaa	Be cautious about what you choose to do and believe in.  It is your choice on what you are comfortable with engaging in and as they are your friends, its probably difficult to voice any feelings of being uncomfortable with what the majority chooses.  <br>  Its totally your choice, but since your asking for opinion, I myself would not become involved since I'm Christian (and, since I'm a LOTR geek as well, I'll explain my view in a LOTR way.)<br>  <br>  The Ring was cool at first, right?  You put it on and you dissapear, It actually works (just like wicca actually works)  We will use it for GOOD.  But the ring is manipulated by Sauron and is evil in nature.  No matter how hard we try, it can backfire.  Evil purposes can be attained even when you are trying to do good with it.<br>  <br>  *Graphic example below, don't read if you can't handle it*  I've read that hunters in the arctic/north somewhere captured animals (I think wolves?) by covering a knife with frozen blood.  At first, the wolves lick it and enjoy their meal.  However, soon they are drinking their own blood off their cut up tongue and don't even notice.  Weakened, they are easily ensnared.<br>  <br>  So yes, be careful, its your choice, but I really wouldn't|`|ParFJxnSaa	It depends to some extent on the mental stability of those involved. If they are, then fine, but, like any belief system, some people can go too far. Look at what was done in the name of Jesus. For example, in 1600 Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake by the Roman catholic papacy, for claiming that there must be life on other planets, among other heresies. He refused to recant. He is one of my greatest my heroes. <br>  <br>  Later, Galileo Galilei was threatened with the same, for stating what he had seen in the heavens through his telescope; he recanted, spending the rest of his life under house arrest, with only his daughter allowed to tend to his needs. Copernicus had foresight enough to know what would happen, and published posthumously.<br>  <br>   BTW, you might want to keep it quiet; especially in the Bible Belt; I am informed that wiccans are discriminated against, and may be victimised. Remember the witches of Salem!|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	What do you mean, wiccan practices?

Taking out the trash is potentially dangerous.  Wicca is really a very calm, deep thing.  It is almost like mediation, if you do it properly.  If your group if full of people who want to start satanic rituals like sacrificing goats and virgins, they aren't really wiccans, they're just looking to satisfy some urge of theirs.  I personally don't believe in Wicca, but I really wish that I did.  If you look up wiccanism, especially wiccan symbols online, you'll see that much of the rituals are centered around protection and serenity.|`|jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet Irena,<br>  <br>  I would not be concerned about a group practicing Wicca so long as what they do makes sense to you and also brings no harm to anyone. If it is a new group trying to establish them selves, watch, listen and be cautious. Do not walk blindly into a group just because they claim to be Wiccan, Christian or other style of belief. Use what the Goddess and God have freely given you. If you still are not sure you can use the Cult Danger Evaluation Frame by Isaac Bonewits <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&c=basics&id=2877." rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=...</a><br>  <br>  I also suggest that you read books like Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. Also you cannot go wrong with anything by Scott Cunningham or Raymond Buckland.<br>  <br>  If you are teen, I suggest Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf and Elements of Witchcraft: Natural Magick for Teens by Ellen Dugan.<br>  <br>  I hope my little blurp has helped.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Naw, my daughter was Wiccan for a while.

For example, if your sister has a negative view of Wicca, but you feel comfortable telling her everything that happens in your group, then it is fine.  However, if you feel you have to lie or avoid talking about the things you do, regardless of your sister's feelings about Wicca, then you need think why you are hiding it.<br>  <br>  Trust your judgment, but never pre-judge.|`|zqJbnHlTaa	Myself, boyfriend, and close friend are all practicing pagans, and wiccans. There's nothing dangerous about the religion itself. It based on nature and is one of the oldest religions. Far older than christianity (Im not talking about neopaganism, thats something else). <br>  However, if you're friends are hurting others, thats not wicca, thats somthing else. <br>  Also, if you don't feel comfortable, don't be involved.

fAFXkikAaa	I'm going to disagree (almost) with just about everyone here.<br>  <br>  HSV1 on the genitals is typically very very mild.  So mild that most people never get more than one outbreak (if they even get one at all).  So mild that incidences of viral shedding (when you could catch the virus without symptoms) are very VERY infrequent.<br>  <br>  Is it POSSIBLE that you could catch HSV1 from someone who has it genitally?  Yes, its possible.   But it is very very unlikely.   <br>  <br>  Further, you might want to get tested yourself, and even intentionally catch HSV1 orally, if possible.   Once you've had HSV1 orally for several months, it becomes extremely unlikely that you'll catch it genitally.   And since everyone ends up with HSV1 sooner or later .... <br>  <br>  As for medicines to prevent outbreaks, I'll bet your partner doesn't have outbreaks - so antivirals wouldn't be recommended.   She could take them, in theory, to reduce viral shedding - but its doubtful that she has viral shedding.<br>  <br>  So, in short, your doctor is EXACTLY right.  It is VERY hard to spread when there is no outbreak.   Not impossible, but very hard.<br>  <br>  Note that all the other respondents are (mostly) correct when speaking of HSV2 genitally - the most frequent type of genital herpes.  But your question was SPECIFICALLY about HSV1 genitally.<br>  <br>  GREAT question.|`|odkfKNewaa	It can be spread any time--it's just more likely during outbreaks|`|AA12266052	Incorrect. Research suggests that the virus can be transmitted even when there are no symptoms present, so that a sexual partner without obvious genital herpes sores can still transmit the illness. In fact, asymptomatic spread may actually contribute more to the spread of genital herpes than do active sores.<br>  Herpes labialis is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. It leads to the development of small and usually painful blisters on the skin of the lips, mouth, gums, or lip area. These blisters are commonly called cold sores or fever blisters.<br>  Those who do experience outbreaks find that topical medication as Zovirax ointment eases the pain and can help speed recovery when blisters appear.|`|973048f8517e0239c85279b6cdd730cbaa	Herpes can be spread without and outbreak through 'shedding'. HSV 1 does happen on the genitals, but it doesn't like it down there, it likes the mouth better. As such, it rarely goes through 'shedding' on the genitals, so that means it will usually only spread during an outbreak. It CAN shed though, so always use protection if you still want to sleep with this girl. I wouldn't though, there is no cure.|`|fk9AvB25aa	It's harder to spread when there are NO signs of an out break, but there is still a small chance that she could spread it between out breaks. HSV1 is very common to have on the mouth, it's contagious while it's active and there is a good chance of passing it to the genitals when there is an out break. It can even be spread during the healing stages and it can even be spread to the genitals. They can also be spread when the virus sheds but there is nothing to tell you when this happens and it only happens for a small percentage of days out of the year. So the sore should be completely healed and gone before you have oral sex with her. <br>  Suppressive therapy such as Valtrex, zovirax and famvir are used to prevent out breaks. She should be the one taking medication, it will do nothing to prevent you from getting herpes if you take it.|`|Bldp1kAdaa	i am a female who has HSV 1 genitally also. I have researched this subject like its my job and rivergirl100 couldnt have given you a better answer, and also, i have taked to many doctors and a lot of them didnt even think you should have to tell a partner about hsv 1 if you do not get outbreaks because its so mild, so your girlfriend is a winner for telling you. <br>  <br>  I actually did give my boyfriend HSV 1 genitally even tho he has had coldsores for years, but this was ONLY because i had unprotected sex with him during my INITIAL outbreak. poor boy. It is said that the only time hsv 1 has been spread genitally was when someone was having their initial outbreak because it is the most severe. So if she has not had an outbreak yet at all, watch out! but besides that, it should definitley not be a very big issue, if even a issue at all|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	incorrect the most common time it is spread is outbreaks and just before and just after an outbreak it can be spread outside of these times and yes it does happen but the risk is low but still a risk.<br>  there are drugs which suppresse the virus and make the risk of passing it on even lower<br>  herpes is in the body for ever like chicken pox but the body heals it's self everytime it has an outbreak....check out the site below for all your questions dont listen to scare storys on here that are mostly wrote by people who do not have or do not know anything about the nuisance skin condition.|`|E9SAv17saa	....?
JEdP02Oeaa	try tea. white or green, its so healthy for you its ridiculous. my friends grandma is like 98 and prefectly healthy because she drinks green tea like at all times. its because it helps the body digest the food your eating, instead of hardening it in your arteries like cold drinks do. it also gives your body anti-oxidants and plenty of vitamins. also, exercise regularly, and drink lots of water and liquids. stay away from greasy/fried foods, and soda. <br>  <br>  also, if you would really like to lose some weight. try going vegetarian for a while. its very healthy if you substitute the protein and fiber with other things like nuts and grains. it actually works, my friend lost 5 pounds in 3 days. good luck (:|`|p5tZ8PIxaa	According to this site, <a href="http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...</a><br>  you are actually 1lb under what your average age is. I don't think you need to worry about your weight. But, you could tone up a little more, which may lead to a flatter stomach or whatever. Just excercise. Muscle is much more attractive than just plan skin and bones! :)|`|85KL0eUUaa	Cut your calories.<br>  If you are 126lb of muscle and fat (instead of just fat), you probably need close to 2100-2300 calories each day. And for each hour of swimming you do every day, add 600 (that should be an average)<br>  So you should cut calories to about 1400 and you'll lose around 2-3lb a week.<br>  <br>  Should get there by summer.|`|lfpay4yHaa	it needs willpower.<br>  some ppl have higher metabloism that other ppl so u might just need to exercise more. Eat salads and drink a lot of water. Don't eat any chocolates, deep-fried stuff and do a lot of the good old push-ups. it takes time to lose weight. Mabe a moth so be patient if at first it doesn't work!|`|cwEO2tGtaa	well if you eat healthy then i would start working out besides swimming; swimming is good but maybe you have a slow matablism so you should do some jogging or jumping rope or something else daily. i know what you mean im the same way. my goal weight is 103 to. im currentley at 117lbs but its not muscle at all|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Walk the brisk walk at the school's track.<br>  I call it the Brisk walk because that is the drink that passes through the system best.<br>  When you need a rest and a drink have two drinks available.<br>  1) A water bottle w/water in it. <br>  and <br>  2) A bottle of "Brisk" ice tea.

The bad thing is since it is only water, once you stop taking it, you'd go back to your old self quickly...|`|AA11747527	well you have to drink it with plenty of water to flush it out of your system.  There is a chance it can cause problems with kidneys or liver.  There may be other side effects as well but not much is known about it yet.  Long term effects are also unknown.  If you're going to do it i would only use like 1/3 or half of the recommended dosage.  It does actually seem to work though.  i know people gain muscle with it.<br>  <br>  I just looked it up further and on the mayoclinic website it says our liver already produces creatine as long as you are getting meat in your diet.  Our kidneys remove the excess levels of creatine so it seems to me taking creatine is pointless if we are already producing enough.  Just seems like more work for the kidneys...  i don't know i probably wouldn't take it if it was me|`|3ICWtcFwaa	you dont make any sense. i will asume you are asking if creatine is ok to take. <br>  <br>  it is legal<br>  it builds body mass<br>  it builds fast twitch muscle fibers.<br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  it can inhibit natural muscle growth meaning muscles you dont work out will get smaller. Also, once you stop taking it your muscles will get tiny and nasty.|`|CtC7lFbjaa	you should take it probably 15 minutes b4 you work out

It could also be your diet, lack of sleep, age related, other variable.|`|h4CAYUvNaa	Your body is probably just reacting to that horrible Sh*t your dumping into it. Your lungs are probably frustrated as hell. Guess what provides the oxygen to the blood -> brain.|`|6S8BKhIYaa	your medically a slut who needa quit smokin.....|`|K1wxsMkBaa	I am a former smoker who started young. I smoked for 8 years before I quit in Feb. 2008. After about 2 - 3 weeks of not smoking I realized that I had been ignoring symptoms for years and that I felt much more healthy and energetic. It really blew my mind. Even that light headed feeling I would get when getting out of a really hot bath went away. (You know the feeling, you get tunnel vision and everything gets dim and then light again.) <br>  <br>  Quit smoking. Its the best thing you can do for your self. Ever look at an old lady smoking? They get deep lines around their lips from puffing and all the chemicals wreak havoc on your skin. There are many more health and beauty implications so in short - quit.<br>  <br>  I quit by reading a short 300 page book. It was $15 at B&N. Its called "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" by Allen Carr. Prior to this book I had tried gum, the patch, hypnotism and cold turkey - all to no avail. The book works! Give it a shot. It really was easy after I learned how.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't ignore your current symptoms though or simply blame them on smoking. There is a chance they could be signs of something more serious.I would go for a check up and tell your doctor of your symptoms and DO NOT LIE about your smoking. Its important to give your doc all the facts so he can give you an honest assesment.<br>  <br>  An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. <br>  <br>  To answer your additional question - I think people arent responding well to your question because you are smoking at age 15 and claim to have been "smoking for ages". It brings up such questions as, How young did you start, how are you getting cigarettes, why are you smoking at age 15 and how does a 15 yr old define "ages" since you have yet to reach adulthood even legally. The way you phrase your question (and I am not trying to be mean so please don't take offense) makes you sound like both arrogant and ignorant. I don't think that was your intention and I'm sure you have a legitimate concern. I also remember being young. When I was 15 a couple of months was "ages" to me. <br>  <br>  To summarize - quit smoking, see your doctor and enjoy being young while you can. Best of luck to you.|`|GO46i2l9aa	First of all STOP SMOKING. You are only 15, you should not be hurting your body like this.<br>  <br>  But also, it could be vertigo, which I have, and I have similar symptoms as you, but also, it could just be lightheaded from standing. <br>  <br>  But please please please stop smoking, and see a doctor.|`|gULNGNkFaa	Yes, please go to the doctor, as something could be wrong. As you are no doubt aware, smoking is very UNhealthy for you, and can seriously damage your lungs and impact your circulatory system including your heart and blood vessels. Only the doctor can diagnose if you have a neurological problem (your nervous system), respiratory system (your lungs) or circulation problem (your heart).

eqC5EBkJaa	First you need to understand that you need to burn the fat over your abdominal muscles to see your 'abs'. After that it depends on exactly what you're eating (you should try to eat mostly lean protein and veggies if you're trying to tone up) and how often (you should try to eat ~5-6 times/day to speed up your metabolism. Now to answer your question:<br>  To get abs you need a proper balance of good eating, resistance and cardio excercise, and sometimes supplements. You need to add resistance excercise as that is the best way to reduce fat (muscle burns fat/calories) and change body shape. <br>  Different people hold fat in different places and that last little bit of fat is usually the hardest to lose. There isn't any definitive way to 'spot' reduce body fat but here are some things I have found useful (to get a lean flat stomach and get 'abs'):<br>  - Do sprint repeats. It may not be warm enough to do these outside so put on some sweats or find an indoor track. Jog to warm up (~1/2 mile). Then do 8 sets of repeat sprints (start with ~100m and gradually move up to ~200m as you get in better shape). Basically you sprint all out, then slow jog (really slow) back. Repeat 8 times. The first one you want to go only ~3/4 speed since your body will still be warming up. Make sure you stretch afterwards as your hamstrings will be sore the next day (especially after the first time).<br>  - Resistance training: go for more reps (less weight), try drop sets, try circuit training. All of these are useful for getting more lean(and as a result will burn fat off your abs). Remember the more muscle you build, the more fat you'll burn (and you won't be big and bulky either).<br>  - Ab ball: do a lot of exercises using one of those ab balls...they work your core in every exercise. You can also do actual ab target exercises (twists, crunches, etc.). Get a trainer at your gym to show you some. Or you can get the CoreSecrets (ball/video) for ~$10-$20 online (just google it)<br>  - Oblique exercises (twisting). Do a lot of these using the ab ball: sit on the ball hold a 10 lb weight and walk your feet forward. 'Lay down' and with the weigh above you twist to one side-up-pause-twist to the other side. Ensure you're using your obliques to do the work.<br>  - Lower abs. Do leg lifts (hold weights in your feet, or lay on ball and do them). Leg raises (where you hang in the air and rotate your knees to your chest). Get with a trainer at a gym to show you some new funky ab exercises<br>  - Improve your nutrition to mostly eat low fat protein (chicken, fish, lean turkey, etc.) and veggies (i.e. broccoli). Mix a little fruit in there for some sweetness. You can also buy whey protein and make whey protein smoothies (2 scoops protein, ice, skim milk - blend - little peanut butter, ripe banana, more ice - blend again: tastes great). Cut out junk food (especially soda, anything loaded with high fructose corn syrup, all sweets, etc.)<br>  - Start taking a thermogenic fat burner (will burn fat faster when your body temp rises - i.e. working out), ripped fuel, or hydroxycut hardcore before your workouts. This will help provide energy for workouts during your cutting 'diet'. These also help you burn fat and are 'good' supplements to use <br>  Work hard, have fun...you should have those nice, ripped abs in ~2 months|`|AA11564934	u can not spot reduce, u have to lower overall bodyfat content.|`|TVnpzBGQaa	Do you hear about a book called the truth about six pack abs?

gr4IFLsMaa	The most common used medication(s) used for depression are the SSRI's because they cause fewer side effects (I think).  Examples are Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, and Lexapro.  I use to take Lexapro for 2 years and it worked wonders for my depression but then I had a manic episode (I'm bipolar) and had to be taken off of it.  But otherwise it works very well for anxiety/depression.<br>  <br>  Other medications are SNRIs such as Cymbalta and Effexor.  I don't know much about them but I do know that you have to watch your blood pressure with Effexor because it can raise it.<br>  <br>  Wellbutrin is another antidepressant that's commonly used because it doesn't have the sexual side effects that the other medications have.  Never taken it myself so I don't know too much about Wellbutrin either.<br>  <br>  I hope you find some of this helpful and I wish you luck in your treatment decisions.|`|MDTj4U75aa	Jesus.|`|ub6641d2aa	prozac. this one works extremely well for me.|`|38VeNgjtaa	sex|`|UinOWcMUaa	Jesus -- No Side affects<br>  <br>  Have u tried Him ??|`|AA11678263	The main groups of antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclics, and selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  All of these have side effects, but they are all different for different people.  Some people will experience no side effects, whilst others will experience many.  <br>  <br>  MAOIs are the least commonly prescribed, as they restrict what you can eat due to interactions with other drugs and foodtypes, so we may as well disregard those to begin with.<br>  <br>  Tricyclics should not be taken if you have any history of heart problems, and can be fatal in overdose, so are generally one to avoid if you have been suicidal and may be tempted again.  They may cause a dry mouth, a slight tremor, fast heartbeat, constipation, sleepiness, and weight gain, and men may experiences sexual dysfunction.<br>  <br>  The list of side-effects for SSRIs looks bad, but most people don't experience the side effects after taking the meds for a couple of weeks.  These include feeling sick and more anxious, being able to urinate, falling, confusion, and suicidal thoughts.  Prozac is an SSRI and shouldn't be presecribed to young people, or closely monitored if prescribed to people under 24 as increased suicidality may occur.<br>  SNRIs are similar to SSRIs in terms of side-effects but should not be used if you have high blood pressure or a history of heart problems.<br>  <br>  The drug that is best for you may not be the same as the one that's best for the next person, so it's hard to say which is the best.  Some may work faster than others, but some may also have worse side effects for you.  It's trial and error I'm afraid.

In the meantime, you can always have a handyman install a thumbturn bolt on your bedroom doors. They lock from the inside and could prevent anyone from getting into your room at night.

OMYd6p3gaa	This is what has worked for me:<br>  <br>  Excercise at least 3 times/week<br>  <br>  Put your body into Ketosis. <br>  Ketosis is when the liver turns fat into fatty acids and keytones. It helps you lose weight faster. <br>  <br>  In order to do this, you must follow these rules:<br>  <br>  Eat hardly any carbs. No more than 1 slice of WHOLE WHEAT bread a day. Eat 2 proteins a day (7 oz) this includes chicken, tofu, beef etc.... Eat 2 fruits a day- but stay away from starch ones like bananas and watermelon, as well as pineapple, Eat UP TO 16 oz of Vegetables a day- again no starchy ones like carrots, corn, etc..... Drink AT LEAST 8 glasses of water a day!!!

Each meal is well balanced and I am not hungry at all. My other friend has a bit more weight to lose than me and she has lost 11 kilos since she started. All info is at the site. You should consider it. It was recommended to me by a natropath friend.

5iOHJHUzaa	Yes it would be VERY healthy. You will lose weight, your skin will clear, you will have more energy. One of the things that make this so effective for weight loss is the fact that uncooked food still has all of its nutritional value and it takes more time to chew, and bulks up un your stomach, therefore you get fuller faster. This is the way humans are meant to eat!|`|KOecCLjLaa	I doubt if you will lose any weight from switching to a raw food diet (unless you are talking about becoming vegaterian, the caloric counts will be essentially the same or not enough to matter).  Those who are a raw food diet that go to cooked food usually become ill, and those who are on cooked foods that go to raw food diets also tend to become ill, so its mainly what your body is used to, just takes time for your body to adjust.  As far as a diet is concerned, I wouldn't go from cooked to raw simply for dieting sake.
W2z5dCrmaa	Whatever makes for a healthy body is good for your penis too. Stay out of junk food, and don't eat fries much.<br>  Just eat a good variety of veggies, protein as in sort of lean meats and stay away from processed meats like canned meat, deli meats..to much preservatives in them like salt peter..Sodium and potassium nitrates and nitrites. Never eat that dried beef jerky..that too many Dudes eat. That stuff is chemically embalmed and just bad for your sex drive and your Dick.<br>  <br>  Your body uses nitrous oxide when you get an erection to open the valve that lets more blood to your penis, plus that which holds more blood in, and these chems. replace it with nitrite and nitrate instead of nitrous radical to form the oxide.

NLAek2bJaa	Normally, any dentist would advise you to go back into the dentist and remake a new temporary but, since it has had a root canal, that should be sealed off so bacteria will not get into the tooth. They should have advised you, when you get a temporary crown, you can not eat on it or even touch it the entire time, because they are known to come out very easy. IF you leave that whole area alone and not eat on it at all... and clean it very well... you should last until you get your permanent crown on. But, the whole point of a temporary is to protect the tooth underneath and maintain that space so your teeth do not shift into that gap or else your permanent tooth will not fit. Its your decision on what you may want to do. When you get to your dentist, just let them know that your temporary came off 8 days ago and he can check and make sure its ok before they cement the crown on.|`|1nINGDC7aa	it is advisable to go to the dentist and get the temporary crown remade or if the permanent is prepared get that fitted. it is not good to keep the reduced tooth like this as there can movement of the tooth and then the permanent will not fit. for more information on crowns you can visit the following link<br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCategories.aspx?ArticleCategoryId=22&Name=Crowns%20&%20Bridges" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...</a>
ov7BmlTcaa	You can continue to go to the gym, but you will need to alter your workout.  I don't know what your normal routine is, but low impact cardio such as the stationary bike or elliptical should be fine.  For strength training I would stay away from any closed chain lower extremity exercises such as squats, which would put alot of pressure through your foot.  <br>  <br>  If you gym has a pool, you can get a really great workout running in the deep end with a floatation belt.  Which would not put any stress on your foot.  You also burn more calories during a water workout since every motion is resisted by the water.

However, I have a terrible time with both codeine and morphine, and also with methadone. <br>  <br>  It's usually the anaesthetist who looks after initial pain management, so best to talk to them first.

fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	the questions should be just how many times did you try to quit??? For me it was literally dozens, so if you do fail, you will not be any worse off than the rest of us who has tried and failed. <br>  <br>  The key is to keep trying, and if you truly want to quit you will when your ready to. And for petes sake do not start taking vitamins to try and quit smoking... talk about substitution....When you start to get the urge to smoke do something that you normally would not do while smokeing. Keep your hands busy and keep your mind busy... <br>  <br>  You will succeed!<br>  <br>  I have tried quitting cold turkey more times than I can count. I have tried "the patch" multiple times" I have tried Zyban and have tried the gum as well. I have even tried the patch and Zyban. All off these did not help me quit. Not because they are not good products because yes I did cut back and so some would say that was a small victory for the time and I would agree with them. <br>  <br>  But I would eventually get back to where I was. But that's the point "I" would go back it wasn't the quit smoking aids that went back it was me. I eventually started a slow process where I went from a Marlboro Red down to lights/ ultra lights. I know I know big deal right.... Well for each step down I  made it was a small victory for me and I felt good about it. So it helped. This last time I tried has been the most successful I have even been.<br>  <br>  It started when I friend who is a OB/Gyn nurse asked if I had heard of or tried Chantix. I said I hadn't and she left it at that.... Then one day a few eeks later I was just getting ready to pull into my drive and she was pulling out and through our vehicle windows she handed me a pamphlet on Chantix and said she wanted me to read it. By this time i was curious about it and had asked about it and heard good things. So I decided to read it. I then talked to my wife about it to see if she had heard anything about it. Went to our frined and asked her about it got the skinny ect...  So about a month later I decide I wanted to try it. went to the doc he wrote the sript and started me off.<br>  <br>  Read the instructions and the first thing was keep smoking... I said ok I have no problem there..LOL take 1 pill once a day for a week then stop. Hmmm ok getting leary here. Sounds like a cold turkey thing to me. But I tried and did ok for the first few hours of the second week....<br>  Still taking one pill a day but I decided I was going to do my bvest not to smoke but if i felt i really needed on then i had one. Then I started week 3 2 pills a day. At this point i decide it was more of a habit than a want one. So I strecthed it out more. this is when they started tasting bad but not bad enough cuz i still smoked em. Now week four comes and I smoked the last cigarette in the pack and I said "I'm not buying any more!!!!" And I didn't..... Then about a month later had a stressful day and borrowed one... Went home with my head hangin and told my very supportive wife I failed. She didn't care she was happy i made it a month without a cigarette. She just said its ok stay on the bike a continue riding. So I got up the next day determined I would go longer. I made it  month damn it I can go longer. I took my Chantix for 90 days like the doc said to and come this April it will have been 2 years without a smoke for me. <br>  <br>  I seriously believe that my friend and Chantix saved my life and helped me quit. Without ether one I may have never heard of it. So each year I plan on sending my frined flowers and athank yoiu for saving my life. <br>  <br>  It worked for me and it will work for you to. Good luck a I'll be praying for you!|`|IeNUPstIaa	Yes i had succesfully quitted smoking after smoking for 8 years and this happend because of my will power i took one packet of cigrate and decided this is going to be my last packet and no more will be there here after,i smoked one because i was knowing this is going to last,u should know that withdrawal symtoms are extremely bad they can make scream the walls down or pull out the hair,but keep the control on ur self and try chewing gums when ever u feel the addiction,honestly saying this had worked for me,its been over an month since i smoked,i mean the addiction is gone and feeling like heaven,Best of luck.|`|f77638df19b856e06b377813782f45faaa	My dad was a smoker for about 15 or so years and he actually quit smoking on a bet with his brother to see who can not smoke the longest . Though my dad quit by using the nicotine patch i don't know which one , though he was kinda grumpy for like a month or so and about a year later he's fine . He was tempted to smoke one time , and i had to tell him to stop . So i'm sure  your family will support your decision . My grandfather has tried to quit for 30 years and he can't ,he started to smoke at the age of 10(he got cigarettes from his older friends)  and he's 56 now . He has tried everything and i told him why can't he quit ? He said that smoking to him is like drinking water and he just simply can't . |`|JwPu0XbIaa	If I were were a smoker trying to quit, my strategy would not be to find the easiest way possible.  Rather, it would be to quit cold-turkey, endure all withdrawal symptoms no matter what, suffer for a couple weeks, and make a recovery.<br>  <br>  After all, if quitting is super-easy, you might be tempted to start smoking again.  You can always quit later!  But if quitting is painful and difficult, yet you manage to endure it, it will be a significant achievement you won't want to throw away by starting again.<br>  <br>  PS:  Drink plenty of water and take vitamins regularly during withdrawal.  Do not be tempted to substitute another drug (such as caffeine or diet pills) for the nicotine you're missing.

AA11678263	There are lots of things you can do Gina, but the first and most important thing is to be nice to yourself.  Reward and congratulate yourself when you complete even what seems like a small task, as it's hard for you, so even though by your old standards it's simple, at the moment it's a feat, and you deserve praise.<br>  <br>  Apart from antidepressants, you can try talking therapies such as counselling, psychotherapy, or CBT.  These can be arranged by your GP, although there is usually a waiting list, or you can try to arrange it privately, or with a charirt, e.g Mind.  You could also call Saneline between 6pm and 11pm every day of the year for a chat and even the names of some local support groups/facilities.<br>  <br>  Getting out of the house is important, just to get some fresh air.  Exercise is very good for mental health, although it's hard to motivate yourself when you are depressed.  Maybe a brisk walk to the shops and back?  Have a list of things you need, and try just getting there and getting back.  The sunlight will do you good, especially as Spring is nearing now, so it's a bit less gloomy.  Most people brighten a little when the sun comes out, even if they don't have SAD.<br>  <br>  There are also complementary treatments/therapies that people report to work, although little research has been conducted - such as massage, acupuncture, taking St John's Wort (don't take if you're on antidepressants without consulting your Dr), or yoga.  Some people find these help to lift their mood.<br>  <br>  Try to come away from the computer and get on with some ADLs (activities of daily living) e.g. cooking, cleaning, self-care.  You say you've lost touch with friends, but if there's anyone, friends or family,that you are still in contact with, try to speak to them, as human contact is very important, and social isolation can become circular.  Try joining a group or club or attending a day centre to make new friends.

Many of these agents have unrealistic views of what a woman should look like. The fact is that to be healthy you need a certain amount of fat, and even if you do this monitored by a Dr. hes just doing what you paid him to do. I'm sorry but theres probably no way to convince anyone that this will not be too thin because it is. Thats probably not what you wanted to hear, but I wouldn't listen to anyone involved in entertainment or fashion industries because they are not scientists or doctors, they are just in the business to make their money whether your unhealthy or not.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	but it IS too thin

FhmEGBvyaa	Firstly you can lose as much weight as you want in a short time period, however, you will gain it back. I am speaking from experience from someone who has been there done that with fad diets. There is the obvious liposuction, however, the recovery time is 3 – 6 months and it sounds as though that you’re in a rush to lose the weight for possibly an event with no downtime to spare. I am and have been on weight watchers for 2 years and lost 25 lbs. It was a slow and steady race, however, I haven’t gained the weight back ‘cause my diet has been stabilized and so was the weight loss from 0.5 – 1 lb/week. <br>  <br>  Remember the weight gain didn’t happen overnight, it happened slowly over time, the same is with proper healthy weight loss, you can’t have/perform miracles over night. <br>  <br>  These are some things that I do.<br>  <br>  1. Drink lots of water as it kept me full longer. <br>  2. Used an appetite suppressant like hoodie to make sure I don’t go over my daily calorie intake. <br>  3. Did cardio and toning 3 – 4 times a week. <br>  4. Made meal and recipe modifications as I cooked. <br>  5. When I dined out, I made sure that I wasn’t shy about asking the kitchen to make modifications like dressing/sauce on the side, half portion ordered the kids meal etc. <br>  6. Brushing teeth after every meal, the mint acts like an appetite suppressant and without the taste in your mouth, you can easily forget about the food. <br>  7. Never drank diet cola, the aspartame actually made me crave food more for some reason. <br>  8. At work I take a break before lunch and either take the stairs in the building or just general toning without weights. We have a gym at work so I do about 15 minutes of weights which not only gets my blood flowing but releases tension from a**hole customers. <br>  9. Bought snacks in bulk (to save money) and properly measured what a cup or portion was and made individual baggies. There are some snacks on the market that are 100 calorie snacks, however, I find those to be too expensive than just buying in bulk and separating the portions yourself. Also by physically separating them yourself, you get an idea of what a portion is supposed to be and you  learn to properly eye ball correct portions.|`|S7KZDfixaa	You should be losing weight by doing that, but you may be feeling tired because your body probably isn't used to that yet. 1200 calories is said to be the minimum of calories consumed for a person who is trying to lose weight, so theres nothing wrong with 1500. Just don't go too far over that.

My name is Mary and I am posting this because I know what it’s like to be <br>  <br>  over weight and feel your life spiraling out of control. I was almost 360 pounds, struggling with my health and looking for a <br>  <br>  way out. Seriously, I would have done almost anything to make a change in my life. And I did, with very little success. <br>  <br>  Pills, therapy, even working out were getting me nowhere.<br>  <br>  No matter what I tried I never really saw a change because I could <br>  <br>  not stop my love of eating. It’s so hard for people to understand when they haven’t faced this struggle. Everyone just says <br>  <br>  that you have to will power. But if you are like me, you know there is much more to it.<br>  <br>  I realized I was holding my life in my <br>  <br>  hands and I made the decision to find a way out of my self-inflicted nightmare. After years of struggle and countless nights <br>  <br>  studying the ins and outs of exercise science I finally stumbled onto a Fat Loss program that caused me to lose 143 pounds <br>  <br>  and still allowed me to enjoy the foods I love. This is nothing like what you have done before. Fat Loss program changed my <br>  <br>  life and I could not believe just how easy it was.<br>  <br>  I want you to discover the key that turned my life around.<br>  <br>  For more <br>  <br>  information please visit: <br>  <a href="http://tiny-url.org/?5rbPCd" rel="nofollow">http://tiny-url.org/?5rbPCd</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  -Mary|`|H98aYOOTaa	If you drink 24oz of milk every day in substituion for another meal, cut your meal portions, and start excersizing. you will be at a good start. It is not a good idea to loose almost 90 lbs in a month in a half and you need to choose a weight that is healthy for you. at your height you should be thinking more towards 110-120. your best bet is to just start small give your self a goal of 20lbs each month(safe weight loss). Stay away from the junk... high sugar high fat etc... lets say for Breakfast you have a small bowl of cereal or a 24 oz glass of milk and a multi vitamin for lunch you have a tuna sandwich with lite may or a 24oz glass of milk and for dinner maybe some spaghetti or mac&cheese something nutritious. But remember to cut your portions... Take what you usually take and cut it in half. After some time of doing this your stomach will shrink and you will feel fuller faster.  eventuall you should reach your goal.|`|YhlGROVyaa	Do you realize that's less than 2 months?<br>  You may get dead, even if advised by a doctor.<br>  <br>  DON'T EVEN TRY A DIET YOU READ ON THE INTERNET<br>  DON'T EVEN USE ANY MEDICATION <br>  GO TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR<br>  ENJOY YOUR LIFE TODAY<br>  <br>  <br>  If you follow a diet you read here or in the rest of the internet, you may:<br>  - Get sick<br>  - Gain more weight<br>  - Die<br>  - Keep the same and become frustrated, very frustrated<br>  <br>  But, c'mon you are thirteen, you want to hear the magical words, you don't want to hear me say there's no chance to get to the 105 and keep there.<br>  <br>  Look I don't know why you are 195, and nobody here knows. maybe it's in your genes, maybe your habits, maybe the brand of peanut butter you mom buys. <br>  <br>  Your best chance is to get a healthy life to August 25. If you get that goal you may be succesful in get to your right weight with time and constantly. And, over all, you won't get dead.<br>  <br>  My best advice, see your doctor.<br>  As I don't know if you have the time or whatever to do this, my second best advice is: Drink more water, not chilled water, not cold water, not flavoured water. Just water. Ask your mom not to fry the meals. Eat more vegetables, and eat the vegetables before everything else. Stop drinking sodas, candies and all sort of delicious stuff. And walk. At least half an hour daily. If you do your room, and your home (hehehe) at the end of the day there would be for you a workout just done.<br>  <br>  Again, it is better if you go to see your doctor, a nutriologist.
rsMCAlEfaa	i know how you feel...i find exercise extremely boring. but i do it while watching tv. put your exercise equipment in a room with a tv and exercise while watching your favorite shows. that way you'll be done with those 40 mins on a treadmill or bike or whatever it may be without even realizing that you've been doing it for so long|`|qwg36SEmaa	You need a fitness program that also deals with your mindset.

DpILcTdCaa	Set up an appointment for sure that way you wont show up unexpected, or when he is out of the office that would feel ackward explaining your self to the office staff. When you call and they ask why you need to see the doc just tell them its nothing serious, but a symptom to discuss with the doctor in private. And just like you asked your question, just tell him you are having what your going through and as he has probaly heard it a millions times and will think nothing of it but just to treat your condition thats what they are there for, they are not there to judge you. Good luck!!!!|`|29fa5460a9c16006e5e07e22271195c2aa	PE is more common than your think. I would call and schedule an appointment. When they ask you over the phone what for just tell them. They will not be shocked or look at you any differently. Alot of times you cant just show up and be able to talk with the doctor. He will want to talk to you so it is best if you have an appointment scheduled.|`|wQolC8nwaa	Call and make an appointment. When you do go in, just say it outright and why you are concerned about it.<br>  <br>  Doctors have heard all so there is no need to feel awkward. |`|fa70fc6c0ebd4df17b301a1c34d3c0b0aa	My opinion is call make an appointment and when asked what you would like to be seen for just explain to them that you have some health concerns but would rather discuss them with the doc first. Or just tell them your concerns. The only reason they ask is to get an idea how much time you may need. It's not like they are going to build a neon sign about your house say "Quick Draw McGraw lives here" Sorry I'm not poking fun I am just trying to make a point. Then when you get in with the doc just lay your cards on the table and say I am concerned about this how can you help me? Honest forthright conversation is the key to any problem if you truly want to solve it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Godspeed|`|AA12363568	I think having sex more frequently would help.

This could cause some tooth pain.  Are your jaws tense?  Also, go back to the dentist and let him know you're still having problems.  The new filling may need adjusting.|`|Lhl5hfTdaa	Could be your sinuses draining. My teeth hurt and that's what my dentist says. I guess it drains right where the roots of the teeth are.|`|VT0YGdK2aa	could be sensitivity.  Go to your dentist and have them apply a desensitizer to the teeth.

Drink the contents. Then put the Sur-Gel in the old bottle and add water. Mix up well and drink.  Then make sure you pee at least once and continue to drink water up until the point of the drug test. When you go to take it don't immediately pee in the bottle wait till about the end and then fill it up this will help dilute it as much as possible.|`|WcYRd9DLaa	GNC?

1j60dOgOaa	You cant get HIV from saliva. Nobody in history has ever gotten HIV from saliva...EVER. There is HIV in saliva, but not enough to transmit to another person. I am familiar with every kind of HIV strain out there from Subtype-B in USA and England, to Subtype-O in the Sahara and Subtype-E in Thailand. None of them can be transmitted through saliva.Theory is that if there is a cut in your mouth, it can be transmitted if the person is in the window period (first 2 months of being infected) or has a high viral load...but this is just theory...there have been no cases of it actually happening. You should move as soon as possible, that really is awful that they make it so hard to get tested. I'm curious what country. They should link HIV to sex since thats the most common way people get it, but they should also offer free testing because its an epidemic that needs to be stopped and all countries need to come together to do that.|`|d2YvAtOjaa	I hear once that you would have to swallow about 8 pints of someones saliva to risk being infected with HIV.

AA10927032	Chicken noodle soup, hot tea with sugar and lemon, warm compresses and aspirin[aspirin is a home remedy, we've  known the bark of the willow tree had pain relieving properties for centuries] for the headache, Eucerin cream[not the lotion, the kind that comes in the tub, and don't buy the generic] for your sore nose. and drink lots of water. <br>  And if you are over 21, a little whiskey in your night time tea. <br>  And take a multivitamin, if you don't already.<br>  If you have a shower, get in it and have the water as warm as you can stand it, or if you don't want to shower or don't have one, shut the bathroom door with you inside and fill the bathtub with hot water and stay there until it cools off.

AA11118134	Do not rest with this answer.  Your husband should see his medical doctor and perhaps an ear/nose/throat specialist.<br>  <br>  My brother suffered serious sinus infections, swollen glands, headaches, etc., only to find out there was a serious infection in the root of one of his teeth.  The nerves from the teeth and sinuses are in fact connected and it is not rare.  Don't want to scare you but a close friend of ours actually suffered severe infection damage from having a tooth removed and the consequences were fatal.<br>  <br>  Do not accept answers from doctors until your husband is fully cured and you feel confident in the treatment he received.|`|5ad2006c18cf8d84e93065fc6861de66aa	Although, this is not very common, it does happen. I think your husband should first finish his antibiotics and then go from there. If there is still signs of an infection, he should definitely call his dentist, and possibly an oral surgeon.|`|VT0YGdK2aa	Our office has had this occur once in the 3 years I have been there.  We referred the patient to the oral surgeon to have the remaining root tip removed and artifical bone was placed in the socket and the tissue was sutured to close the hole.  I would have your husband see a specialist to get rid of the problem.

It's plastic on the outside, cloth on the inside with velcro straps you would wear over socks.<br>  <br>  That's what you would normally wear to sleep in.

NbUwThM4aa	you can get a cap for your tooth. root canals are waaaaay $$$ and the nerve probably isn't damaged.|`|qrGLcTh4aa	Any option you have will be expensive. Unfortunately dental care isn't cheap and insurance doesn't help very much. <br>  <br>  Here are you options:<br>  - get a root canal and the have it bonded<br>  - get a root canal followed by a crown<br>  - get a root canal followed by a veneer<br>  - get the tooth pulled and get an implant<br>  - get the tooth pulled and get a bridge<br>  <br>  The reason root canals are recommended before restorative work is to prevent pain for you in the future.  Restorations, like crowns and veneers are a lot for a tooth that has already been traumatized to handle. The natural effect will be for the tooth to die on it's own. Then you will definitely need one( a root canal). Symptoms of needing a root canal is pain and infection. Also, if you choose to skip the root canal and do the restoration only (if you have problems in the future) a dentist will have to drill through the restoration to do the root canal. That can cause damage or breakage to the restoration.  Any dentist should recommend a root canal first as a preventative. <br>  <br>  On a side note, what a lot of people will do in this situation is have the restoration made in a lighter shade than your natural teeth. The reason is, restorations and bonding material don't respond to dental bleach. So, if you think you may want to bleach your teeth at some point, you can bleach them to the shade of the restoration. Hope this helps! <br>  Good luck to you

VXy7ja5uaa	it really depends on what medications your put on. I started them when i was 17 and the first one they tried me on made my wanna kill myself. it was scary. So now I've been on another one for a couple years. Its great if i remember to take them on time. It takes a while for them to kick into ur system. But I feel much better when i'm taking them and actually they help me focus better too. Kinda an energy boost. Thats why i take mine in the morning. But like i said it all depends on the one they prescribe and the dose. Ask your doctor/therapist what kinda side effects you should see being on the meds.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	here are some side effects of antidepressants<br>  <a href="http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/antidepressant-medications.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/12/anti...</a>|`|5PcMA84Zaa	Antidepressants will not interfere with your coordination and focus. Some antidepressants that can cause drowsiness will need to be taken at night. Side effects I have experienced personally with Tricyclic antidepressants are sedation and weight gain. These are older antidepressants (ie: elavil,tofranil) and weight gain is fairly common with them. Doctors nowadays commonly prescribe S.S.R.I's (prozac,paxil,zoloft,etc). My experience with those has not been good. They caused me to have wild mood swings, but this side effect is NOT very common. How well they will work and the side effects all depend in the individuals brain chemistry.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) with dinner, for depression and anxiety.

They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.<br>   <br>  It takes a couple weeks before you'll feel them starting to work, and from four to six weeks before they're working fully.|`|LV8dLB2zaa	Antidepressants are a long term, low dose kind of set up.

8AwjYQ0Baa	try being more physical throughout your day. go for a long run, workout at the gym, play a sport, anything that will get your body tired instead of just your mind. when your mind is tired and not your body, you end up taking little naps if anything at all. if you get your body tired, you should sleep all the way through the night. also, make sure youre not eating anything before you go to bed, you dont want your body trying to go into digestion mode, getting all excited about breaking down food, while youre trying to calm down and go to sleep.|`|ST19Eq3baa	Go to bed the same time every day example every 8 or 9 pm and avoid caffeine 3 to 4 hours before sleeping.|`|7DzcIkKRaa	Keep yourself active throughout the day, try some decaffeinated tea before bed, also playing some relaxing nature sounds on low volume is a good way to relax the mind.|`|tTIYrhphaa	sometimes listening to music or getting thoughts out on paper before you go to bed helps. listening to soothing sounds like the rain or the wind that they make for the ipod are very relaxing as well. try drinking hot tea that isn't that sweet or warm milk before you lie down at night. if you have a lot on your mind, talk about it during the day instead of keeping it on your consence. it might not be the best idea to be over active during the day right now because of the lack of sleep. hope this helps =]
VXy7ja5uaa	well surely it looks like your hair falling out is causing your enough stress. Your doctor telling you your just under stress isn't really helping you much. You should ask about how to manage stress and see if thats really what causing it. It can be other things, but I would imagine stress would be the first culprit. Try hair and nail vitamins and that should help you feel better about the situation. Your hair should grow back just fine. Also you may wanna ask yourself if your pulling on your hair when your not paying attention or messing with it, cause those are all signs of stress. Its your way of coping.|`|Ve6RAuq3aa	if u arent sure whether or not ur under stress, then i doubt u are...when ppl are stressed they pretty much always know it....the hair should grow back by itself unless u have damaged it in anyway or if u have a history of baldness in ur family

uYkqXWN4aa	Sounds like it could be Wittmaack-Ekbom's syndrome, also known as "Restless legs syndrome" or RLS. RLS is a condition that is characterized by an irresistible urge to move one's body to stop uncomfortable or odd sensations. RLS causes a sensation in the legs or arms that can most closely be compared to a burning, itching, or tickling sensation in the muscles. <br>  <br>  You mention your anxiety, but not what prescription medication(s), if any, you take for it. This is relevant because RLS is a side-effect of some medications used for anxiety.<br>  <br>  If it's not a side effect of your medication, or you're not taking medications for anxiety, RLS could also be tied to an iron deficiency, folate deficiency, sleep apnea, uremia, diabetes, thyroid disease, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease and certain auto-immune disorders - it doesn't have to be a side effect of medication. <br>  <br>  Talk with your doctor about this possibility and get his/her opinion. They'd know best (usually..). You can also try sleeping with mittins on.|`|Gk00iL6waa	How about Xanax?

A good friend of my dads helped me and talked with me. Try talking with someone you know would be good with helping you out.

I have it also and the meds actually made me feel better to start, then progressively worse. Ive been seeing a psychologist and his best advice was to flow with it but dont think about it. Like if you feel it coming on then say to yourself, "Its ok this will pass" and do something that distracts your mind from it. I know it sounds easier said than done because i was also the same, though it does work and im getting better from it. He said the worst thing about anxiety is the "anxiety you get from the anxiety" if that makes any sense? Meaning the more you think about an attack when your having one the worse it becomes. Meditation also helps because it allows you to train your brain how to think, you have complete control over it.<br>  Worked for me.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I agree with not taking the xanax, my dr won't precribe them at all.(pyschiatrist).<br>  However, take one pill a day-ask your Dr about Lexapro.

If you do any exercise today, it is not mandatory to participate in sport, but a daily walk or a bit of swimming each week can already do a lot.<br>  <br>  Warning! if you need to lose five kilograms or more, go see a doctor or a dietician because you need regular monitoring.
FYUHJyvpaa	It is to make small changes in both the routine every day. Some time of adjustment is often necessary to establish a new habit and then it becomes automatic. The calorie is a measure of energy. A kilo is 7000 calories. Save 100 calories per day for 365 days gives 36,500 calories, equivalent to 5 kilograms. The result can be doubled by cutting 100 calories from food and expending 100 additional calories per day.
VPlKbDplaa	You didn't say the age of the infant. There is a serious risk of dehydration so if it persists more than a day get medical advice from a doctor.

AA11678263	You did very well to get out of this relationship, as many get trapped into the loop of "he's just doing it because he loves me/I'm bad/he's trying to help" which clearly he is not.  It is an abusive relationship, and sounds like it could escalate to a fully violent one, so don't ever. ever consider going back to him.  He is barraging you with unwanted attention, and contacting your family.  Essentially this is harassment, and you have the right to make a formal complaint about him and/or get a restraining order to force him to desist.  Just because the attention he is paying you now is "positive" ie not hateful, does not mean it is not harassment.  He is trying to win you back, which is another controlling move. You've done really well to get out of this - don't let him ruin any more of your life.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	You are in a real dilemma and I truly feel sorry for you. I know (from experience) how it feels when a partner fails to get the message of rejection. Of course there is only one way to resolve this do you know and it is not by way of a restraining order...or warning him off....or getting his or your friends to warn him off. You will have to replace him with another. This is a courageous step however as partners of rejection do not all act similiarly when faced with this situation.The majority just walk away and forget you and find another. Some however  take it seriously where the "offending" partner (the one who did the rejection) to them has to be punished..somehow ...someway ("how dare she do this to me when I love her") goes the rationale (or the irrationale)!!!.

FyVdQKIBaa	The most common cause for low blood pressure is dehydration - it causes you to faint and get dizzy, light headed. Drink more water, especially considering your age. Try it, you'll feel better.<br>  <br>  Here's a link for more info.|`|jRqXZV6Oaa	Dehydration is a common cause for dizziness, as stated above.  <br>  <br>  The way to confirm if it is from dehydration is by checking what is called 'orthostatic blood pressures.'  If you have an automatic BP monitor, this should be easy to do.  <br>  <br>  First, lie down for at least 3-5 minutes and relax, then take your BP while still lying down.  Next, sit up on the side of the bed or chair, just sit for 3-5 min, then take BP again.  Then stand for several minutes and take a standing BP.<br>  <br>  If your BP is lower while you are standing and sitting than when you are lying down, that confirms dehydration.|`|84d32624933be7b9f1140bd3c088d39caa	It may be because of dehydration.

8CGOfmk3aa	Carrots are a good source of beta-carotene.  Technically, while eating carrots is very healthy for you, if you take too much of it your skin will turn orange, and I'm sure you don't want that to happen.<br>  <br>  The basic rule to losing weight is making sure your caloric intake is less than your output.  In simpler words, your body must expend more energy than you are taking in.  It won't really matter what you take in as long as your caloric intake is less than output.  Fats have the most energy with 9 Calories per gram, while carbohydrates and proteins both have 4 Calories per gram.  (Side note: be careful of saturated/trans fats.  Even if you lose weight and manage to look good, your cholesterol level can still be high which leads to arterial damage)  <br>  <br>  If you're eating massive mounts of carrots and carrot soup, your caloric intake may be equal as your output.  While this may be healthier than getting your calories from fatty food, I would suggest a smaller, but more balanced meal, which includes essential fatty acid and essential protein.  Introduce lean beef or chicken and fruits into your diet.  Good luck.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Carrots are really good for you, as long as you include them in a healthy diet.  Carrots alone (even with a little tomato and onion) will never come close to meeting your nutritional needs.  By doing this you are putting you body in a starvation mode.  The first time you eat any thing else your body will store it as fat.  This is NOT healthy, you may loose weight at first but damage your organs.  If you are serious about loosing weight.  Don't fall into dangerous diet traps, like eating only carrots.  You need to change your life style.  It's not fun being thin if you are too sick to get out of bed.<br>  The best advice. . . . Eat less, move more.<br>  You can snack all you want between meals.....as long as it is on fruits, vegetables and nuts (check the serving size and don't go over board on the nuts all though a healthy fat, you can over do it.)<br>  Drink plenty of water.<br>  Eat only whole grain bread, cereals and pasta's<br>  Cut way back on sodium and  sugar (soda's, candy etc.) <br>  Don't skip meals.  Eat 3 meals a day,  making sure your portions are the correct size.<br>  Portion sizes are listed on the food containers or at any number of sites on the internet.<br>  If you eat out, more often then not, you will be served double or even triple what you should consume in a single meal.  So eat 1/3 to 1/2 and eat the rest for lunch the next day.<br>  Last but certainly not least,  Move More.|`|gP7XSy9paa	yes but i would recommend home made pumpkin soup|`|s9G56VH7aa	You will lose weight, but that is a *terribly* unbalanced diet.

sTdlAMv7aa	I'm not sure about the dosage.  I know how much testosterone men produce daily but I'm not certain how much estrogen that premenopausal women produce daily (allowing for variations within a cycle), nor how much a biomale needs for feminization.  But I think there are safer/more pleasant options for your goals.<br>  <br>  Aldactone/Spironolactone can lower testosterone & feminize appearance but quite a number of male to female tgs I talk to say they don't like it, as it makes them feel "heavy".<br>  <br>  Premarin has different types of estrogen, including equilin & equilenin from mares.  Equilenin does not occur in humans (& equilin probably doesn't either).  These estrogens are not nearly as safe as human estrogens.<br>  <br>  Perhaps requesting compounded estrogen or Tri-Est cream would be better, offering fewer side effects.  Most pills (including estrogen pills) tax the liver.

Some of these disorders are passed down from parents to children (inherited). Many people with primary immunodeficiency are born missing some of the body's immune defenses, making them more susceptible to germs that cause infections. Between 25,000 and 50,000 people in the Unites States live with a primary immunodeficiency disorder.<br>  <br>  According to the World Health Organization, there are over 100 different types of primary immunodeficiency. What type you have depends on which genetic defect is present. Examples include:<br>  <br>  Common variable immune deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) <br>  Selective IgA deficiency <br>  X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's disease) <br>  Severe combined immune deficiency <br>  In some cases, untreated primary immunodeficiency can lead to long-term health problems, including permanent damage to organs such as the ears or lungs, or physical disability.<br>  <br>  <br>  One of the most common signs of primary immunodeficiency is an increased susceptibility to infection. You may have infections that are more frequent, longer lasting or harder to treat than are the infections of someone with a normal immune system. You may also get infections that a person with a healthy immune system would not get (called opportunistic infections). However, signs and symptoms differ depending on the particular type of disorder you have, and signs and symptoms also vary from person to person.<br>  <br>  Signs of primary immunodeficiency can include:<br>  <br>  Frequent and recurrent ear infections, pneumonia, meningitis, bronchitis, sinus infections or skin infections <br>  Blood infections <br>  Inflammation and infection of internal organs, such as the liver <br>  Rheumatic disorders (such as lupus or arthritis) <br>  Thyroid disease <br>  Blood disorders, such as low platelet counts or anemia <br>  Digestive problems, such as cramping, loss of appetite, nausea and diarrhea <br>  Delayed growth and development
zMUCCSdBaa	Superantigens are bacterial products that activate T cells by binding to APC (antigen presenting cells) via beta1 chain of class II MHC molecules outside the antigen binding groove and to TCRs via V beta chains outside the antigen binding site. Since superantigens bind all V beta chains of a paticular class, they activate all member of TCR V beta families, which may comprise up to 20% or more of T cells. As example, Stapylococci exotoxin able to activate T cell and release abundant cytokines and result in toxic shock syndrome|`|AA12266052	Superantigens (SAgs) are secreted proteins (exotoxins) that exhibit highly potent lymphocyte-transforming (mitogenic) activity directed towards T lymphocytes.

x1CcZBENaa	1. You must stop your skin pores from being clogged. For this purpose you should do skin cleansing with plenty of hot water and soap.<br>     2. Do not use harsh products because they can strip your skin of oil and encourage flakiness.<br>     3. Do not use skincare products which leave your skin feeling stretched tight and dehydrated.<br>     4. Do use oil-free moisturizers to lessen the oil shine on your complexion.<br>     5. Wash your face two to three times a day.<br>     6. Do not use heaving cleansers or harsh soaps. A combination of an antibacterial cleansing lotion or a lightly medicated soap with water rich in minerals can be very effective.<br>     7. When cleansing, massage your face well with your fingertips, using an upward and outward motion. Be careful not to rub soap into the skin; it can clog pores.<br>     8. If your oily skin is flaking then use a deep-cleaning exfoliant on alternate nights.<br>     9. If you oily skin is sensitive then use white or rose-colored clays.<br>    10. Use a light antiseptic night cream.<br>    11. Choose cosmetic and facial care products that suit to your oily skin.<br>    12. Before applying makeup, use an antiseptic day cream with active ingredients.|`|17b088d67647626fb8f52e0b628f36f1aa	Cleansing is an essential part of caring for your skin. The key is to treat your skin gently. <br>  <br>  Use warm water and limit bath time. Hot water and long showers or baths remove oils from your skin. Limit your bath or shower time to about 15 minutes or less, and use warm, rather than hot, water. <br>  Avoid strong soaps. Strong soaps — those most capable of stripping oil from your skin — can leave your skin dry. Instead, choose mild soaps or detergent substitutes with added oils and fats. Good choices include Dove, Vanicream, Cetaphil and Purpose. <br>  Avoid irritating additives. If your skin is sensitive, avoid products containing perfumes or dyes. These can irritate your skin and may trigger an allergic response. <br>  Remove eye makeup carefully. Use a soft sponge, cotton cloth or cotton balls when removing eye makeup to avoid damaging the delicate tissue around your eyes. If you wear heavy, waterproof makeup, you may need to use an oil-based product, such as Eucerin, Aquaphor or petroleum jelly, to remove makeup. <br>  Pat dry. After washing or bathing, gently pat or blot your skin dry with a towel so that some moisture remains on the skin. Immediately moisturize your skin with an oil or cream. <br>  4. Moisturize regularly<br>  Moisturizers help maintain your skin's natural moisture levels. They work by providing a seal over your skin — to keep water from escaping — or by slowly releasing water into your skin. <br>  <br>  The moisturizer that's best for you and the frequency with which you need to moisturize depend on many factors, including your skin type, your age and whether you have specific conditions such as acne. A good way to test if you need a moisturizer is to wait 20 minutes after bathing. If your skin feels tight, you should apply a moisturizer. <br>  <br>  Select a moisturizer with an SPF of at least 15 to help protect your skin from damaging ultraviolet rays. If you have sensitive skin, look for products free of heavy dyes, perfumes or other additives. If your skin is very dry, you may want to apply an oil, such as baby oil, while your skin is still moist. Oil has more staying power than moisturizers do and prevents the evaporation of water from the surface of your skin. If your skin is oily, you may want to skip moisturizing.|`|pBhbQiMtaa	Foods causing acne is a myth. There has been no factual proof that food or drink causes acne.

AA12266052	Consult a doctor (pulmonary medicine) for the treatment of nicotine dependence.|`|ecM7pdHwaa	Smoke is the collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases[1] emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (cf. fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defense (smoke-screen) or smoking (tobacco, marijuana, crack, etc.). Smoke is used in rituals, when incense, sage, or resin are burned to produce a smell for spiritual purposes. Smoke is sometimes used as a flavoring agent and preservative for various foodstuffs. Smoke is also sometimes a component of internal combustion engine exhaust gas, particularly diesel exhaust.<br>  <br>  Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.<br>  <br>  Smoke particles are an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light. This effect has been likened to three-dimensional textured privacy glass[citation needed] — a smoke cloud does not obstruct an image, but thoroughly scrambles it.
AA12266052	You should consult a doctor (Pulmonary medicine) for the treatment of nicotine dependence.|`|xdo49r2iaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Pl. find here withe the information about quitting smoking.<br>  <br>  Four ways to stop smoking<br>  <br>  There are numerous ways that people can use to stop smoking. <br>  The most popular ways used to quit smoking and not in any particular order are:<br>  1. Willpower.<br>  This is probably the most used ways for stopping smoking and one that does work. Actually a certain amount of willpower will be required no matter what method of quitting smoking you use.<br>  The description willpower is not helpful as far as stopping smoking is concerned because of the perceived battle that the word suggests.  It suggests a fight and implies that if you are strong minded you will succeed and that if you fail you are weak minded.<br>   <br>  A better word would be 'decision'. Just make your decision and then that can be that. But make it a final decision and not some half-hearted attempt and then you may be able to  quit successfully.<br>  2. Cutting down<br>  This involves willpower with the idea of feedback that you are succeeding plus knowing that you are gradually weaning yourself off any real or perceived chemical dependency of cigarettes. In theory it sounds great because if each day you smoke one less cigarette you know you are getting closer to stopping. <br>  The disadvantage of this method is in order to know how many cigarettes you are smoking you have to count them and then know at any particular moment of the day how many you have had and how many more you can have. This means that you have to think about smoking much more than if you were smoking freely. If something is on your mind constantly, then it can make it harder to stop it. If you really want to succeed with using the cutting down method, do not get into counting your cigarettes.<br>  A better option is to decide to leave out certain cigarettes such as the one at 10:30 or the one after lunch. This way you do not have to count how many you are smoking and yet you know you are cutting down.<br>  3.  Patches, Gum and Lozenges.<br>  These methods still give you nicotine. The idea is that it helps with any withdrawal symptoms you may have to deal with to stop smoking. It is an odd sort of logic in that patches, gum and lozenges still give you nicotine as a way of helping you to stop taking nicotine via cigarettes. <br>  Also as long as you chew gum, suck lozenges or have to wear a patch it constantly reminds you of smoking. A constant reminder as we mentioned is not a useful method to use to help stop doing something.<br>  4. False Cigarette<br>  This is a substitute for the action and behavior of smoking but without the intake of all the chemicals involved.  It helps those who would miss doing something with the hands, or those who would feel less confident without having something in their hands. <br>  The down side is that although you are no longer inhaling all those poisons you are still keeping the habit and behavior of smoking going.<br>  There are several methods used to stop smoking. Which one works best? Ask those who have tried.  See if one of those will work for you.<br>  The five keys for quitting are according to the Clinical Practice <br>  <br>  1) Get ready.<br>  - Set a quit date and stick to it – don't take in even a single puff.<br>  - Get rid of all cigarettes and ashtrays in your home, car or workplace.<br>  - Think about past quit attempts. What worked and what didn’t?<br>  2) Get support and encouragement.<br>  - Tell your family, friends and co-workers you are quitting.<br>  - Talk to your doctor or other health care provider.<br>  - Get group, individual, online or telephone counseling.<br>  Stay in non-smoking areas.<br>  3) Learn new skills and behaviors.<br>  - When you first try to quit, change your normal routine.<br>  - Reduce stress.<br>  - Distract yourself from urges to smoke.<br>  - Plan something enjoyable to do every day.<br>  - Drink a lot of water and other non carbonated, non caffine fluids.<br>  - Breathe in deeply when you feel the urge to smoke.<br>  - Reward yourself often.<br>  4) Get medication and use it correctly.<br>  - Talk with your health care provider about which medication will work best for you: Bupropion SR (available by prescription); nicotine gum (available over-the-counter); nicotine inhaler (available by prescription); nicotine nasal spray (available by prescription); or nicotine patch (available over-the-counter). <br>  5) Be prepared for relapse or difficult situations.<br>  - Avoid alcohol.<br>  - Be careful around other smokers.<br>  - Improve your mood in ways other than smoking.<br>  - Eat a healthy diet and stay physically active.<br>  - Keep busy.|`|uFSDEo9Uaa	<a href="http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/" rel="nofollow">http://stopsmoking.eu.pn/</a> is a new approach on quitting for free.<br>  This site is designed for everyone who seriously wants to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  It doesn’t matter if you are a five a day teenager, or a one hundred a day pensioner, male or female, or if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at stopping - if you really want to stop smoking then this is the site for you, and it's free.|`|hl5cZxO2aa	Now a days some harmless nicotine tablets are available.

udUzdU7Raa	Losing weight and getting fitter is really quite simple. All you have to do is a few simple things. Firstly, clear your fridge of fatty junk foods. If there’s no temptation, you cannot fall. Secondly, stock up on watermelon and other fruits. Watermelon is excellent because it clears out your digestive system of toxins and waste, leaving you feeling and being healthier. Next, begin exercising every day. Do not go too hard. If running, don’t go fast or uphill, unless you want bulky muscle. A steady pace each day for a minimum of 30 minutes will allow you to shed fat and tone your body. Set a day each week when you each junk food, but try not to go overboard and ruin the work of every other day. Drink plenty of water, often when you think you are hungry, you are actually thirsty. If you are getting cravings, have a glass of water, wait 5 minutes, and then see if you still want food. This usually gets rid of those nasty afternoon hunger pangs for me!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you get the results you want!!|`|kdXTunqgaa	My friends and I are following weightlosssecret.info. to the letter and I have lost 8 kilos now since December.

If you have a lot of unresolved feelings that need sorting out or expressing these could be a major factor in your sleeping problem.<br>  <br>  No.2 When a person has difficulty sleeping its because your basic biological body clock's rhythm has shifted or changed. And there is normally some factor that's caused that shift.<br>  <br>  **The bodies internal clock is called your "circadian rhythm" and is triggered by hormones in the body & brain. These hormones are part of the dopamine system, dopamine in turn affects how our neurotransmitters in the brain work. We start to feel tired and want to go to sleep when dusk comes & the fading of the daylight triggers a dopamine response in the brain thus we feel tired & go to bed for sleep but the dopamine response can be messed up and thus the body clock is messed up too as a result.<br>  <br>  **There MIGHT BE a genuine medical cause for such a reaction and so my advise would DON'T dismiss or discount a genuine medical cause for this, it is possible. So if it persists its not unrealistic or unreasonable to seek help from your GP and in some cases you can even be referred by a GP for a sleep study and hopefully treatment of some sort.<br>  <br>  **Sleeping tablets should only be used as a total last resort really because they change the dopamine responses in the body & brain. But even brain & body can become accustomed to the sleeping tablets over time so they become either habit forming i.e. cannot sleep without them which doesn't fix the problem long term or the tablets become less and less effective so your no better off again long term.<br>  <br>  Ivan|`|ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of  warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to master, (Progressive Muscular Relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day. An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, saying to yourself: "Even though I sometimes have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. <br>  <br>  Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm</a>  The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective, although I haven't tried the other 2 methods. Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.<br>  <br>  Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea.  I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, in section 3, on page A, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. Have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3.

It's very true, size only matters to a point, then it only gets rediculous and women complain. Well to answer the question, depends if you started puberty early or late. If late, you may keep growing till your 20. Even if you started early you should grow up to 18 so you still have plenty of time to reach your end point. As for some guys' insecurities they may say they have an 8" plus or even 7.5" but that's a total crock. Very few actually have monster penises. Most are around 6/6.5 I'd say.

In contrast, compare the menus used on the low-fat diet: On the one hand, the total calorie content of a typical American daily diet is about 2800 calories, of which almost 50 per cent is fat. <br>  <br>  The low-fat diet provides approximately 1800 calories (1000 calories less) the low-fat diet to lose weight provides 1200 or 1000 or 800 calories. Here the fat content is about 15 per cent of the total dietary calorie content and is the amount found in the diets of millions of non-Americans who are virtually free of atherosclerosis or heart attacks and strokes. What a clear-cut and simple choice is given us for better health and longer life!<br>  <br>  The question may still arise, "Isn't fat necessary for normal health and nutrition?"

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

x5BfWGvOaa	have u not considered the possibility that the reason why your parents are harder on you than your sister is that they expected more from you? they probably see that you could do better and behave more maturely than your sister who, as you might have described as a total failure. your parents probably see you as having a better future than your sister that's why they want you to do better, and it frustrates them to see you do otherwise. your parents have probably given up on your sister and they now turn their focus on you. On your part you should respond to all these in a positive and constructive way. and i'd like to congratulate you for being able to deal well with your eating problems. it's a sign that you can really do better inspite of the odds. please do not be depressed my friend. a lot of people go through life with much worse circumstances than you have but they were still able to pull themselves out and become well adjusted people. it's all a matter of how you look at your life...that's called perspective. you only end up defeated when you let things defeat you. you're still growing up and you still have a long way to go. if you let all these things defeat you and affect you at this early part of your life..then you will  fail when you face the more serious problems in the future..in the real world. remember my friend...depression is for those who,ve convince themselves that there is no hope. there is always hope.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	Do not starve yourself.<br>  <br>  Talk to someone you trust, friends and adults, because eating disorders can get ugly.<br>  <br>  Think about what you need to do for you and don't worry about your sister.<br>  <br>  Hugs!

If you ask with intent to really know the answer, and not like a complaint or a "why do you hate me" attitude, you will get a lot better response from them. <br>  <br>  Also, when people stop pushing us to be better, and driving us to be better, that is a sign that they have given up on us.

Think, everything  that happens is not the symptom of a greater illness. Bodies are crazy things and sometimes have reactions at random. Don't over examine yourself. When you notice something, don't mess with it. You can make  it an actual problem. Just keep your mind about you. Never be dissatisfied with who you are. If you see something that you think is disfigured or abnormal, think about everything else about you that you like. I'm sure there is something. focus on your good points and less on the bad. It sounds Cliche but when you think highly of yourself good things happen and happiness follows.

ZQMjPCDxaa	Depending on the severity of the burn, I would contact your doctor or go to your local ER. Oil burns are the most severe burns a person can get, and can lead to infection. It is hard to remove all of the oil, so it can continue to burn and irritate the affected spot. If the burn isn't that bad, I would still talk to your doctor and ask how to treat it (via phone, there's no point in going all the way to the doctor for something that isn't that major.) He might advise you to apply a burn salve, or an antibiotic ointment, and then apply a gauze pad over the spot. You need to keep the area clean and sterile, as burns can become infected very easily.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Aloe vera gel works best, especially if you keep a bottle in your fridge.|`|ZQxCcG6qaa	burn salve...it will feel really cool but won't stop the blood flow to your hand which is needed to heal.<br>  <br>  aloe vera could also be used but burn salve (gel) had medication in it.<br>  take a mild pain reliever like tylonnel.<br>  <br>  try to leave the burn unbandaged when you can. keep it covered while you sleep so fuzzies from clothes and bedsheets don't get stuck to it. if it blisters open it and disinfect it. most tell you not to open it but if you keep is clean it won't get infected and will heal faster.<br>  <br>  when you burn yourself you should hold your hand under HOT water..not scalding but the pain will lessen..or milk...i don't know why it works but it does.|`|AA10308264	take toothpaste.. apply all over the affected area... but b4 that.. 1st put your hand under water... and may be even try to give a cold ice pack treatment for better results & stop burning sensation
SQLSOeHcaa	A number of things can cause tingling in the arm and hand. The two most common problems are carpal tunnel syndrome and a<br>  pinched nerve in the neck. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is caused by a compression of the median nerve at the wrist. It is<br>  often associated with repetitive movements with the hand, for example typing, factory line work, or woodworking, etc. The<br>  most common symptoms are numbness in the first 2 fingers, pain at the wrist and loss of grip strength, However, the symptoms<br>  may involve the whole hand and radiate up the arm. Symptoms are usually worse with movement and better at rest. They will<br>  typically wake a person up at night due to the positions of the hands when we sleep. The pinched nerve in the neck (cervical<br>  radiculopathy) is also caused by a compression of the nerve as it exits the spine. It is usually compressed by a herniated disc or<br>  a bony spur from arthritis, The pain will typically shoot down the arm in association with neck movements. It may also cause<br>  numbness and weakness. These two disorders are best diagnosed by an EMG (electromyography)test. <br>  There are a number of other possible disorders that may cause numbness down the arm, and I therefore recommend that you<br>  seek evaluation by a neurologist. A complete neurologic exam is needed to diagnose you correctly. This is a frequent complaint<br>  that neurologist see.<br>  <br>   Good luck.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I honestly think it's normal but it would be a good idea to see a physical therapist just to be safe.<br>  <br>  Recently, my arm, the back, has been twitching a lot.

AA11835801	I too suffer from anxiety attacks.  A helpful tip I received was to place the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth (you should be able to feel the back of your two front teeth).  Breath deeply in and out from your mouth until you feel more calm.    <br>  <br>  Also, when our bodies lack Magnesium, stress levels are raised.  Take calcium, magnesium, and b-complex vitamins daily.  <br>  <br>  Get 30 minutes of exercise everyday.  Walking really helps me.<br>  <br>  Avoid caffeine, sugar and alcohol.  <br>  <br>  Lavender is a great for stress too.  You can get lavender incense or essential oil and burn that in your house.  <br>  <br>  During an attack, tell yourself you are in control.  Don't think of how you can't breath, or are going to die, but instead do the breathing exercise and keep telling yourself you are going to be okay. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope these suggestions are helpful to you.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	This is definitely an anxiety attack, but you need to figure out where it comes from.

All you have to do is a few simple things. Firstly, clear your fridge of fatty junk foods. If there’s no temptation, you cannot fall. Secondly, stock up on watermelon and other fruits. Watermelon is excellent because it clears out your digestive system of toxins and waste, leaving you feeling and being healthier. Next, begin exercising every day. Do not go too hard. If running, don’t go fast or uphill, unless you want bulky muscle. A steady pace each day for a minimum of 30 minutes will allow you to shed fat and tone your body. Set a day each week when you each junk food, but try not to go overboard and ruin the work of every other day. Drink plenty of water, often when you think you are hungry, you are actually thirsty. If you are getting cravings, have a glass of water, wait 5 minutes, and then see if you still want food.

Joy Jr., professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are the most common complications of leaving malpositioned or impacted wisdom teeth in place:<br>  <br>  Infection of the surrounding gum tissue. This condition, pericoronitis, is most likely to occur if the tooth is partly erupted or very close to the surface. <br>  Fluid filled cysts. These can form from remnants of tissue around the crown of the tooth, becoming large and painful. Dr. Guralnick said that if panoramic X-rays are taken every three years, there will be an ample opportunity to detect such cysts while they are small and easy to be removed. <br>  Decay, or dental caries. The positioning of wisdom teeth makes them hard to clean and hard to repair.<br>  <br>  It is like having a choice .<br>  <br>  Pay me now or pay me later.<br>  <br>  I really wish you the very best XxLovelyxXtm|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	my dentist cut the pieces of skin/gum.<br>  the wisdom tooth was able to come out completely!<br>  so:go to your dentist and tell him/her to freeze and cut off those flaps of gum tissue!<br>  my wisdom teeth never bothered me after.<br>  i only have 3 wisdom teeth(1 is not even on the xray)|`|AA11593134	I think it is because your wisdom teeth (tooth?) are trying to break the gum so they can come out.

First, what you experienced is called "pericoronitis"....basically localized gingivitis at the area of "little ball of excess gum". This area is notorious in partially erupted wisdom teeth for being hard to clean....so plaque gets trapped underneath very easily. Some dentists will tell you to extract because it's a quick fix (and they make moolah); others will say no need as long as you keep excellent oral hygiene and your jaw is spacey enough to accommodate the growing teeth. I suggest visiting your dentist and ask about a chlorhexidine rinse (what my dentist gave me) and maybe get an oral irrigator like Waterpik or something. Also, start making friend with a good toothpick after eating a meal.|`|lUvd3ZyXaa	Unfortunately, the wisdom teeth usually try to erupt into a jaw that is too small.<br>  <br>  Also Wisdom teeth removal is not always a surgical procedure.<br>  <br>  I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.gadkarisclinic.com/extraction-teeth-wisdom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gadkarisclinic.com/extraction...</a><br>  it might be of some help.|`|AA11838775	you know what..id suggest you go to the dentist 4 advice..n if ever u have to get it removed, rest assured, it doesnt hurt much!!...just a little...

pBhbQiMtaa	I get these quite often and I hate it. DO NOT TRY TO POP IT YET. The best thing I have used is toothpaste on it at night.  If there is no puss just red, well that is just blood. Since you have tried to pop it that can make the swelling worse. So my advice would be use toothpaste at night and then in the morning put an ice cube on it until the cube melts. Put it on and take it off, put it on and take it off until the cube melts it don't have to be on it the whole time. Do this for about three days and if it doesn't seem to get better then you may have to drain the blood. I take a sewing needle and sterilize it with alcohol and a lighter and the poke a small hole at the mass of the bump. Be sure to go about a 1/4 inch to get pass the hard blood. To make the blood run free put a damp hot towel on the bump to warm the blood. Hope this helps|`|Mok3ewI2aa	It's called a pimple.<br>  <br>  Put a pin in it and the goodness pops out.
z5JkgFOyaa	If your girlfriend is experiencing pain during or after sex there may be several factors that are contributing to the pain she feels. For women there are a number of physical conditions that may make sex hurt, including:<br>  <br>  * Pelvic Inflammatory Disease <br>  * Endometriosis <br>  * Ovarian cysts<br>  * Interstitial cystitis <br>  * Vaginismus <br>  * Vulvodynia <br>  * Some sexually transmitted diseases <br>  * Urinary infections <br>  * Yeast infections<br>  * Vaginal dryness <br>  * Physical injury and chronic pain <br>  <br>  I would recommend that if your girlfriend continues to experience pain during or after sex that she consults with her doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation and to rule out any serious causes.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|qHMBkLx2aa	stick it in the vagina and not the anus|`|50zbKv0jaa	her cervix your not supposed to poke it as it hurts<br>  <br>  <br>  not too big just ignorant about sex|`|t8gYx9LIaa	Yeah sex isnt suppose to hurt her.

qrGLcTh4aa	Sometimes root canals can start to "fail" for various reasons. Cracks or fractures are one of those reasons. You've had a crown placed, which typically protects a root canaled tooth, however sometimes fractures can still occur under the crown. The sensations you'll feel from a crack is discomfort while chewing / using it or contact with the tooth adjacent to it.<br>  The best thing to do is go back to the dentist who did the root canal and have them exam it. If that is not an option than look for an Endodontist in your area. An Endodontist is a specialist in root canals.<br>  I know you're nervous to go, nobody likes that stuff, but it needs attention.

NPpalf1Gaa	I definitely would say that from what your describing, you most likely have TMJ. I started off with just a clicking noise when I yawned and sometimes when I chewed my food.. and it progressed to pains occurring almost every day and eventually led to lock jaw when I could not get my mouth to close all the way for about an hour. <br>  It doesn't matter what age you are, you should not be hearing any sort of clicking in your joints and if you are hurting as much as you say are you are then yes, please do see your dentist and tell him or her to refer you to a facial and oral surgeon. Once you get referred, the doctor there will take your x-rays, ask you questions, take your photo, and measure your upper and lower jaws. He or she will then tell you what you need to do from here, whether to go ahead and start preparing for surgery or whether to wait.<br>  <br>  Also, surgery usually takes at least a year to prepare for, so if you start planning now.. the more chance you'll have at getting it as SOON as possible. Most doctors prefer to wait until you reach 18 years old.. because that is when your bones stop growing and they can get the exact measurements of how far to move your upper and lower jaws.<br>  <br>  This surgery is called orthognathic surgery. Try looking up on google, youtube, and other data bases: orthognathic surgery, and ask your dentist for more information.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|YSr8dm5faa	It's possible but you cant be diagnosed over the internet.

PyQhb7gCaa	Yes dear .. Pear shaped .. Do you know how does a PEAR fruit look like? Okay let me explain, Pear shaped means, the lower part of body is larger compared to upper body ... <br>  <br>  Shapes are personal and go beyond the usual apple and pear. Women can have three typical body shapes–upper body fat, lower body fat and both upper and lower body fat. Men usually only get upper body fat. The upper body stores fat in times of stress and some people can lose and gain weight rapidly in the upper body. The lower body fat in women responds to female hormones such as estrogen and progesterone and stores fat for breastfeeding a newborn baby. <br>  <br>  Women who have both upper and lower body fat will lose their upper body fat first. Women with more upper body fat tend to have more muscle than women with lower body fat and will need more protein in their diet to help control their hunger. Losing weight is harder if you have lower body fat rather than upper body fat, but the medical benefits of losing your upper body fat are greater. <br>  <br>  Losing weight around your neck, face, chest and waist usually goes along with losing fat on the inside as well. So as you look better, you are also improving your health tremendously.|`|xqQO81Omaa	I'd say closest to rectangle body shape, but with some curves.|`|AA10283947	How I wish I was Isaac Newton, you could fall into my arms anytime with a figure like that.|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	You have a slim body.|`|Y2yein3Baa	pretty much a hour glass....a small one

wH9vd6bCaa	All the symptoms you are describing sound like a kidney infection, yu can get it in both at the same time, go to your gp/doc to be seen, you are having the hot and cold sweats because the body is trying to get rid of waste from the body through sweat this is usually what the kidneys filter away, you need antibiotics. Hope this helps x
ZlNFOgO7aa	If you want to increase fibre without him knowing it there is a product like metamucil on the market which is completely dissolvable in water, he wont even know he is having it it is called benefibre I think. It is a good help for constipation. Your son needs to up his fibre and water intake considerably. He needs to be drinking about 1 litre of water a day and he needs to be having the actual pieces of fruit not the juice. He should be aiming for two medium pieces of fruit a day a medium apple, pear, 20 grapes, a medium banana.  You must remember that if you up your sons fibre intake he needs to up his fluid. If he doesn't up his fluids he will remain constipated. Fibre needs lots of liquid to help pass through the bowels without straining. It is the combination of plant matter and liquid that makes it go through soft (sorry for the graphic description). Lots of veggies, brown bread or multigrain, no white bread products at all while you are getting this under control.  Your son needs two types of fibre, soluble like metamucil (psyllium husks) and insoluble like plant matter. Brown rice, whole meal pasta. An adult needs about 30grams of fibre per day. Some adults need closer to 50 grams. I would at least put your son on 20 grams of plant fibre a day. which would be 2 pieces of fruit and 2 servings of veg, plus a fibre type breakfast, porridge with honey to sweeten, some type of bran flake.  Also for bowel health, your son having yogurt each day will help too, because of the acidophilus and bifidophlous in it.<br>  <br>  If you need to resort to juices to move his bowel, prune would be the best bet, small doses throughout the day. The actual dried prunes are a great help too I wouldn't give him anymore than 3-4 a day until the problem clears, but the juices and prunes only help to get things moving due to sugar content, not actually curing the problem.|`|pueeMH6gaa	I don't know what a doctor would say but my personal experience is that you can't beat donuts for curing constipation.|`|onbwN4csaa	Milk is very constipating Ask you doctor about other alternatives to make up for the loss of calcium.<br>  <br>  I had it real bad when i was young.<br>  Stop the milk.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Prune juice is magic - but from day to day whole fruit is much better than juice.    Apples are good and oranges.   Bananas not quite so good.   Give him bran flakes for breakfast - and if he doesn't like them much add some sultanas or stewed fruit.    The thing  is that you cannot overdose on fibre.    Does he eat any vegetables? raw carrot? sweet corn?.   Another thing that might help is going to the bathroom with him after breakfast and chatting or reading to him so he sits until he does something.   Gradually his body will get into the habit of being regular if you can encourage a daily habit, even if you have to keep him company while he waits for it to happen.

Now fat burn cannot be isolated to one body part permanently. If you do so, ur body is gonna balance itself automatically and all the hard work will go in vain. The best way to to get the upper arm in shape /toned is cardio+ upper body workout. swimming and running r both good idea but u shud know. swimming is used to build lung capacity and increase body strength. Research shows that swimming doesnt really help u lose fat. Running ur way to body trim is time consuming and tiring. what you can probably try is doing 500 skips with a rope. 5 sets, 100 skips in each set. and about 10-20 push ups NOT MORE in a single set. That shud get ur heart rate up and get ur upper body toned.

t9Nw86Plaa	The pill won't make you continue to gain weight indefinitely; generally just a couple of extra pounds, and that's about it. The pill can make it easier to gain weight (and harder to lose it) for some women, but overall it doesn't have a huge effect - the only way you would gain weight uncontrollably, is if you actually ate uncontrollably as well!<br>  <br>  I had a similar problem when I started the pill. In my first 4 months on the pill, I put on about 10 pounds! In my case, switching the brand of pill helped a bit, but not as much as changing my diet. I realized that it wasn't JUST the pill making me gain weight.. I was also eating more since starting the pill. I adjusted my diet very slightly, and went back to (nearly) my pre-pill weight in another 4 months.<br>  <br>  Maybe have a critical look at how your diet (and exercise) has changed since you started taking the pill. If it hasn't changed at all and you're still gaining weight, that's when you may want to think about switching to a different pill brand.|`|aa913a7742ee895eca3af1ab4fef085aaa	i gained a little on the pill but went to te depo shot.

I am also lookig for a pill with no weight gain.|`|AA11485284	The Pill is actually a hormone supplement that simulates pregnancy; that's why you don't get pregnant using it. So it's not uncommon for women taking the pill to undergo the symptoms of pregnancy; chronic morning sickness is one of the most common ones. But weight gain around the stomach, hips, thighs are very common symptoms, as well as increase in breast size. You may also notice any acne that you had prior to taking the pill has faded, if not disappeared altogether. It's all to do with hormones.

Try to relax and read or something before you go to sleep to take your mind off it.

I wouldn't worry that you have what i have, it's really rare and even more in young people, (i'm pretty much the youngest person in the world with it). <br>  <br>  When you feel it acting up you should take your pulse in your wrist, if it's going like 120 beats per minute you should probably go and see a doctor. If it's going like 200 beats per minute then you should go seek medical advice NOW and consider going to hospital.<br>  <br>  You really should go and get an echocardiogram, but don't worry it's not scary it;s pretty much just an ultrasound on your chest.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)

kKQ9Jp8haa	It sounds like your meds might be stressing you out rather than helping. Talk to your doctor, or whomever prescribed this for you, about what you're experiencing. Chances are they're normal side-effects of the medication, and they may lower your dose or switch you to something else. Whatever you do, don't stop taking it cold-turkey, as that can make things worse, and you may end up in the hospital for shock (happened to my mum).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. =)

AA12266052	Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  Try the following steps to improve or prevent bad breath:<br>      * Brush your teeth after you eat. Keep a toothbrush at work to brush after eating. Be sure to brush at least twice a day, for two to three minutes at a time.<br>      * Floss at least once a day. Proper flossing removes food particles and plaque from between your teeth.<br>      * Brush your tongue. Giving your tongue a gentle brushing removes dead cells, bacteria and food debris. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or a flexible tongue scraper. Try to clean as far back as you can without gagging because the bacteria tend to collect toward the back.<br>      * Clean your dentures well. If you wear a bridge or a partial or complete denture, clean it thoroughly at least once a day or as directed by your dentist.<br>      * Drink plenty of water. To keep your mouth moist, be sure to consume plenty of water — not coffee, soft drinks or alcohol. Chewing gum (preferably sugarless) or sucking on candy (preferably sugarless) also stimulates saliva, washing away food particles and bacteria. If you have chronic dry mouth, your dentist or doctor may additionally prescribe an artificial saliva preparation or an oral medication that stimulates the flow of saliva.<br>      * Use a fairly new toothbrush. Change your toothbrush every three to four months, and choose a soft-bristled toothbrush.<br>      * Schedule regular dental checkups. At least twice a year, see your dentist to have your teeth or dentures examined and cleaned.<br>      * Chew fresh parsley or suck on a sugarless mint. Doing so may temporarily improve bad breath.<br>  You can teach your school-age children to brush and floss their teeth regularly and to brush their tongues to prevent bad breath. But, don't let children use mouthwash, because many mouthwash products contain alcohol and can pose a risk for children if swallowed.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	This is not a home remedy but it is very close to it.  First, you must understand that most bad breath comes from bacteria that grow on the top of the tongue.  You can often see this bacteria as a white film on the top of your tongue, especially on the back of the tongue.  This white stuff must be remove to get rid of bad breath.

396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	You're getting yourself all freaked out.  Yes, early symptoms of an HIV infection can resemble flu but the symptoms you describe sound more like an actual cold.  I am one of the unlucky positive people and remember my early symptoms.  Swollen lymph nodes...they were all swollen and stayed that way for several weeks.  Others I have talked to had swollen nodes that lasted for months and months.  <br>  <br>  It is very difficult for a woman to pass on HIV to a healthy man.  You have no std's and only had sex with her for a few seconds.  The chances of you having contracted HIV from her is very low.  If you are so worried, why don't you go to your local Aids Service Organization and get tested.  Their testing is usually free and they use an oral swab that gives results in only twenty minutes.  It is possible to test positive only six weeks after exposure.  You should get tested now and put your mind at ease.  The agency that you visit will have professionals to council you in your risks and when you should return for follow up testing.  You are smart to be safe and committed to getting tested but I think you are probably overly paranoid.|`|geYWzzM2aa	dude your probably just paranoid. i would still get tested but the likelihood of contracting it within 30 seconds to a minute in a pool at that, is relatively small especially if the pool was chlorinated because the chemicals used to keep the pool clean most likely would destroy or at least alter any bodily fluids. so next time wrap it up and try to calm down.
RXI8ImdIaa	Well you can't remember a period of time so yes that is commonly called a blackout.<br>  <br>  Don't get so drunk next time.
AA12129792	If you used a condom and it was used correctly then there is very little chance of catching anything (as HIV is not the only disease you should be thinking about), although there is still a very small chance.  I'm afraid that the only way to be 100% safe is to remain celibate.<br>  <br>  Actually by sleeping with 'professionals' you may be better protected than simply sleeping with any random girl you meet, as professionals will always use protection and will always ensure that it is used correctly.  They are also more likely to get checked out than random women and are less likely to have risky drunken sex than other women.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	There are no accurate figures for the percentage of STIs that are prevented by the use of condoms. Estimates however suggest it is no more than 50%. There thus always remains real risk, the more partners and the more risky contacts you have the higher the risk.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	If you feel so worried, don't sleep with whores next time.|`|scX6smKVaa	Well one, I do not appreciate the fact that you used the word Whores on here!! that is very degrading to women and the fact that you slept with them in the space of 3 days make you a whore!<br>  <br>  As long as you used a condom you should be fine but I would get yourself checked out still!!! it is not a nice process for a man as they use a swab right inside the entrance where you wee...... quite painful I hear.<br>  <br>  But again, you should be more responsible for your own actions and avoid sleeping with people you dont know|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	sorry are you saying you didn't wear a condom and had sex?<br>  if so yes you can catch HIV.|`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	Lets make party together I'm wild and crazy guy too! Do you like the disco music?|`|joGBEnjRaa	you can actually sleep with someone with hiv for years and not catch it?i know this as ive recently been tested and came back all clean?id be more worried about the other things you could of caught like hepititus c gonorea and syphilis? these types of infections are very easy to catch and very bad if not sorted out?go to your GUM clinic and get tested?for your own safety?i very much doubt you have hiv! very unlikely but the others you may could have?and a little lesson,dont sleep with someone so dirty if you dont want the worry?|`|CegTlp4Caa	Please don't ever reproduce.|`|AA10956110	depends.  did you wear the condom on your penis, your head, your belt....  Any body fluid contact?
uFRIsdC7aa	Infection can spread up the urinary tract to the kidneys, or the kidneys may become infected through bacteria in the bloodstream.<br>  Chills, fever, back pain, nausea, and vomiting can occur.<br>  Urine and sometimes blood tests are done to diagnose pyelonephritis.<br>  Antibiotics are given to treat the infection.<br>  <br>  YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	You need to see a doctor.  Since there were still bacteria found in your urine after treatment, your doctor should not have told you that the infection was cleared. The presence of bacteria means that you still have an infection and need to continue treatment. See a doctor right away.|`|fli3Mvalaa	<a href="http://inall.adores.it" rel="nofollow">http://inall.adores.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
Rk46lIBwaa	This is a very safe procedure indeed. Please don't worry, its understandable but unnecessary.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Well, general anaesthetic carries risks at any age, but my son had a general anaesthetic when he was a baby (10 months) and he was absolutely fine.  In fact often children are safer than adults, as the anaesthetist will be extra careful, and your son's vital signs will be monitored very closely throughout the whole procedure.  But I do understand your worries, if you decide to go ahead, make sure you have a chat with the anaesthetist beforehand to put your minds at ease.|`|TiW72sAUaa	My son had a general anaesthetic at 5, he was absolutely fine. I was like yourself, I was worried to death. All anaesthetics pose a risk, but the surgeon said it could be more dangerous actually travelling to the hospital. Did the dentist give you a leaflet regarding the anaesthetic. It states anaesthetics these days are really safe. With tooth extraction your child is normally asleep for 10 mins tops, so by the time you sit back down in the waiting room, he will be awake again.|`|C7DOTjhqaa	Ask if they can use Versed or a similar anesthetic, which will put him into a twilight sleep instead of making him completely unconscious.  <br>  <br>  My six-year-old daughter has a serious medical condition which made it necessary for her to have frequent lumbar punctures over the course of a few years.  She was put into this twilight sleep stage for the procedures, and the Versed made her compliant without knocking her out completely, which was a comfort to me as a parent.<br>  <br>  But administered by a competent anesthesiologist, general anesthetic should be safe.  They will know the proper dosage and will monitor him closely.  It's better than risking further damage to his mouth by allowing a serious dental problem to go untreated.
wORqCGlyaa	try a close grip bench or push up and some butterfly's|`|3gPLONagaa	tons of push ups and crunches|`|e6484VQ2aa	pushups pushups pushups!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  and for the lower<br>  crunches crunches crunches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Cml9DhIDaa	lots and lots of pushups
ybexjS2Paa	Listen to your doctor|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Putting it simply and as crude as your doctor, he's got a screw loose.<br>       The fiberous cartilage around your bones, if seen on a arthroscope could show a ragged carpet appearance but, without this how can he tell. Yes it could be bad but he has no way of knowing from what. Either he's joshing you or he's got a screw loose.<br>        When the bones in your hands get this bad they usually start to calcify and freeze. I have a brace in one hand  and it's doing this due to osteoarthritis and not what you think.<br>         Find another doctor and tell him the problems.|`|4g9UKpyVaa	lose the wrist or chop ur penis off.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	Try using your housemates hands....|`|1CdLseXbaa	Stop doing... that. Give your wrists some time to rest. Lol.
pBhbQiMtaa	You should search for your question on here. I remember answering this a while ago. Use this link I have provided|`|QIwhMrBraa	start with microdermabrasion, which is sort of sandblasting your face with tiny sand crystals, which removes the outer layer of the skin. repeated treatments eventually remove down to the scarring and hopefully level it out, its like road surfacing. it doesnt hurt much, but the repeat treatements can be expensive. one is pointless. each treatment as i recall lasts about half an hour. makes your face red but only for a few hours.<br>  <br>  if you are feeling bold, try a chemical peel where you are put under and then you will have to stay at home for a few weeks with bandages on your face, but ive heard they are well worth it. i myself havenet been that a*sed and i hate the feeling of burnt skin on my face just from being sunburnt, but if ur willing to go through with the pain, this will work better as its a deeper peel.<br>  <br>  you can also have scars (the ones that look like pits) filled in, though i think this is only temporary. with make up over that, ur skin will look smoother.<br>  <br>  also, buy some retin a cream, you can find it online, (look under the generic name), apply it a few times a week but it is  strong so use sparingly else it can give u a burn as well. also some oils are good, like Bio Oil, which i really like, and it does not break me out. you can buy that at most supermarkets, boots, etc.<br>  <br>  just keep in mind that acne scarring is a b*tch to get rid of, and you must not expect perfect skin from any treatment. the reality is your skin, over time, will look about 30% better, but i wouldnt assume much better than that. if anyone tells you otherwise, be skeptical.<br>  <br>  best x|`|1VibE08Paa	try isotretenoin a drug fr acne
kvkLaA9maa	Are you stretching cold muscles?<br>  <br>  Are you drinking enough water?<br>  <br>  I do some fast knee-ups for 15 seconds or so, then I rotate each hip joint in turn by lifting my leg up and over (as if stepping over a hurdle) either side. This warms up the legs. Then I start to stretch.<br>  <br>  You may also be over stretching. It should be a little uncomfortable but not painful when you stretch.<br>  <br>  HTH!<br>  x
B8WEoAiKaa	yes! It worked for me!!!<br>  <br>  Wartrol is a good (probably the best) product that gets rid of genital warts and makes you feel more confident knowing that they wont show.<br>  <br>  <br>  I do not know if any pharmacies carry Wartrol but I do know that you can purchase it directly from the manufacturer and read more about the product here <a href="http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=749165" rel="nofollow">http://www.wartrol.com/?aid=749165</a><br>  <br>  They have a few months supply for free at the moment<br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10140201	It will probably hide your outbreak but it won't take away the cause of the outbreak.|`|uFRIsdC7aa	HAVE NEVER TRY IT.
hBmafVYoaa	I don't know of any cream. My husband sometimes irritates my face with his beard stubble. It's not very nice but I don't think there is any quick fix. Maybe wait until the stubble is a little longer before going down there.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Co-operation is needed from him|`|scX6smKVaa	Hmmm Cream will not help as when you keep having sex with him then it will return...<br>  <br>  I had the same problem with my man and told him this. He thought that perhaps shaving himself would give me more pleasure but when I explained to him that it just irratates he stopped shaving and just trimmed his pubic area with scissors instead.<br>  <br>  Men sometimes shave to make their penis look larger but just explain to him its not how it looks its what he does with it that turns you on....|`|kHRD7uUAaa	he is a bit of common sense men have never ever shaved down there and i am sure a many of men sweat more then your boyfriend so he needs to mature no need for any shaving down there i think you younger people are bored and the most entertainment you have is shaving your private area|`|brSfRLspaa	tell him just to shave his balls and butt crack and NOT the upper area<br>  <br>  mike is so old and funny, lol

Ask your doctor to confirm that on your next smear test (or sooner if your next smear is not for a while).|`|scX6smKVaa	The best thing to do is go to the doctors ASAP and get yourself checked out as many people on here may be wrong and give you the wrong advice...... doctors is always the best bet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|KNnwUcpqaa	Sounds like genital warts|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	DOCTOR NOW!!|`|joGBEnjRaa	im afraid it sounds like either 2 infections?i had genital warts with my very first partner.they take about 6months to show,and they will get bigger?if you have been with your fella for longer than 6months then im afraid someone has been playing away?or he could have caught it off another girl as a lad dosnt really show any signs of the genital wart infection?the other would be syphalis?the symptom is a couple of spots either whits or red around the vagina?although thats not always sexually transmitted?it can be from a toilet seat etc?go and get checked to put your mind at rest|`|AA10140201	If you shave your pubic area it could be an ingrown hair, if not then I honestly do not know what it could be the first time you see something check it out with your doctor to be on the safe side.
