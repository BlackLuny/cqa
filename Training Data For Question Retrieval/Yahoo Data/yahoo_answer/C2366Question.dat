20090310031956AAClab2	Education & Reference;Teaching	Poor administration? What should I do?	I am a second-year teacher at a middle school.  During my first year of teaching. I was very happy and things were great.  I was told by my administrator that I was a very strong teacher and well on my way to being a master teacher.  I had a great co-teaching situation.  This year, the same administrator was telling me all year long about what a great teacher he thought I was.  He said that I engage the students and center lessons around them.  Additionally, my lessons are multi-cultural, differentiated, and cross-curricular.  So, needless to say, I was feeling great!      It came as a shock to me when I was called down to the principal's office several weeks ago to be told that I would not be given a contract for next year because of performance issues.  Out of left field, he said that I had problems working with coworkers, planning well, and developing proper assessments.  I was shocked.      So, I went to the superintendent to appeal the decision.  When I was there, it was even worse.  He had a whole file of information compiled on me by this same administrator who said I was doing well.  He is our assistant principal.  He went behind my back and documented every little thing I did wrong, put it in my file, and then handed it to those above me for my dismissal.  However, he never brought any of this to my attention.  In stark contrast, he was telling me how great I was doing.      So, my dilemma is.  What should I do?  This isn't fair.  I now look like a liar to the superintendent and I feel trapped.

(I got a scholarship after I had confirmed the loan amount for the year, which accounts for the difference)  I now have a 6 month grace period until my student loans go into repayment.  I was wondering what the best idea is for the $4,000 + that I have.  I want to wait until my loans start repayment to put that money towards them because I am paying the normal loan balance now as though I'm already in repayment (I want to make the most of my money).  I have $45,000 in loans with an interest rate of 6% when repayment starts.  Should I put that money into a high yield savings account, or a three month CD?  I want to make sure that the money is available exactly six months so any CD over 3 months is out of the picture because I won't get the money in check form for a few weeks.  Does anyone have any options I am overlooking?  The interest I am making from the investment will also go towards paying my student loans.  All help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

Okay well, I was leaving school early on Friday because I had to go to the Orthodontist. I asked her if I had any homework or work I needed to do, and asked her if she could give it to me. So she said yeah she would give it to me later.       Well today she gave us back are corrected work, and i'm missing a lot of assignments because she won't give them to me. I asked her for the work and she said yeah and looked, then went back to teaching the class.      She won't give me any of the work I need to make up!      I asked and asked her but she won't!          I can't switch math teachers at my middle school, once you get a teacher you have to stay with them!         So, what can I say to my math teacher about this!?         Thanks!         P.S The reason why I'm so worried about not getting my work is because I take school seriously, and staying back will make me upset! And besides who wants to stay back? Not me!

I dreamt that I went to church with an old friend and on the side of the chapel, there was six colorfully painted crosses and a preacher standing next to them behind a podium. And then the preacher asked if any one would like to renew their faith and six people went up. (Including my parents who don't go to other churches other than the one I was raised in) And some other people came up and started attaching hooks and lines ot the crotch part. And my dad (holding my niece) said to her not to cry so he won't scream. And then they began to be lifted up onto the top of the crosses. The preacher said some words and they were lifted down. They were unhooked and then the preacher asked if there were any kids wanted to try and the ceremony was repeated. The only thing I remember afterword is going to Sunday school. And then I woke up. As I laid in bed thinking of this strange dream, I remembered that I had that dream before. Can any one please explain what they think this means? Thanks for the help!

20090227145721AAAqnvg	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Heroism and Bean Field?	"Heroism"       Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind, and in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual's character. Now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than any one else. Therefore, just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past: then they see it to be in unison with their acts. All prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then the prudent also extol.       "Bean Field"       When I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from Boston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field, to the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And now to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The pines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have cooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all around, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture, and even I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.       Which of the two essays reveals a more romantic, warm, down to earth voice? Why?       Which writer is more focused on nature and which on human behavior? How do you know?       Describe what you did and didn't understand about these 2 passages. Could you figure out what certain words meant even if you hadn't seen them before? If so, what strategies did you use to understand these passages.       Yes, I know theys are homework questions but I've read the two excerpts three times and still can't seem to answer those questions. I really just don't understand what they want me to write. Can you help me?   Thanks so much,

20090227144542AATQMTc	Education & Reference;Quotations	Isn't this quote SO TRUE?	This life is what you make it, and no matter what, your going to mess up sometimes, its the universal truth. But the good part is that you get to decide how you mess it up. Girls will be your friend - well, they will act like they are anyway; But just remember, some come & some go. The ones that stay with your through everything - they're your true friends. Dont let go of them. Also remember, lovers, they'll come and go too. If they break your heart, you can't give up; Because if you give up, you'll never find a soul mate. You'll never find that half that makes you whole, & that goes for everything - just because you fail once, doesn't mean your going to fail everything, keep trying, hold on, and always always believe in youself; Because if you don't, who will? So keep your head high, chin up & most importantly, keep smiling - because lifes a beautiful thing !

I was involved with a group..... got to know member of group who invited me to live and work on her property......she had drug addicted son who was causing a lot of trouble. I stupidly pointed out to his mother he may have a problem because he was abusing her very badly and I kept having to listen to her tell me about it..........she accused him whilst I as in house when I asked her not to........ the son proceeded to attack me.....gravely injured my horses and dog........ threatened me trying to force me to leave.       When I attempted to leave she got very upset and spat at me "It's all or nothing" when I suggested I did not need to live on property to be her friend........she said "it's different"........I said "how" and she would not answer me.       I suspected she had more designs on me than friendship........I am not gay...... her poor husband is being treated so badly. This was about five years ago and I did not go back to the group because of this.......in the meantime a friend of mine has become president of that group.......it is a horse group that is working to open bridles paths up in Australia....... when my friend became president one of the core members questioned his association with me.      He told them he is my friend and it will stay that way and that I had planned on coming back to the group. That woman who questioned him is connected to quite a prominent family in the country threatened to leave if I tried to become a member again and take six members with her.   They then proceeded to lie about me to my friend and also lied about another poor woman who I'd been riding with. It was outrageous. I believe that the woman with the drug addict son is trying to discredit me and god knows what kind of fabrications she has come up with but this other woman is being overtly aggressive towards me and even subtly threatened to have me ostracised from other horse groups in the country if I attempted to to pursue being a member.       I feel my name has been maligned and they are casting aspersions on my character that are not true in order to justify blocking my membership. I suggestions from anybody would be good.      By the time I decided to leave the situation I discovered that woman was the reason her son is like he is because she had manipulated me with lies in regard to a lot of things ........ god knows what she would be saying to others about me to serve her own ends. She is very clever and so is her son and I feel that he has the same problem.      Annie

And then people tell me about pilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a crumbling temple, to a leering stone monster with a pot belly, created by some leprous savage. Is it beauty and genius they want to see? Do they seek a sense of the sublime? Let them come to New York, stand on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. When I see the city from my window - no, I don't feel how small I am - but I feel that if a war came to threaten this, I would throw myself into space, over the city, and protect these buildings with my body."

And does anyone know where to file a complain against a school in the state of Washington.   They are trying to extort money from me.  They keep threatening to send me collections if I do not send them more money.    I withdrew my child from the school---and have had a terrible time ever since.  Not to mention they send the letters via regular post so I have very little time to respond before the threat of sending to a collection agency.    My son is disabled and could not keep up with the work assigned.   So they are charging a $50 fee for each time he missed a deadline.      After I un-enrolled him.....they sent me an e-mail giving homeschoolers a choice of not being charged late fees (this was after I un-enrolled him.   (A day after).  Then I get a bill sent via regular post and I have about a week to send the money to them or they have threatened to send me to a collection agency.      This is a Christian school.  I was just wondering if anyone knew where I could file a complaint against them.    I will not be receiving any tuition reimbursement as I paid in full up front.   Mothers and Fathers who paid monthly would not have had to pay for the additional months of school after un-enrolling them.

20090309171720AAAAIhg	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me put this into my "own words"?	plz!   i am begging you!         In January 1966, during the first combined American and South Vietnamese Army operation, "Operation Masher," Crandall, while under intense enemy fire and with only a spot flashlight beam to guide him , twice dropped his Huey helicopter through the dense jungle canopy to rescue 12 wounded Soldiers. For his courage in that incident Crandall received the Aviation & Space Writers Helicopter Heroism Award for 1966.      After an assignment in Colorado, he attended the Armed Forces Staff College. Soon he was back in Vietnam, this time flying Huey gunships - "a big improvement" -- supporting the 1st Bn., 9th Cavalry Squadron, 1st CAV Div.       In January 1968, four months into his second tour, Crandall's helicopter was downed during another rescue attempt - Air Force bombs going off too close to where he was flying. After five months in the hospital, with a broken back and other injuries, he resumed his career as a student earning a bootstrap degree through the University of Nebraska in 1969. In Bangkok, Thailand, he would become a Facility Engineer managing 3,800 people. He subsequently served as deputy chief of staff, deputy installation commander, and commander of the 5th Engineer Combat Bn., all at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.       South America was supposed to be his next assignment, and he and Arlene attended the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, CA. as Spanish language students in preparation for an Aviation and Engineering advisor to Argentina - an assignment that never came. A stroke sidelined Crandall, ending his flying career. After his recovery, the Crandalls did find the language training useful when he was sent to Caracas, Venezuela, as the Defense Mapping Agency's director for the Interamerican Geodetic Survey.      In his final Army assignment, he served as senior engineer advisor to the California Army National Guard.

I have to write an essay comparing "realismo magico" in "La peste del insomnio" and "El otro".      Here's the assignment: El realismo magico se puede definir como una mezcla de lo real y lo fantastico.

Puedes incluir cómo se presentan los elementos reales y magicos, y el tono o ambiente en el que se presentan.

20090309123757AAW0PI4	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I go for this? (CNA + High school?) This is a long-looking one, but I'd appreciate any input.?	First off, let me say that, aside from a couple of electives and 2 (each) English/Global credits, I'm pretty much done with my Advanced Regents Diploma credits (I took honors courses starting in Middle school, so I'm, for the most part, a year ahead.) I would like to pursue a career in health care, most likely and RN (In Hospice, perhaps?)      As a junior and senior (I'm a sophomore, planning my schedule right now.), I can take a half-school-day (4 of 8 periods) class (BOCES Vo-Tech, if you're familiar with it.) that will end in me getting a (free!) Nurse Assisting Certification (therefore, depending upon what my not-really-considered,-to-be-honest college life looks like, a pretty decent job), lots of science/English credits, and, from what I've been told, something that looks really good on College apps. (Plus, it would give me two years to figure out if this is even the kind of work I want to do, and no commitment if I want to leave after a semester.)      This would be in addition to my AR diploma (I'd do regular classes for the other half of the day, obviously.)      My only dilemma is whether it would be a better move to just load up on regular classes. Here are my courses for next year (Keep in mind that I have another year after this, that's even more open... I'll only HAVE TO take 1 class as a senior, so anything I don't take next year, I can do as a Senior.), according to my (rather unhelpful, actually) guidance counselor (classes I'll definitely be taking, regardless, have an asterisk by them):   -Honors English*   -US History*   -French*   -Gym/Human Anatomy* (Alternating - every other day.)   -Typing   -Forensics (I don't know. She just plopped me in there. I hear it's an easy A, though...)   -College Alg. (Def. Taking this one at some point in the next 2 years.)   -Piano (I'm currently in the beginner class and love it.)

I heard that if you live on your own for a certain period and your parents don't claim you on taxes, you will be considered as independent and receive financial aid depending on your income (not your parents). But when I filled out fafsa, it said even though I'm on my own, my financial aid is still determined by my parents income alone. Am I doing something wrong or is your living arrangements even a factor?

20090309171136AAEeKTE	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How can I fix my transcript?	My first two semesters of college I spent messing around in various subjects, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to study. As a result of this, I took a lot of classes I wasn't good at, or later decided I didn't want to take. Back then, I didn't know about unpenalized withdraw dates, so I always just stopped attending a class and ended with an 'F'.      Now, I've got a crap GPA, despite the fact that I've chosen a major, and am doing fairly admirably in it.      My question is: How would you suggest trying to go about fixing it? I don't think the counselors can help much, seeing as how they pushed me to take all of these random classes "just to be sure".

At my high school there is this CNA [Certified Nursing Assistant] course where you can take. Successful completion of the course enables you to register with the state to begin employment in this field right after you graduate from high school.

I did some calculations and I would be making about $2,500 a month. Is this enough? Like for a one bedroom apartment, food, electricity, water etc. [this just so happens if I go to a community college]      Note: I kinda screwed up my sophomore year and my grades took the plunge down the tubes. But I've gotten myself back on track and I'm getting A's and B's again. && if my grades are still good by the end of next school year then I probably end up going straight into a 4 year college where there's housing.

I am pretty sure the bills are paid for it. we did everything and it's garbage day and we dont have a trash can for one we live in a neighborhood, that if someone took it everyone would know. And no one really steps on each others property that we all don't know. So I dont get it?   Can they take it?

I need to find financial aid to help me out because the tuition and fees for international students is ridiculously high, and will also cost me more in the longrun because of the exchange rate. Can I find financial aid from the UK government, or can I only get it from my own government? I would prefer to apply for grants and scholarships, and loans if necessary.  Does anyone know of some good websites for financial aid?

20090309125718AApyB3l	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What's a good title for this mystery story I made up?	Okay, so I'm in grade 7 and we had to make up a mystery story (ewww I hate writing stories) for writing, and I couldn't think of a title for it.       So here are the main points of what happens (I didn't really write it yet but i have my ideas).   -There's this girl about my age named Samantha, and she comes home from school and her mom is dead on the floor.    -She obviously wants to find out who did this crime, so her and her friend Carey are thinking of suspects.   -They think of one person who could be a suspect: This woman across the street named Ashley who Samantha thinks hates her mom.   -Then they think of another suspect: Some random, freaky, odd, unusual man who hangs around the park behind the house.   -So for a while they are just figuring out things and all.   -Carey (just to remind you that's Samantha's friend) is very into finding out who did this. She is really trying to frame the 2 suspects.   -Samantha is very sad the whole time because she needs to know who killed her mom.    -Finally, Carey says that she was the one who killed Samantha's mom, because that mysterious, freaky, odd man told her that if she didn't kill the mom he would kill her. Also if she told anything about the situation to anyone, the man would kill her too.    -At the end Carey feels so bad for what she did, and committed suicide.       So what do you think would be the best name for this story? Not something like "Killed mom", but something creative and cool to make people actually want to read this story.

I was just recently offered an interview from Dartmouth; I applied regular decision as an undergraduate freshman for the fall of '09. I've been hearing that everyone is offered an interview, and that it's just a regular part of the decision process, but I've also been told that being offered this interview means that Dartmouth is interested in me... Which is true?      Also -- collegeboard.com says that Dartmouth sends out its acceptance letters by March 31... Are their any past applicants or alumni who know when they received their letters?
