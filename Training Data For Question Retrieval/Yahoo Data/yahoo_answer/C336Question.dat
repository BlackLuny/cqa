20090226101034AAGgsWx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	I posted this lyrics last night, but I want some more feedback. And recommend a beat if you could?	Verse One:   Seemingly to make a dance, that's all you got to do to get out   Prince was hot, but would you wear pants with the booty cut out   I think not. "That's not our mo"   Then someone jump out the window and your whole crew follow   It's like the games filled with negative role models   Busting' bad nuts to the rest of the artist who swallow   Keep coming with change that's strange and dangerous choices   Deranged, controlling waves with fake T-Painish voices   They say it's the new school originality, traveling a new alley   That must be why, when I turn on MTV I see reality   Can't understand, it's stuck around the horn like Reali   They come up with shyt that suck and call it the best damn like John Sally   So I demand what I can, when the economic supply is low   I use to only show attention to rappers underground after it was there time to go   And they were buried with legacy and pride all inside   Now they underground because they whole brains is buried alive   Because they try to turned the tide   And don’t shrink the content of their saying to vary with a vibe         Verse Two:   It use to be doe or die, now it snap your fingers do your step   Bite of what's popular till your on top of your of rep   How we suppose to save it, when they destroying our pavement   Jack hammering and bulldozing our road before we can pave it   Should just let them finish it!   They adding and subtracting to fast to do arithmetic   It use to be supreme, cream, life and times, through our dreams   Five percenter's mathematics intertwined within rhyme schemes   Use to rock parties of blocks so big you'd be like "Golly"   With tick tocks of abstract clocks dripping like Dali   Back when raw talent with the pencil was showing up exponential   And potential in their lines was left blowing up your mental   Over an instrumental, why'd they let it stray to today?   They let it lay, deferred the dream, to explode and decay   Wash away in time just like the sand through the hour glass   Its days of our lives, with death left showering paths         Verse Three:   Time to set an example, split the sample take chances   Like a saint with spray paint let the graffiti lay upon the canvas   This is wear the red foxx dances, in the hand is   The mic that can strike with wit quicker than Fred Sanford's   I feel it's up to me to be real, set an example it's my duty   They destroyed so let me rebuild the peace and beauty   All the action like red faction, that old school magnetic attractions   Even if I catch dirty visions, and more slashes than division of fractions   I'm saying yes I can that's my decision like Nas, I just know   I've been seeing stars all life, I was Galileo since play dough   Catching on fire since Richard Pryor was on free base   I hope I'm the next to acquire that free space   And you know it's me   Kicking more soul than Rakim plus Jodeci   I'm the bonus scene after the movie   There is a story to tell and they got to tell it through Truly
20090226100739AASC3UE	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Would you want to see this REBOOT of Neverending Story (read article)?	There may be some truth to the possibility that The NeverEnding Story is never going to end. Or to be more precise, a new NeverEnding story will replace the old one. Warner Bros. and a pair of top-tier production banners are in the early stages of a reboot of the 1980s children's fantasy classic.      The Kennedy/Marshall Co. (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Leonard DiCaprio's shingle Appian Way are in discussions with Warners about reviving the 25-year-old franchise with a modern spin. The studio recently acquired rights to the property, clearing the way for a potential remake.      The new pic -- which original producer Dieter Geissler also will produce and Sarah Schechter and Jesse Ehrman will oversee for Warners -- will examine the more nuanced details of the book that were glossed over in the first pic.      Plot Concept: Born out of a German-language novel by Michael Ende, the film centers on a boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux who discovers a parallel world in a book titled "The NeverEnding Story." As the boy, a loner, delves deeper into the book, he increasingly finds his life intertwined with the plot of the novel, in which a hero in the land of Fantasia must save the universe on behalf of an empress.      Wolfgang Petersen directed and Neue Constantin produced the original for Warners, which earned a respectable $20 million when it was released in 1984. The film has had a long life on home video and an even larger influence on popular culture, prefiguring Harry Potter and other present-day children's fantasies.      A sequel directed by George Miller came out in 1990 and earned $17 million; a third movie followed in the U.S. in 1996 but quickly went to video. Those familiar with the project emphasize that it is in its early stages and that writers have not been attached.

I am very curious why or why not you might think she is or isnt a *****!!      I think she is a ***** cause she gives attitude too much, and yes i can say i have attitude too.  But I'm not famous, and does she not realize that there are a lot of people that look up to her.   I mean its one thing to give attitude to annoying people always taking your picture but its different when she does it to her OWN FANS!!! (bitchy)      ANd the fact that she thinks Twilight is a horrible movie and that its just a big money maker.  WELL hiney if you dont like it then leave the ******* movie. I'll be glad to take your place.      I mean i personally liked Twilight and ALL the books.      But to me all this is proving is that she is an UNGRATEFUL ***** THAT NEEDS TO ******* LEAVE THE MOVIE IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT. WHY BOTHER BEING IN IT!!! HUH???

Either they have help on full songs or just a verse or two it is rare that you will look at a RHH artist album cover and only see one name under who wrote the song!

I know that she is trying to make money for her kids as well but surely it would be better to spend time with them and maybe raise money for cancer charities instead of going on horrible ok magazine adverts with a cheesey grin saying "you've been with me through the bad times and the good times now see me on the happiest day of my life" - and then watch her die too? I feel sorry for her and her kids but I think that's a bit weird. And the media completely flipped one minute they were calling her a racist evil bully then they act like it's the worst thing ever that she's dying but there a plently of other people dying of cancer too who have done something important rather then just tried to be a celebrity all their life - i suppose she got what she wanted in a horrible way.

I'm doing a survey on uncertainty in science news, this is for a class!    http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...    Can you read this article "Colors of Quasars Reveal Dusty Universe," it's very very short:      And answer these questions (you can leave some blank if you don't have an   answer):   1. Is the purpose of the article, the scientific finding, clear?      2. Were there any words that you don't know and would have to look up?      3. Are there any scientific concepts that are unclear, or the writer assumes prior knowledge?      4. Is there anything mentioned that you feel isn't explained in the article, and it would help to have that extra info?      Thanks if you can! I'm going to be pulling your quotes, It's for a   presentation.      THANKS for any help!! 10 points for first to answer ;)         It's really not my homework! I'm a grad student, the survey is to see how well writers know their audiences, and to find out what is unclear to readers.   Thanks :)
20090226103042AAOWwmi	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Do you think Astrology is a bunch of rubbish and/ fake?	I like to read about starsigns whereas some seem so identical to said person with a few exceptions but I've noticed a few that are incorrect for example, I am a Leo and I am far from what it explains on different sites. I actually look through them all and scoff because not one of those positive and negative traits sound like me at all you wouldn't even think I was a Leo! I've often been mistaken for a Scorpio because honestly if we're going to stereotype I am an extremely private and mysterious person, I like to know about other people more and do not show my emotions well and even if I'm showing you the time of day is enough to show that I care.      So my question is, do you think astrology is rubbish and fake?
20090226103827AA9HGi6	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	If you were sitting in front of a classroom and your teacher kept walking right and left, where would u look?	So I sit in front of the classroom where the entire class can see me and my teacher has the tendency to walk back and forth from right to left and because I'm up so close, I have to keep turning my head and left and right and I start feeling like an idiot watching a Tennis game in front of everyone. No one in the class really has to keep turning their head because they sit far back enough or are close enough to the side. I am in the middle in the front. So what would you do if while lecturing your teacher kept on walking way off to the left then way off to the right then way off to left.

They are stuntmen and actors, nothing more. Who agrees with this. And if you disagrees please state why.

20090226110357AAsmkV8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Serious parenting question: Should I write a note or something?	My daughter is five and they went on a field trip today. Apparently, they were in a rush to get back on the bus and after letting them carry bottled water and drink all the Capri Sun they wanted, the chaperones didn't allow for time to use the bathroom before they boarded the bus back to the school.      Needless to say, she had an accident. I went to school and brought her dry clothes and she wanted to come home early so I went ahead and let her.       She's afraid to go back tomorrow because the other kids (one in particular) are going to make fun of her. I feel terrible for her. She NEVER has accidents. This was a one time freak thing.      Should I write a note to her teacher in the morning letting her know how upset she is? I hate to think she's going to go get teased tomorrow because we all know how cruel kids can be.

I play guitar and hopefully will be learning to play drums soon. I've taught myself some basic piano (not very much, just, for example: what keys on the keyboard are what notes, how to read basic music, ect...).   I would really like to know more about piano. I have been trying to learn but I really just don't have that much time on my hands.   But what really bothers me is that my music teacher will say things like, "What key do you want to preform this song in?" or "Ok, there's a key change here." And I'm like "What the heck does that mean?!?!" And I don't really want to appear ignorant so I'm just like "Uh-huh..." even though I have NO idea what she's talking about.   I'd really like to know what it means when a song is in the key of C or F# or anything. And also what a key change is.   Please explain in detail because I am just so confused at this moment.   Thank you so much, your answers will be really appreciated!

20090226140532AAPZEe6	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	GH: What did Rebecca mean when she said?	that Sonny was the only one that seemed to know who Emily really was? did I miss something? He really didn't say anything too much different from Nikolas. He just talked about how wonderful she was too and threw in that she wasn't perfect. I don't think Nikolas claimed Emily was perfect either. Sonny said she was kind, generous, had a way of seeeing the best in everyone, loved too much, Nikolas didn't deserve her, etc, etc. I am just not seeing what was so different about the  way Sonny described her. And what does Sonny have against Nikolas that he said he didn't deserve Emily?

Well, now that my sister and I have gotten the official a-ok to go to UMF, all we have to do now is to decide on whether we want VIP tickets or normal ones. =S This IS going to be our first time going, so the reason I'm posting here is because I want to know if it's worth it to spend $350 for the VIP. As in, how big are the differences between the two, and should we hold back since it's only our first time? Also, I'm only 15... [don't worry, my sister is 27.] so I'm worried that that will have a big impact on my experience. (and it's making me wonder if I should wait till I'm older to buy a VIP ticket)      Anyway, does anybody have any thoughts on this? We're seriously stumped and have no idea on which one to buy.

20090226121048AAgsaGm	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	For all you scientific types out there (and humorists, too)...?	Lawrence Livermore Laboratories has discovered the heaviest element yet known to science. The new element, Governmentium (Gv), has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312.      These 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons. Since Governmentium has no electrons, it is inert; however, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A tiny amount of Governmentium can cause a reaction that would normally take less than a second, to take from 4 days to 4 years to complete.      Governmentium has a normal half-life of 2-6 years. It does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places.    In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Governmentium is formed whenever morons reach a critical concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as critical morass.      When catalyzed with money, Governmentium becomes Administratium, an element that radiates just as much energy as Governmentium since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.

20090226121603AAnCtby	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are you a Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia?	Wow say that in a sentence.       literally, "fear of the number six-hundred-sixty-six") is the fear that originates in the Biblical verse Revelation 13:18 which indicates that the number 666 is the Number of the Beast, linked to Satan or the Anti-Christ. Outside the Christian faith, the phobia has been further popularized as a motif in various horror films.      Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobes will strongly avoid things related to the number 666. A prominent example is of Nancy and Ronald Reagan who, in 1989, when moving to their home in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles, had the address of 666 St. Cloud Road changed to 668 St. Cloud Road.[1] Some women also expressed concern on giving birth to a child on 6/6/2006.[2]      Rarer is trying to avoid the number as it relates to other numbers. For example, the fraction 2/3 has a repeating decimal of .666…. A severe hexakosioihexekontahexaphobe may avoid all fractions that would include this recurring decimal. Those with hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia may consider it bad luck to get three sixes in a hand of poker, even though this is usually quite a good hand.      Many are afraid of the digits 666, rather than the quantitative number adding up to this amount.

I answered a Q and some women seemed to think this was impossible and meant we had no jobs etc... and that i didn't really love my fiancee (we are 21 & 23 and been together 6years, pretty long time if we don't love each other!) we are in full time university and have part time jobs but we make time for each other and we have sex about 2 or 3 times a day (once if we are tired) but is this really that bad? ive always heard men wanted it more than wives usually give (this isn't why i do it lol, my guy friends have sex only 2 or 3 times a week and they complain like hell about it) so i was wondering is how much we love and how passionate we are for each other still after 6years a good or bad thing? (just to put i think its great and i wouldn't change anything for the world but just curious is to how other people see this?)

20090226140455AAeDboV	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you ever kiss (like a peck kiss) your family or friends on the lips?	Nothing sexual, please don't misconstrue.       A friend thought that was perfectly normal and asked, "Come on, you've never done that?"       Whereas in my family, any kisses are given on the check or forehead. We don't kiss our friends.       So I'm just really curious now about how common this practice is. Is it a cultural thing?       The person was just white, no strong ethnic culture or anything, so I'm sure it's more than just cultural influence.       Star if you find it interesting, I would love to get as many opinions and answers as possible. Thanks:)

The problem is, our AUX outs are at the board (obviously) and our stage (this is a church btw) is about 150' to 200' away (by the time you run the wires along the wall and over and under stuff. I've looked, but I can't find a 1/4" snake any longer than 20'. Is there a longer snake? If not, is there another solution (other than wireless due to $$ issues)? Someone has mentioned to me setting up a monitor board on stage. I've got NO IDEA how that would work. Thanks for any help you can provide!

I'm just learning music notation so I realize this is a very basic question...         I have a piece of music in the original "Key of G Major".       BUT - I have since transposed it up 1/2 step... Which makes have a key signature of A flat (4 flats)...  SO how do I refer to my sheet music now?   Do I say this music is in "the Key of A flat"  Or in the Key of A flat-major" Or is A flat major it's key signature and I should refer to the key of the song in a minor category when it is a flat... Ex.  The key of F-Minor.        What's the different between     A flat-Major   and    F-Minor   and do they mean the exact same thing when you say them or not?      Thank you!

20090225114544AATvuaw	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Mary J. Blige What's the 411 vs. My Life?	Which album do you think is superior and why? It seems My Life has gotten far more accolades - a Grammy, a Rolling Stone top 500 placing and better reviews all around. Do you think that's because of what Mary J was going through at the time - depression, drug abuse and an abusive relationship with K-Ci Hailey - or is it legitimately a better album?      Personally I believe What's the 411 to be superior but that's because I love the r&b/hip hop infused sound. I was just listening to it yesterday and said to myself I love this album more now (17 years later) than I did when it first came out.
20090225114715AAYWXg6	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do people ever go, "Hey, let's watch something that came out in 2005!"?	I mean, not naming a specific title, just watching something that came out in a specific year.      Also, are people more inclined to watch films years later that won Academy Awards?  For example, something that won Oscars in 2006 is more likely to be watched in 2009 than any other 2005 film?  Am I correct in this assumption?

The second clip, Kick The Tragedy, was one of my favorites back in the 90's. I could get lost in it for days. And the 3rd one, Angel, is an interesting cover of the Madonna song.

The bus pulls up, the door opens, and the bus driver says, "Only eight seats vacant." The man quickly tells his wife, "You and the children get on, myself and the blind man will walk." The bus speeds off and the two start to walk.    The blind man starts taping his stick on the sidewalk. To the tap tap tap sound, the man gets frustrated and shouts, "Can't you put a rubber to the end of that stick?"   To this the blind man shouts back, "If you would have put a rubber at the end of your stick, we both would have got a seat on the bus."

20090225114406AAUk1OL	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Fans of the anime One Piece, will you please answer this?	So I've noticed a lot of negativity towards the dubbed version of One Piece (4kids). People say it is ridiculous, especially compared to the original subs. I prefer watching anime like One Piece and Full Metal Alchemist as dubs. Although I do watch most other anime with Japanese dialogue (mainly because it is a lot easier to find).      But what do you think about the One Piece dub, is it really that bad? I don't see how it is. People are saying that the One Piece rap as the intro totally ruins the anime. But I love the rap, and I am addicted to it. What is wrong with the voice acting for Luffy? He sounds crazy which is what he is, isn't he? He is energetic and care-free, and the voice reflects that =]      What do you think?

I"m wondering what would happen if there was a tv show rehashing old white tv shows and such and the host were to say something like "The only blacks you'll see is Clint Black!"      All I ever hear is black people talking about equality, but I continue to see things like this where they purposefully segregate and generalize. Isn't that hypocritical and racist of THEM?

Jamal is in the police station, he has just finished telling the story about how he was thrown out of the hotel room by his brother and all that. So then the inspector asks him "Did you ever see them again?" Jamal replies, " I wouldn't be here if I had."      So, why would he say this? We know he saw Latika and Salim again at the construction site and at the gangsters house (his name escapes me at the moment) BEFORE he ever went on the show.      any thoughts?   thanks?

20090225114739AA6UFMq	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Twilight or Vampire Academy?	I read both series, and honestly I think VA is much more interesting than Twilight. here are my reasons:         1) Rose is more like my type of girl. She's sassy, amazing, sexy, smart, and hell she thrills me more than Bella.      2) I really think Richelle had a better plot than Stephenie. Twilight didn't really have a plot, it focused more on Bella and Ed, maybe a little too much, and honestly the only thing that made it gripping were the making out scenes.       3) VA is not a typical romance book. i mean all books end with happy endings, like ed and bell get married, have a daughter, bla bla bla, and Stephenie meyer is so in love with her characters that she didn't even kill any of them. But when Richelle made complications in rose and Dimka's relationship, it kind of keeps you to the book, and then Dimka turns into a strigoi and ROSE goes to kill him, so I thought that was completely AMAZING. Very exciting, better than bell and ed.   I mean i know there were complications btwn bell and ed because he's a vamp and she's just a stupid high school chick, but really, there's no plot to hold on to, like vamp academy and liss and her complicated powers and all that keep you like - i dunno...*shrug* gripped.      Tell me what you think.       And save your breath if you haven't even read Vampire Academy. I don't want to hear lame comments from people who don't even know what they're talking about....

20090226153552AAbXzQs	Entertainment & Music;Music;Country	Why do people think Taylor Swift shouldn't be in the country genre?	Okay I have been a contry music fan for most my life. I've liked Taylor Swift from the moment I heard her first single "Tim McGraw". How you can not call that country? Recently, she has become more popular and a lot of radio stations are remixing her songs to pop. I think that is the reason why people are mistaking her for a pop star. If you are a fan of her or you have her CDs you know that she has the original versions of the songs on them and not the pop remixes. Taylor Swift always says she is going to stick with country music because that's what she's heard all her life. Personally, I think she is an awesome country singer and that the original versions of the songs are way better. What do you think? Country or pop?

20090226162816AA29Aro	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Do you like the dubbed (english) or subbed version of Yugioh more? (please respond if you've seen both)?	Before I start I just want to say that this is my OPINION, I know others have different, but this is mine.      I personally like the subbed more for a few reasons.   1. In the japanese their voice sound much better and even make some annoying characters tolerable (Ex: Weevil and Haga)   2. music. the music in the subbed sounds more approriate for the setting, while in the subbed well...it doesn't fit well   3. Now the thing that really irratates me. A lot of stuff is cut out of the japanese for the american version. I mean come on SUCK IT UP! So, there is a scary card or someone's arm is bleeding! DEAL WITH IT! It's just a program! And honestly if they took the japanese version and all they did to change it was turn the voices into english and one wasn't still able to watch it, then maybe they have no business watching it at all. I mean honestly it's not that bad, it's not like there's blood spewing all over and that kind off stuff. It's really not that bad. I think it was kind of dumb for them to cut out stuff for american kids who just couldn't handle it.I don't even understand why they cut some of the stuff out! In the episode where Yami Marik duels with Yami Yugi the two have a brief discussion that whoever loses will have their light offered to the shadow realm (Yugi or Marik) Yami Yugi wonders about this then later vows to save both the lights. This cut in the dubbed for who knows why. I mean is it really that bad that he wants to try to save them both and that he is worried about what he should do? (I don't think so) And also the US censors out some stuff for I don't know what reason! When Joey (or Jonouchi) is taken the Air Deck hospital there is a sign that reads "medical room" in the subbed, blank in the dubbed. Or when Bakura is being taken to the hospital "Taxi" is on the taxi in subbed, none in dubbed. I mean What?!!!      So my point is basically this. If a person can't handle some of the dark stuff from the subbed then they shouldn't be watching it. (That means LITTLE KIDS, I know some kids are more mature than others so don't tell me) And America has ruined another great Anime. Way to go USA!      Here's a site where you can see differences between the dubbed and subbed:       http://www.yu-jyo.net/003/128.html

20090226160510AAeNzU9	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why are men so full of crap about the size of women?	They say they want a woman with 'curves' or meat on their bones, yet constantly talk about how sexy the movies stars are which are sizes 00-4.  My boyfriend says he hates skinny women and the unrealistic standards Hollywood places on women, yet raves about Jennifer Aniston's  body and she is a size 2.  It is really annoying.  If you like small skinny women then admit it.  But just realize that these women are usually not getting the recommonded calories a day to be healthy and work out constantly.

We're a good looking group of lads, all about 17. Thing is im not girl obsessed but i like the occasional pull and the challenge of trying to get someone knickers down (hope that doesn't come across in a derogatory sense), but I'm just not as forceful towards women as they are and they keep saying that I need to be more forward but it's just not in my character. So whenever I don't get any action and they all do, I just get stick for it but I know I'm the best looking by a mile.      The bottom line is whether I should be more forward and show them how it's done or just stick to having fun.      HELP!      thanks.      :)

20090226112149AAKlRuM	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should I do a naked photo shoot (read details)?	My sister-in-law's sister, who is 29 years old and married, is in a photography class and has been desperately searching for someone to pose nude for her. She said there would be no full-frontal shots, and only her photography class and teacher would see the pictures. She lives a couple hours away from me, so there's no chance that I know anyone in her class or anyone knows me. I'm willing to do it, but my girlfriend's not really okay with it. She said she was a little upset, but that she'd get over it. I can tell she's obviously more than a little upset. So, should I do it or not?      Also, my girlfriend means a lot to me, so I don't want her to be upset. I'm pretty much this woman's last resort, though. I'm not completely sure what to do. I've talked about it with my girlfriend, obviously. Her response was this exactly, "It's fine. I'll get over it. You can do it if you want to." But we all know women never say exactly what they mean. So what did that mean exactly?      I've already asked this question, and I appreciate the answers but I need to add a few details, if you don't mind reading a little more.    A lot of people said I should just invite my girlfriend with me. The problem is, she's never seen me naked. I think that's her biggest issue with it, that another woman is going to see me naked before she is, but then again, that's her choice.    Basically everyone else said I shouldn't do it. The problem with that is, the woman needs someone fitting a very specific body type. She needs someone who is slender, but fit, and someone who has somewhat feminine facial features, which I do. She refuses to hire an amateur model except as a last resort because she doesn't want the pictures to seem too posed and professional. She's telling a story with her pictures and is insistent that a model would take away from them. Any advice would be appreciated.

20090226163923AAKICtZ	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	In relation to Locke and Richard on LOST, the TV series?	Since Last night's episode, The Life and Death Of...   When Widmore is talking to Locke on the hospital bed, Widmore mentions that he first met Locke when he was 17, and all these years later, Locke looks exactly the same. Widmore then asks Locke how long it has been for him since they met, and Locke replies 4 days.      Can we assume, then, that the reason Richard never appears to age is because he is traveling as well, and the time period of 50 years + is in fact only a few days? Is this too simple? It does confuse me, because in an earlier episode of this season (Jughead?) it appears that Richard and The Others are not traveling with the rest of them. What is going on?!

20090226155414AAXwsK0	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Do you think all rap has a bad influence on people or not?	Why?   Personally, I love hip-hop/rap.   Some of my favorites are Spoonfull (yes, with two L's), Jedi Mind Tricks, Immortal Technique, Army of the Pharaohs, and Aesop Rock.   Underground hip-hop/rap<3...   Freestyle is good too...   Rap played on the radio is ****ing terrible...   What I listen to helps with my general outlook on life...   "This is your home, this is where your life lives."   "It doesn't matter how often you change sneakers, it's still the same ground underneath it will stay the same."   "So give yourself some advice if you need it. A younger version of you has a secret."   Etc...Etc. I could go on...For a while.      How exactly can music such as that really be a bad influence?   "That kids 15 and he even had the nerve to curse!"   Give up...Music is the least of our problems.

So, I went to a family gathering this past Saturday and I talked to my cousin that I see every time the family gets together. We were watching a movie and started talking about what she does for a living because I never knew what her profession was. Well, it turns out she is a casting director for her own casting company and works for several companies. She finds people for big movies and things like that and said she was looking for someone with dark hair etc, and she said I fit the qualities (she said other people she was thinking of too was like vanessa hudgens, etc but they r all busy). Acting was always something I was interested in (not just for the fame), so do you think I should email her and ask about it, and if see if she can help me in any way or anything like that? Even if I don't get the big part I can get started. Is this something I should do because I have nothing to lose and everything to gain? (btw, this is not a joke). What do you think, should I go for it????

20090226160234AAYTP62	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Is anyone else out there grossly disappointed about the Top Chef Finale, Hosea with the title?	I really enjoyed the previous seasons of Top Chef but they undeniably fell short this season, being completely hypocritical in their decision making process. Hosea ended up winning the Top Chef title, talk about unfair endings...I knew Colicchio would eventually disappoint me the minute he endorsed 'diet coke'.      What is most troubling thing to me is that these are the people who have chosen Hung as a Top Chef, and now suddenly they're worried about people having souls. Not only that, they have acted as if the final meal was the basis for their final decision. Everyone who watches the show regularly knows that this is far from the truth. The past performance is always taken into account, and it's pretty obvious regardless of the judges having a conversation about it. Remember Marcel, who clearly wasn't judged solely on the final meal he prepared. He was experimental throughout the whole competition, and had quite a few lows which was his downfall. They actually seemed to be more surprised and fascinated with Marcel's final dishes than Ilan's.       I'm not criticizing the judges for taking past performance into account as it is the way it should be. Just like school, our finals have more weight than each of the other individual tests, papers, and presentations but they still are just a part of the final grade. Nobody ends up in Harvard Law by only taking the final exams as an undergraduate. Consistency is undoubtedly important, and even though I skipped the 4th season, I know that the first three seasons did not produce a final winner who happened to suck as much as Hosea throughout the whole competition. We knew Hosea was a good, knowledgeable chef, yet he kept having trouble pulling it off again and again.            Why not Stefan??? Is it because he's irritating? Is it because he is cocky and arrogant (which I do believe is counterproductive for his future) ? Now we know, 'know it all' Europeans who irritate American audiences do not get to be Top Chefs, at least not on TV...          By the way,  who the hell does not expect a desert at the end of a 3-course meal?
20090226161744AAu840w	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Have porn stars and co-porn stars ever fallen in love with one another in real life?	And have they even gotten married. I'm just asking because even though they both are getting paid for what they do and even though it's coming from a sexual fantasy world, they still are doing a very intimate act, whether it's imaginary or not. I figured that maybe they start out as with having a working relationship, but then it could blossom more into feelings of love and tenderness between the two of them. Especially if they are both good-looking and since they are really having intercourse.

My boyfriend of 6 months is a pisces, and so am I, but lately we've had so much arguments and he's lost interest but we've carried on. He's tried ignoring me before and we've made four days before he text me I miss you, then we fell out a short while after and I text him this time and he says he doesn't want to text me. But this time he says we are 100% over, he really doesn't want to do it anymore and he says things haven't been the same for months. It's not out of character for him to be like this but I have tried really hard to persuade him otherwise, but he persistently says no but his reasons are very flimsy and not very good. One thing they say about Pisces Men is that they often come back to clear things up before disappearing, is this what is going on here? Is he ignoring me for effect & if so how long will it usually last? And, if possible, how do I get him to stop doing this?

20090226104124AA2mLr4	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Multiple guitar string questions?	Hi!      I'm new to picking guitar strings, and as my acoustic guitar really hurts my fingers when I play (even though my fingers have gone rock hard...) so want to buy some new ones. I was told a .11 or .12 would be good. (not that I have a clue what that means...)      And as I like the 'ol epiphone guitar, I picked these ones:    http://www.gear4music.com/Guitar-and-Bas...       Someone tell me if they're good? Will they hurt less then bigger strings? I don't know what my acoustic strings are, but I assume higher then .12. And also I was wondering, my guitar isn't epiphone, so will epiphone strings work on it?      Lastly, are they a good choice of strings? I don't want to spend too much on them, I just want quality ones. Being a big fan of Noel. G and I love his guitar noise, anyone know what kind of strings he used here:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ_d9aSRN...       Sorry for the long string of questions!    Any help is much appreciated,   Thanks in advance!   -Dan

20090226163738AA2Uxip	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	What do you think of Jesse McCartney?	What do you think of Jesse McCartney?   What do you think of Jesse McCartney?   Here are my thoughts:      I think he is amazingly talented. Yes he did get started using disney. And we know disney can make you famous fast. During his disney days he had very good songs. And its gonna be very hard for him to lose this image. But I feel with Departure he is getting a good start. I think it was smart for Jesse to stop singing disney songs. I do love disney songs but it would be ridiculous if he was 21 and still singing those songs. Yes disney songs are very good...but if you want to be taken seriously as an artist you can't depend on it your entire career. It wass a little akward for me( and i bet alot of you) to see Jesse singing these new songs....but after a while I got used to it and fell in love with him all over again. I think everyone needs to get used to this new jesse because it looks like hes gonna be sticking around.       He's gonna lose fans because he ISNT disney anymore...but hes gonna gain alot more older fans with this new sound. He will always have the haters who will hate him no matter what he does and what he sings...which is sad because they are mssing out on his amazing new music.      But in the end I feel he has a very unique and phenominal voice. You just can't get past the voice. He is also an amazing actor. I saw him on Keith and Law and Order and in both he made tears come to my eyes. When I see him perform he makes me all sweaty and everything. And yes mostly girls listen to his music and yes part of that is because of his looks...but his music is really good too and I think everyone needs to give him a chance. Both guys and girls. He has a good head on his shoulders and I hope he makes alot more hit records.       Im mad that he got such a bad rating on his departure album on itunes becuase of the haters who refuse to listen to his songs and lyrics then just give him a bad rating...and also people who gave his album a bad rating becuz its not disney like they expected. Or they think he just cant do r&b...the albums sales were very poor...      I didnt like his album at first and then at the beginning of 09 i decided to give it another try after hearing him on dick clarks new years eve. And I fell in love with it and went out the next day and bought the Cd      I jus ask everyone to put there disney hate/jesse hate aside and actually listen to his songs a few times. He is so talented and I wish him the best in his career.         And I dont understand why they would call him gay? He had a model girlfreind for so many years.       I just desperately wish people would put the hate aside b/c he actually is very talented! Idk ...im just so frustrated by all the people hating on him. People have such closed minds that they arent willing to listen to his music!

20090226163538AAHWxPY	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Help Identifying Non-English Song?	There's this non-English song I've been trying to find for a couple years. I don't know what language it's in (sounded like Hindi or something Middle-Eastern possibly). I do know that it was sung by a woman with a soft-ish voice, it's got a fast beat, and the part that I remember had lyrics that sounded like this: "A mistanai, ha eiyai la sono... hei-yi piana, ha eiyai na sono" sort of like that, and then there was an instrumental part that went: yadada DA DA da-da-da, yadada DA DA da-da-da. I know this is a ridiculously vague request, but I figured it was worth a try. Can anyone think of anything that sounds even remotely similar to what I'm describing?

20090226121456AAImerV	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What is UNIVERSAL health care?	Obama is planning to invoke universal health care for all people. What is universal health care? How will universal health care hurt a doctor's salary? On top of the HUGE hurt the doctor will get from taxes with their $250,000+ paychecks. The funny thing is doctors already pay around 60% of their $250,000+ to taxes, i wonder if obama will increase so much that doctors will pay 80%+ of their paycheck to taxes. Then obama will add insult to injury by using universal health care and by cutting the costs of pills. That hurts doctors too so it's like if any of you want to be a doctor, don't do it because you're not going to get paid anything.

Ok, I had bad grades so my mom grounded me, but the only reason I had bad grades was because I was absent for about 3 days so I had alot of make-up work. Well I called my mom to tell her that I raised my history grade from an F to a B. She told me that she didn't think I should be grounded because I was sick. So I'm now ungrounded and can go to a movie friday and hang out with people! And I have a homecoming dance next Saturday! But some bad things happened today too. One of my best friends found out this morining that her parents are getting a divorce (that happened to me in the younger years so I can't say I feel her pain, but I do know that its hard to live without one of your parents.) and in 4th bell, in history they were playing a review game and someone tried to kill himself, I don't know why and I wasn't there so I don't know who, all I know is the dude choked himself and I heard him heaving in the hallway but we weren't allowed out of our seats so I didn't see who it was. So tell me, whats been happening in your life since last time we talked??

20090226135342AA8JWiP	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think all he cares about is getting with girls?	Tell me how you perceive this guy:   His facebook profile picture is 2 girls kissing his cheeks(one girl on each cheek). Some kid wrote, 'those your sisters?' Then the guy with the picture wrote something like, there my bittys.' I know that a bitty can be a girl, an attractive girl, a slut, or a '*****'. Do you think because he called them bittys, he wants nothing more than just getting with girls, not wanting a relationship, and is just a jerk? (The one girl in the picture had a boyfriend for awhile but they broke up, and the other girl isn't that pretty) so I really don't know if he was just messing with his friend who asked him who the girls were. But this guy has never been in a relationship before, but he's hot and he's 19. So tell me what ya think? Can he be a lover, or just some jerk who only wants ***? (I know he's not a virgin but I don't think he has had a lot of different sex partners).
