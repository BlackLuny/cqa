y02PZj22aa	Here's a better pic of it:  <a href="http://twilight-movie.site40.net/Gallery/albums/userpics/10001/normal_alice.jpg." rel="nofollow">http://twilight-movie.site40.net/Gallery...</a><br>  <br>  It looks like a long, white, sleeveless vest in a diamond pattern with bobbles in the middles of the diamonds.  In a quick look on the "usual" Internet sites, I didn't see any vests with a similar schematic, although you might be able to do something from this one:  <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/patterns/kce-longVest.html?noImages=." rel="nofollow">http://www.lionbrand.com/patterns/kce-lo...</a>  If you have knitting design software, you can design a similar vest pattern, then add the diamonds and bobbles to it (here's a pattern with diamonds:  <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter02/PATTdiamonds.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter02/PATT...</a>  That would probably be your best bet, as that vest was almost surely designed especially for that movie and knit by one of the knitters who specialize in knitting for the movies.  <br>  <br>  However, if lots of people feel the same way about it you do, knockoffs will start appearing in stores soon, as will patterns on the yarn companies' sites.  Look what happened when Martha Stewart wore a poncho to get out of prison--suddenly the crocheted ponchos and the patterns were everywhere.  And the brown dress with the polka dots Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman was in every store and every catalog within weeks of the movie being released.  Have hope!|`|154dzJ1Faa	It's not knit.

75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	if you hear a jet type engine and then explosion, that's the alien, use dogmeat found in the scrap yard to search for ammo, other wise, it is just NPC's fighting but you are unable find them, same thing happens to me|`|SNACHcceaa	If you wonder off in random places, hear explosions but see no body fighting, its likely that you found the Spaceship in the area :D! Spaceship has an alien inside and the alien is carrying a Firelancer ( best gun in the game ) or alien blaster ( 2nd best gun in the game ) Which comes with anywhere between 20-200 ammo around the craft, if you see the space ship and dont see the gun near the ship then it is possible that a npc has picked it up and is using it ( if he shoots you once with either of those guns on very hard or hard mode you're likely to die with only one blast... ) or that the either gun is a short distance away from the ship.
CysVPqXsaa	Hey, don't worry about it at all!!!!<br>  <br>  There is no problem with liking something just because other people don't like it. Everyone has their own opinions about things. As long as you're happy loving pokemon, go ahead, no one really cares, it's just your opinion and who you are. Just because some people might think that you are too old to like something, doesn't mean that you are. <br>  <br>  You all know that when you were babies your parents watched those baby shows with you, sometimes just because they liked watching with you, and sometimes because they still liked them and it reminded them of their childhood.<br>  <br>  Believe me, you are not alone on this experience!!! Everyone has some show they still like from when they were a kid. I can tell you that I am one of those people, and so are my siblings. We actually like more than one of these things, and we have books, posters, cards, and watch the shows (pokemon is one of them LOL!!) Hope you feel more confident about your love for pokemon!!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!!! Good Luck!!!!!|`|xjZKpXTTaa	ARE YOU KIDDING?!?! I'm 17 and I have loved Pokemon ever since it came out! I met my best friends through Pokemon, and I met the most fun people through playing Pokemon.<br>  <br>  Pokemon has been around since I was little, it is the one thing from my childhood I don't want to give up. EVER <3<br>  <br>  So why should you care what other people think? They have their own "weird" past times, you don't see others complaining! Hehe, one of the 'popular girls' (she's really nice though) in my high school is 19 and she still sleeps with a Cabbage Patch kid. Others laugh at her, but she doesn't care (lol, her Cabbage Patch kid has been with her since she was 2! That doll is 17 years old!!!). <br>  <br>  Take pride in what you've kept with you from childhood, it's admirable- especially in our time when technology is booming and everybody wants the newest and trendiest thing. Having something retro that makes you happy is inspiring :)|`|BJrfq5Owaa	well if you really love Pokemon i wouldn't recommend stop liking it because of peer pressure. there is no disadvantage to like Pokemon. hell it might even help you. but if you think that its  wrong to like Pokemon at 16. go to any Pokemon trading store or video game store. and you will see that your not the only one. there are people in their 30s still playing. there are even lawyers doctors and scientists who play Pokemon in their spare time. even i play Pokemon fire red and i love it no shame to that.(i brought all the games of Pokemon because i love the games) wither way keep playin Pokemon if that's what makes you happy.(im 17 and i have all the pokemon games)|`|PpheQM2naa	Lol, nah that normal,<br>  Im 14 myself and still into it its just all about your preferences.<br>  <br>  I know a 40 year old male who lives a normal life who is in love with the dragon ball z series, it really dosnt matter at all.|`|Yna4nQyPaa	PSH!

It has nothing to do with the console. <br>  <br>  If you were to sell it id say around 300-320 USD.<br>  <br>  to buy a PS3 would cost you around 400 USD plus taxes and then you would still have to buy an extra controller and games.

Doing slayer tasks whilst training strength with either a godsword or saradomin sword, and a black mask will dramatically increase your experience, most slayer creatures have very good drops, and you are training your slayer too. I'd recommend either Slayer or Experimenting/Yakking ;) have fun|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	I have found that training on Ankos or whatever they are called is good experience and they drop some useful stuff that you can use or sell.

It's a locally-owned general gaming store. Talk to the owner there and they might be willing to special order it in for you.

AA12165015	yahoo updated the site, check your game demo.<br>  <br>  Yahoo games and rooms open with a pop up.  Turning  off the pop up blockers like Yahoo  says doesn't work very well!  Most tool bars like yahoo and Internet explorer have pop up blockers! When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker on yahoo tool bar. On the drop down list click on Always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light Yahoo.com then click allow. On Google  blocker click on blocker and  it will allow site.<br>  . IE browser settings to allow pop ups Right click on Tools, Internet options, privacy tab, cookie over ride. Type in www. Yahoo.com, allow then OK.  If your tool bar has a blue gear with tools beside it, Click on it and a drop down list will have pop up blocker listed.Type in www.yahoo.com, click allow.  It is rare but sometimes the demo can go bad. To check, click Tools, Internet Options, Click Browser settings ,Then view objects. If any are bad it will say corrupted instead of installed. If bad delete it  and load the new demo next time you play.<br>   This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker. I have never had a problem or had to hold  any keys down to get in.  1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box.

2RefT1hBaa	First I think you should take out Cyber Dragon because mos of the time with this deck, you will already have a monster out on the field. Also cause it will just be another useless tribute card in your hand. Also add 1 Kreebons, 2 Plaguespreader Zombies and 1-2 Teleports. This will allow you to snychro summon a lot easier. My favorite tuner is Rose Warrior because it's the only level 4 tuner which means you can bring out Stardust, Red Dragon archfiend, etc a lot quicker. Also 1 RoTA so you can search out Rose, D-Dude, etc. Finally the side deck should include 3 D.D Survivor to go with the dimensional fissures you have. It makes it so you have a 1800 beatstick out on the field and on top of that he doesn't go away as long as you have dimensional fissure. Your deck looks really great. Hope I  could help.

During the End Phase of this turn, you take damage equal to its original ATK.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ideal808.com/product.asp?ID=25041" rel="nofollow">http://ideal808.com/product.asp?ID=25041</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  - Player A activates Power Bond, selecting Gatling Dragon in his extra deck (Barrel Dragon + Blowback Dragon)<br>  - Player B has no response<br>  - Player A sends Barrel Dragon and Blowback Dragon to the graveyard from his field or hand, and special summons Gatling Dragon (2600 ATK).<br>  - Due to the effect of Power Bond, the moment Gatling Dragon hits the field, its ATK is doubled (2600x2 = 5200 ATK).|`|TVnssRkkaa	To put it simply.

d5LN2DxEaa	Hello shayle, well first build up 1 supply pad, then build 1 generator or power supply, after that build any type of building that has troops in it (id prefer the barracks, get some ground soldiers in there) Afterwards go for the upgrades or build an armory. While you are doing all of this send troops out to gather more resources and take as many bases as you can. Use this base (after you have those 3 or 4 buildings up), use it as your main resource base and build turrets. On your second base you take use that as your backupbase and so on and so forth. Make sure that when your building your first base, send the warthog you start out with to gather the nearby resources and to scout around. hope that helped. Oh and if you would like to talk about halo, halo wars, and anything else halo go to this site/forum:<br>  <a href="http://www.halowarsworld.com/referral/777777e0" rel="nofollow">http://www.halowarsworld.com/referral/77...</a> <br>  Then go to by points after you create your account and add limkun.

sgRDJUXqaa	Cooking is actually the slowest way to gain cooking points.  Have her read a cooking book or watch the cooking channel on TV.  (If she has the culinary career or is a member of the cooking hobby lot -- both of those require expansion packs, I believe -- have her use the career reward; it's much faster, especially if someone with a higher skill teaches her.)

fvre0o9laa	Loop start your stitches, and finish with a quilter's knot that you can pop through to the midlayer.  If that doesn't feel secure enough to you, add a tiny drop of June Tailor Fray Block (not Dritz Fray Check) to the last couple of stitches.<br>  <br>  Or stitch through as you would if dealing with a single layer, and slipstitch a lining over the back when you're done.<br>  <br>  Or remember it's just a bib.  <g>
y02PZj22aa	Re-read the pattern.  It's made in one piece.<br>  <br>  The beginning chain ends up in the middle of the shawl and the V-stitches radiate from the beginning chain.  The ends will be identical instead of one being the beginning chain and one being the top of a working row.   <br>  <br>  When you have crocheted half of the shawl, you turn it around and start the second half in the OTHER SIDE of the beginning chain.  You then crochet the second half with the V-stitches right-side-up in the other direction.  The shawl comes out symmetrical.<br>  <br>  No sewing required.  It's a one-piece project all the way, it's just done to look symmetrical from the center.|`|rYNM67oyaa	Even though you've decided to do it in one piece the reason that is done one side at a time is the v stitch pattern points out one way and then you go back to middle so it points outward the other direction. I'd use a different yarn than homespun. I find it hard to work with. But I sure like the look of it worked up.|`|kGHwWNFraa	One reason may be that when you chain and work from one end to the other it creates a difference on the ends.  The working end will be elastic or springy, but the chained end will have much less give.  This may be desirable in the middle of the piece to help hold it's shape.    A second reason may be that some pattern stitches such as a shell may have a definite top and bottom.  if you split the stitch, you will have both sides mirrored.  Some people may think it looks "neater" that way.
QWHpXlNCaa	spunky ,<br>      That probably won't be a job for you. Maintain stuff like fallen limbs and clean areas people left messe at is generally the detail. plus actual carpentry stuff from time to time. find out some other jobs. you could even try to find jobs using yellow pages. just put your town and state in the location box..and then put different types of businesses in the product/service box.  the types of places you would like to work at might be go cart racing, theme parks, or something else...just put it in the product /service  box and click search.|`|43zXRpLYaa	Maintenance is maintaining the park. Repairing things like a carpenter would do. A carpenter is someone who builds things like houses, installs doors and windows, pours concrete, etc. Doesn't sound like you you know how to do that sort of work.
qbmkMWqeaa	ET for the Atari 2600. This game single handedly made Atari give up the console business and stick to third party games.<br>  <br>  Since I tend to buy games after reading reviews and playing demos I rarely get a bad game.

I did one for my best friend and i's last summer together and it was really great! Everyone loved it! We even had each person pitch in 10$ so that the winning team won like 100 bucks?!

43zXRpLYaa	Make sure you sign up for your daughters birthday on the Disneyland website for her free admission and take a copy of her birth certificate as proof. If you sign up online it will take less time at the ticket booth. Once inside the park go to guest relations and get a birthday button for her. They will write her name on it and ever cast member that see's her with the birthday button on with say happy birthday. It also will get you free stuff some places like Blue Bayou will give her a free desert.<br>  <br>  June is a peak month so there will probably be a lot of people there. I would arrive early to spend as much time as you can since the lines will be long. Utilize the fast pass early on the bigger rides if you intend on going on these otherwise they will run out. Rides like Space Mountain and Indiana Jones.<br>  <br>  If you plan on visiting both Disneyland and California Adventure, go to Disneyland first for a couple of hours. Then go to California Adventure. DCA opens after Disneyland and closes before. You have small kids and there are a bunch of things to do in both parks and they will have a lot of fun in both.<br>  <br>  A few fun attractions for your kids would be:<br>  ? A Bugs Life<br>  ? Toy Story<br>  ? Soaring over California<br>  ? Monsters Inc.<br>  ? Disneyland Rail Road<br>  ? The Fantasy Land Attractions<br>  ? The Jedi Training School<br>  ? Astro Orbitor<br>  ?

OZ0DgzrJaa	Everyday the newspaper offers you a job chosen at random from the ones available.  Also you can check the 'internet' in game and get 3 more offerings.<br>  <br>  Since job offers are random, you just need to keep doing it every day until a sports related job shows up.  <br>  <br>  Here's a money saving hint.  You can buy the computer.  Check it for jobs, and then immediately sell it back for full value!  If you keep the computer overnight it 'devalues' and can't be sold for full price anymore.  If you don't find the job you want, sell the computer anyway and buy it again the next day.

qbmkMWqeaa	nvidia is a hardware maker, not an MMO or game maker. You might want to check with some of the smaller game companies like Double Fine...I'd stay away from larger companies like Activision/Blizzard and EA...more than likely you wouldn't get even a response from them...<br>  <br>  You could post an add on something like craigslist that you are looking for freelance game designers to put together an MMORPG. With today's economy I know there are several out of work designers who might be interested.<br>  <br>  <br>  What you should first though, is to start putting down ideas, like a script, rather than having a bunch of jumbled ideas in your head. You need to sell this idea and no will want to listen to someone rambling...|`|AA10069553	Find someone who does know about coding and graphics and stuff like that.

Success depends on a large team of experienced developers, artists, and supporting staff to make it happen.<br>  <br>  If you have a good imagination and some talented friends, I would suggest getting your feet wet by starting with development of a text-based MUD (multi-user dungeon), which you could use a starting point for character development, lore, character balancing, and things along those lines. Using the experience gained during your project, you could potentially join a team at a larger game company and put your creativity to work.<br>  <br>  As an alternative, you could also work with your friends on a smaller-scale multi-player game, which wouldn't be as demanding in terms of resources and still be quite profitable. The gaming industry is currently undergoing a garage game renaissance and small teams have successfully launched very successful games like World of Goo, Portal, etc.<br>  <br>  You should also check out Kingdom of Loathing as an example of a low overhead small team project that has been financially successful.<br>  <br>  This being said, if you're hell-bent on making it an MMO, there are some great free software tools out there for 3d game development. Check out Blender (particularly Yo Frankie), Crystal Space 3d, and the WorldForge project. There are plenty of other resources out there, but I still recommend starting small.|`|UPWmuAvCaa	I'm sorry to inform you that it's not as easy as you might think. Though some small independent teams have managed to create MMORPGs the success to failure ratio is extremely small.<br>  <br>  In my sources you'll find a link to a man who's attempting to create a MMO. He's written a lot in his journal about the issue. I think you'll find it pretty enlightening.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about game programming than I suggest you start small and grow from there. Nothing better than making a tic-tac-toe game to realize just how difficult it'll be to make a MMORPG.<br>  <br>  Also, to answer your question, companies will not sponsor an inexperienced team for such an ambitious project.

NuH0NYl7aa	Activate the controls after charging up the power by turning on the generator. Go to the ramp and activate it through the control scheme on the electrical box. Once it's on, the power should start flowing and hen all you have to do is go back a few feet to a little box on a pedestal type metal bar with two buttons, hit them and the ramp should raise, but be warned there are a few enemies waiting, michael jackson, a koopa, and a mugger will be there, watch out for the koopa he's tricky, but before you do any of this YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS

TVnssRkkaa	Personally i hate synchros. they are an excuse to make weaker players seem stronger in the arena of duel monsters. but if you want to be able to match my level that will take much more than synchros, sure they're powerful, but they have no effect against the types of decks that i run, and even an amateur duelist can counter a synchro monster if they arnt stupid. so if i were you, dont rely upon the rediculous things known as synchro monsters. use the cards that you love to do duel with, not because you think they are cool, but because you love them for what they are.|`|h7lfk0ODaa	go to www.yugiohcardguide.com and you should be able to find synchro cards|`|XKiMAh39aa	dont rely much on synchro cards <br>  <br>  if possible dont use them at all|`|jTLxF4ZNaa	I suggest these cards<br>  <br>  Assault Mode Activate-Trap-Tribute one synchro monster on your side of the filed. special summon that same monster from your deck but with Assault mode in its name.<br>  <br>  Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode-Atk:3000 Def:2000-This card can only be summoned by the effect of assault mode activate.When this card is destroyed special summon Stardust dragon from your graveyard.(the rest is the same as stardust Dragon)<br>  <br>  Red dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode-Atk:3500 Def:2500-This card can only be summoned by the effect of Assault mode Activate.

l0Ojx5DCaa	I think you mean the the church at the top of cemetary hill, right? To the left of the entry and towards the back is a ladder. Go upstairs and strafe the railing until you get a prompt to jump to the chandelier. Jump off on the other side, and you will have access to a color panel which controls the orientation of three light circles. Rotate the circles to match the color patterns (blue on green makes yellow, blue on red makes purple, etc.; light mixture is different from pigment mixture), until your three circles blend to match the circle above the altar. Bars will raise, and a door will open to give you access to Ashley and the rest of the game.<br>  <br>  You're coming up on the mob assault on the little house. Good luck with that. I hope you've hoarded a few grenades.|`|qJaurSycaa	it's been a while, but it has something to do with arranging the panels of the stained glass window above the altar|`|tc9NGTIpaa	you have to run to that house go upstairs and find the rocketlancher and shoot the big dude in the face and get in the tank and go off the jump in the tank
0nvXYAZUaa	If you mean, does it happen on everyones console, the answer is yes.

e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	The "It's still a land" is actually a detriment to it.  As a creature, it can be destroyed and once destroyed, it's sent to the graveyard, just like all other dead creatures, land or not, but since it's a land, if your opponent changes it into a creature, it's still vunerable to something like Stone Rain, which destroys target land and sends it to the graveyard.  Just because it's a land doesn't mean it doesn't go to the graveyard when destroyed, so whether land or creature, you kill it, it's gone.  Combat Damage, Sudden Death, Wrath of God, Stone Rain, etc.|`|p3tVyimaaa	The card can be destoyed in combat, socery, instant, etc...<br>  <br>  "It's still a land." means that it can still be tapped for mana.|`|TVnssRkkaa	Yes it can be destroyed by a monster in battle. The reason its saying it is still a land is for mainly 'instant's to affect the card before it attacks, instants that specifically target a land card.
uctxzjIIaa	Each enemy has two items they can drop: one normal and one rare. Each has a set quantity assigned to it, but you can get double that amount if you do enough damage with the killing blow to "overkill" it.<br>  <br>  The only way to change the item an enemy drops is with a "Distiller" item, which you can eventually buy from the guy running the Monster Arena. There is one distiller item for each of the spheres used to increase a base stat. Using a distiller on an enemy changes the items that enemy drops to the same number of that type of sphere.|`|gYIdZ8Xuaa	i think they are predetermined|`|b9YVC7Mraa	i think there are certain items like chocobo feathers that can help you get certain spheres when you use them in battle

wyNvKrQmaa	Yeah this is possible, and a pretty clever way of getting around the unbalanced trade update.<br>  <br>  However every item is now worth a set price remember, and the General Store conforms to this, so it will only be slightly cheaper, maybye knock 500k or so off the total price.<br>  <br>  But remember that the General Store will get all the money, the rich friend will loose a certain amount of money that cannot be claimed back.|`|613d5971b99debfdbfc4fe45b9e6f875aa	yes i belive so but i wouldn't|`|2Y8D4BeKaa	ya u got no life|`|2Qr8vcAfaa	This method doesn't work. Let's say something is worth 100gp (to keep it simple). The store will probably buy it from you, the player, for around 80gp. Maybe even less, you never know. <br>  <br>  If you check the price once you've sold the item, you'll notice it's a lot higher than market price (at least it usually is). In this case, it might be around 120gp.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting some items you don't want; mith platebody or something similar - relatively low value. Check the price they offer prior to selling it, then check the price they're selling it on for. You'll notice that I said seems to hold true. ;) <br>  <br>  You'll just have to do what everyone else does and work for the item paying market price, or if you're lucky, minimum price in the G.E. :)|`|lPRPh7TBaa	Not really. The general store would offer to buy it a little cheaper, and then they would sell it a little higher. Just like in real life so they can make a profit.<br>  <br>  Even if it was possible, your friend might buy it back to get some money of it.<br>  <br>  And you would still need to have nearly 10m. why not just buy it? It probably wouldn't drop to 10k. It'd still be expensive.`

k5lfyMgNaa	For the interview expect anything. They have a tendency depending on the location you are applying for to make you do silly things to see if you fit the company profile,like making animals talk to each other, or "selling" an animal for a pretend customer. <br>  <br>  Be outgoing and bubbly no matter what you do. You have to relate to adults as well as children, and you have to show you can sell and care about the company, along with having a fun personality. Sometimes the first interview is a group interview, so I would say try to stand out and make yourself look awesome compared to everyone else.<br>  <br>  If you do get hired, they pay minimum wage, and since its their slower time of the year, I wouldn't expect too many hours,especially right off the bat. They usually want people who can work weekends, and won't mind closing or opening the store, either shift. If they ask you if you could do a kids bday party, enthusiastically say yes and say it sounds like a lot of fun! =) They want people who will do them, it's expected out of your job.<br>  <br>  Ask questions to show you are interested, about the job and what you will be doing. It will show your interest in the company, and that you are really serious about working there.|`|4hFT5JcLaa	Don't expect to get many hours a week. Especially if it's in a mall.

f6rHiAe2aa	Premature Burial, The Creator(Monster Effect), Rope of Life, Soul Resurrection, and Symbols of Duty...I think they're more with the new Booster packs.|`|96OLkhmyaa	There are numerous monsters with effects that bring monsters from the graveyard, such as creator, Light and darkness dragon, and ect. Also there is many spell cards that can do this, looking at the March 2009 ban list i believe you can use Monster reborn a vital card for brining cards back from the graveyard to the flied. May i warn you though, that I still believe that premature burial is banned and so is Call of the haunted ( i think) . Even though these are banned though, there are still many cards in witch can bring back cards from the graveyard. Also, if you were to specify the type of deck you are using then i could list a couple of card that can bring monsters from the graveyard to your hand/field and can support your deck.|`|FZjhVpQCaa	you should move on yu-gi-oh has died<br>  <br>  <br>           boo hoo hoo

EVjoCpjEaa	The proposing on an odd day is just a myth. It has been proved false many times. In my own game, I proposed on Winter 22 (an even day) and got a girl.<br>  <br>  Gender is randomly determined before marriage. You can't predict which you'll get until it's born.<br>  <br>  The only way to get a girl (without action replay.. if that even works) is to use both save files.<br>  <br>  Save in File 1 before you propose. <br>  Use File 2 to play up until the birth of your child.<br>  <br>  If you don't get a girl, reload File 1 and replay the 3 seasons.<br>  <br>  It's really time-consuming though.. good luck.
TMmvD55maa	My teenage daughter has two favorite places to play online.  The first is Barbie girls and the second is Virtual Family Kingdom.  She likes Virtual Family Kingdom (www.virtualfamilykingdom.com) the best because the clothes and furni are amazing.  She changes clothes frequently and VFK has so many clothes, that I don't believe her character wears the same outfit twice in a week.  The clothes are very realistic and the skirts swish when you walk. She especially enjoys turning into a fairy and going into the fairy world. She loves mermaids and really likes being a mermaid in their undersea world.  There is a really cool "Twilight Quest" where you can turn into a wolf when you complete it.  My daughter also loves to chat and has made friends from all over the world.  <br>  <br>  She also likes Barbie Girls (www.barbiegirls.com) it has a very pretty pink interface and great clothes and furniture. The games are very targeted toward girls with a designing clothes game, a "make-over" game and even a cute roller coaster game. It is a bit younger, but still fun.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Wdfg2Xziaa	<a href="http://www.RollyPoint.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.RollyPoint.com</a> is the best because it is not blocked by many school and work filters and has a great selection of games.

AA11850311	I've read that running the game in windowed mode can reduce lagging<br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Windowed_Mode" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a><br>  I do know that if you are in the neighborhood view, and go to options or settings in the lower left corner, and turn down most or all of the graphics settings, that will reduce lagging.  The one setting that helped me the most was reducing the resolution.
3MrhyHTZaa	im not sure y it wouldnt work... however a good cheat is maxmotives (fills your sim's status bar)
CgTUtZgXaa	Logitech Freedom 2.4 Cordless Joystick.<br>  It's really good, although you might need to download some free firmware for it off of Logitech's site (was a little annoying - the firmware that came with it was out of date lol)<br>  Other than that, it works perfectly and is great.<br>  Think it cost ￡25-30 at the time, probably a bit less now.

5d6392a517918c69f898af7a86fa7bfaaa	Oh my god, its amazing!!! There is so much to see and do...and so many important decisions to make. One of the first things you do is decide whether or not to set off a nuke that's in the middle of the first town you come across, in return for a large sum of cash (which would potentially obliterate the entire area around the town and its inhabitants) What other shooting game can boast that it has cities inhabited by Zombies, Vampires, Superheroes, and last but not least Androids. None, that I know of.<br>  <br>  If you like first-person shooters like Bioshock, that offers just a tidbit of RPG elements and skills, you'll fall in love with it. The game is essentially all in real-time(except when you are occasionally able to utilize the VATs mode), so the sense of fast-paced action and danger is definitely there. I'm really not surprised at the superb quality and depth of this game. We're talking about the same people who did the earlier Fallouts and the Elder Scrolls series...most recently Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion(Basically, Fallout3 set in a magical, medieval realm) (Another great game).|`|596N0bRXaa	yes i would recommended.|`|gA2op2YEaa	This game is amazing, if you have ever played The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion it is very similar. It is the same playing style but a different setting. The storyline is excellent and its another game where you choose between good and evil and the story changes to reflect your decisions<br>  <br>  Id give it a 10/10<br>  <br>  Heres a gameplay clip <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42068.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42068...</a>|`|pDtoi6FUaa	yes. i would recommend it highly. you can explore, customize everyithing. its a awesome game|`|NelFLLWmaa	yes i love that game.. and im still playing it till resident evil 5 comes out
ivzhA4Bdaa	Depending on what you make, you might be able to find some wonderful pieces at antique stores, thrift shops, and closeout shops.  Then you can either use the pieces as is, or deconstruct and reconstruct.|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	<a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com/</a><br>  This is the best place I know of that<br>  is reasonable with their prices.
eolsn2e2aa	Typical sleepover things to do. <br>  makeup or dressup eachother.<br>  scary movies and junk food.<br>  scary stories. <br>  board games. <br>  prank call your crushes. <br>  dance party.<br>  <br>  but whatever you do, make sure everyone is okay with it. try to have as much fun as you can as long as nobody gets hurt or left out.|`|aO8iBKkZaa	You can get out of the house for awhile and go bowling, or play laser tag.  That way there's not as much time at home trying to think of things to do.|`|6WsFngRxaa	There's this hilarious game, but I suggest you do it before everyone else in your house wants to go to sleep.<br>  <br>   You need a bar of chocolate,(wrapped would be better)  and knife and fork, hat, gloves (mittens is funnier) and scarf set. You need a dice.<br>  <br>   Everyone takes it in turns to roll the dice and if it's your turn when it lands on a six, you have to rush forwards, put on the hat, gloves(mittens is funnier) and scarf, pick up the knife and fork and try to open the chocolate, cut off a piece, and eat it. <br>  <br>  YOU CANNOT USE YOUR FINGERS! <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, everyone else carries on taking turns to roll the dice. If someone else gets a six you have to take off all you clothing and leave the chocolate how it is. They then have to put on the clothing and do the same. It goes for as long as you've got chocolate ;)<br>  <br>  oh, and prank calling is always good ;)<br>  <br>  hope this helps. see if you can help me please! ;)<br>  cheers,<br>  xxx

ktbyKKK9aa	I don't think that's possible. I know that each badge has its set item(In the case of Medic, revive gun.) and that you could gain another item(When you get 5 ppl to spawn on your grenades for 8 matches, you get an air strike bot.).|`|Id9ce5kPaa	I think you just have to unlock them?|`|AA11474128	the higher your rank...the more you can enable and do

IjN65G2Taa	This is the ROM and instructions that I used (and it worked for me!)  Works PERFECTLY without lag.  <br>  -----------------------Starting the Game--------------------------<br>  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?cb..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?cb...</a><br>  Rom<br>  <a href="http://www.crimsonrain.com/2007/12/nogba..." rel="nofollow">http://www.crimsonrain.com/2007/12/nogba...</a><br>  Emulator<br>  <br>  Turn on sound to prevent crashed caused by first battle<br>  If you try saving most roms they also won't save.<br>  <br>  Im hoping you know how to play pokemon. Sorry, I only know how to get a Diamond rom so hopefully you'll bear with me.<br>  <br>  How to open rom <br>  1. Go into the emulator (hopefully, the firmware is there so u can use the touchscreen)<br>  2. Before starting a game select options/ emulator setup. Change the emulation speed to Realtime auto *2 (fastest). Change sound output to digital stereo. Change NDS Cartridge backup media to Flash 512k (so it can save ingame). Click controls and change controls to whatever. OK. Then options/ save options.<br>  3. Start new game. <br>  4. Play a bit and save as soon as you can (to check whether it can), with whatever you assigned the x key. <br>  5. Quit the emulator! If you don't the save file won't be generated!<br>  6. Open the rom again. If the continue option is there, it should be. If it isn't or something went wrong, email me. Before you do that, check whether you've done the steps right.<br>  7. Congratulations, if you have successfully saved, you can continue your Pokemon Journey to being a Master!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Enjoy!|`|VWueB85zaa	i dont know what that means? but if your talking about making Diamond and Pearl easier 2 play then get a DS Action Replay. it can help you get lots of things like 99 master balls, capturing all of the legendary pokemon and other things.|`|AkpPTYN2aa	Yes but u can onl get japanese|`|cO10thlnaa	IDeaS runs D/P with slight slowdown in some field areas and some possible sound glitches here and there on my machine, which is just a generic HP Vista laptop.

154dzJ1Faa	Digital cameras are every where now, and very cheap.  Just go and make a movie.  See what others think.  There are lots of free editing software available.  That is the only way you will know if you can do it, and if others will be willing to watch them.<br>  <br>  Study commercials -- they are mini-movies, tell a story in a very short time.<br>  <br>  (hint: look into a SpellChecker)

aHafzVcuaa	I think you have to have your city for a while to do that, like you need a lot more people. Maybe try making a few cities around the one you want with the skyscrapers. They're are websites with cheat codes that may be able to help.|`|Spr3E5FWaa	Lower taxes for high wealth residential and commercial to 0%, and medium to something close to 0.  Also make sure you put the commercial and residential districts fare away from industry

LwYt5eNMaa	That's a really good team especially as you're doing it properly. Start of weavile and give it swords dance instead of night slash and a focus sash if you can afford one at the battle tower. On dusknoir replace mean look with fire punch if you can (you probably need platinum) and that would make it much better. Replace gengar's energy ball with thunferbolt and replace skarmorys stealth rock with roost. Foretress would be fine but for toxic spikes a tentacruel would go well on this team instead.<br>  This definately looks like a proper competative pokemon team, 10/10.|`|fUzJL2Qyaa	that's a good team. if you want to trade on pokemon wifi any time my fc is 081784784318 and name is jamaal.email me your fc|`|pB0XHnY9aa	its a really good team i dont think you can get foretress but if you want a posin pokemon i suggest going with crogunk and the it will evolve into toxicrok but nice teem over all good luck

xMqgB2GDaa	I think if you had some floating decorative cube lanterns that looked like bricks, people might try to jump up and hit them. Which might be fun if they had candy or something inside them....<br>  <br>  Centerpiece might be fun with a turtle shell cake (from Mario). That might be a little much, but it's a thought.
AwT0VRz2aa	Go to your address book. It's on the front cover of that.<br>  <br>  Wii message board > Address Book > Flick to front page<br>  <br>  Or Another way<br>  <br>  Click on the message board, click on send message, and then when it tells you to select a contact, your wii code will be right on the first page of your address book. It will say this console's wii number.
