20080323171703AAt4qdJ	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Car cd player problems...........Wiring?	Ok, I had just got a cd player 2 weeks ago and decide to hook it up myself. After I finished installing the cd player  I couldn't hear anything and the fuse keep blowing. So I figure out that it was a wire or the busted speaker on my front passenger door. So after I went to a "professional" and got a new speaker put in everything was working fine. Then, I figure something strange keep happening everytime I hit the remote button(twice) to unlock the door, the antenna will go up half way and then come back down. I don't know what in the world is going on either, cuz everytime I cut the cd player on It lose its memory then I gotta keep setting the radio stations and so on. After that I took the radio out just to see how they installed cd player, and the only thing they did was ran a yellow wire to the steering column. My question is that the reason(wiring) why the cd player is actin like that?  By the way, the car is a 96' Cadillac Deville

20080929163302AAytd6X	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Subwoofer question.. Pyramid VS Rockford?	Hello, I have been looking around for possibly better subs. I currently have a set of 12" Pyramid Imperials DVC 4ohm subs rated 1200peak 600RMS.. I keep getting told that the rockford fosgate P3D412's would hit harder.. but they are rated 1000peak 500rms. Also since Im sorta newbie on how to pick subs.. I thought the higher the DB sensitivy the better? The rockford subs have 85db sensitivy where as my Imperials have 97. Right now I am putting about 250watt rms to each of my subs and they are in a sealed box *which I wanna get a slot ported soon for either subs I go with* Which of these subs would truly be better? Ive been using the pyramids for nearly 4 years with no problems but Ive never had an amp to push them to even half of there required power. So any suggestions on which sub would give me better bass would be appreciated.  Also.. would there really be THAT much of a difference if I were to put a better amp that closer matched sub requirements? Thank you
20081022134456AAlb2Tv	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Rockford Fosgate 800A2 bass question?	Hello, I have just bought a new used RF 800A2 amp that ever since I hooked it up just didnt seem to sound right to me, with the bass turned up it only seemed to match my old amps bass with that ones turned down.. I think I found the problem with the new amp, It kept bugging me that with the punch bass turned up that it would only match the 501s with the punch bass on the 501s turned down. So I experimented and turned the punch bass on the 800A2 all the way down and turned up the volume.. NO BASS AT ALL. Its like its reversed or something.. its like turning the bass only up to 0 instead of -12 if thats gives you an idea of what I mean. Since the warranty is up on the amp anyway I opened it and nothing looks burnt or messed up. Question tho if you know.. Is it even possible for the bass knob to operate backwards so to speak? As in turning down the bass actually turns the bass into the minus region instead of just returning to 0 like Ive always known them to? Any ideas on this? I read that RF doesnt service the 800A2 anymore so sending it in doesn't look like an option now, not that I have the money to send it in anyway. The punch bass on the amp looks identical to the oval remote punch bass knob I already have. Makes me wonder if I can take my old knob *which is still good* and solder on the 800A2 board. The remote bass version of the 800A2 takes the same bass knob I have for my 501s.. just the difference is the 800A2 I have has the knob built into the amp instead of on remote.   Thanks to any replies
20081023212319AAdLnzu	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Car amplifier question?	Hello, I was wondering if it was possible for something to blow or go bad inside of an amp but still allow things to function semi normally? You see I just picked up a rockford fosgate 800a2 amp and while it turns on and has plenty of sound it just seems to be weak for what it is and what Ive seen other 800a2's do. Take for example.. if I turn the punch bass up on the 800a2 and turn up the volume, it performs like my rockford fosgate 501s with the bass turned down. Its got me very confused because I already opened it and while I saw some connections that had a darker caramel color around there base where they connect to the board, nothing smells burnt or anything. But I definitely know this amp isnt performing to its best. So I was curious if something could go bad in an amp but still allow it to work but maybe just not to its full potential? Thank you for any answers
20081007201831AAGybN0	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2001 Ford Focus Engine shake?	My Cousin has a 2001 Ford Focus with the 2.0 4cyl. The problem is that when you have the car idling in park or nuetral it shakes HORRIBLY, you can vibrate your arm on the fender or give your backside a nice massage from the seat. When you put the car in drive however it almost goes perfectly smooth. The engine is still visibly shaking a bit but you dont feel it through the whole car like it does in Park or Neutral. I am thinking a bad motor mount but when I have someone put their foot on the brake, put it in drive and give it gas the engine does seem to raise anymore than it is supposed to.. same for reverse. Any ideas?

I have an 89 dodge caravan, the blower motor stopped working... so I replaced the blower motor and it worked fine for a week then stopped again, then worked intermittently. Today I went out and tested power at the wires coming into the blower and get a 12v signal no matter where the switch is placed "low/medium/high"  Isn't it supposed to fluctuate depending on where the switch is? Next I checked the resistor under the hood and it appears fine *no broken or badly rusted connections* but the weird thing is even with the resistor unplugged I am getting still getting a 12v signal to the blower motor??? I have one power wire on the connector to the resistor thats blue with a yellow stripe? Not sure on those colors since Im colorblind but thats what it looks like to me, thats also the same color as the wire going to the fan motor but both ends have power? I thought without the resistor installed there would be no power to the blower? Can someone lend some kind of idea please? Thank you

Well I am about to buy a car and I paid several months on the car that no longer exists. So, do I get my $ back or can I put this new car on that plan? How does that work?

I took it all apart and put it back on the regulator but when I roll it up now, the window falls forward into the door instead of going up.  I have to hold it with my hand to get it up.(That doesn't sound right :)  Any ways is there something I'm missing that supports the weight on the front of the window , or do you know where I can find a diagram of all the parts involved?

20081101142728AArtIyf	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1989 Dodge Caravan Running issues?	Hello,       My Aunt has an 89 dodge caravan se with the 3.0 engine 3spd trans. Her problem is this. When the van is in drive and you hit the gas, it hesitates a few times then goes.. if you press the pedal harder once moving the engine actually revs down instead of up until you have it basically floored. Another symptom is when you do floor it *even from a stop* its revs up VERY slowly. I was originally thinking fuel pump/filter but those would exhibit problems more towards higher rpm and not lower like hers is doing. Also when you come to a stop it will usually stall.. and restarting it causes it to instantly stall unil you "start and floor the pedal" then gradually bring it back down.. then it will idle to a degree.  This sounds like TPS to me but I figured Id see if anyone else has had these issues with a similar vehicle.   Problems already known with van: slightly leaking brake booster, old plug wires, old dis.cap and rotor, and pretty nice exhaust leak.
20081026174303AAiPOF0	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	JVC head unit question?	Hello, for a while now I have been thinking my amps have been acting up and sounding low and no matter what I tried I couldnt get it to sound right... Well I was messing with the radio today and think my problem might be associated with it and not the amps. The radio is a JVC KD-LH300 mp3 player. It works nice enough tho the face always has trouble staying on.. but the thing I noticed was when I went into the setup and hit the "Amp Output Gain Power HIGH/LOW" option, there is absolutely no difference in sound between changing it from low or high. My uncle has basically the same exact radio I do and when you change his from low to high there is a huge difference in bass and over all sound. And thats where my system is lacking.. bass is massively down and Ive tried opening amps and cleaning due to finding nothing wrong, Ive tried replacing the wiring in the car to better grade.. so now I am thinking the radio.. but not sure since I dont know if the HIGH/LOW option could go and still let the radio function for the most part normally? I know occasionally my speakers/subs will just go dead and all Ill get is this nasty crunchy/scratchy sound from them for about 5-10 secs then most times they come back to normal. Is my radio close to dead or could this just be a stupid fix? Any Ideas? Thanks
20081110135823AArlTwL	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Weird smell from subwoofers?	Hello,       I have 2 12" pyramid Imperials dvc 4ohm subs rated 1200/600 peak/rms wired @ 2ohm on each channel of the amp which is a rockford fosgate 800A2 rated 400rmsX2 tho the brithsheet says 1150watt rms. My problem is today it was rather cold outside and I turned on my radio.. I turned it up and it didnt sound right *lately its been sounding a little lackin in the bass department* well today after about 20 seconds with the volume around 15 I started smelling this nose curling smell which didnt smell like electronics when they burn. This was more of a hair/finger nail burning kind of smell. I smelled the vents on my sub enclosure and almost gagged at the potency of the smell. I pulled the one sub and smelled around it.. as soon as I hit the bottom hole on the magnet I got punched in the face with the smell again. The subs still operate fine *tho tend to start clipping at a much lower volume than before* but the smell is present as soon as the subs start comin to life. This may be my fault but my gains and crossover settings are maxxed out.. but I was told this was fine to do since my amp technically isnt matched for my subs rms anyway. Any thoughts as to what I may have done and or how to stop/prolong the possible death.   Thank you

My aunt is supposed to turn in her leased 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in August but she has gotten in about four accident both fault and non, including hitting a pole. She wants to know if she should fix the damages and turn it in for a new or used car. She didn't want to fix it because her insurance is already top price but she wants to get a new car what should she do? The damages are: BACK BUMPER - has a crack from when somebody rear ended her and piece about the size of a golf ball. FRONT HOOD/FRONT BUMPER/HEADLIGHT/GRILL- she hit the back of a Jeep Wrangler after sliding on snow and half of the headlight cover is missing, the hood is dented up a little, the bumper is cracked along with the grill. DRIVERS SIDE REAR - she hit a yellow parking lot pole and it has a small dent and the paint chipped and its starting to rust. and finally, PASSENGER SIDE REAR - it looks like somebody hit her or she hit something and right above the rear passenger tire where the body frills out, it's dented in about the size of a golf ball. Should she get all these fixed, or should she fix some of them what should she do?

20060818160508AAe0QEx	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with my Truck?	It started out with this weird problem were it would die and lose speed when I put my foot on the gas, and it got wosre over time. At first I could restsrt it right away, but eventually I would have to let it sit for hours and then it would mysteriously started working again. It began happening more and more frecquently, and now, it won't even start. It seems like their may not be fuel getting to the engine. It had a quarterof a tank of gas and wouldn't start until I added a few gallons to that. then i was able to drive it home. Now again it won't start. I'm guessing that maybe my fuel pump is out, or the fuel filter is clogged, or something else is wrong with the fuel line. It is an 1985 Ford Ranger, V6, 2.8 L, with 4 wheel drive, and the auxillary gas tank. Ideas?

20070318011923AAhgo1l	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Les Espagnols ont-il raison ?	MADRID (AFP) - Conduire à 260 km/h n'est pas nécessairement dangereux selon un tribunal de la province espagnole de Burgos (nord) qui n'a pas retenu de délit contre le chauffard, tout en jugeant sa conduite "manifestement téméraire".   L'automobiliste avait été contr?lé en février 2006 sur une voie rapide entre Leon et Burgos au volant d'une grosse cylindrée, et la cour a estimé qu'il n'y a pas de délit étant donné que la "visibilité était bonne et la circulation peu importante".      Il n'y avait "aucune circonstance dangereuse concrète, comme cela aurait été le cas si d'autres conducteurs avaient été contraints d'effectuer des manoeuvres d'évitement", selon l'arrêt, cité par le quotidien ABC.      Le code pénal dispose qu'il doit y avoir un "danger concret pour la vie ou l'intégrité des personnes" pour que soit retenu le délit contre la sécurité du trafic, selon ABC.

20070912113630AAgQ8c9	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1999 ford windstar problem?	Hello,      Recently our 99 windstar has been giving us transmission problems. On a trip to NJ (300 miles 1 way) we were going up a hill and before the top of the hill our O/D light started flashing then the tranny just let out all the fluid. We got it towed back home and I attempted to find the leak since I do have a decent amount of mechanic knowledge. I refilled it completely and let it sit overnight to see if the ground would give an idea of the location, not a drop at all on the ground. I was puzzled, but I drove it locally with no problems. Then we made a 2 hour drive yesterday and the same thing happened. OD light flashes and the tranny fluid pours out. I did notice while running it in the Driveway for an hour at idle (to check for leaks) the tranny pan and fluid got so hot I couldnt touch it. None of my other vehichles get that hot. Any ideas? I am thinking tranny cooler or possible TC or Valve body. Neither of the latter am I happy about changing. Thanks for any ideas

My Problem is Im running EXTREMELY rich, as in 1/4 tank of gas for a 10 mile drive! I replaced down the list (O2 sensor, MAP Sensor, IAC Valve, Coil Packs, Ignition Module, Fuel pump, Coolant Temp sensor, Crank Sensor, New Vac lines, Intake manifold gasket changed, EGR Valve, New Plugs/Wires) I had my Fuel Pressure Regulator checked and its fine at 38PSI, Aside from the TPS every sensor has been changed on this engine to my knowledge. The problem I have is when you let it idle after 5 min or so the engine will shake very badly, I will get pops out the exhaust and white'ish smoke.. I know thats head gasket sounding but its not in this case. Also within the past 5 months the Timing Gears and chain were replaced so its not a timing issue. I am stumped as to what it could be tho. ECM is working fine as when you d/c MAP sensor it throws codes that way, Not leaking Gas but bad gas smell, catalytic converter changed to.

I just plan to use the audio from the AUX from the existing HU, its ghetto i know but its nothing i'm going to use often.       With that being said i want to purchase this unit and put it in a custom fiberclass housing I am making      This is a dvd player with a motorized monitor       http://www.sonicelectronix.com/item_1124...        My question is, how do i install it being that the stock HU is occupied with the stock harness. I know how to do most electrical stuff. Where do i draw power from fusebox battery? Will the HU power on if i don't occupy the audio plugs. Is this possible to do? If you look at the picture at the link i provided, you can see the picture of the back.  Could I just power the dvd player by connecting the ground, acc, and +12v? Where is the best place to do that.      Thanks in advance

20090227131305AATN8Zl	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Why would flames come from my tires?	Hi - I'm new here.... I drive a 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe. This morning on the way to work (on a busy fwy) someone pulled up on the left of me and tried to get me to roll down my window and tell me something.... I couldnt hear him... so I just kept driving. Then about 15 minutes later another car flashed his lights at me, then came up on the right side of me and told me there were flames coming from my tire!!!   So I proceeded to make my way off of the freeway and to a gas station. On the way I checked for any lights on the dash and looked out my windows to see any smoke or smell anything. At the gas station, a tow truck driver looked under the hood, checked and smelled the oil, and checked the wheel wells... nothing! I saw no flames! Does anyone know what May have caused this? I'm Assuming it came from behind since both drivers who notified me came from behind. Further - I had an oil change on tuesday evening - when I got home that night I smelled something mildly burning from the grill when I walked around the car.... but nothing the following days. I'm really afraid to drive home... I have a 25 mile drive.      Ideas?

20090308003625AAfunjD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	What can the problem be in '02 Ford Ranger?	Well This 2002 Ford Ranger v6 XLT has two problems that I want to fix, but not sure what the exact problem is.      1. Sometimes the ' Overdrive off ' light starts to blink. either it turns on by itself or it turns on when I reach 3K RPM and sometimes it goes pass the 3K when l'm not really moving fast.   Could it be that the transmission itself is messed up or that I need to change the trans fluid & filter- can this cause the 3K RPM+ issue? As far as I know it hasn't been changed in about 4 years- don't blame me it was my brother-inlaws truck, and then my dad's- i just started driving it.      2. When I'm driving on the freeway going about 60 or over the left side starts to vibrate I have changed both the tire and rims on that side and it continues to vibrate. Also I have notice that If i looked at the truck from the front it looks kind of slanted/tilted to the left. What can the problem be here...could it be a worn out shock/strut or something else? plz no ego strokes, ford jokes or smart answers.      K = thousand   Mileage about 140345      Like other people, I rather fix these issues then to buy another vehicle in this economy.
20090308003541AAZIutY	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is this a good deal on a car?	I found a 96 Thunderbird with 203,000 miles on it. Guy was asking $1200 for it and I talked him down to $800. The guy put brand new tires on it 3 months ago. My friend is a mechanic and looked the car over top to bottom. The only thing he found wrong is it will need new shocks soon and it needs a good interior and exterior cleaning. There is no dents in the car body and the paint is holding up well and the car runs great. I'm really considering buying this vehicle cuz I need something real bad to get to school. Is $800 realistic?

20080713112011AADU4V2	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1988 plymouth Voyager 3.0 oil leaking?	I am doing a job for a friend, I had to pull the engine and tranny, change the engine and rebuild the transmisson for her. The problem is the new engine has a VERY bad oil leak coming from behind the harmonic balancer. While it was out I change the crankshaft seal and lubed it properly because it had the oil leak before it was pulled from the other car. Imagine my level of fustration when I finally get it all back together and start the engine only to have it pouring oil like I did nothing at all! When you start the van initially there is no oil drips.. in about 10 seconds tho it starts a steady drip that would roughly equal 1 quart to every 5-10 miles worth of driving. I know I put the seal in correctly but this one has me stumped. Any ideas? Ive seen bad camshaft leaks before but this is alot worse.. I can take a look tho. Thanks for any advice with this

I have yet to get a Second opinion but will. Before I do I was wondering is it worth putting all this money into my car? it has 117,000 miles, I have always kept up with tune ups and oil changes and this is the first time the car has giving any major problems. I just am afraid of paying so much to fix it and it just dies or something. So I don't know should I keep it , fix it, and pay the balance, or just get another car? I have always wanted to be car payment free for awhile but don't want to be stuck with a car i cant trade in later. Im so confused.... some advise from strangers is helpful at times.... thanks guys~

Hello everyone, I was planning on buying an '03 Harley V-Rod for 8k this past week but the deal fell through after 6 weeks of "negotiations," and I'm bummed and basically thinking screw it, I'll buy a new bike.

I would have to finance for 6 years, unless I pay it all off before that (naturally).

20090308015251AAJg971	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mitsubishi	How safe are 95-99 Eclipse's for real?	Ok the NADA Guides and everything else says the frontal crash tests are 8/10...but!.. the side impact ratings are 1/10, which is terrible and has deterred me away from those models and on to the 00-05 models, which are 8/10 side impact and overall very safe.  So I was just wondering if the 95 - 99s are safe at all.

Found this DVD player for car which plays dvd/mpeg/mp3 and other things.       The unit is : VORTEX  VA-250      Here are sum of the specs:      4 X 30 WATTS   2.5" sharp colour lcd screen   REMOTE CONTROL   ESP FUNCTION      Im worried bout the 4x30Watt. Is that powerful to listen to sum trance songs or house songs. Will it be good hearing?      My car is small but still would love a good 'hearing' cd player.      Price is a factor. Around $120 would be good. You guys got any suggestion if the Vortex isn't good enough for good sound?
