20090223163630AA5TDNH	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	How to win at Pachinko in Japan?	Now, I'm a little confused about the modern hi-tech pachinko machines they have in Japan - can anyone help me out?      Okay, I understand the whole balls-flying-round land-them-in-the-catchers more-balls-come-out business, but I'm confused by the massive flashing video screen slot machine thing in the middle and the extra buttons on the front.      Basically, what I want to know is whether or not the player can actually influence the outcome of the reels in the middle. Modern pachinko machines certainly make it seem as though you have some control over it, and there are extra buttons on the front which don't affect the balls in any way so I feel that they should therefore affect the reels, but I can't for the life of me workout how.      Thanks for your help.
