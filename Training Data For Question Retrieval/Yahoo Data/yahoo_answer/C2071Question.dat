20090221025410AAx0SLr	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Voice Calls	Have you been ripped off by yahoo/Jajah voice billing?	Have you also been ripped off by the fraudulent yahoo/jajah voice billing service? If so do speak up so others wont fall victim.      I cannot count how much money has been 'fraudulently' deducted from my yahoo voice account, which is managed by jajah, for calls that was never made/connected.       Many many (many many) times, when I dial a number, and it rings out, or I cut the line as it seems it wont be answered, I notice that money gets debited from my account, even though the call was not answered, or it didn't go to voice mail. Where on earth do you get billed for dialing a number???      My mail to yahoo referred me to deal with jajah as they manage their voice service, and repeated mails to jajah are unanswered. One time they did answered, and I when I told them of the problem, they never responded back. And yet this practice of debiting my account continues. Of course once the funds in the account runs out, that will be last of my money that ever goes to them, not when such companies like skype exists.      Shame on yahoo for doing business with a company with such extremely lousy customer service and with such fraudulent practices.      Anyone else with such experience, pls speak up and let others be forewarned before they are ripped off like me and I'm sure many others like me.

20090221033851AA1vPJk	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why was this question deleted?	I asked the following question in the Philosophy and Jokes & Riddles sections:      "With man gone, will there be hope for gorilla?"      This is a well known koan in certain circles.  From what I can tell the questions never made it to their category listings.  The very next day I received three notices of violation saying my questions had been deleted.  Not sure why I got three notices, but I got the points penalty twice.  The reason for deletion was left blank.  I appealed and today Bjorn contacted me saying the violation stands, though he also failed to give any reason for the deletion.        I can't even begin to imagine how this question violates any community guidelines while Y!A is filled with hateful and intolerant questions and answers.

20090221000719AAwOnwh	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Please,can you fine for me all the answers of this question :( I'm not understand ENG well so i can't answer .?	Act One       What is Iago's complaint in Scene I?       Who is Brabantio, and why does Iago and Roderigo awaken him in the middle  of the night?       Why does Iago leave Roderigo at Brabantio's house?        What is Roderigo’s previous relationship with Brabantio and Desdemona?       What is Brabantio's reaction to Othello's marriage to Desdemona?       Why does the Duke send for Othello?       What danger is Cyprus facing?       Brabantio complains to the Duke about Othello's marriage to Desdemona. After listening to  both sides of the story, what is the Duke's reply?       What is Roderigo's complaint, and what is Iago's reply to it?       Who is Othello, and why is he so respected by the Duke?       What warning does Brabantio give to Othello?       Othello and Desdemona have just been married.  Will they stay together or separate?       What does Iago say must happen to Desdemona?       Why does Iago “hate the Moor”?       How would you grade Iago on racial insensitivity?       Act Two              Where are we as Act 2 begins?  What is the situation at sea?       What has happened to the Turkish fleet?       Which ship from Venice arrives first?        Which ship arrives second?  Why is it surprising that  it arrives before Othello’s?       What does the discussion between Desdemona and Emilia tell us about their relationship?       Who is Emilia?       How does Cassio greet Desdemona and Emilia?       Why does Iago want Roderigo to anger Cassio?       What is the purpose of Iago's plan?       What evidence is Iago using to rationalize his plan?  Is his evidence solid?       What keeps Roderigo from seeing  the truth instead of Iago’s lies?       What emotion seems to be governing Iago’s thoughts and actions?       How does Iago see Desdemona, and how does Cassio see Desdemona?       Why does Iago want Cassio to drink more wine?       What is the outcome of Cassio’s drinking?       What lie does Iago tell Montano about Cassio?       Why does Othello strip Cassio of his rank?       Why does Iago want Cassio to ask Desdemona for help in restoring Othello's faith in Cassio?       How does Iago get back in Othello’s good graces?       What is Roderigo’s complaint, and how does Iago answer it?      Act Three              Why does Cassio bring musicians?  What is Othello’s response to them?       What does Emilia tell Cassio that Desdemona is already doing for him?       What responses do Iago and Othello have to seeing Cassio leave Desdemona?       How successfully does Desdemona plead for Cassio? What is Othello's response to Desdemona as she leaves?       Why doesn't Iago simply tell Othello right away that Desdemona and Cassio are having an  affair?        Othello’s love for Desdemona is solid as can be seen through line 93 of Act 3, Scene 3.  Why does he become a man in “misery” by  his next speech (3.3.190).  What has moved him from love to jealousy?       How can anyone provide proof of fidelity?       What thing does Emilia find and give to Iago? What does Iago intend to do with it?       What is Iago's reply when Othello demanded proof of his wife's disloyalty?       What does Othello decide and command at the end of Scene 3 ?       How likely is it that Othello will keep an open mind until he has seen real proof? How much have Iago's suggestions about Desdemona's "nature" worked on Othello?       Is there any chance of his changing his mind or of Desdemona's convincing him of her innocence after this speech?       What is Emilia's relationship with Iago? Desdemona?       What, according to Othello, is the history of the handkerchief (3.4.53-73)? Is Othello telling the truth here? What else might he be doing?       What does the argument in 3.4.75-95 show about both Othello and Desdemona?        What is Emilia's view of men (3.4.99-102)? How justified is she?       Who is Bianca? What is her relationship to Cassio? What does he ask her to do? What is her emotional response? Sound familiar? How does Cassio get the handkerchief?       Who had the handkerchief at the end of Act  3? Why?       Act  Four           After Iago lied and told Othello that Cassio confessed going to bed with Desdemona, what advice does he give the overwhelmed Othello?       What happens to Othello in Scene 1?  How does Iago respond?       How does Iago trick Othello into thinking Cassio is gloating and bragging about his affair with Desdemona?       Why is Bianca angry with Cassio?       How does Bianca's return with the handkerchief help Iago?       Why does Othello hit Desdemona?       Who is Lodovico, and why has he come to Venice?        What is Lodovico's reaction to Othello's behavior towards Desdemona? How does Iago later  explain Othello's behavior to Lodovico?       Why does Othello ask Emilia about Cassio's affair with Desdemona, and what is her reply?       How correctly does Othello identify his weakness in Scene 2 ?       To whom does Desdemona turn for help after Othello calls her a strumpet?       Why does Iago tell Rodriego to kill Cassio? Why does Roderigo consent to think about it?       If Roderigo kills Iago, what promise  has Iago taken care of

20090221025648AAa1Bs5	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	What is the purpose of this stupid thumbs up/thumbs down system?	Seriously, I really don't get it. In the search for objective and logically derived answers, what is the purpose of a thumbs up and thumbs down system? When was a thumbs up or a thumbs down EVER a convincing argument, or ever consequential to the decision on a best answer? When has it ever done anything but inflate egos or anger people? In a community full of people that aren't looking for answers so much as they're looking for agreement, is it really necessary to make it worse and allow people to spam your answers with am illogical thumbs up or thumbs down?      I swear, unless someone can tell me why it's necessary, I contend that it is a ridiculous and unnecessary element, interactive or not. Anyone care to make their voice hear about this?

20090221051213AAGRStI	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Do you think Yahoo Answers should give one the opportunity to *Accept* or *Decline* a contact?	I think Y/A should send an e-mail on behalf of a user (like they do when someone has added you as a contact) REQUESTING to add you as a contact.      You can select *Accept* or *Decline*.      This will stop people getting into your profile without your permission, before you even realise they have added you.      By the time you block them it is too late.      Other sites like facebook wont allow anyone to have access to your page unless you give permission beforehand.      What do you think?

20090221044831AAITpZG	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why does Yahoo! Answers allow people to post their age?	I've run across several questions and answers that kids have asked.      For some reason, some of them think it's a good idea to post their age in the question/answer.       It honestly scares me. Everywhere else people are so worried about protecting children, yet anyone could contact them here or find their Contact Info. Even if they can't they could do a quick search of their user name on google.       It can't be safe for a Child to say, "Oh yeah and by the way I'm 13.". Even Parents who monitor their Children's Activities online, might not think to check Yahoo! Answers.       So I was wondering.... why does Yahoo! allow people to post their age? I would think that most of the time, that information wouldn't be relevant.

20090219165208AATrN0m	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Messenger;Voice Calls	How do I get stupid prank callers to stop calling my house?	They call and then don't say anything and then hang up. I can't ignore them because we get important phone calls for my dad and mom's work and important calls from people from church and we can't ignore them because alot of the calls are very important. i also can't blow a whistle on them because i don't have one. one time they kept calling saying nothing, and then hanging up. they keep the line up long enough for me to say something and then i hang up. the 4th time they called i answerd, they didn't say anything so i knew it was them and i said "at least say something to make a worthwhile prank instead of saying nothing" the second time i said "use a soundboard if you have to, say something to make a worthwhile call instead of wasting your time saying nothing" after i said that and i hung up, they stopped calling, so i want to know what i should do for the next time they call, i was thinking of saying "ok, i work in the police department and have a phone tracker so even if you are calling from a private number, i will track you down and arrest you" and then hang up, i know its not the truth but it would entertain me and might make them stop. what do you think?

For some reason the default city is New York, New York, USA.  I don't live in New York, I live in another country and want to save that as my location.  But Yahoo wants me to put a city and state and zep code, we do not have zep codes or states here.  We have districts but Yahoo will not recognize that and asks for a state.  How do you change it so that yahoo will show my own country's news and local weather?  I do not understand why people would want to know the weather in New York?

I understand they can get flagged for inappropriate content, but one was about veganism... The question, my answer, and all other answers at that point were inoffensive. If someone answers in a profane manner, does the entire question get pulled? Does Yahoo pull questions for other reasons like redundancy? Or could the asker decide to pull it for any reason?
