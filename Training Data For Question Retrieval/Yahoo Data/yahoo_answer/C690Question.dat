There is also a cute guy I like in my band class. His name escapes me but he seems really nice. His friend told me that he has a crush on me and I ws starstruck but he has a weird way of showing it. Is it just him being a typical guy acting like a jerk around me or is he just the wrong guy, however Logan is showing awesome signs of love and is getting alot of my attention. Should I choose the guy who I know likes me and be a happy couple or should I choose Logan who is the perfect guy but love isn't completely in the air.

20081006180208AAJU9qC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do U think you'd still be attracted to a star?	if he/she were just a normal person walking by you in town or somewhere? Is it the fame that attracts people or the actual beauty and personality. Personally, I'm attracted to the latter. For example, I don't find Angie Jolie attractive at all and I would not date here even if I was paid cause I get scared of girls with lips so large, they're able to chew gum till it breaks. That's my opinion and you all have your own.      Angie Jolie was just an example. There's many freaks in hollywood.

Im 17 and my boyfriend is 18       We live on different sides of town      He doesn't have a car, my aunt wont take me to see him because she think s its the "mans" responsibility to come see his girl, no matter what it takes and that she girl should never make it easy for the"man " to see her      We've been dating since the summer...used to see each other alot during the summer ,but now that she school year has started back we only see each other at practice every thursday afternoon      whenever i make plans (no matter how early i plan) he can never find a way to get to where we are supposed to go   (even though we meet each other half way, my aunt wont take me anywhere closer to him, although i don't mind, i think it should be 50/50)      He doesn't have a cell phone anymore because he only works Monday-tuesday and he doesn't make even money to pay his bill.....so he has to use his brothers cell phone, so this makes it hard for us to talk as much as we used to.         Theres more- but with that being said do you think i should continue to be with him and see how things improve, call him my boyfriend but continue to do me on the side, or just break up with him because there's no hope?

I have dated my ex for almost 3 years. The relationship was bad for the most part but when it was good; it was REALLY good. I have now been with a guy for 7 months who treats me like a princess. I really care about him, but for some reason i STILL think about my ex every single day. My ex just recently tried contacting me again, has not noted any interest in getting back together, but has been talking to me for a steady 3 weeks (even though we've gone months and months without talking or seeing each other). When i last saw him a few months ago he left where we were the minute i saw him. I'm sick of reading into this, but i just dont know why i feel this way, why i can't stop thinking about him and most importantly why i'd even put thought behind if he still likes me or not. Ive grown as a person and am now with a great guy that i deserve. He, on the other hand, has put on weight, become dependent on different drugs/pills/i dont know the logistics of it, and i just cannot seem to stop dwelling on the past and wondering how he feels about me... what do i do?

20081109082122AADvqjR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend? Do I really know you?	So I've known this guy online through a game we used to play. He told me he was the same age I was so I felt I could relate to him. After four years he tells me yesterday that he wasn't really the same age that I was and he was really two years younger than I was. I feel like part of the reason why I was able to connect with him was because he was the same age as I was. Now, I feel like the whole thing has been a sham and I don't even know whether to believe him anymore. Over these four years I've spent a lot of time with him (gaming and such) So I'm split between forgiving him and tossing our sham of a friendship.      Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.

20090309221806AA0uL4B	Family & Relationships;Weddings	No food in cocktail hour...?	It is more the cocktail half hour, but we were thinking of not having hor d oeuvres with the drinks.      We recently went to a friend wedding at the same venue and only 2  tiny pieces of not very nice food was passed. And that was $6.50pp!      Timeline: 4 - 5pm wedding,    5 - 5:30pm congrats and move over to reception (same property)    5:30 - 6 cocktail hour,    6 reception,    6:30 entree served.      As a guest would you be annoyed if there was no food during cocktail hour? Is that too long to make them wait without food?
20090108161316AARef0k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think is happening between us?	this might be long. and it's me talking about a boy situation so if from reading this you're not interested then move on. but to anyone with an honest mature opinion that's interested in my story, read on :)      Since the beginning of the school year, I've had a crush on this guy. There would be times where all I felt was that i really liked him cuz he's the only boy ever that really stands out to me in the ways i admire the most, but other times i tried not to care and i really didn't at some points about liking him, cuz I'm a freshman, young, naive? not really i know my limits . and being tied down now doesn't sound like the greatest thing but there's something about him that makes me want him so bad. i don't know if i've ever been in love before .. i don't know exactly what love is, but i've been thinking about him in ways i've never thought about like any other boy, person, thing, etc. he's just different to me. everything i'd dream of in a guy is HIM. he's so cute when he smiles and stutters in spanish class. anyways he's a sophomore. he tries hard in school . he's not a jerk . at all .... really good looking. i don't ever see him talk to many girls . he's shy to us i know it. but yeah yeah ever since 2 weeks ago, i felt me liking him was pointless cuz it wasn't going anywhere. i've tried talking to him but there were times where he'd just give me one or only a few word answers. and one time we were starting a convo kind of and he just looked down and it like ended our conversation. but that was months ago when i first "liked" him. NOW, i sit by him. he asks me for help with spanish sometimes. my friend that knows i like him tells him to talk to me and he does. he asked for my number today and i said why but not ina bad tone and he was like 'i dont knoww so you can help me wit spanish homework'         i gave it to him, i turned around and put my head down. i was smiling sooooooooooooooooooooo hard and my friend right next to him was laughing with his head down on his desk.         but when he asked me, he was like . . smiling . and he already had my friend's number to text about spanish hw. so im thinking , why would he need mine? :) !!!!      and i walked by his friends and him in the morning one time, and i stopped and looked over and they were pushing him and looking at me. not just looking, but like turning and looking over everyone possible around us just to see me. and sometimes i see him looking at me in the corner of my eye. i guess i really like him .. and i've never really trusted many guys or even thought about liking any since my ex. but all those feelings went away when i met him. what do you think?
20090309223440AAVDN7j	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My parents are separated :(:(?	My parents are getting separated out of no where, after 30 years my mom made the decision and wont tell anyone why, and my dad wants to work things out so bad he loves her so much, he's not controlling or abusive in any way to her or me and my siblings and he does everything for her, Why is this happening im really upset and don't know what to do, i've been through a lot in the past 2 years, My cousin who was like a sister and best friend to me and we grew up together (she was the same age as me,,, im 18 btw) past away, and then her home committed suicide and i was close to her, and i almost lost my best friend in a bad car accident and now my parents are getting separated i feel so crappy and have no idea what to do i can't choose who to live with so i decided to move out with my friend, And my little sister has been through so much more and i want to be there for her but not sure how. Can someone help me please :(
20090309223056AAVNJ4E	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Hair stylist drama....?	Ok... so I hired this woman by word of mouth. She is new in town and just getting her business started and I thought I'd help her get some business going... The first meeting we had setup she had to reschedule... something to do with her son. I can understand that, I have a kid too, so I was ok with it. Then when she finally did show up she seemed really bitchy and I did not like her hairstyle or makeup style... wasn't really confident with her making me look and feel good but still decided to go with it. She wouldnt give me a direct price but just kept saying it'll be cheaper than anyone else in town if you let me use pictures for promotional purposes... We were supposed to have our run through tomorrow (my wedding is on the 18th, 9 days away) and she called today to say she couldnt do it because she still had to go out of town to get stuff for my hair and that we needed to reschedule again for wednesday. I agreed, reluctantly... then tonight at 10:00 PM.... 10!! I have a 15 month old son!!!! She called to see what color my sister wants done in her hair...       So I'm PISSED. Isnt that something that should be able to be decided when shes in the chair... or atleast call at a decent hour tomorrow!??      I told my sister to hang up. that it was inappropriate for her to be calling at such an hour and that I'm ready to get a new hairstylist.      So... am I right to be mad? Would you be mad? Would you be looking for someone new? What would you do?
20090309223551AAanJgf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is he like this towards me?? can I fix it?	I had some strong eye contact with a guy last year in the hallway at school. He was just staring at me so I stared back at him. There was no smiling or anything...pretty much a stare down and then I had to look away.      I have a class with him this semester and he listens in to conversations I have had outside of class and says some of those exact things I have said in class?? He has done this about 4-5 times      He stood beside me once in the hallway so I looked at him and he starts making a big deal of out this poster that is beside him on the other side and started talking to this other girl.      I had to hand him something in class and he looked above my head and said thank you (avoiding eye contact).      Why is he being so rude?? He is confident and talks to everyone else in class.      We are in college

20081124210630AA9PYFu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In need of relationship advice :(?	Ok, here's the story, the details are relevant for the answer I'm seeking...very confused.   I met this guy who chased after me considerably before I gave him my number..not because I wasn't interested, I was actually just getting out of another relationship and was still upset. As soon as we started to talk, things began moving very quickly. We spent a lot of time together and he was very honest and staright forward about his feelings...telling me he hadnt felt this way before yadda yadda.. Less than 2 weeks into our whirlwind romance, he told me he loved me which reallly turned me off. I was going through a rough time emotionally and him telling me that just released the trigger since he made no sense to me... I stated acting like a total jerk with him until he reached his breaking point and we broke up... I felt really bad and started to miss him and all my friends told me I was too harsh on him, so after calming myself down, i called him and we got back together. We ended up sleeping together for the first time shortly after and I started to notice that he was being very distant...would take 5-6 hrs to reply to my texts and i would call way more than he called me.. I started to get angry and instead of talking to him about it, i got really drunk one night and called him and broke up with him...again. (forgot to mention it was me who broke up with him the first time around too because i felt that i pushed him so far it was beyond salvation)... everyone told me i'm too impulsive and quick to cut him out of my life only to regret it later...in the same time ive also been told that i had good reason to break up with him the second time around because he was playing games.. now we just got back together for the third time!! lol just a few days ago... and it was me who initiated contact again... we spend 2 days together and everything seemed great and now hes back to taking too long to reply to my texts and not calling often... i'm so stressed out and dunno what to think or do...he wasnt like this at the start and i cant help but think i just blew it...or am i just not realizing that he is a player...or am i freaking out for no reason... should i end things again and for good?   thank you!!!

I am having a lot of trouble talking to people, whether it be guys or girls. Like if I am with a group of people I am completely fine with not saying a word and just listening along with the convo. Or even if its just one person, sometimes its hard for me to say stuff. What can I do to be more outgoing and talkative?? This is really effecting my relationships with people and I need to change. Also, this doesn't happen all the time, just most of the time.      Any advice??

20090204181043AAoTOYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex-boyfriend asks me to send him pictures/webcam, what's going on?	I've looked at other answers to questions similar to mine, but they don't give a lot of info about the relationship and many questions have the same answers.      My ex and I have been broken up for a few months now, and just recently, he's IMed me and says he wants to try being friends again. But then he'll go and ask me for a naked picture or something similar. I really care for him still, and I know he really cared for me at some point, but there was this one point where I absolutely put my foot down and refused to go on my webcam. He went a bit crazy over the phone and said some hurtful things that he later apologized for and said weren't the truth. They weren't really insults to me, but more insults to our relationship. I've asked him why he doesn't just go and ask other girls for these types of pictures or look online or something, and he says he doesn't want them from anyone else because he wants me. (I know he could probably get a picture from other girls, he's had exes offering to take pictures for him.) He'll say things like he misses me, and may still have feelings for me, but then in the next hour he'll text me and tell me he doesn't really have feelings for me. All of these things confuse me, and I am ashamed to say that the last time I did something like this for him, he went back on everything he said and stopped talking to me. This was also after we broke up. So I'm being cautious now, and I still want him back, but I don't know what to do anymore. Part of me thinks he still has feelings for me, but the other part strongly believes that he just thinks I'm hot or pretty or whatever it is. I asked him what a picture/video has anything to do with his decision about choosing to be friends with me, and he's answered that he just wants me to accept him the way he is, pervert and all. So a few days ago, after I again refused to send him anything, he blocked me on AIM and deleted me off facebook. I don't know if that's because he's afraid he has feelings for me and wants to stop all contact, or what. A lot of my friends say that, and that he's being an ******** :P. I am really lost about what is going on and any light that can be shed on this situation would be appreciated.      P.S. I know that he wouldn't distribute these to other people. He's not that type of person, and I can promise that. If he wanted to do so, he would have already done so previously.

20081121104809AAMIHec	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife Unfaithful - What Should I do? (Adult Content)?	I just recently found out that 20 years ago my wife cheated on me when she was six weeks pregnant with our daughter.      I suspect that there may be others, and I have discovered a few times that she has placed personal ads online in the last few years. The ads are very graphic, contain a nude photo of her, and are directed to men looking for "no strings" sex and even mention that she's open to anal intercourse.      One time about a year ago she came home from work and went straight to the shower. She's done this occasionally from time to time.   This time, however, I found her panties laying next to the bed with what appeared to be a puddle of semen in the center. I never confronted her about it, probably because I didn't want to confirm what I had found and already knew.      The thing is she is a loving mom, and all in all a good wife. She's now in her mid 40's, and certainly does not look like the wild type. Plus, she holds an executive position at a financial institution.      However, even though she gets off at 5 and it's a 10 minute drive home, she's almost never home before 6. Sometimes as late as 6:30 or 7. She just says she's overwhelmed in the office with her workload and that's why she's late.       For the past several years my emotions have been on a roller coaster over this. For a while I figured she was probably cheating. But I assumed that if she were at the very least she would be practicing safe sex, making sure the guy wore a condom and all. But the semen in the panties pretty much killed that thought.      I'm just not sure what to do. One side of me says that if this is what she needs to be happy, I should let her have it. The other side says that it's not right and I should feel humiliated that I can't keep my wife satisfied in the bedroom.      Anyone out there in a similar situation and if so, how did you/are you handling it?               
20090106092158AARtZWP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i tell him to leave me alone?	This guy has gotten very attached to me lately all the time.

The only reason i don't work is because i have Major Depression and my DR said that there is no way i could work but anyways he told me that it didn't bother him if i can't work now i am thinking it does.

20090309224433AAkt5yz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk and not payin attention to women getting their butts beat to death? I dont care, they are the ones choosing these losers so they get with they deserve. Thats how i feel about it..
20081218203012AAeVOc4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I feel the only way for him to love me is..?	if we have sex? I feel as though my boyfriend only shows me affection if we're having sex. And i really love him but I just don't feel the love back. and when he tells me he loves me i don't believe it. the only way i feel he truly cares for me is if we're having sex. is this relationship worth keeping or not? we argue like any couple does but it's like not much really happens with us. we talk and see each other but i still don't feel the love. and he just told me he wants to stop having sex so now i feel as though i won't be getting any affection.

He's a really nice guy, he has a good head on his shoulders, and he's not bad looking, so I've decided to give him a chance.       The problem is that I'm just not into him. He doesn't make me laugh or smile. I find myself trying really hard and there are so many awkward moments and silences. I think he might be a little nervous but we've gone out a few times and the dates just seem to go on forever.       Should I just keep going out with him? Maybe there'll be a spark somewhere down the road? Or should I call it quits or start avoiding him? Idk... what do you think?

20090106054224AAc63Sy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex has come back into my life. What do I do?	I was in a relationship in 2007-2008 for almost a year. Things were perfect in the beginning. We fell in love pretty quickly. Then of course like any relationship we started to bicker about little things. Then later on the bickering turned into screaming and crying matches. Yet we still loved each other very much so. All his life he has lived with bi-polar disorder. The fighting got so bad, because of his disorder that we eventually broke things off and he ended up in the hospital. It's been 6 months now, and he has come back into my life. I still love him very much. That has never changed. He still loves me too. Do you think we could ever have a relationship again? Is it possible to start all over with the same person? The hard part is that we have both forgiven each other for the fights, but there's no way to forget. How do we make it work?

20081117155248AAYYySe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do, I am so confused?	I'm 16.  I started having feelings for my friend. But he liked someone else, then he stopped liking her so I tried to get closer to him.  We have been talking alot more.  But today, when HE was around, my friend told me our other guy friend likes me.  He's nice and everything but I don't think of him that way, he's just a friend.  But since the guy i actually like heard this its really awkward.        I don't know if he knows I don't like our friend because he left right when my friend started telling me about it.      I can't just go up to the guy i like and say I dont like our friend.  And now I feel really bad trying to flirt with the guy I really like when the guy that likes me is around, which is all the time since we are ALL friends.      I am sooooo confused. Any help would be great :)

When people are single they tend to consider that something must be wrong with them since they can't get a partner. I am a 20 year old guy who has never been in a relationship what-so-ever. It is really starting to bother me even when I try to be as patient as possible. I can approach girls easily and have success with numbers but it just seems so hard to find someone.

20090309221920AAUj7ok	Family & Relationships;Weddings	MIL to be called to yell at me for not being able to afford attendance at a wedding!?	My MIL to be called today to basicly yell at me for me and my fiancee not being able to afford to fly to the East coast to attend a distant family members wedding.  The wedding is in VT and we are in CA.  The cost just for airfare and hotel accomodations is over $1500 alone!  This is not including taking time off work, gift, food and other things while we are there.  She told us we were not acting like family.  My fiancee has not seen this cousin in over 5 years and has not even spoken to him in 4!  I feel that the only reason we even got an invite is because the bride and groom felt obligated because their parents forced them to.  FIne and dandy, but we cannot afford to go.  Our own wedding is a month later and she is telling us we are horrible a month before our own wedding we are not willing to spend $1500-2000!  I am so upset.  She has not offered a dime to help us with our wedding, but did not even wink on flying out to this one and is planning on staying out there a week.  She too has not seen this person in years and has never even met his bride.  I feel she is just trying to go out there to put on a show (if you knew her, you would understand).  Should I tell her she is out of line for her repremand or just ignore her.  I think if this was even in our budget (wich it is not!) that we would still not attend.  In my fiancees own words...."I do not even know them and neither does she!).  What do you think I should do about this?

20090309224313AA3SxXG	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Where can I go to get married?	I am 17 and my boyfriend is 21 and we have been together for a really long time now, we have not been intimate yet due to our age difference but would like to further our relationship. Can I get married in Nevada?
20090309224414AARwb2v	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it irrational to be thinking marriage?	I am in my mid thirties, had a "first boyfriend" marriage at 20 that lasted a year or so.  We were both way too young to manage the issues that came up in the relationship (he had a porn addiction and was neglectful at times, and I had never dated anyone else and ended up feeling trapped).  I did not marry again until I was 30, and that was in large part motivated by having an unplanned pregnancy, and me wanting to give us the best shot at being a whole family.  I found out after the marriage that my (now ex) husband had been abused as a child and this was causing us severe intimacy problems.  He was an alcoholic and I later found out, had a secret double life of cheating and drug use, etc through our whole relationship.        In both cases I was the one to leave the marriages, but felt I had little choice, especially the second one.      I have been on my own as a single mom for a little while.  I don't "love" being alone, but I have been comfortable with it and stayed busy with work, my son, and friends.      Suddenly, 4 months ago I received an email from the man I always believed was the love of my life.  We'd had no contact for 10 years through a complex set of circumstances, but he found me again.  We talked online for 3 months until he returned here from the other country he has been living in all this time.      He has been here less than a month and I can hardly believe that my feelings are all still there and growing.  He is kind, trustworthy so far, consistent and incredibly considerate.  He says he is here to stay, to be with me, and wants to marry.  I am attempting to stay independent and have not integrated him into my 5 year old child's life yet.  He says he has loved me for a decade and wants to marry me, but respects waiting, as I told him I could not marry anyone I have dated less than a year.  But as time goes on I feel a little stuck in the rational and playing by some arbitrary set of rules.  He isn't exactly a stranger, and we have spent time getting to know each again other via phone and messaging prior to his arrival in the flesh.      Have we spent enough time apart already?  Or do I wait an arbitrary amount of time given my track record?  I have been in therapy for a year and a half sorting through all my emotions about my divorce and doing a lot of self reflection, and I do feel as if this man is truly the one, as I did all those years ago.      I really figured I was done and would never marry again, but this man is making me reconsider my thinking.      Am I making sense?  I want to be sure I make wise choices for myself as well as my son.  Thank you.
20090309224815AAEgMNk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get a girl to like me, that likes another guy?	There is this girl in my class who I really like, I know she likes this other guy, but she's been dropping hints that she likes me as well... She is quite reserved on emotional things like this, but she seems to trust me because she told me she like this other guy (that doesn't like her). I told her, in person, that I loved her and she said it was the sweetest thing ever said to her... and i know she wouldn't lie about that... so i need to know how to get her to like me instead of that other guy...
20090507112940AAsHDd4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many people are sick of reading high school kids questions talking about "love"?	I mean... Seriously, it's always stuff like, "We've been dating two months and he loves me and I love him," or, "We broke up after a month but I still love him so much!"      I know like most of you that have actually graduated high school, gotten jobs, apartments, and lives/relationships out in the real world, that high-school romance is just a bunch of drama and crushes... How many of you people out there are sick of hearing it too?      (If you're just some 15 year old girl who wants to try and change my mind, please don't answer... Despite what you may think you "know" at this point, experience is STILL the best knowledge.)

20060627233603AAWcgyj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the easiest way to tell a sensitive boyfriend he's been letting himself go and needs to lose weight?	My best friend asked my advice on this tonight. She and her bf have been together for a year and a half... just recently (a few months ago) started having sex, and love eachother dearly... but he has been putting on weight lately. Add to that he's super-sensitive and insecure about himself, physically (it doesn't help that she's gorgeous and has the metabolism of a chain-smoking junk head) and will almost definitely be hurt about this.      What's the easiest way for her to tell him she's been losing interest ever since he began gaining pounds? And how can she help him get back in shape without further crushing his ego?

Here is my problem, I am 20 years old living in ohio, and been with this girl who loves me more than the world for a year and a half, and dont get me wrong i love her too but think were both too young to be saying that we should get married. we were  living together for a few months before i needed "my space", and broke up with for like a week, now were on the same path again of her calling me literally every 10 minutes, texting me, and just being ridiculous with it. i like the attention but sometimes it can be overbearing.   anyways my father wants me to move to arizona with him and go to college out there,i told my 18 year old girlfriend that and she went crazy. i dont want to live my life with regret, in her defense there are plenty of colleges in ohio that i could go to so everyone i asked told me to move out there, but i dont want to lose her, im scared that i will never find another love like hers again. so how do i weigh love against college and this once in a lifetime experience

I know all teenagers go thru stages but I really think we may have some issues here.  We have had full custody of him since he was 11.  He is so angry all the time.  He stays locked up in his room.

Well im deciding to stop sending her letters and actually say hi to her. But i wont mention that i was her secret admirer. I just want to say hi to her, not to try to start anything, just to say hi. The thing is i dont know how to say it. She's  popular and she's white and one of her friends said that she could be mean at times. Im black. If i said Hi or Hello, i feel it would come off as cheesy. If i said Hey, she probably think i was asking her for something. If i said wassup i would probably come off too strong, seeing that i dont really know her. We only talked once when she asked me if i was new to the school (since I just started at this school a month ago). And i dont want to just wave because she may not see it or she may think its someone else. So what do you think i should do. And I dont want to ask for a pencil or ask for help with homework or nothing like that.       Anyways what do you guys think i should do

A is the most fun, Sweetest, Happiest, Most positive girl to be around and I love being with her, Theres never a dull moment. But when I'm with B, Sometimes she goes quiet or just doesn't seem too enthusiastic. B's mom rarely lets her out of the house even if we invite her to stuff. So this is why A and I always hang out. But whenever we do and B finds out, She'll post bulletins saying how she doesn't have best friends anymore and such, But we can't help that her mom doesn't let her out! Another example: Last year I took B to Disneyland, But this year I'm taking A. And when she found out she got all angry and jealous. She can't really say anything because I took her last right? I really need help, I can't deal with this jealousy anymore.

20070708160154AAn3ak0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell, or find out, if he is seeing someone else?	I just started seeing this guy, for a few weeks now (seen each other 4 times).  There has been a few times where he wanted to get together, and then calls or leaves a message to reschedule.  There was also a couple times where he left a message, with things not planned, saying we'd talk soon, he's not feeling well.  I don't know if he just wants time to himself, for I feel I may be being a little clingy; I do call or message every to every other day.  Or if he is saying this ahead of time for he doesn't want me to come down unexpectedly and catch him in the act of something.  How do I find this out (if there is someone else)?  What should I do?  Do I bring it to his attention and straight out ask him (it's probably not likely he'd tell me, if he is, for he would figure I probably wouldn't see him anymore), or do I just accuse him (even though I don't know the real truth), for then he might admit it (if he actually is), for he feels I already know and it could get him in bigger trouble?

Even thou there was a age diffrence we got along VERY great. She left her family too come live with me, we lived together over a month. Wednesday her mamaw went into the hospital and she stayed at the hospital with her family that night. Thursday she came here with her dad too get her things. She would not even look me in the eye, would not even talk too me and tell me why. They then had me arrested on a unpaid traffick ticket that I had a warrant for. I was in jail until Friday. I was VERY good too her, EVERY day I would make sure too tell her I loved her and probably did 15 times a day. Just wednesday when I let her out at the hospital she hugged me tight and said she loved me until the end of time and couldnt wait too start a new job that we had been planning. We had even gone too take our drug tests.We both already had jobs but this was a better one and could work together. Now I talk too her online but she only talks about general things, never "us"

J'ai cru qu'elle était trisomique. Elle me raconte qu'elle a été guérrie par un saint et que puisqu'elle avait passé plusieurs années dans les hopitaux elle n'a pas beaucoup d'amis.   Je lui ai répondu que je n'ai pas d'inconvénient d'être son ami sauf que je monterais à la campagne la semaine prochaine, et que je ne pourrais la voir que lorsque je viendrais à la messe.   Mais je me sens mal. Je sens que je ne peux pas être son ami. Ca me ferait mal et ?a la blesserait. Je sens que je l'ai rendu heureuse mais je ne peux pas assumer cette amitié. Je me sens mal.

Things like that. The only time he gets irritated with me is if I get moody and I startt to nag or get emotional. I only get like this in response to him being so callous with  me!

Em nenhum momento ele tentou pegar em minhas partes íntimas, mas me deitou no sofa, e deitou entre minhas pernas, se esfregando em mim, e ficava me acariciando as costas, barriga e pernas, mas acariciando de forma intensa, apertando. Algumas vezes ele me puxou para o colo dele e etc e tal. Estou confusa. Apesar de ele nao ter tentado tranzar, acredito que ele ficou sarrando em mim, será que ele n?o foi mais longe por medo de tomar um n?o, ou por n?o ter interesse? Ou será que tudo n?o passou de um teste?

20061106190720AAYFo0B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok for a guy in a serious relationship to go out and not come home because he is drunk?	Ok. I know it sounds a bit silly. We've been dating for a little while and its only been serious for about a month. Last week he went on a "date" to a wedding that was pre-arranged before us. I understood that, no biggie. At the end of the night he said he'd give me a call and say goodnight. That didn't happen. I was a little annoyed because I'm sick of dating guys that say they're going to do something and then don't. Last night he was supposed to come over after hanging out with his friends for a bit since his kids were at their mom's for the night. Well, he got to drunk again and I ended up worried again that something happened. Then, he text my cell phone at 3:30AM ( bars close here at 2AM)  and says he's going home with his friend Will cause he's to drunk to drive.  I'm grateful that he knows when NOT to drive. But, when it's really irritating when "a couple of beers" turns in "I'm wasted".  Especially when we had plans. Does this count as being stood up?

We both have joint custody of our child and he has visitation every other weekend.  I fear for my child's safety when she is with him.  She is only six years old and of course does not realize what is going on around her but she has told me that her dad has woken her up in the middle of the night to go to someones house and so on and so forth.      I have no proof of him doing anything, but from his actions and what I've been told, things are not good.      He makes promises all the time to her and doesn't follow through.  He says he will come and see her and doesn't.  Sometimes he won't even return her phone calls.  I feel so bad for my child..  She loves her father very much and of course he has no fault in her eyes.      I don't have the money for an attorney to take him back to court to seek soul custody, plus I have no proof of his illegal behavior.  I am also not receiving child support.      Help!

20070319012714AAzDULX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I get His Attention?	I'm a really straight forward kind of girl, but I've been working on this group project, and I am starting to like one of the guys in the group. I've never had a problem flirting except when I had to work w/ the person. The only time I see him is during class & when we work on the project (which ends tomorrow) but there were always other people around, & I've been trying to keep it professional.   I've caught him staring at me a few times, & he smiles at me a lot. I know that sounds stupid/silly, but I caught him looking at me a LOT. I don't know if he's just being friendly, or he's actually interested. I always made sure to clearly smile back, but w/ a friendly neutral smile since I don't know if he likes me.   After the project I won't have a reason to talk to him again, at ALL. I have a few months before the end of the semester. I sit next to him. I know he's single. What can I do to let him know I am interested? Should I let him know? IS he interested in me? How can I tell he likes me?
20070319231955AAYULqE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should she have a second thought?	my sister have been sharing me her problem but i havent answer her, well, i hope you guys can share your opinion on this situation. she have a very long term relationship with her boyfriend (almost 10 yrs ) .This couple have a strong chemistry and planning to get marry this year. Lately, she  contacted with this nice guy and found that it is a very interesting to know a new person-what he likes, and he doesnt, kinda new things everyday, well its a very nice feeling. my sister claim that theres almost no spark in her relationship with her beau, maybe becaouse of the so long term relationship. But her boyfriend have show her loyalty and trustworthiness during this relationship. my question, should she have a second thought on this? because to start a new relationship is about taking risk and we might not know what will happen.I hope the Cupid's arrow will take the right place.

20070405084927AAjlEDK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just an insecure guy?	Hello, I'm a very bright, mature and articulate guy, but I have a problem. I've been with my current gf for about 6 months. I really care about her. I've sent her flowers to her job more than once, I surprise her all the time with gifts. We talk, laugh , have unbelievable sex, and get along most of the time. Her family love me and I love them too. Me and her sisters are great friends too. Ok..getting to the point. She has a past. She's been with more guys than I have women. She is all about myspace, contacting people all the time. Nothing wrong with that, but her ex-boyfriend is one of her " friends" on there. So he can see every detail of her life that she puts on there, including our outings.  Isn't that weird? I don't like her ex being able to know so much about "our" life. And I also made her drop an ex-lover as a friend because my intuition was bad about him. I'm typically a very open, trusting person, hell...I talk to my ex once every few months. Should I worry about it?

20070410100852AAjrd6W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love her but....?	My GF has been so supportive of me & I keep messing up.  It's been 10 mos. I keep cheating on her because women keep calling my phone & I'm finding it hard to tell them no.  She's been there 4 me, she does my laundry, she let's me come to her house to shower because my water is off & she cooks 4 me.  I keep trying to leave although I really don't want 2 & she begs me to stay.  She said that we can work through these things together & that we'll grow together and we'll get through this.  I know that eventually I do but I know I keep hurting her but she doesn't want me to go.  I know if I really wanted 2 go that there's nothing she could do or say to make me stay that's y I stay when she begs because I don't want 2 let go of such a good thing.  Last night we cried together because I wanted to leave when I called her & she didn't answer her phone I thought maybe she was with another guy & I can't handle that.  Although, I know I talk to other women.

20070515150842AADvOBR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Threesome with my wife and another woman?	We're a happily married couple of many years and we have a heathly relationship in every sense.  A few years back we clicked with a female at a bar and by chance spent the night with her at a hotel.  It was great, my wife discovered she was bisexual and I got to experience what I had always dreamed of but never had the guts to approach.  After plenty of discussion and some basic ground rules to work with we have had two more threesomes and they were even better.  However I now feel that my wife is leaning towards seeking out a relationship with a female her type and with me instead.  After having considered it , I feel that I do too.  Has anyone had experience with this?  Any suggestions?

20070520153529AAHFmbx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, have you ever had a new date pry into your personal life & for what?  How did you tell him off?	What did you do to let a man know that it's not okay to get into your personal life and how did he react.  It seems every 5 years men pick a new trait to tick women off.  Five years ago it was control, 5 years from now it will be bisexuality, but for now it's nosiness.  My story is this guy asked me 4 times in a row what I did for a living, but when I asked him, he said "oh come on now, how are you going to do that to me?"  Whatever that meant.  So when he reluctantly answered they VERY question HE had posed (hint hint, he knows he's in the wrong), I finally answered him, but added, "why is it so important that you know this and where my income comes from."  Then I never spoke to him again and brushed by him with another man the next time I saw him.  As Carrie Underwood says, maybe he learned and next time he won't be so rude.

20070611153321AASLdj7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm majorly attracted to my best guy friend...what do I do?	I've known my best guy friend since 8th grade (i'm now in 12th).  He was head-over-heels for me back in freshman and sophomore year, and I REALLY liked him.  We briefly "dated," but it didn't work out too well because I was so jumpy around him (wouldn't even hold hands with him, didn't go on an actual dates, etc.) and we were both immature. However, we've been super-good friends ever since.  But I've never gotten completely over him- the attraction/fancying has always remained.  And I know he's still very much attracted/likes me. If we both don't want a serious relationship (for our own reasons), is it wrong to be "friends with benefits" of sorts this summer, as in, flirting, hanging out together, movies, perhaps even a bit of kissing, etc.?  I know "FWB" normally has a negative conotation, but I am not talking about the typical definition of "hooking up" and stuff..... just a little bit of PG-rated fooling around?  Any help would be greatly appreciated    :-)

We recently graduated from highschool and I read my yearbook and on there he wrote " to bad nothing happened between us you know you love me" and he will occasionally call me and ask me if I miss him or ask me why I don't call him anymore but our conversations on the phone are really short and I dont know if he really likes me or he is just messing around since he was voted school clown.  so here are my questions do you think he likes me? and How can I ask him if he wants to go to the movies with me and a couple of friends and their boyfriends without making it seem desperate or slutty. What do you think? If you were in this situation how would you approach it? please help.      Remember he was voted class clown by the entire school and he always jokes around. I have known him for two years now.

His friends always give him a nudge when they see me, i have no idea whether that's good or bad though?

I am pregnant and my due date is 6 weeks before the wedding.  She also does not live local but several states away and I would have to fly.  Besides the issue of having no idea what size I will be I would not bring my baby on the plane and would have to leave the baby home.  I am concerned about not wanting to leave the baby and if this will screw up the breastfeeding.  If I am in the wedding I would have to leave for a couple days if I try to go but not be in the wedding I would fly there that day and come home the next day.  Mothers, would you agree to be in the wedding?  Would you not be in it and try to go?  Anybody who wouldn't go and why?  Please don't give me a lecture about nursing, thanks.

My roommate always has guys telling her she is pretty and hot, and all these things when she really is not. The thing that bothers me is that she rubs in it in my face. She always tells me when a guy says hi to her or when a guy says she is pretty. I never have guys telling me I am pretty and I am always trying to look good and  other people always tell me I look pretty, just not to that extent. I suffer from bad self esteem issues, and her stories about other guys just ruin it even more. I never feel good about myself here, and I always wonder what is wrong with me? Why am I never good enough? She makes me feel so ugly. I wish it wasn't like that but it is the truth. How can I get over this?

These dreams that I am playing with our kids in our backyard and I am really happy. My wife and I recently celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary and maybe that has something to do with it. I did not want kids because I thought I would not make a good dad. Has anyone else ever changed their mind about having children? And should I tell my wife about these dreams?

20070825114603AAQwK6H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i turn the tables for revenge?	ive liked this girl for a year (notice liked is in the past tense) and then i guess she kept me around because she was fliting with the idea of us being together but never really put any effort into it while i was doing all the work. so i asked her out one day and she rejected me. and i did all the wrong things that would push her away even more like beg and get angry. that all happened about a month or two ago and now i see how i was wrong with it all and i can understand why she didnt feel any attraction to me.  i want her to know that she was wrong in some aspects because i have appaeared to absolve her of all her wrongdoings. i also want her to see that ive changed and i want her to start liking me (kinda out of revenge) i dont plan on liking her again but i want her to like me and know that she cant have me even if she wanted to anymore. do you think theres a chance that she could start liking me again and how would i do that after she already thinks she can have her way with me

Or I am a lesbian but still don't know it :)(this one is highly unlikely by the way :).

20080326085354AAQBvkH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know???  Thank you!?	My ex broke up with me by saying that he had definite feelings for me, but that he can't be in a relationship right now because of the pressures of schoolwork in college and football and he doesn't know when he's going to be able to.  I asked him about if we had a future and he said that he doesn't know.     We never had a falling out.  Why would he break up with me but tell me that he still really likes me?  He's said it more than once... he doesn't want me to wait for him though.  How do I know if it is over forever in his mind??
20081002130742AAZEuoI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Picking on stupid thigs?	Long story short...   My partner has been picking on little things I have "done wrong" for a while now. For example, I may forget to turn sky off on the actual unit at night (I turn the TV off but forget the sky sometimes), or put something in another place or forget to put a cd back in the rack before getting another one to play, or if I can't get around to washing up (we have a 15 month old), or if the hallway gets a little cluttered, unimportant things like this.   I have let it go for a while because he has been doing lots of overtime at work because we're short on cash so I know he's tired.  He doesn't like who he works with either which makes it harder on him. I appreciate him for this which is why i have not said anything about the nit-picking.   Tonight he came home and said, "i'm not having a go, i'm only gonna say this one, you want us to save money but you left the sky on upstairs". This pi%%ed me off. I gave him his dinner (which was curry) and he said "is this a sprout i see in my curry?" I said, well if you don't like it I don't care! He got up and said don't speak to me and stormed upstairs! It's been a few hours and he hasn't come down.  The sprout was left overs in case you were wondering lol and he likes then anyway!  He never makes comments about the good things I do, only the negative things.       I never complain about him leaving clothes on the floor or any other habits like that because to me it's no big issue.    Is there any way I can sort this out without having to say it's my fault and letting him think he's right to pick at me?   Thanks
20090309222918AAs1ycl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband's son is making me sick?	My stepson is driving me crazy   My husband got custody of his 13 yr old son (mother is on drugs) 5 yrs ago. I met my husband 2 yrs ago and now they live with me. His son is always lying and telling people that my husband kidnapped him from his mother. He hates living with us and wants to go back with his mother. He hates me and always treats me like crap. He is now telling people that I treat him like a slave (because he has to do chores) and tells people that his dad is a drunk just because his dad likes to have a couple of beers after work. He is saying these things because he wants to go back with his mom. I have this kid going to see a shrink , and the shrink thinks he is crazy and wants to put him on pills but my husband doesn't want to. My husband has him so spoiled , even after all the mean things he has said. My husband never tells him anything, and lets him get away with everything. I tied to be friends with this kid but he hates me. What can I do to make this kid stop saying all those lies? how can I get my husband to see the truth? I have told my husband that I want a divorce because I can't take it anymore.

20090309222758AASd4if	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you like to hang out with girls or boys, why, and tell me your gender?	I will start with myself.   I am a girl and I like hanging out with guys more than girls because girls are....annoying for the most part. They laugh at the most ridiculous story and are always looking for an agreement to their opinion, and doesn't like it when others disagree. Girls also tend to talk behind people's back and they are always in a group, as if they can't function without herd.   On the other hand, guys tend to be more straightforward with their thoughts and more honest. Guys tend to be less offended than girls too.   I know that not all females and males are like this, and I don't want to discriminate, but this is what females and males in my school tends to be.

20090309174046AAPx7JI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need some advice on how to deal with this.?	I don't know what to do,think,act. I think I have done something wrong but I don't know. See I'll take you back to earlier this afternoon.    I was pondering about why I left my moms house in December and moved in with me dad.   I lived with my mom for 16 years of my life until I finally woke up and see everything people were talking about, 5 years ago my mother married a man named Jake. him, my mom, me and my two little sisters ,(jakes 2 kids dont live with us) moved into this regaular home except for it had a little hint of smell, but we could get rid of that. 3years later the house is a mess smells, trash everywhere, deag crap smell on all the floors, and thats when jakes daughter moved in with us. I tryed my best to keep the house clean, and so did my little sisters, but it was like a mess that just kept coming back. In November I decided I had enough of the yelling and filth, that I left and moved in with my father and step mom. It was the middle of febuary , i went to spend a weekend with my mom and stepdad and the girls (my 2 little sisters+ chads daughter) it was ok the house reeked of poo and pee and trash was everywhere, the next morning i went to the kitchen for the first time sice i had been there that weekend and i walked in the a HUGE trash dump, it had trash everywhere, pans with molding food. and the smell in the kitchen alone was disgusting. I couldnt stay there till sunday so i earlie afternoon. and my step dad had to drive me home and i told hiom why i left and he only  said that the house was fine and there was nothing wrong with it. It's March now, and the rest of the family is waiting for eachother to call children services,but everyone was scared to. Until today, I pondered it for 3 days and i hesitated everytime i dialed the number, but then i though of my two little sisters and their pretty faces and what they would have to go through everyday, with that trash and smell getting on their clothes. So I called the children services and reported it, i didnt tell them i was 17 i only told them of everything that had gone on in that house and that i had lived there at one time. Yeah the ladie asked why i waited so long and the only thing i could say was "I was scared."   And now i regret calling children services on my own mother.   It's 8:35PM  and I'm regretting what I have done. Should I feel this way? did I do the right thing? did i betray my mother by doing this? have i saved my sisters the misery that would come to them in the future?
20090309224844AA3xxd8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Like this guy names NATHAN?	He's in a rock band and i love him very much. I think i saw him checking me out when i freshened up after spending the night with the band, innocently. However, he was with his good friend and troy, as i'll call him, thinks the rock star life is about getting laid and wasted. I've known the band for a while now. They would not approve of that at all. what should i do?

20090309114150AAqJk9p	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do I handle my sisters not wanting to come to my ceremony?	Normally  I would just say whatever when my sisters dont want to come to something I am planning, but now this is my wedding.  All of my family should be there.  My fiance's family is driving from NE to MD for the weekend.  Why cant my family make little sacrifices?  My little sister and older sister dont plan on attending my ceremony but plan on coming to the reception to "party"  My oldest sister has already requested off for her vacations and cant make it to the ceremony due to work, but also plans on attending the reception.  My wedding isnt til June 20th.  Shouldnt they almost feel obligated not just for me, but for our sick mother who has a hard time getting our family together?

20080210184729AA9nBjM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	TO THE MEN: please help me understand why my partner needs to look at porn?	My partner and I have a good sex life. We love each other and we have a good life together however my partner looks at porn although it hurts my feelings. I have tried to compromise by asking that he does it once a week when my daughter and I sleep at my sisters house but that is not enough for him. I found very very foul dirty magizines under the car seat when I was cleaning. He sometimes stays up late to watch the sex line ads on t.v but says he was watching the infomercials. Lies! He looks at internet porn the minute i go to bed and he downloads porn to his mobile. I tried to watch some with him because I thought it could help me not dislike it as much but I dont like to touch him after seeing it let alone have sex with him. Why does he need that when I am here? Why am I not enough? Why does he do it when it breaks my heart?

20080305144515AArCgGk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys really like girls who make the first move?	I was just wondering...Because this guy I like doesn't seem to be real forward as far as conversation goes. I asked him out to eat, we had a good time, a week later he asked me out to tennis, another good time, AND I was just wondering if this is like tennis with a ball bouncing back and forth, so maybe it's my turn to ask...?   Also, he asked for my number the first day and I've called him maybe four times and he's called me maybe two, so I just need to know if I should call him or TEXT him even when he doesn't call or text me.  (Plus, the times he called were in response to the calls he missed from me)      Basically, I want to know if I need to make the first moves, or if it will just be annoying him.

20080501091313AA5Ev6u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong for being upset with my boyfriend?	My boyfriend currently lives in my house and does not work.  I am pregnant and work 40 hrs. per week to support our household.  He is on the computer 6-7 hours per day and does not do much to help around the house.  I had suspicions that things weren't right and installed a spyware program on my computer.  I found out that he was talking online in different chat rooms, viewing all kinds of porn, and was on the personal ads.  He shared naked pictures of himself online on one site and viewed many pictures of other women.  When I found out, he claimed that he had a problem and needed help and he didn't want to lose me.   He has constantly lied to me about what he does during the day.  I will ask him to do something for me and come home and it is still not done because he has spent all day on the computer looking at porn and other things.  He now claims that he isn't doing anything wrong.  So am I wrong to think that this is inappropriate?

There is no return address and they are not signed. I have been married for 16 years and have no idea who is sending me the cards.I get a new card at least once a week and with each card they have gotten a little more personal. The last episode happened last Tuesday when a person drove by and called my wife a whore and sped off and 2 days later I received a new card explaining how she drove by and called my wife a whore and how much better I could do like with her. She further explained that she had finally told her husband about us and now it was my turn. She told me she was looking for our new house and how many bedrooms I would want for my children. The only clue we have is she calls me Chuck and that is the name I used in school and I graduated in 1984. What if any steps could I use to find out who this is before something happens that we do not want.
20080620111726AAgSj91	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help, is it my looks that are the problem?	Ok all my friends say I can get girls and that I should but every time I try it seems like no one is ever interested. I feel like I'm a really nice guy and treat everyone with respect and I'm pretty fun to be around. And I know girls always say it's not just about looks but I know I have a decent personality because I have a lot of friends, both girls and guys. I'm just getting worried because I've never even had a girlfriend and I'm already 19 years old. I am pretty shy but it feels like I don't get the chance because girls either choose my friends over me or I just never get any attention anyway.

I know its not what I'm looking for and the latest has been quite a treat.  A very attractive 21 year old that has pursued me relentlessly and I fell for her drama.  Basically, in the time of courting, she has been knocked up by her ex loser and she has no real sense of responsibility as she comes from money and aside from looks is a complete idiot.  I should really know better and think that I've only hung in as a type of diversion from my own responsibilities.  I'm seeking advice as I really know I need to just forget this drama case as theres no really point to this in the long run.... thanks

So there's this black, "thuggish", "gangster-ish", football player that likes me.       I'm a white, "gothic/emo/grunge/whatever" girl.       I only hang out with my "clique" and he only hangs out with his.      And It's not like I'm racist or anything.

20090110003303AAtoTeZ	Family & Relationships;Family	How to Deal With Strict Parents?	My 'rents are really really strict. I asked my dad at around 9:00pm-ish if I could go to a party. He said that I could if I came home at 11-ish. Well in-between 10:45 and 11:00 my best friend's girlfriend broke up with him and he needed someone to talk about it to, So I helped him out by talking to him about it, I got home at about 11:30-ish because of it and I'm grounded for "a long time" whatever "a long time" means. I explained to my 'rents the situation but they just replied with "Well, that's the way it goes". Usually I would just take the grounding and be kinda ticked but go on with life, but recently I have been trying to get know this girl better and I will need to be able to do things after school and stuff to be able to hang out, etc. So any suggestions about my situation would be appreciated. Thanks!

He recently told me about these 2 children and I feel left out, especially since we've been trying to get pregnant without success.  Now that he's told me, he feels his conscience is clear, but now, I feel sad.  I feel he loves me and he's treated me well, but I'm hurt by this news.  I thought we would share raising a family together, he feels we can still do this and move forward, but I feel like he's got something that we should have had together and I'm not a part of it.

I told him how much it hurt my feelings personally -especially when I was right there for whatever he needed! In the past year he's gone from naked women, videos, and magazines to scantily clad women/sketches. I feel better, but not great. I'm trying to understand why he needs it so much, and we've both concluded he's addicted 7yrs. But he says he doesn't think it'll ever stop. He cares about me and I'm crazy about him; but I've read that addictions are not good to start a marriage on. What should I do? Accept it? What about our kids in 15yrs? He'll be a horrible example of porn-is-ok! His parents are divorced and his dad looks at the stuff too. Is there a way to become unaddicted? What should I do?

Since we are on a budget we are pretty much doing everything ourselves. As far as the photography we are having a friend take the pictures for us. I dont see the need to spend thousands of dollars on a photographer. Also we are having two or my fiances friends be our D.J.'s. I am just pretty much having them introduce our parents, the bridal party and then us. I also am having them say something a little bit before we cut the cake and do the special dancing. Does anybody think I should have them say anything else. Just making sure I'm not missing anything. Also what order do things normally get done at a wedding reception? The reception is from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. So I figured to introduce everybody would take about 15 to 20 minutes. Then I didnt know if we should eat. (buffet style). So I just need some ideas on the order we should do things. I dont want his two friends to have to do to much. Thank you to anybody for their good advice.

My girlfriend and I went out for about 2 months, and then she broke up with me. She still really wants to be friends with me, but I think I still like her beyond a friendship. One month after the breakup, we started rebuilding our relationship enough to just be friends again. I recently learned she has started to go out with another guy. I'm afraid to still hang out with her if I still like her the way I do, especially if she is going out with another guy now.I really still want to hang out with her, but I don't know what the best thing is for me to do. I'm 16, so this isn't an an adult relationship or anything.
20090309184019AA6NUDM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Have i got a big problem?	I'm currently with my fiance of 1yr + a half. He has a really good job working away abroad and i'm 8 months pregnant. But as "distance makes the heart grow fonder", when hes home, everything is perfect, he has an amazing personality. But then just one of those days he is back everything gets wrecked. He ends out getting invited out by his friends to go clubbing and doesn't want to lose them so he goes along. He really can't handle his drink, so when he comes home, he acts all cocky and totally different. I end up shouting at him as it angers me to see him like that. This brings out his "alter ego" and he starts calling me every name under the sun and saying really personal stuff. The next morning he has no recollection of the events and is devastated. He tries to stop drinking but can't, even though its only the one night out, but it always ends in us arguing. Is this alcoholism? have i got a big problem? What should i do? xx

20090309215518AAQLH3P	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Okay, so what's going on?	I've caught the guy I like looking at me during class and in the halls for a while now. My friends always say 'He was checking you out. He probably likes you' and I thought he did too. Over the weekend, there was a big party and this morning at school, everyone was talking about it. Someone asked him why he was flirting with some girl at the party. I didn't think of it much because I flirt with other guys, too. Then others agreed and were like 'you were with her all night. you were definately flirting with her; it was so obvious.'      Then my friend told me she talked to him about me. I asked what she said and she just asked him if he knew who I was. It took him a little over 10 minutes to finally respond 'oh, that one chick in one of my classes. she has those red shoes?'      Part of me feels incredibly stupid for thinking he might actually like me when he only knows me as the 'girl with red shoes'. The other part of me can't help but feel hopeful that he still might possibly like me; that he was just playing around when he took forever to remember who I was. But I know that's highly unlikely.      What do you think? Is it possible that he might like me? I make it pretty obvious I like him; always staring at him during class. Is he completely oblivious, or just not interested? Ugh, I'm so confused.

20090309220106AA3YyLH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need some Help with Ex-Girlfriend... Really Confused with her!!!?	Ok guys, I know this might be long but I'll try my best to get straight to the point.      I'll try to give out points whenever I can...      So basically my ex-girlfriend and I broke up 7 months ago. Along this time line I've tried my best to be her friend even when she fell for my best friend 2 months after our break-up and whom she had only known for a week at that time. She says that she's confused right now and she doesn't want to be in a relationship and that she has her issues to work out.      I'm still confused about how that all that all changed because last year (her freshman year) we would always be with each other like doing homework together and stuff like that. This year, she seems like she treats her friends better whom she just met this year even though we've dated for 2 out of the 4 years I've known her.      It's also weird because I always run down to campus for her whenever she's having a bad day and I still let her cry on my shoulder and I still even invite her out for dinner with me occasionally. We still take naps together in the same bed and just a few days ago she said that she wanted to live with me and have me be a part of her life. Whenever I try to have a serious conversation with her, one of her friends always knocks on her door and she always answers it which frustrates me and whenever she invites me over, one of her friends is already sitting in her room...What does this all mean and what should I do?      Also, it's been really bad for me to because we haven't had sex for 2 months now and I'm sexually tensed up but I don't want to do it with anyone else because I'm still in love with my ex. Every-time we get close to doing it, she's always stopped in the middle and I also get really frustrated over this.      She's really pretty and attractive also because every guy that becomes her friend always end up liking her more than just as a friend.      If someone could please analyze this advise me on what to do, I would be really grateful.      -Torn college student
20090309225310AALLEva	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this man traitor to his sex?	im aware of two married couples and both husbands are happily retired however both of them use their retierment differently. one husband basically lounges around all day now and fully believes the woman should do all the "women" jobs (cook clean groceries etc) sure he does man work but doesnt lift a finger to assist his wife. the other husband uses (and sees) his retirement as an oppurtinity to spend more time with his wife. he will literally do EVERYTHING for her and with her. basically he does/helps with everything a woman usually does. this man isnt whipped but he just devotes his time to assisting/doing his wife's "jobs" if you will. however, the "lounging" husband has mentioned a few times to the "helping husband" that he is a traitor to his sex, in other words he is a traitor to man because he helps his wife with the "women jobs". would you say he is traitor to his sex?

The guy,who is from Haiti, can't speak English well like me. He is so rude, but it is fine because I think that he just doesn't have a good English skills. He cheats in some exam but I don't care. It is good so far.   I'm about to fall in love with my class mate who is colombian lady. So, everyday I try to talk to her. The dude is kidding me like kid. I'm fine but I think she may not like that. I feel punching him many times, but I can't. I don't want to go jail something like that. And also, I don't want to have any problem with Haitian in my school because they are so kind and I have many Haitian friends. What should I do? I almost waste my patient.    In my country, we just fought each other who I and a guy who kidded me. Please, I need advice. thanks.

20090309222652AAlT6pG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Problem with a friend/co-worker?	I have this friend and co-worker who con stantly lies about everything. She makes up stupid things that I know aren't true (and everyone else knows it, too!) She also is very blunt to the point of being extremely hurtful to other people, while constantly talking about how great she is. She is so arrogant, which I know is just to cover up her own personal insecurities.  She happens to live with me too, so it's really wearing me down. I like her a lot but don't really know what I am supposed to do about the problem. Any advice is appreciated.
20090309212140AAn09b0	Family & Relationships;Friends	As a Christian are we allowed to mourn the loss of a friend who has moved away or not?	Serious question.  Before anyone wants to "stone" me as so often they do when I ask a question on this site. I ask this because the friend no longer speaks to me (neither of us did anything wrong).  New life, new family etc.  And I guess that would mean it is past and I should not look back.  But is it wrong to still mourn the loss?  I ask this in reference to Lot and his wife being turned to salt when she looked back.  It means she looked back at her old life?
20090309205800AAg2Bdo	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my mom too controlling? My parents are completely opposite and I'm going crazy!?	First off, I'm sorry it's long, but I really need help.   Okay, so long story short.  My parents got divorced when I was 12.  I'm 16 now.  My dad lives two hours away, and I drive to his house every other weekend with my 11 year old sister.   Mom = controlling, loud, tempermental, narcissistic, selfish,  disrespectful, impatient, aggressive, lazy, and completely un-compromising, revolves around money   Dad = laid-back, quiet, permissive, just wants me to have fun, not very talkative, funny, acts like a kid, never ever yells, basically the exact same personality as me.      So, I live with my mom, step-dad and sister.  My mother is trying to control my life, I swear.  She yells at me for the littlest things, and I'm always just like "Chill, it's not big deal."  And her response: "Don't you disrespect me like that!"  Really, Mom. Show me respect and you'll get it back.  Basically my theory is that if it's not hurting anyone in any way, then it's not something to get worked up over.     These are some of the things my mother does:   - She and my sister secretly gang up on me.  My mom tells my sister to tell her whenever I do anything wrong.  My sister only does it for my mom's approval.    - I'm not a bad kid.  I don't do drugs, smoke, or drink.  She constantly accuses me of being this horrible kid because I wear V-neck shirts and skinny jeans.   - She forgot to feed my cat when I was at my dad's house and my cat ran away. It's been three months, and I still have yet to find my cat.  And I loved that cat.  She refuses to admit she did that.   - She and my best's friends mom used to be best friends.  They got in a huge fight, and suddenly, I'm not allowed to hang out with my best friend anymore.  When I confronted her about this, she said that my friend is a "bad influence".  My friend doesn't do drugs, alcohol, or smokes.  (Oh, and they became friends again, and what does she do? Invites my friend to spend the night, after not coming over to my house for a year)   - I told her I wanted to live with my dad for next semester and she told me that if I moved out I wasn't coming back.   - I use to ride horses, but not anymore.  She made me quit.   - I play the drums. (I have an electric set) And I told her that I wanted to buy an acoustic set, and she said no, even though I said I would pay for the whole thing, and keep them in the garage.   - I only get to hang out with my friends for two weekends out of the month (because I'm at my dad's the rest of the weekends), and what does she make me do during those weekends?  She makes me babysit my little sister.  And the worst part - I don't get paid.   - She makes me earn my gas money, although the only places I ever go is to pick up my sister from daycare because my mother is too lazy to do it herself. (she doesn't have a job).  And I don't hang out with friends on weekdays.  I'm not allowed.   - She told me that if I ever dye my hair, I would be grounded for three months. Yet, she makes me get highlights in my hair. WTF.      These are some of the things my dad does:   - He loves for me to spend time with him, but he knows that I like to go out with my friends when I'm at his house, and he respects that by saying, "I just want you to have fun." And in turn, I limit my time with my friends so I can spend quality time with him, because I know he respects that.   - I put black raccoon stripes in my hair, and my dad's response was, "Why didn't you do green instead of black?" Haha, I love him.   - He gladly gives me money without complaining like my mother, and I only use the minimum ammount of money that I need to because he's so nice about it.   - He pays for my horses' board in the town that he lives in.     - He paid for my car (which was my step-brother's car, but he still had to pay full price)   - He pays child support every month (which is probably why my mom doesn't have a job.) Yet, he still gives me money when I come to his house.  (Keep in mind, he's a farmer, so not the richest person)      Anyway, can you see my dilemma?  What can I do about my crazy, psycho mother?  I've tried everything.  I've tried talking to her, but I don't talk to her anymore, because when I try, I end up getting yelled at.  I even wrote her a 5 page paper on how I felt.  She never changed.  Oh, and I've tried going to live with my dad, but my mom has full custody, and because she's not willing to compromise, it would cost a lot of money for my dad for me to move in with him.  And I'll be away at college in 2 years. (which my dad will probably have to pay for)      So can anyone please give me advice on how to deal with her?  I've thought about just doing whatever the hell I want, and completely ignoring what she says, because she can't physically force me to be grounded in my room.  But I have a feeling that would make things worse.   Another question, I'm just being whiney? Or are other people's parents like this too?  I understand that other people have it WAY worse than me, so please no crude comments.

20090309212137AAIXu8b	Family & Relationships;Family	Words of comfort, if you have any?	I really need to know!        I'm 29 and have never been married or engaged.  A series of things have happened in my life that make me believe that I'm not meant to have a boyfriend.  I've been let down by a series of people in the past and I don't want to let someone into my heart, only to have it broken again.      I'm different than most other people in one respect... I was born and raised in USA but I've always loved Latin stuff and I'm super attracted to latin guys.  Nothing wrong with white American guys... it's just that I have an affinity for latin culture.  I have loads of latin friends, and I am definitely not racist, but some things have happened that makes me think that relationships between latinos and north americans just don't work.  It kills me because I really LOVE Mexican guys, and my Mexican friends are sweet and loving but Im beginning to believe that relationships between people of different cultures are almost always doomed.        This sounds like I'm feeling sorry for myself but I just want the desire for a boyfriend to go away so that I can move on with my life and away from the void.  Just when I think it's gone, something always happens to fan the flame that I've been trying so hard to extinguish.      My best friend is from Acapulco and I always thought he'd be a wonderful boyfriend for me, but every time he gets a girlfriend it's always another girl from his own culture.  I've told him how I feel but he says that "people need to be with their own kind."  I'm not putting the other races or cultures down... I just have a sexual orientation and I can't change it.       I wish there were just some magic spell or wand that would make me Latin, but this isn't a Disney movie.       Ideally I would have someone I loved with my whole heart who would love me back, who would love me too much to ever hurt me, but I have gotten to the point where I just want to get over this desire once and for all.       If you can help me thanks in advance

20090309222142AA1i8a2	Family & Relationships;Family	My stepson is driving me crazy?	My husband got custody of his 13 yr old  son  (mother is on drugs)  5 yrs ago. I met my husband 2 yrs ago and now they live with me. His son is always lying and telling people that my husband kidnapped him from his mother. He hates living with us and wants to go back with his mother. He hates me and always treats me like crap. He is now telling people that I treat him like a slave (because he has to do chores) and tells people that his dad is a drunk just because his dad likes to have a couple of beers after work. He is saying these things because he wants to go back with his mom.  I have this kid going to see a shrink , and the shrink thinks he is crazy and wants to put him on pills but my husband doesn't want to. My husband has him so spoiled , even after all the mean things he has said. My husband never tells him anything, and lets him get away with everything.  I tied to be friends with this kid but he hates me. What can I do to make this kid stop saying all those lies? how can I get my husband to see the truth? I have told my husband that I want a divorce because I can't take it anymore.

So im guessing some of you people have heard "i think we should take a break", i was wondering if you have been in this situation before, and if so, what did u do to get your ex back after.      with my story, the girl called me yesterday morning, im 18, shes 16, she told me she wanted a break. I told her i honestly respected her decision, and she was still an amazing girl, and it made her cry. I remained calm, even though i was a bit sad on the inside, i told her i had to get ready for work, and as we said goodbye, she said "i still love you". So later on she texted me, and basically said, she missed me, (without me saying it to her lol) and that she wanted to see me soon. I asked when and she said she didnt know cause she was in trouble about her progress report, which may or may not be true lol, but so far, i do know that i still want to be with her, so if anyone could give me some tips on what i should do personally, anything you have to say is greatly appreciated =]      p.s. and i havent talked to her since she texted me last night, im really trying to let her be for a few days, is this a good thing? and if so when should i try to contact her?

20090309225448AAIktLm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I move back home.?	I have been seperated from my ex husband for almost a year. The divorce is almost final. He was cheating on me and chose the other woman. After I filed for divorce, I decided to move about 45 miles away and return to school. Things have been going really good in school but...I am still terribly hurt by my ex and his girlfriend. I have been offered a job back in the small town that I moved from. The pay is 4 times what I am making now and I can continue my education on top of it. It is a very tempting offer but I am worried if I move back, me and my children will just be hurt all over again. I have a bigger support group in my hometown and a lot more friends. I think about what happened all the time and I am worried if I move back I will just re-live the pain. My ex and his girlfriend like to rub things in my face and hurt me. Would it be a wise decision on my part or should I just stay here and struggle finacially.

20090309222002AAuMbyQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	An interesting friend question....?	I have a close friend living with me and my husband because she and her husband were fighting and she didn't want to be with him anymore.  Now, let me start from the beginning....      The first time she moved in with us was in August of 2008. She stayed with me for 3 days before going back home with her husband to try and work things out.  The second time she stayed with us was in October 2008.  That time, she stayed with us for about a month, before decided she wanted to try to work things out with her husband AGAIN.        Now she is staying with me again...she has been here for a little over a month now and has committed to staying with us until my apt lease is up in July.  About 2 weeks ago she started hanging out with her husband again and slowly but surely, shes now with him every night when he gets off of work. She has had him sleep over here at my place and I have heard them fooling around 3 times.        I know she said that this time was "different" and that she would stay until July but im not so sure.  It makes my blood boil when she brings him here for the night.  I hate it.        My question is...am I being ridiculous??  Should I not get mad that she is always either texting him, talking to him on the phone or going out with him a lot??

20090309213015AAxNcHT	Family & Relationships;Friends	GIRLS!! What Would You Want Your Friend To Do?	There is this girl.  I met her in our freshman year of college and we've been really good friends ever since.  She got a boyfriend in the beginning of freshman year too and a lot of people don't really like him that much..including me.  Now, in our sophomore year, we've been hanging out a lot more and we talk a lot more too.  I'm starting to fall for her and I can't help but have feelings for her when we hang out.  We are such good friends that I don't want to ruin anything, but a lot of my friends think that I would be good with her.  I know if I say anything it will ruin our friendship.  She's not a **** by any means but every time she comes to my room she always lays on my bed.  One time when she came by drunk she was sitting really close to me (our bodies were touching) and I felt tension there.  What do I do??  I really think I'm falling for her.  I can't say anything to her though!

When he found this out [like any man would]  he didn't have a problem with her inviting other women into the bedroom with them...that was his automatic 3-some. Well, recently, he's saying that she's been going overboard with inviting beautiful women to their home for sex.  She recently told him that she doesn't want to stop and now has begun a close relationship with one of the girls.  She's says she's not leaving him, she just wants to have sex with her, and wants him to be involved. does he have the right to feel that enough is enough? what should he do? for some reason he values what i say because im one of his closest friends that doesn't act crazy all the time!

20090309210815AAra0yP	Family & Relationships;Friends	I cant stop thinking about this one girl.  She wants me as a friend, and I want more.?	Ive known this girl for nearly 8 months.  When I first met her, she had just gotten into a relationship.  I casually observed her and what she did and it really suprised me on how amazing she was.  She got so into this relationship loving with this other guy and i was astonished.  We kinda became friends slowly until her bf starting moving away from her.  She eventually had to break it up with him and she made me as her "best friend".  I was happy until eventually I spilled the beans and told her I liked her.  After she went out with 3 retards she sent me a letter explaining how great I was for her and how she really liked me more then a friend.  I was tempted to ask her out but I knew she was probably still a little upset.   Then something happened and she said she needed time before she could feel those feelings again.  I waited and became a friend again although she knew I wanted more.  Then another guy came along and swept her off her feet and then she told me she would rather have me as a friend and that I was too close to her as a friend for anything.  I dont want anyone but her and cant stop thinking about her.  Do I just cut my losses and leave before I completely break myself.  Or do I stay around and wait it out, maybe she will come around?  What do I do?

I go to the U EVERY weekend no joke. We party. I met his friend there back in september she lives a couple dorm rooms down. We always talk, hangout, drink, etc. I now have feelings for her. I like her. She's beautiful fun to talk to, smart, just fun to be with.      We were drunk maybe 3 weeks ago. I walked her back to her room, She was upset cuz some1 was talking about her. Once she calmed down (much later) I told her I liked her. She said she doesn't really know how to share her feelings with guys. We eventually made out and thats all which was fine. I texted her a couple days later about it. I asked if it was just a drunk kiss. I sadly recieved a text saying it was that she doesn't kiss guys she barely knows? I thought we knew eachother fairly well.      Anyways 2 days ago saturday night. We drank once again but not even close to much as before. I was not drunk at all. We were walking to a party. A group of girls came up behind us, my buddy says something. I look at the girls. Then she hits me playfully and says not to look at other grirls. hmmm? 20 minutes later we were talking and she says she want's to tell me something but she doesn't want to feel stupid in the morning.    The next day she invites me to goto a concert with her that night. I didn't go tho it was short notice. Kind of regret that.      I don't know what to do. Should I ask her what she was gonna ask when she said she wanted to tell me something but would feel stupid in the morning? From what I wrote can anyone give any advice do you think she does like me? I really do like her but I don't really want to call/text her and feel dumb again. IDK PLEASE HELP.

Hey guys, any advice or anything is really appreciated ^^;      Okay, so, my best friend just recently started dating this boy that's two years younger than us. He's a really nice kid and all, but he's super awkward around me especially. Anyways, I never get to see her anymore because she's always out with him. She even asks me to get my boyfriend to give her rides to go see her boyfriend. My bf thinks she's using us but I'm in denial because we always used to give her rides before she started dating so I don't see the difference :[      Anyways, we don't even talk anymore. It's like, all she does is talk to other friends who just got boyfriends recently too. And all they do is spend time together. I don't get it because I know her better than them and if she wants to double date or something, why can't she just come to me?      But yea, so everytime we do get the chance to talk now, she's always talking to him at the same time, whether it be on the phone, texting, etc. I've tried telling her by leaving messages like "go on aim later, I need someone to talk to" and stuff like that but she's always talking to him >.<      I'm really at a loss about what to do, now :c She's like my safe, my diary, the one I tell everything to. Without her, I feel lost and confused. All I really want is my best friend back, not this boy crazed person who's simply leaving me in the dirt behind her D:

20090309221843AAKnUPn	Family & Relationships;Family	What should i do in this time of need?	i attempted suicide more than i can remember , but in the end im to chicken to do so. Ever since i was a child it was always in the wrong direction. my parents divorced when i was young, and lived with my mom ,everyday i would cry and sometimes my mom would ignore me. My brother was no help either .then my father left for america and came back after 3 years. What made me cry the most was that every kid in my school had a dad and there smiles would make me cry. In elementary i would come to school with tears. And would be ignored. Kids parents in my school would gossip how my mom was a single mother and how i wasnt raised well , though my mom raised me to my best despite the things she did to me .After my dad came back when i was in gr.3 i would see my dad in weekends , later on i stayed at his house every night. And seeing less of my mom, everyday was a challenge for me my parents wouldnt even talk to eachother . My life got worse, every year on my birthday i would cry and be alone. Because my parents were to busy to celebrate, I am a very shy person though when i see my friends im different person. on my graduation night my father promised to go, and while standing on the stage i would look at the empty seat and was reserved for my father...   It seems he left without a word to see his new wife. I tried calling his phone but he wouldnt asnwer it was the most important night of my life. There are worse things that happend, i was abused multiple times by people , and last summer a women very close to me died from cancer, not to soon my friend suicided, and my other best friend got pregnant and lost all communication with me. These are just some little things that happened in my life. i need advice   (excuse me for my grammer and spelling mistake)

20090309231125AAFtHmS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship problems?	I recently went through a breakup with someone I was completely in love with. To give u some background info I was with him, lost my virginity to him, planned on a future with him but the reason why we broke up is because we were horrible to each other. I mean we would fight almost everyday and when we weren't fighting we were ignoring each other I feel like i barely know who he is at this point. Anyway a week ago i was at his house getting my belongings and we started to make-out and before i knew it we were on the bed. I stopped him and said "i cant do this, im either your girlfriend or im not and if im not im going home." he tryed to convince me to stay but i didn't want him to see me cry so i left. He got all butt-hurt about it and now im not sure if he really meant things would change or if i made the right decision by leaving. Obviously i still love him but i just cant go back into that horrible relationship. Should i get him back? How would i? Did i make the right choice?   Advice please?

I have long brunette hair and really dark eyes. I am five feet tall.       Everytime I start talking to a guy a like he's not interested and I haven't met any guys who have shown any interest in me.      I was texting a guy friend the other night, we are totally platonic, and I wasn't flirting at all. Then out of the blue he says "I'm not ready for a relationship and I really don't think your girlfriend material." . I wasn't even hitting on the guy! I like cars and music. I am currently restoring an old thunderbird and that is what I was texting the guy about when he suddenly thought I was coming on to him.      So why do you think guys don't like me? What do you think I am doing wrong?

20090309232313AAnhfro	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Let me tell you the cycle why successful black men mostly end up dating non-black women?	Early stages of a African American boy = He is young and growing up, Mom tells him he needs to be good and respect his elders and go school and get good grades.. While he is in school getting good grades this is unattractive to black-women so they label him a corn-ball or a nerd. He continues to get good grades because he wants to make something of himself..   Blackgirls are at school but usually hanging out and going out on dates with the loser guys, the guys that does drugs, rapping loud in public, pants half off his *** or the jock-meathead guys that has failing grades from ditching school and ask her to come which half of the time she does..      Middle stages of the African American boy = He is almost a man at 18 yrs but still the black women see the thugs as more datable due to the fact they have all the free time in the world to give them while the good Black man is in school going for his bachelors or master degree in science or another good field.. She still doesn’t see him as the type of guy she wants. She continues to ignore him and would rather go out on a date with the thug guy because he has the bigger criminal record..      Late stages of the African American man = He is done with college and now is able to get a good job, he lands a job at a company where his is earning money the correct way and not by drugs or doing other crap.. The thug as not be doing nothing and now that the blackwoman is older lets say 25 she is realizing that damn, this is getting old, maybe she has a couple of babies with this thug or a guy with no goal and now she is thinking, Black men aint ****, Black men aint ****, which usually happens and then she goes blaming that there are no good black men.. Well the successful black man has been at his job for a couple of years now, has a nice car and just bought a house and usually at his new good paying job he see’s non-blackwomen which are treating him better and he ask them out on a date, they accept, date goes good and they keep going out to the point where they turn into boyfriend-girlfriend. This makes black women mad watching him drive a nice car with a non-black women with him. Black women that hung out with the thug is now seeing the guy she turned down 5 years ago is doing good for himself and she think now that she is done playing around with the thugs and gangsters while he was working hard in school all of a sudden think the good Black man is just going to run back to her with kids with the thug and bow-down and worship her now that she is used goods. Haha to funny.. He don’t give a crap about black women because now his is on a different level and only date successful women which are usually non-black, now black women want to come on the tyra bank and try to put black men down saying that they should only date good black women??? I think the new generation of black women are nothing but a bunch of losers.. Am i right??

20090309231511AAImTwa	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Mum gone nuts. I'm sacred?	Ok,this is going to be long.I was helping my mother with a few things on the computer for her work(she is not very good with the PC) and then she kept on whining  that she wasn't comfortable sitting on the couch so i snapped and tolled her to sit at the table while i finish this. Then she started screaming at me that i treat her like trash that i want to sh*t on her etc. She hit me on the face with the papers she was holding.I got really mad but i kept my mouth shut. Then she thru her phone (i dont know if she was aiming at my head or not) but it hit the floor and broke. I got scared and locked myself in my room but she started screaming and punching/kicking the door so hard it splinted and the wood has a lot of cracks,the lock is shaky too. So i opened the door and she screamed some more. I went and finished HER stupid work all the while she screamed that i was a boar,that i'm a whore,that i'm ungrateful etc. After that i went to bed (i was hungry but i was too scared to go into the kitchen since she was there) and today she also yelled at me again and literally  racked the whole house.Again i didnt have breakfast till 1PM 'cause i was scared to even see her.I can easily picture her stabbing me with a kitchen knife.After that she left.Oh and she also tolled me that i'm going to explain to my dad why the door and the phone are broken, 'cause apparently its all my fault. This happened before but rarely.  My dad wont be home till next month (my grandfather died and only he could go to a different country,mum has work, i have exams coming).I cant go to a friends house 'cause they live far from here. Has anyone had something similar?How did you deal with it? God,i hate this! :(

20090309232143AAEiPoU	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I Just Stop Trying to Be Close to my Cousin?	We're both in college and I keep asking her if she wants to hang out. That's the problem; it's only me initiating that kind of offer. I'm busy as much as her, but I'm willing to make the time for her. But her seemingly lack of interest is not a good motivator.      We were pretty close growing up. Should I just let our relationship fade? It seems like it's heading that way.
20090309230842AAsuTFi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why can't my husband seem to finish?	Hello.. this is a bit embarrassing but I need an answer.  My husband and I want to have a second child but for some reason he can't ever seem to "finish" if you know what I mean.  We are both in our 30's so it isn't like we are old or anything.  It gives me a complex when he can't finish.  He always seems to get "overheated" and has to stop.  Then he says that he is out of shape and needs to work up his stamina.  What is this about?  Is it normal?        We both work demanding jobs and hardly get the chance to be in the same bed together.  He told me that it might be because we get the opportunity so rarely.  I am pretty sure he makes jelly fish in the shower every morning when he is getting ready for work.  He works days and I work graves, that is our reason for not seeing each other as often as we should.      Besides this, our relationship is good and we do both want another child.  How do I fix this, it makes me feel like it is my fault and I can't help but to take it personally.  And no, he is not cheating on me so that is not the problem.       Any suggestions right now would be appreciated.  Thank you.
20090309231425AAqXEtL	Family & Relationships;Friends	Being asked to not associate with someone anymore...?	So my boyfriend's roommate and his girlfriend broke up.  I always liked her, and she was always nice to me in the time that I've known her.  Her boyfriend, however, (my boyfriend's roommate) I have always had problems with and usually when I come over I just don't really talk to him because we've had too many fights over the years (even before he moved in with my bf) that i just don't really feel comfortable around him.      When the two broke up, my bf and i told her that we were there for her, because we both thought she was a nice girl.  She said "THANKS, you're like my 2nd family to me" and then she told me she wanted to hang out with me because she was going to be lonely now that he dumped her.      A week later, and the roommate comes to us and says "I'm being accused of abusing her, and the cops will be coming here."  They never did show up, I'm not sure what came of it.  Then he said, "If you could, could you please not talk to her EVER again?  for me?"  He seemed really upset, like he was ready to cry...so I agreed.      I don't know both sides of the story and what went down.  But then a few days ago, she removed me, my boyfriend, and a bunch of other people as her friend on facebook.       I've been feeling torn lately as the month has passed.  My boyfriend has been cruel to me too and often times he ditches me for his roommate for "guy time".  So I've been acquiring a bitterness towards, both, and men in general.       My question is not about my own personal relationship with my boyfriend, because that's a totally different story, my question is.... do you think I really need to cut this girl out of my life?  She has never done wrong to me, and I feel she removed us as friends because he threatened her that she can't talk to us anymore.  But sometimes I feel I should not disassociate myself with someone, just because someone else wants me to.  Some day we all die, and we may look back to regret it.      Should I maybe talk to her and ask her what's up?  Or should I follow the roommate's request and just never talk to her again?
20090309231428AAVwZ51	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He dumped his girlfren coz he was attracted to me.say something n make me feel better after reading this pls?	now we r married but this thought sometimes makes me sad.he was in love with this girl for 2 yrs.we met in a coaching centre he introduced himself ,came close to me.he was the most intelligent guy in the class n also very charming n daring so i really got attracted to him very soon.everything was beautiful we fell in love at first he was just giving me hints that wat if he had a love affair before,would i leave him or wat would i do.i thought he was just joking i dint take seriously.when time approached for marriage he told me everything that he used to love a girlbefore n that her parents were against their marriage n so he had to leave her.but i came to know from his fren that he broke with that girl for mysake.he stopped talking to her after he met me but he used to call her once in 3 months he is guilty of wat he has done also once he told me that she had to face insults bcoz of him n he is feeling bad for that.i restricted him from calling the girl coz i felt if u break up with someone u need to leave them completely so that they can forget u n moveon with their life,how can she forget u if u keep calling her,may be she is still in love with u n is expecting that u might comeback,y r u giving hope to her unnecessarily.but he dint understand wat i wanted to say but he stopped calling her.everything is fine now we r happy with our life.n that girl got a job n she is also ok.but sometimes i feel bad its all bcoz of me am the one who entered in to their lives n changed everything.i made a girl suffer a lot.i feel i was a fool unware of anything i felt really so special when i met him it was like a dream come true at that time.now i feel y this happened to him when a girl was crying n got cheated i was enjoying.nothing wrong with him now he loves me a lot but........sometimes i lose respect for him.

I met my friend in 7th grade, but became better friends during 12th Grade (senior year). He's basically a kid that's got everything going for him. Many friends who LOVE him... aka talk to him all the time, say hey jeff what's up... iono maybe its just his type of personality... After that he's also got his academics going for him. He's got above a 4.0 and it doesnt even seem that hard for him. he's naturally smart. Other than that he's also got people that care for him, like girls and stuff. he's got a few friends that are girls... and i dont know....       One of the issues is that im jealous of him, entirely... his life is flawless and it just makes me feel hecka angry at him when i see something good happen for him... I get these feelings even though he's grown to become my best friend. He's got many friends too. when i see him with other friends it just seems like he has more fun with them, making me feel like im a boring person... or just less of a friend of his.       I dont know if it's awknowledgement that i need, or what. He claims that im one of his best friends too, but he doesnt straight up says it or show it in a way...or enough. He's the type of person who waits for people to call him to hang out, he's not the type to initiate a conversation, or ask someone to hang out. Probably because he just has so many friends. I feel like the friendship is onesided... Along with that, last semester in school we used to hang out a lot. Now, during this semester, he's got Badminton from afterschool to 7pm... He says he loves badminton and sometiems when im with him he says he wants to play badminton hella badly. I feel like im being replaced...      This is basically a difficult topic for me to describe, but it's basically just like... i sulk and stuff because we used to be so much more chill, and now it seems like im getting replaced with his Badminton buddies... we barely hang out anymore. During 4th period, he also goes out with other friends and get food / play cards... doing that is also making me feel like i've been replaced. He's tried telling me that i havent been replaced but i still get that feeling inside whenever he goes and hangs out with friends and just has a godo time yano? i just feel like im losing touch or something. Having this being the last semester of highschool i feel like it wont get anybetter since he has badminton until school ends. And when college comes...      I dont know. I hold him as my best friend, maybe even as close as a brother, but i feel like he doesnt feel the same way... He claims that he doesnt rank his friends, so i never really know where i stand in his organization of friends. It may be because he just has so many friends... that he doesnt want to be unfair to one or the other.. but It sorta makes me sad to know that this friendship is sometimes one-sided... I talked to him recently and he said he was discouraged to hang out with me because how i sulk during school, making him feel like it's his fault. (which it sort of is...) and im basically sulking because he doesnt hang out with me anymore... it's going in a circle basically.... BUT ANYWAYS... what should i do? my mind and my emotions are all boggled up and i get really annoyed from myself for feeling like this.      Maybe it's that i need to know that I'm his best friend, as he is mine. (Aknowledgement)   Maybe I just need to calm down and not hold him to such high standards (As a good friend rather than a best friend)   Or maybe i just need to do something else.... THIS IS COMPLICATED YES?   Maybe i'm just too attached. It may seem bad but sometimes i've been trying to detatch myself from my best friend..just so i wont feel like this.   He never asks me to hang out.. .ever, it's always me doign it. but im assuming it's because he's so used to his other friends asking him to hang out that he never really has to do any work himself.... dude good luck understanding this. if you have any good advice, thanks? lol

20090309232107AAFbXVt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I ask a girl out & she said let me think about it and asks for my number?	i've been having this crush on this girl for the past 6 months & receiving positive signals from her at work(work different departments though).  haven't seen her for the past 2 weeks when she changed her shift but finally met her in the parking lot.  she rolls down her car window to say hi to me & i finally ask her out.  she seemed very happy & says "oh my gosh" and just smiled alot.  but she says let me think about it & asks for my number which i give to her.  i also ask her number & ask when is a good time to call.  she says anytime except when she's working.  so i call her 3 days later & she says she's busy.  after that she ignores my phone calls and me whenever we run into each other.....what gives ladies???  i heart she's extremely shy though from her friends......   Update:  i finally talk to her on the phone & she says she doesn't want to go out with me(i was like why didn't u tell me that without all these ignoring crap).  so i ignore her for like 3 weeks & we run into each other again at work & she purposely turns around to playfully smile at me for like 7 seconds....is she playing games or is she just shy or what gives ladies????????   should i pursue her or forget her?   i've dated many girls & the last time i had such a special feeling for a girl was like a girl i dated 10 yrs ago......
