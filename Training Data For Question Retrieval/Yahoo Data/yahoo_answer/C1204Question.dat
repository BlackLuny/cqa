It is floating in the water as shown in the figure. Calculate how many iron cubes each of mass 0.25 kg can be placed on the cube before the cube sinks.       I found the height of the block above the water = 0.08.       I know that the density of the cube plus the density of the added cubes have to be less than the density of the water.

20090202214723AA9hcIv	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Series of Statics problems?	A cube of wood whose edge is 12 mm is floating in water in a glass with one of its faces parallel to the liquid surface. The density of wood is 900 kg/m^3, the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. How far beneath the surface of the water is the cube?      Then a light oil is poured onto the surface to form a layer of 5 mm. The density of the oil is 600 kg/m^3. When the wood cube attains hydrostatic equilibrium again, what will be the distance from the top of the liquid to the bottom face of the cube?      Finally, additional light oil is poured onto the liquid surface until the top surface of the oil coincides with the top surface of the wood cube (in hydrostatic equilibrium). How thick is the whole layer of the light oil?         I have an idea of the first, absolutely none on the second or third. Detailed help would be much appreciated. thanks

I'm referring to the feeling I (and perhaps you) get when I listen to some really profound statement about science.  Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman were especially good at these kinds of statements.  For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, watch this:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myPSkL_S4...       I am not religious, but my question is for religious and non-religious, for scientists and non-scientists:      Do you think that the feelings I described are the same as those felt by religious people when praying to or contemplating their respective deities, or when listening to religious texts being spoken or sung?  It seems to me that there is much in common; that the same brain functions are used in each of these experiences.  In other words, might not they be the same experience, but in different contexts?      What are your thoughts?      I have asked this question in both the Religion and Science sections, to get a broader perspective.

20090202220536AAPrWXB	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Really Hard Math Riddle?	Well for this riddle its very hard to even explain so let me start.  You can only use the numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9 once and you have to keep adding on and dividing each one by the number on digits that in the number. so for an example i first pick the number 3 since 3 is the first number i have to see if its divisable by 1 and yes it is so i then add an 8 to my number 3. so my new number is 38. then since i have two digits i have to divide 38 by 2. and since 2 can divide into 38 it works the i add 4 so my new number is 384 and since that number has three digits i have to divide 384 by 3 and it works so thats fine. Then i add a 5. so my new numbers 3845 and since i have four digits i divide 3845 by 4 and the answer is 961.25 it doesnt work so i can use that. and every number needs to be correct.   So Good Luck, Have Fun, and i hope i explained it good enough

I need help with one of my questions for my stats homework, the question is only worth 1 point, but those points can add up. Anyways, the question is about a lady who has collected data for a study. Within the data she collected, she collected each participant's height, age, and IQ test scores. The question is: Is the "age" variable a type of nominal or ratio statistic? Is "age" neither nominal nor ratio? Defend your position.       I have looked all through my notes and in my text book and I think I am only confusing myself more. I keep reading that age is a quantitative variable...so I didn't know if that should be my answer. But then ratio statistic could also be the answer from what I understand. So if you could just help me out, I would appreciate it. Also, I am not asking you to defend your answer like the question asks...I am just confused between my two answers.       Please don't reply with any of that "Do your own homework" stuff...I'm a senior in college and starting grad school next semester so I think I am doing pretty well by myself thank you...it just so happens that math is my weakness.

20090202223730AAsqJtc	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I have a problem learning math?	It's really frustrating. I pick up every aspect of math conceptually very quickly but when it comes to the calculation I hardly ever come up with the correct answer. I always make an error somewhere in the calculation. So even though I know the concepts and procedures I always get the wrong answer and end up with a bad score. How do I fix this? I feel like I know what I'm doing but many times I make a mistake somewhere within the calculation. Therefore, I end up liking math for the concepts but I can never complete the calculation correctly. Does/has anyone else have/had this problem?

Im stressing out over them, and I was wondering if anyone could help, or point me in the right direction...      A) When two monomers such as amino acids join together, a molecule of water is produced. Use two amino acid molecules to explain where this water comes from.         B) A particular polypeptide contains nine amino acids. The polypeptide has been fragmented in various experiments by breaking particular peptide bonds. The fragments obtained were:      ser - cys - his - pro - arg - cys      pro - arg - cys      X - gly - met - cys      his - pro - arg - cys      X - gly - met - cys - ser - cys      X is known to be the first amino acid in the polypeptide. What is the primary structure of this polypeptide?               This is very stressful, and is due by Friday. It would be a huge weight off my shoulders if someone could answer this. Well, I am not particularly after answers, but more-so an explanation. As in, how to do this, and questions like it. Thank you so much for any help you may offer!            Details: I am a Year eleven student at a school in Australia. I am in Year twelve Biology. I cannot grasp these concepts. Please help.            Thanks all,      -Diablo

When developers built my neighborhood 15 years ago, they apparently planted all male ginkgo trees on the streets, so we wouldn't have those stinky disgusting fruits all over the place.  Apparently, half the trees "mutated" to become females, including the one in front of my house, and we've got those stinky disgusting fruits all over the place (well, not now, but in summer/fall).  Is it even possible for these trees to change sex?  If so can I do something to mutate it back?

20060816053146AAUSIut	Science & Mathematics;Geography	Perchè un punto della Death Valley si chiama Zabriskie Point e perchè tale nome non compare sulle carte?	Zabriskie Point è un noto film di Michelangelo Antonioni del 1970 ed il titolo fa riferimento al luogo dove si svolge la parte centrale della vicenda.Tale luogo si trova all'interno della Death Valley, ovvero il deserto a Est della California che è anche il luogo più caldo del continente americano nonchè il luogo dove si trova la sua massima depressione, pari a 86 metri sotto il livello del mare.   In parecchie recensioni del film si fa riferimento a "Zabriskie Point" come al punto più basso della Death Valley ma in nessuna cartina tale nome viene citato e da nessuna parte si trova un riferimento all'origine del nome "Zabriskie".
