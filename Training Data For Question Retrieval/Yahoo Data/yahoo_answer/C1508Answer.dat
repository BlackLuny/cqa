j0zhKhIEaa	I have facebook and myspace.<br>  <br>  Although they are both social networking sites, they are so different it is hard to really compare them<br>  <br>  Facebook is better to keep in touch with friends and is all and all easier. It was originally created for college STUDENTs<br>  <br>  Myspace lets you get more CREATive with your profile but is not great to really keep in touch on.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think i like facebook better because more of my friends are on facebook (I have 300 facebook friends and 40 myspace friends).<br>  <br>  Since many people only have one, my advice for you (if you don't have one already) is to get both.|`|VDOE8B5vaa	If you really want to use a networking site I would definitely suggest Facebook. There is alot more people using it and its easier to screen who's checking your page. Everything is private so no one can creep on you. Plus, for virtually and phone with internet access there's a facebook application. Definitely choose it!!<br>  <br>  Myspace is really unsafe and it is a pain in the ***. and not many people even use it anymore.|`|6zCm65haaa	bebo is the best. the worst has deffo got t be facebook a bunch of wierdos frm school trying to be ya friend even tho they wo total bitches at school nah cant b arsed wiv it i have friends allready i like bebo cos the your friends on it and well they have ldz of cute skins lol|`|QUjW3ii5aa	I like facebook the most.

rNXCnJ8Eaa	I think the main reason is because there's a general "Cultures & Groups" homepage that LGBT questions pop up on (it's a mesh bag of all the subcategories). As I see it, someone who happens to be homophobic sees gay content so they can't resist putting up an idiotic or nasty response to an honest question. Then they find out that there's an entire section devoted to LGBT questions so it's basically like Disneyland for them.<br>  <br>  That's why I don't really bother sending nasty comments in response to nasty questions. It falls on deaf ears anyway. So I usually get my whitty pun in and then go about my day. I used to get all pissed off but no good ever came out of it so I just stopped caring.<br>  <br>  It's a shame too, trolls are also the reason I have to keep my Q&A private.

Churches are willfully resistant to change, and only do so when pressure is put on them.  The Mormons, for instance, retracted their polygamy and anti-black practices only when real-world pressure was bought on (they had convenient "revelations", but that should be transparent).  <br>  <br>  So long as the loons who accuse children of witchcraft (often for no reason at all) are regarded with respect and prestige, they will keep right on doing it.  <br>  <br>  There are no child "witches".  There are only children who have been singled out by the (christian) religious fanatics for purely arbitrary reasons.  <br>  <br>  And no, I have yet to come across any church that "knows what they are doing" except when it comes to extracting as much cash and influence as possible out of its members.|`|DZ9ADg7Xaa	Aren't the religious people the ones doing the murdering, despite their ten commandments? Child-witches aren't doing anything wrong. It's just like when I was a kid and thought I was a bird.<br>  <br>  Witches don't EXIST. Magic doesn't EXIST. I don't know why your god is so afraid of something that is a fairytale. Maybe because once people realize magic is a fairytale, they'll realize god is too.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	Witchcraft is a sacred tradition that will never be removed from this world. We are needed, now more than ever.<br>  <br>  The mainstream religious despise us, but we don't despise them. We pity them for their limited worldview. <br>  <br>  Additionally, witchcraft has nothing to do with Satan or the Devil. Satanism is technically a Christian denomination because Satan is part of Christianity. We do not recognize any such figure, nor do we believe in the existence of absolute evil.|`|vbjgMBdVaa	You are an idiot if you think that is right!

No, just, no.<br>  <br>  All weed does is maybe make sex a bit more fun *while you're doing it*.  It doesn't increase libido IME or even reduce inhibitions anything like alcohol does.  I'm a pretty inhibited person, and I basically get more inhibited when I'm high.  That is certainly not the case with alcohol, though...<br>  <br>  Weed has little effect on sex at all.  In my experience it just makes the act itself a little more pleasurable while you're doing it.  That's all.|`|G6BG7id2aa	smoking pot turns you into everything that's anything|`|vDG0iA8laa	No...

It is horrible and it pains every Christian to know that those who refuse Christ will be eternally separated from God. I am sorry that it seems rude to you to hear that from someone. And in fact, I don't say that to people. I believe that the Christian duty is to show the love of Christ, to live a life that causes people to say.. What does she have or know that gives her such peace, how can she smile, and be calm in the storms of life? What is it? It is God, in Christ that gives courage to live life without fear, always hopeful, knowing that He is in control and that He wants the best for me. So I rest in Him knowing the future is secure, and live each day in His promise to never leave me.|`|3i1vAIBFaa	Because Heaven and Hell exist and we are just trying to inform non-believers that God loves them no matter what and all He wants is for you to believe and follow in Him.

A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.

They can't even come up with a logical and real answer to justify this "hell"!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't make a habit of telling people they are going to hell.  On this site, people ask about heaven and hell.  They ask about how to get to heaven and how to avoid hell.  Being a Christian, I give them information from the bible on this matter.  They have the choice to listen to what I am saying, or ignore what I am saying.  But my responses will always be based in scripture.|`|pFs71HsHaa	In "real life" when I talk to someone about God I don't mention hell. All I talk to them about is what Jesus did for them and how God can help them in their everyday life. There is no reason to scare a person with hell when I want them to accept Jesus. There is so much more to Christianity than just hell. I want to tell people about heaven before ever mentioning hell.<br>  Here on Y/A is the only place where I will tell someone that they will go to hell and that is because they have asked a question about it.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Please explain to me why would someone who doesn't think there is a God want to spend eternity worshiping Him?<br>  <br>  Make Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior spend forever in His kingdom;<br>  reject Him and spend eternity on the outside looking in.<br>  <br>  It's that simple, and no I'm not getting anything out of it except knowing that I've told you the truth..|`|NlzlBV8Haa	The same thing a bystander "gets" from yelling "LOOK OUT!" to somebody that's about to get hit by a car... or walk off a cliff...|`|WPLKVdBKaa	il help hold your hand Kat! and we will need a group hug too..
rNXCnJ8Eaa	If you only like other hermaphrodites then why not? Otherwise you're just trisexual.|`|7xbSG3lQaa	There is no such thing as a hermaphrodite. That implies having both sets of sex organs at once, which to my knowledge has never happened. You can have people who are not entirely one or the other, but not both at once. <br>  <br>  It's like the colors red and blue. You can be purple, but you can't be red and blue at the same time. <br>  <br>  In any case, almost all of the people who are intersexed identify with one gender. If they have attractions towards the same gender, then they are gay. If not, they are straight.|`|i0zqlI2Aaa	most hermaphrodite's have a sex change at birth or early ages so they are considered male or female.<br>  i never heard of anyone keeping both gential parts if they were born with both.<br>  so whatever sex they are now considered to be (by the government) is how u would decide if they were gay or not.|`|AMa9czcBaa	Yes they even write it on your id card so that you stand out-hellooooooo please go and look up the term hermaphrodite in the dictionary before asking these things.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	haha "the whole set up" thats funny<br>  <br>  uhmmm well being gay has nothing to do with laws anyway hun<br>  <br>  (well,.. marriage does)|`|8DeRuAmYaa	depends on which gender a hermaphrodite associates him/herself with.|`|m05HJc1Paa	I'm pretty sure being gay isn't a legal issue...|`|uky2nsh8aa	Uh, when did i sign a legal form to say i'm pansexual??? *s a confused little panda*<br>  <br>  and generally you'll identify as one gender, so attraction to that same gender identifies you as gay.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	You can be whatever you want.  "Legality" has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  Adult hermaphrodites with 2 fully functioning sets of genitalia are EXTREMELY rare, though I do know one person who is intersexed (the preferred term for "hermaphrodites").  She identifies as female and bisexual. <br>  <br>  Most intersexed people are surgically altered in infancy at the advice of surgeons who convince parents that their children will be happier and better adjusted, socially, if they appear as unambiguously male or female. Unfortunately the surgery is usually done while the child is still too young for the parents to know if the child identifies as either a boy or a girl. Sometimes the surgeons get the child's gender right....and sometimes they get it wrong.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Well first of all I don't think the phrase "legally gay" means anything since even non-hermaphrodites can use their "equipment" any way they please.<br>  <br>  But if "gay" means "sex with the same sex you are" then I guess a hermaphrodite can only be gay if they have sex with another hermaphrodite.<br>  <br>  And remember that there are many different types of intersex people (which is the correct term for hermaphrodite) - so if you really want to be picky, you would need to know exactly which *type* of hermaphrodites you're talking about...|`|zgBPtQXraa	Of course you can, being hermaphrodite is just a physical condition in contrast being gay, besides the physical need of sex, it also implies the emotional attraction towards the same gender, with this I mean that psychological factors also play a very important role in here|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Usually if you are a herma either one or the other works.

People such as the Taliban or al-Qaeda have taken their religion, and twisted it into some perverted belief that justifies the killing of innocent people, and strips others of their rights.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	ask the 9/11 victims families if it is just a spiritual struggle.|`|IGAzs2UEaa	who said it is JUST a spiritual struggle|`|8QgF4xqkaa	There are many types of Jihad. Some of them are described here:<br>  <a href="http://www.islamawareness.net/Jihad/types_jihad.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamawareness.net/Jihad/type...</a><br>  <br>  As you said, Jihad means struggle. Jihad can be against oneself and can be against Satan.<br>  <br>  The hardest Jihad is the one against oneself. It's against oneself because the soul tends to follow the pleasures of life without limit.<br>  <br>  Water doesn't have a shape, it takes the shape of whatever container you put it in. This is just like the soul. It needs discipline.<br>  <br>  This discipline is the highest level of Jihad.<br>  <br>  Another form of Jihad, is the one that the media tries to use in a bad image to make Islam look bad. (They are not successful at that anyway).<br>  <br>  This form of Jihad is the one related to wars. It's meant for defense only.<br>  <br>  If an enemy comes to your home and tries to kill your children then it is called Jihad whatever form of physical struggle you go through in order to defend your family.<br>  <br>  Now what happened in 9/11 was nothing but a killing of some people that weren't directly involved in a war. This cannot be considered Jihad and it's punishable by the Islamic Law (Sharia).<br>  <br>  If I talked about 9/11 I should also mention the other side. Terrorism happens also from non muslims. The history is a witness to this and books talking about Christians and Jews and other types of terrorists are abundant.<br>  <br>  Please don't be one sided but be fair.|`|3XLAs6Isaa	It is not just a spiritual struggle. In fact, since the beginning of Islam, jihad has been a physical struggle (and sometimes considered more important than that spiritual jihad). This was used as an excuse for Muslim conquest and murder of "infidels" or "non believers". It is still being used today. <br>  Whoever claims that jihad is only spiritual is sorely mistaken.|`|mSrnLnNcaa	its called extremism sir. you know, the force that takes something that is pure and turns it into something bad.

So, if ye repent, it will be better for you; but if ye are averse, then know that ye cannot escape Allah. Give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom to those who disbelieve,<br>  [Pickthal 9:4] Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye (Muslims) have a treaty, and who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you. (As for these), fulfil their treaty to them till their term. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty (unto Him).<br>  [Pickthal 9:5] Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

tYqUutidaa	There is no solid historical evidence that the Trojan War, with all the stories arising from it as told in the Iliad, the Odyssey (and to a lesser extent the Aeneid), ever actually took place and is anything more than just a story. It is possible that it did though. As for the details such as the Trojan Horse, the semi-mortal Achilles being killed by an arrow in his heel, Odysseus wandering the oceans for 10 years trying to get home afterwards and meeting with witches... one would suspect these are all embellishments. In fact to me, their presence at every turn of the narrative suggests that the entire conflict is a dramatic invention and not based on historical fact, but prior to Homer there was something of a Dark Age in terms of written texts, so it is possible that his epic poem was based on an actual historic siege-battle that took place and merely embellished to make a better story rather than fabricated from scratch|`|m89kGXBnaa	None.

Jesus even prayed to God  saying "that if there is another way to do be punished than allow it  happen.

And if he didn't die for us than there would be no way for us to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And getting baptized does not save us. It's a symbol that Christians do to let God know that they are turning over a new life to Him.|`|K2nbcyKSaa	Jesus is a faithful high priest that did no sin but He tasted death for us.

He is just physically different. God Himself is The Book of Life. Every soul created from God (be it angel or human), are written in The Book of Life (which means are in harmony with God's state of existence from conception). "Spirits" are angels. The human race are spiritual descendants of God through Adam and Eve (who were both in harmony with God's existence and thus were in the Book of Life).<br>  <br>  S.I.N is Spirit Inverse Nature. God is Spirit. Anything opposite of God's Nature is SIN. Spirits created from God's physical existence is made from the stuff God is made of and is naturally in harmony with God's state of perfection. When a spirit does something opposite of God's nature, or SIN, they become inverted (their physical existence is literally opposite of God's nature). If an angel inverts, it is permanent because angels are made of the same stuff that God is made of: ENERGY. When energy changes form, it cannot change back to its original state. A raw egg when cooked can't be restored to its raw state. Thus, when an angel inverts, because it consists as conscious energy, it is permanent. Inverted angels are demons. When a spirit being inverts, they are no longer in harmony with God, and are thus removed from the Book of Life.<br>  <br>  A human being consists as spirit, soul, and body. The human spirit dwells within the soul. The soul is a composite of both the spirit and the body. The soul dwells in the brain and controls the body through the brain; which is why you are not dead until you are brain dead (without the aid of any machine). Human spirits are made of the stuff like that of angels, but consist as the raw material from which the human soul is created (and then co-exists interdependently within the human soul). The human soul is YOU - the individual who is expressing thought, emotion, and actions through the physical body.<br>  <br>  When Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, their soul and body inverted and they became opposite of God's nature and their bodies began to age. God prevented them from eating of the tree of life to prevent their spirits from becoming inverted (and making it possible for their souls to be restored to God's nature of existence (to be reverted) through the blood of lambs).<br>  <br>  Genesis 3.21<br>  <br>  “Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.”<br>  <br>  Leviticus 17.11 <br>  <br>  “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement (reconciliation/restoration) for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” <br>  <br>  Animals are governed by the spirit of life that dwells in them; and cannot invert, so that when they die, they are simply restored to God. The human body and the body of mammals are created from the earth, thus God was able to use the body of animals as a substitute for the inverted human body - through which the blood of that which is pure is used to cleanse that which is inverted (to temporarily restore them to God - which required a daily sacrifice until God Himself formed a body to provide His own blood to restore the human soul to Himself permanently).<br>  <br>  John 1.29<br>  <br>  “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”<br>  <br>  To take away the S.I.N. of the world is to restore the inverted state of man back to its original state. This can only be done through pure blood; which is why Christ said, <br>  <br>  John 14.6<br>  <br>  “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father (is restored to The Book of Life as a son of God), but by me.”<br>  <br>  It is the blood of Christ that restores you to the Book of Life.<br>  <br>  Leviticus 17.11<br>  <br>  “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement (reconciliation/restoration) for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.”<br>  <br>  The breath of life that came from God's physical existence is the spirit of life. The human spirit itself is literally restored to God; while the soul's destination is determined by its state of existence upon death (which takes about 1/10th of a second). Upon death, the soul consists in either one of two states: in harmony with God's existence or opposite of God's existence (or the inverse).<br>  <br>  Romans 5.12 <br>  <br>  “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:”<br>  <br>  Exodus 32.31-33<br>  <br>  “And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.”<br>  <br>  Revelation 20.11, 12, 15<br>  <br>  “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is [the book] of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”<br>  <br>  The dead who were removed from the Book of Life when they SINned against God while alive, never restored themselves to God (the Book of Life) before they died. Because they were not in harmony with God when they died, they were permanently inverted, and was cast into the Lake of Fire.|`|AlUGue93aa	Jesus offered Himself as a pure sacrifice to save the world and He did just that.|`|u9QV92KQaa	he fixed the sin, all of the sinsof adm and eve|`|vAbATcTcaa	He loved us much, that is why. By doing all that He did, He merited for humanity for all time, the graces to assist us in our journey to heaven.<br>  He did not blot out by his death original sin of adam and eve, rather He taught us how to become children of God, Jesus said, You must be born again to enter the kingdom of heaven, and if you do not, you cannot enter it.  He told his apostles to go out into the whole world and teach all that He had given them and baptise all nations in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit.   Jesus restored the communion with mankind that had been broken since the time of adam. NOONE could go to heaven since that sin of adam. Only when Jesus came lived suffered and died and rose again and assended up into heaven, did He take those long dead figures such as noah and moses etc. into heaven with him, remember when the bible said after Jesus died he went to "preach" to the spirits?  That means he went to tell the dead in abrahams bosom that they would soon be in heaven with him, tHAT IS HOW JESUS RESTORED COMMUNION OR THE RELATIONSONSHIP WITH GOD.  by his living and dying for us.  He also established a church in which he left the 12 apostles in charge of and commissioned them to go out and tell the world, thats why they made many many more converts to this faith so that others could become apostles and hellp spread Jesus 's church. The doctrine of Christ.   You would benefit much by going to a large book store where they sale the catholic catechism, and buy yourself one, and read about this of which you're asking.

AMEN!    SHALOM!|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	He sacrificed Himself out of love for us so that we could have eternal life.  Yes, Christians have been relieved of original sin and all sin upon receiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.  He made a way for us to have a relationship with God by tearing down the wall (sin) that separated us.  We don't need to be baptized to be saved, but if someone claims to be born again (saved) and refuses baptism, it is likely that they are not really saved (unless they have some physical problem that disallows them from baptism by immersion).  Baptism is  symbolic showing identification with Christ's death, burial and resurrection.  Everyone  "sins  all their life" including Christians, but Christians presumably will sin less than nonChristians.  This is because they are more aware of their sins than non-Christians.  Also, just believing in Christ does not save.  The Bible says the devil believes but he is not saved.  Being a Christian means more than an intellectual assent to the fact that Christ lived, died and rose again.  A true Christian will have a changed life (2 Corinthians 5:17).  He will be trying to please the Lord.  Think of  "receiving Christ" (John 1:12)  as being like receiving a guest into your home.  The first thing you do is try to serve them in some way - give them a seat or offer a cup of coffee or food.  Receiving Christ means having a desire to serve Him.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Behold the Lamb of God behold he that takes away the sins of the world.

I seem to have understood something recently -- Jesus said he had to be lifted up so he could draw all men up after him.  If this is true, then he needed to die to be resurrected, and he needed to resurrect himself so he could accomplish two things: (a) resurrect us as well; and (b) bring us back into God's presence.<br>  <br>  Because of his atonement and the sacrifice of his life and his subsequent resurrection, original sin is done away -- if indeed there ever were such a thing.

vEEeq7kYaa	.<br>  <br>  We know Jews don't call God by those names, and Jews know Jesus is not the Davidic Messiah, but neither of those things is as "annoying" as identity theft.<br>  <br>  edit: I wish to note..these two things can be more annoying than anything if the person insisting them gets nasty or aggressive..Overall, in my every day life, I don't bother to think about Christian beliefs much. I am friends with many Christians. I have a few family members that are Christians. Until or unless they're trying to convert me, they misrepresent an aspect of my faith or they're hateful to me and try to base it on their belief, I get along with most folk. I try be respectful and tolerant of the right of individuals and groups to have their own unadulterated culture, customs and beliefs. My tolerance extends to the point where the expression of those beliefs violate certain standards of behaviors: If they attempt to violate another’s civil rights, seek to incite harm to anyone, willfully deceive another or misrepresent the beliefs of others then my tolerance ceases. <br>  <br>  the evangelical Hebrew Christians who call themselves Jews when their doctrine utterly violates Torah precept and then cry "persecution" when Jews of EVERY branch on EVERY" continent speak to this truth. <br>  <br>  It is worse than annoying,.  It is creating antisemitism when they claim they are "persecuted" for belief in Jesus in utter falsehood.<br>  They are most definitely free to believe whatever they want to believe. Mazel Tov on their choice of following the New Testament doctrine.<br>  <br>  They simply will never ever be able to call it Jewish belief without Jews being forced to speak out to declare that is not true if they wish to call worship of or through a human a form of Judaism.<br>  <br>  If a Devil worshipper were to call themself a "completed Christian" I think it would be expected that Christians would not respect that. Jews do not like to see Judaism misrepresented and Jewish identity hijacked. If there was someone insisting on misrepresenting Jewish belief and Jews pointed that out with clear evidence that isn't something that should be declared hostile. <br>  <br>  The assault to the rights of Jewish people to maintain Jewish identity through Jewish law is hostile to Jews and is creating antisemitism considering they're also teaching in falsehood that Jews hate them because they believe in Jesus! That essentially says Jews hate Christians for their belief..which is another lie. We just want them to stop calling themselves as following Judaism so that we don't have to keep coming along behind them to say..no, you're not. God defined in the Torah what is and isn't of the eternal covenant and the New Testament is contradictory to it. It is not Judaism.<br>  <br>  it is not bigotry to declare that Judaism is not Christianity. <br>  <br>  There is no branch of Judaism known as "Messianic Judaism" because ALL of Judaism *is* messianic...meaning that the Jewish religion's tenets of faith contain belief in the promises by God of a Davidic messianic age. Judaism is the original messianic religion so it would be a nonsense term to say non messianic Jew. <br>  The concept and job description of the term messiah in the Tanakh is simply VERY different from that of the New Testament<br>  <br>  ALL branches of Judaism are in complete agreement that this assault to Jewish identity by people who profess faith in the doctrine of the New Testament is not telling these people what to believe, but just trying to inform the world that these people are not being honest when they hijack the identity of the Jewish people.<br>  <br>  We currently have no other name to call them than what they were FORMERLY known as, Hebrew Christians. The Messianic Jewish Alliance of America was known by that name from it's beginning in 1915 until 1975. The term "Messianic Judaism" began around 1967 according to "Christianity Today" magazine. Their statements of faith are in contradiction to the statements of belief of every form of Judaism on planet earth. Every Chief Rabbi and Jewish organization of every branch on every continent you find Jews and every Jewish user from five continents here in Yahoo that I've seen posting on this issue are in full agreement. This isn't a schism within Judaism, It isn't Judaism.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is supposed to be a place where people seek knowledge and factual information. If Jews did NOT speak out when Judaism and Jewish identity is being misrepresented, that would mean that false information is condoned as fact. That should not be acceptable to ANY honest person using Yahoo as it is intended, Jew or Gentile.  In fact, because Jews are so few in number, we hope that more people will stop turning a blind eye to this and also speak out for honesty. <br>  <br>  Jews do not believe God is exclusive to us..but we believe that we must be exclusive to God.  Worship of or through a Jew is a violation of Torah to do.<br>  <br>  Shalom<br>  <br>  EDIT:   Thank you for your respect!<br>  How appropriate you bring up a Bar Mitzvah.  I'm married to a non-Jew.  He isn't Christian, but the majority of his family is practicing Christian.  My Christian in-laws, nephews and nieces attended our son's Bar Mitzvah recently and enjoyed it tremendously.  They were utterly fascinated to hear the Torah portion and a portion of the Prophets in Hebrew. I was of course beaming with pride that my son did so wonderfully and wrote a wonderful d'var Torah ( talk on the portion) AND  afterward, my Christian brother in law,a "semi-professional" singer, who also sings a solo at his church each Christmas from Handel's Messiah...sang at my son's reception.  Of course he would have never disrespected us to sing anything to do with Christianity.  He even sang Hine Mah Tov..a well known song that is from Psalms in HEBREW just for the occasion.  The lyrics say in English translation " how good and pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity"<br>  <br>  We can respect one another and respect that we have different beliefs.  Yes, that's the best way to get along in the world IMHO.<br>  <br>  Shalom<br>  (ps I know that last bit veered from the q but I just wanted to share )<br>  ANOTHER EDIT:  That speaks to an ANNOYANCE of mine.<br>  <br>  DJ just said that Jews were responsible for God's name being removed from the Bible!  NONSENSE.<br>  <br>  The Torah scrolls used today are identitcal to the oldest Torah's known and God's name is in all of them.  It is a violation of a commandment that has always been taken VERY seriously by scribes for thousands of years..to alter even the tiniest portion of Torah.<br>  <br>  There is NO Jewish Bible that has ever had God's name removed.  <br>  I have seen that false accusation made a number of times in Y/A and several times had people argue with me about it even when I linked them to the Orion Center in Israel, home of the Dead Sea Scrolls that confirm that the oldest known Tanakh's  have God's name in them in the same places as those in use today in synagogues around the world.<br>  <br>  shalom|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: Most Jews I know don't worry too much about either except that some Christians seemed VERY determined to prove to Jews Jesus was the Jewish messiah and won't let up.<br>  <br>  1) JWs and various PC Cults claiming "Jehovah" is the Divine Name in Scripture - despite the mistranslation and wishful thinking - Jehovah and Yahweh are NOT the sacred name of G-d. No one knows the name of G-d any longer.  The name Yvhv wasn't written with vowels included and has been lost to time.  <br>  <br>  2) Jesus (Yeshua) is the Messiah? - Despite how many times Jews point out that Jesus couldn't have been the Jewish Messiah, Christians will see otherwise and stick to their mistranslations and out-of-context verses of the OT and not explore the actual Tanakh.  <br>  <br>  Christianity is a wonderful religion. Nothing says G-d couldn't have used Jesus and Paul to spread monotheism to the pagan gentiles. Tacking on the title of Jewish Messiah on Jesus was incorrect, however.  Declaring Jesus divine was probably in error as well.<br>  <br>  Divinity proves Jesus wasn't the messiah.<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  Pleasure and thanks for being tolerant and understanding.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Honestly I don't think we get annoyed by those two things, because we respect that Christians hold those beliefs.<br>  <br>  The one issue that DOES infuriate us is when Christian evangelists go round posing as 'messianic jews'.<br>  <br>  99% of Messianics were *never* Jews to START WITH!<br>  <br>  Messianics are ***literally*** not Jewish.<br>  Just as Hindus are literally not Jewish.<br>  Just as Catholics are literally not Jewish.<br>  <br>  And a Jew who becomes a Christian = a Christian<br>  <br>  There is no 'messianic' group in Judaism.<br>  <br>  Every single Jewish movement - worldwide - has publicly condemned the Messianics.

Whatever people want to do in their religions (as long as it hurts no one) is fine with me; that's their own personal belief.  What I take issue with is when people practice deception or saying that a member of that religion doesn't understand their own Scripture or Bible.<br>  <br>  As a Jew, I find it arrogant and insulting to hear that my Tanakh is wrong and I'm going to hell if I don't accept Jesus (and yes, it's happened in my life, not necc. here).<br>  Jews don't believe that there is only one path, so...live and let live and do it honestly.<br>  <br>  ((((Beans)))) - Hang in there, hon!

8fyEZtyNaa	i agree with you. it doesnt sound right that blacks are told to get over it when natives and even non natives of today, complain about history.<br>  <br>  i wonder if non natives really hate what our ancestors did so much, why they havent gotten up and left yet...cause you cant say its wrong and they deserve their land back, and still live here.<br>  <br>  i think honestly, everyone needs to learn about it. and move on.<br>  <br>  this dwelling isnt helping. <br>  <br>  you cant justify why its okay to complain 100s of years later, about one event, and not be able to complain about an equally bad even.<br>  <br>  both were bad, we all know it. but the purpose of history is to learn from it and not repeat it...not to dwell on what can not be changed.<br>  <br>  america is america now....|`|StRaKUf6aa	Because (thanks to some power-hungry flip heads with a severe superiority complex) there aren't enough Native Americans around to fight the way blacks have fought.  So it's okay to feel pity for them because they're less intimidating.  Blacks are seen as more annoying because there are more of us, and we are a lot more vocal about our concerns (which the people living in perfect dreamland can't wrap their heads around).<br>  <br>  And yes, modern Native Americans DO complain about it.  There are entire documentaries and organizations where they talk about it.  Why the hell wouldn't they?<br>  <br>  Who cares if it didn't happen directly to them?  They're obviously living in the aftermath of it all.  If your great great grandmother's land was stolen (she used to be rich) and now you're living in the projects, are you saying it's wrong to still be upset about it?  It didn't happen to you directly, but obviously you've been affected by it.<br>  <br>  I concur @ been there done that|`|vYAgIMLdaa	well, since the Iraq invasion didn't happen to you, you shouldn't be upset about it.

Since you claim what we know about slavery is a lie, then read Frederick Douglas book (he was a slave) and then tell me his account on slavery was a lie.

They liked the home but the didn't like the people who were already in the home.  (It was already another people's home, you know?!)  So, they fought with the 'homeowners' and, because they outnumbered the 'homeowners' the 'homeowners' were forced to live in the closets and corners.  Many years passed and the descendants of the original 'homeowners' were still living in corners and in cabinets and closets while the intruders lived throughout the rest of their house and called it their own.  Those in the corners, cabinets and closets, although they weren't alive when the takeover happened are still p*ssed because the whole house used to be theirs.  Those living in the rest of the house want the descendants of the original 'homeowners' to get over it while they themselves lounge in the home that their ancestors took over by hook and crook.<br>  <br>  YOU, my lady, are living in our freakin' home.  No it wasn't you but you benefit from the actions of your ancestors (whether they were from Jamestown, Plymoth, or more recent immigrants).

Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  And such were some of you.

He will go everywhere except Makkah and Mad?nah, which Allah has forbidden to him; angels stand at their gates. He will have a mountain of bread, and the people will face hardship, except for those who follow him. He will have two rivers, and I know what is in them. He will call one Paradise and one Hell. Whoever enters the one he calls Paradise will find that it is Hell, and whoever enters the one he calls Hell will find that it is Paradise. Allah will send with him devils who will speak to the people. He will bring a great tribulation; he will issue a command to the sky and it will seem to the people as if it is raining. Then he will appear to kill someone and bring him back to life. After that he will no longer have this power. The people will say, "Can anybody do something like this except the Lord?" The Muslims will flee to Jabal al-Dukhan in Syria, and the Dajjal will come and besiege them. The siege will intensify and they will suffer great hardship. Then Jesus son of Mary will descend, and will call the people at dawn: "O people, what prevented you from coming out to fight this evil liar?" They will answer, "He is a Jinn." Then they will go out, and find Jesus son of Mary. The time for prayer will come, and the Muslims will call on Jesus to lead the prayer, but he will say, "Let your Imam lead the prayer." Their Imam will lead them in praying Salat al-Subh (Morning prayer), then they will go out to fight the Dajjal. When the liar sees Jesus, he will dissolve like salt in water.

cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	Yeah, talent is not what it used to be like before. Today, talent is defined as if you're marketable rather than talented, in the end it's about money for those who are marketing the singer/actor. In the 50s you actually had to have a good voice, and even if you werent that good looking, you still got discovered.<br>  <br>  As far as Chris Brown, i was indifferent to his music. His voice is rather.... childish. I dont mean to offend any Chris Brown fans, but i feel he needs to develop it more. There's other people, like Josh Groban, who sing way better than he does.... but he is marketable. However, if it has been confirmed that he hit Rihanna, I hope his fans realize he's not worth sticking by. Why would a woman still like a guy who beats up on women?|`|l2qtG4yfaa	The judging of someone's talent is subjective just because you think someone is bad doesn't mean everyone else does.<br>  So there are probably more people nation wide who think Chris brown has talent or more people nation wide who think Hannah Montana and The Jonas Brothers do not have any.

50WCN0graa	What is happening to your friends is totally wrong!! Serious props to you for sticking up for them! You are a good friend!<br>  <br>  I wonder if you can teach your friends some of the skills you have. Since they are shy, it may not work for them to stand up to the bullies, but you could try something else.... most bullies bully people for a reason.... they like the reaction they get. Bullies love to have an audience.<br>  <br>  Are you friends giving any kind of reaction when they are being bullied (saying something back, looking scared or intimidated, etc). Can you teach your friends to "play it cool?" In other words, make it look like they are confident and could care less about what the bullies are doing. It is important that they don't give any response to the bullies (don't make any comebacks or anything), otherwise the bullies won't stop. <br>  <br>  Bullies love to get reactions from people. If your friends can act like they don't care, then the bullies may stop.... because bullies love to have audience. It may get worse at first with this method, but if your friends can stick it out, the bullies should get bored and move on.|`|5Sp6h5Qzaa	Stand up for them!

The flogger is expert with the whip, and tears out chucks of flesh for 39 strokes of his whip. (40 less one is supposed to be merciful).<br>  Next, in your beaten and bloodied state, you get to carry your own cross, or cross-member to the execution site.<br>  Then, you are rope-tied (or nailed, as for Jesus) to the cross-member by your wrists, and you and the wood are raised upright and mounted on a wooden post, or a tree. <br>  Initially, you hang there from your wrists until your executioners mercifully supply a footrest to tie your feet to (or nail). <br>  Then you hang there until death comes, possible for days while bugs and birds come to feast off your body, until shock causes unconsciousness and all your blood has drained out on the ground. <br>  But for the Jews, the Romans were merciful...<br>  Jewish law required the dead to be buried before sundown. <br>  So to hasten death for burial, the executioners would come and break your legs so that you could no longer support yourself. <br>  On top of the pain from two leg fractures, the weight of your body would pull your shoulders out of joint, and and breathing would become impossible because of the strain put on the rib-cage and diaphragm. Suffocation would be the eventual cause of death in such cases.<br>  Source(s):<br>  The Bible indicates that the Messiah was not even recognizable as a human being before He was entombed. [Isaiah 52:13-15]|`|7ufheV16aa	Besides what it says in the Bible, I'm sure God was thinking about each and every one of us and probably thought to himself why we would fall in to sin instead of following and trusting him.

He died for our sins.|`|xMCb1e70aa	I think it was the most horrifying death that ever took place. <br>  Not only was the physical pain unimaginable, but He also had the weight of all the sins of all the people of the world that ever would and did exist. <br>  Every rape, every murder, every sinful thought and action. <br>  <br>  When He cried out "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" He was in so much emotional pain, and God the father turned His back to Him because He was taking on and representing sin itself. It would have been like being in hell, for hell is a completely god forsaken place.<br>  <br>  He died of a broken heart (Look up Myocardial Infarction or "broken heart syndrome") not from the wounds inflicted. When they pierced His side with the spear to make sure He was dead, water came out, that is the sign of a broken heart - He died from sadness...<br>  <br>  *It is hard to watch and not for children, but make sure you see <br>  "The Passion of the Christ" -it's an eye opener.|`|RZetcwalaa	Well apparently he had a deep philosophical conversation with the other people being crucified, as anyone who has been hung by the arms or has an IQ of 3 knows this is impossible, he would have struggled to breath let alone chat.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	Nothing happened.

I think it is a cute idiosyncrasy when we can so quickly claim victory in a debate because I am always rational and I do understand what constitutes an assertion without evidence.  It is not my fault that God gave 'all christians' the ability to win every debate.  I declare this logically as the meek and mild who populate the earth!  Would you like to debate some seminary credos? It exercises by Gluteus Maximus muscles. Oops, wrong end - it exercises "those little gray cells" in the Cranium!  So what do you want to debate that the Romans under Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus - the third Roman emperor nicknamed 'Caligula' could throw a more decadent and debauched party than those lovely Israelites at Sodom and Gomorrah?  Or would you prefer to debate the fact that smoke is able to travel through the blood brain barrier 100% in tact ergo why should we be deprived of a good roach to help with pain therapy?  Just so you know, nothing passes the BBB 100% in tact which makes this fact a jaw dropping OMG - sorry for you none GOD believers that would be OMG = oh my goodness.  Do you want to debate a different esoteric paradigm? Gee, I feel so clever because I have good news for your nausea/vomiting it is a little OTC drug called Meclizine HCL 25mg.- just take 2 and you can say 'to ta loo' to that nasty puke (emesis)! Could we debate the use of the ancient Roman Vomitoriums because we could eat, go vomit, eat go vomit, and you would not have to 'puke in your hands'! How utterly vulgar that you don't have a waste basket or can not pray to the porcelain Goddess! I would prefer to debate with people claiming a classical education but mental midgets are allowed to play too!<br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't douche because 4 out of 5 OB-GYN's discourage it.  I would debate this also!  Anything is fair game.  I do however extoll the virtues of a high colonic!  Then you could call me something with more panache like poo poo bag! It is cute and shows your superior intellect to the world.  Now climb down from your little ivory tower because you definitely need a good enema before we start debate.  If you fail to see this whole rant as nothing more than being facetious then I will take my Barbie dolls home and not play with you anymore.  I am being a pretentious snob, but I can be fun too!  Okay back to debate - As the Romans would declare, "Let the games begin!"|`|78VY1OiHaa	It's difficult to have a meaningful debate in this type of forum. Having debated Christian apologists for years on their own websites, I've found that Christians really don't want to know the truth. They just want to believe, regardless of the evidence against them. I mean, the existence of the Christian God is actually DISPROVABLE, but they don't care. Instead of answering questions, they try to change the questions to fit their "answers."  <br>  <br>  It's very intellectually dishonest, and sad...|`|3i1vAIBFaa	I think it's cute how atheist can be so stubborn and set it there ways. I love it when they say, "Well if you can't see God, than He must not exist.

And if miraculously there will be mutants who want to kill them.  I’m sure three years in the military would do a lot more then video games.<br>  <br>  <br>  Books and a good education will get them ready.|`|JHXAtG3eaa	I disagree with the fellow above.

But it was thicker and called papyrus.|`|rl1hQAkZaa	they had paper over 4000 years back in Ancient Egyptian times. It was called Papyrus and was made using a substance wraught from the reeds that grew along the nile.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	in addition to papyrus and parchment, they had clay tablets and copper sheets that they inscribed.  i believe some of the dead sea scrolls are copper.|`|UO3i8BqVaa	Of course BUT no printing presses; everything was written by hand.<br>  Lotsa little priesties in big rooms copying stuff.<br>  ~|`|Ft9Q33uLaa	yes the scribes did have paper. don't be siily.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	Animal skins and papyrus I would think they had.|`|snj9zznvaa	papyrus
JHXAtG3eaa	You can feel wind and see the effects of gravity. There is nothing that you can feel or test to verify the existence of God. It is purely a matter of faith. Some people have the ability or need to believe in God, while others do not. Mane people need to experience something to truly believe in it|`|oil8ALh4aa	I have never seen, felt, or heard from him, even when i was a Christan. I have seen this world for what it really is and it is unfair and cruel. I have read the Bible so many times that it now disgusts me to know that this God can be so sick and sadistic. The people never of the verses were he tells people to rape women, kill babies, own slaves or sell you daughter. I have met a few people on earth to be more merciful and compassionate then this God, so he must not be that holy.<br>  <br>  Ive turned against him because I can not get along with im or his teachings. And I don't see the point in believing when Evolution seems to make more sense to me then a sky daddy.|`|JQ3J5cdZaa	I hate the wind and gravity analogy for the existence of god.  Wind has effects, we can measure it in other non-visual ways.  The air is made up of molecules we can see and detect with the right equipment.  Gravity is simply our name for the force that draws us to the planet, no belief required.  Everything on the planet doesn't going flying into space for a reason and we gave that reason a name enough said.  God is a belief, there is no actual sustainable proof that he/she/it exists, so saying just because we can't see he/she/it means he/she/it could exist is asinine.  Final point wind and gravity can be measured in other ways while the existence of god/gods can't.

DaS9fwakaa	$40-50 is plenty! <br>  <br>  If others want to send more then they can - but you are in no way obliged to send any more than the already very generous gifts that you are sending.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	They must have been joking.  I have three children, one teen and two tweens.  They don't even get one card for their birthday or Christmas from their uncles and aunts and they have the means.  Two of my children don't even get a card from their Godparents, not even a visit.  For one, I chose the Godparents, she's my favourite cousin and her husband and they're the only ones who remember birthdays and Christmas.  You're the best aunt ever.  You're so sweet, you're presence alone should be their gift.  That's all I wish for my children.|`|TWMUXDhKaa	For a nephew, just send a card.|`|O4jGlC2caa	What?  They are nephews.  They should be grateful they are getting more than just a card.  $40 to $50 is more than enough.  I never got that much from my aunts and uncles every year... and I never complained either.  What family member criticized your gift spending?  If it was a close relative of the nephews... such as one of their parents... they can stick it.  Again, if that's the attitude going around, maybe the boys don't need anything for their birthdays.|`|TXddP0uxaa	I think you send them plenty, and they should be grateful for it.  Whoever said otherwise is selfish and petty.  Next time someone says something like that say, "Thanks for your input.  I'll keep that in mind."|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Please my aunt and uncles never gave me anything for my birthday! I remember getting $20 as a teenager (also 10 years ago).

It is not his obligation to reveal himself in accordance to the demands of his creation. Then it would be the created dictating to the deity.<br>  <br>  God is god and if you use the faith that he has put inside you, and the obvious facts that he had laden about you, being the very things that shall convict or liberate you, then you will see that he is real and he was gracious enough to give us his word.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	No.<br>  One of the things that God cannot do is to deny Himself because such a lie would be sinful, and there is no sin in Him. It goes against His character. <br>  <br>  As you wrote this question, could you deny that you exist? Both the question and the denial preclude the very premise! Therefore, it defies logic.|`|OWGA6cFKaa	Well hypothetically, if some omnipotent deity did exist, I guess he could create an infallible argument but that would mean he would reveal his existence so therefore the argument would be illogical at the start because it would not be true.|`|h1eBWehMaa	dude seriously? this is really old. it is just another form of "Can God create a big enough rock that not even He can lift it" <br>  F*cks sake man your amateur!|`|1Q5XZgoiaa	can you?

You should do some more research on how it's done right (on google). But if you believe it's all true, then I suggest you read some true stories about what happens if you do do that. I've heard (I'm not sure if I believe any of it) that these two sisters did it and one of them was grabbed by the neck by Mary's hand and thrown IN the mirror with her while the other one was scratched severely on the face. The sister that survived had to go to the mental hospital and the other was never seen again.<br>  <br>  Just be warned. If you are going to do it, then get like four people to do it with you because it seems pretty dangerous if it's all true.|`|zvvkmiUoaa	the thing is, kids get sooo scared they start seeing things, like bloody mary, or they lie just to freak out their friends and little siblings, and that's how word gets around about it.|`|Jgoylfvqaa	Nothing is gonna happen to you.

snj9zznvaa	no the confession box is exempt|`|eAMq1iBWaa	i asked this q a few weeks ago and the answers all came back "no" but he would be encouraged to turn himself in|`|pGf4mIw9aa	That depends. If it's a atheist that was murder. Never mind. Yes it is his duty to call the police and let them know. If I had murdered a atheist, I surely wouldn't confess anything to a priest. I would have went to God, asked for forgiveness and went to sleep knowing tomorrow was going to be a new day.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I'm not Catholic, but I know this one. The priest not only would not have to tell the police, he would be punished by the Church for doing so. The sanctity of the confessional has always stood up in court, at least in the United States.<br>  <br>  The priest could, however, make absolution conditional on the murderer confessing his crime to the authorities.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	NOPE.. ALL Priests know before they are ordained that the seal or veil of the confession is unbreakable.   The latin word used to describe how bad it is for a Priest to break this seal has NO english equivalent, but the closest english words are something "soo terrible that one can not even imagine it" -- So it is considered...really really really bad. <br>  <br>  A Priest will be undoubtedly excommunicated from the faith once they find out he did this. <br>  <br>  IN fact,  in doing some research to answer a similar question a few months ago.. I found out a few OTHER things about it...<br>  <br>  YES,  Priests will often times STRONGLY URGE the person to confess.. they will even offer to follow the person to the police station to give them courage.  However they can NOT tell the police EVEN IF the confessor tells them to.  Even if the suspect tells the Priest in public it is OK to tell the Police what he told him..the Priest STILL can not break the veil of secrecy.  In  order for the Priest to bear witness against the confessor.. the confessor MUST tell the priest everything all over again in a public location outside of the confessional...so it is no longer part of the sacrament of confession. <br>  <br>  That's just HOW serious Priests take it.<br>  <br>  ALSO.. interesting to note.. IF someone one ELSE accidently over hears a confession,  even though they are not a Priest they TOO are covered by the veil of secrecy and are expected to NOT say anything about it. <br>  You could see how a nurse or family member, tending to a sick or dying person might need to tend to the patient while they are confessing to a Priest.. if this occurrs, then they TOO are not allowed to mention anything to anyone.<br>  <br>  Obviously many Catholics don't know this..and even fewer non-catholics do. And also,  obviously, the Catholic church realizes that there is NO way to enforce that rule on people, but it is a rule, none the less for Catholics to follow.  <br>  So,  if you hear a confession, but don't know you are suppose to keep quiet and tell someone,  you haven't sinned since you didn't know it was wrong.  BUT, once you know..you should respect that and not continue to spread around the person's confession all over town.<br>  <br>  Priests CAN mention in very general terms what they hear in a confession, so long as there is no specifics mentioned and there is no way anyone knows who they are talking about.  Examples of why they MIGHT want to do this is to teach the congregation a moral lesson, or to make a point.  They might say,  "Just last week I had a gentleman confess that he cheated on his wife...."  -- so long at the congregation is large enough that no one knows WHO went to confession last week. <br>  <br>  The fact that Priests don't marry actually reduces their inclination to "share with their spouse" something I know is a temptation for a lot of married Pastors and I know some who tell their wives nearly everything.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Study the law|`|0YQRbq9faa	Most states have what they call preist-pennitent laws that don't require ministers to disclose things such as this.  However, as a minister, if you tell me you hurt someone, are abusing someone, killed some one, or are planning to kill someone, I am calling the police so fast it will make your head spin.  How can a minister, a man of God, be a voice of morality in the community if he does not stand up for right. What is right is if you do the crime, you do the time.  I back the badge all the way!|`|vAbATcTcaa	the priest would encourage him to do so himself as part of his forgiveness process. But a priest cannot go out and blab a person's confession to ANYONE.  Unlike a minister who can and probably has told what some person confessed to him to the total embarrasment and scandal of the one who entrusted themself to him, A catholic priest is bound by his vow and if he should tell someone's sin, whatever it was, to anyone, he can loose his priestly vocation forever. The church cannot say, that well, a priest can tell on one who commits a serious crime and sin, but he cannot tell on one who just commits sins, no, it has to be one way or the other or you would have a huge mess and people would quit confessing, and Jesus is the one who told us to confess to the other when he commissioned the 12 to forgive them their sins or retain their sins, if they do, they are forgiven if they do not the are retained.  Those are Jesus<br>  's words, not mine.|`|qOGh6ODLaa	No they would not tell. Priests uphold a higher law. There is a Seal on the Confessional however the murder would be required to confess himself and face the consequences in order to receive absolution.|`|ki3XY49daa	Indeed, a confession to a pastor or priest is protected under the law as inadmissable in a court of law.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Why would a murderer confess to a priest. Only God can forgive him. Why not just confess to God?|`|N6cCc9dOaa	No.Because a good priest must never tell some ones sins to others.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	no priests have no morals|`|casg30Ataa	suuuure you didnt :)<br>  <br>  honestly i have no idea|`|te9y6MQkaa	No. <br>  <br>  But this is an ethical scenario brought up in seminary and like course all the time. <br>  <br>  What if it got out to the parishioners that the Priest knew? What if the police could have gotten involved and prevented the murder? Shouldn't a person have the right to go before a representative of God in confidentiality? Others may not come to confession because now they know the priest may tell. This is one of the major splits between American Protestantism and it's progenitor. <br>  <br>  It's not going to be solved here.|`|rl1hQAkZaa	people may state that the confession booth is exempt all they wish.. However, to be forgiven by a god does not make it ok.<br>  <br>  I am under the understanding that should someone confess to murder, the priest would still have to come forward with information. After all, in most cases it stops a psychological doctor from coming forth, but if the person is dangerous or kills, they would still need to inform the police.|`|Tc7MEnxZaa	no he wouldnt and in telling the police he would be breaking the sacrament of penance... i watched a movie about this in my theology class and the priest was called to the stand and actually prosecuted as a suspect... even under possible jail time he did not reveal any information regarding the person who confessed... turns out his wife rats on him and he goes   crazy and shoots her....|`|rL4FrfSlaa	The priest is prohibited from violating the seal of the confessional under any circumstances whatever. I believe standard operating procedure is to withhold absolution (forgiveness) until the penitent has surrendered to the civil authorities, as an incentive for doing so.|`|vouUQQzBaa	No, he doesn't have to. However it HAS been done<br>  <br>  The priest was actually backed up by the Archdioceses|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	If they did they'd be in ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTA trouble because he's supposed to keep it to himself; forever.|`|xelkbdbdaa	I don't believe that this is a serious question.<br>  <br>  But, anyway... the priest will likely leave that to his own conscience.

I think your'e on to something here...<br>  <br>  Lol forget these people man. 3 days in hell = eternal amount of sins? Lol cmon man my 4 year old niece could come up with a better story than this. It was in no way a sacrifice he just set his son out as a loan, knowing he was going to get his son back AND countless followers. Kinda what the companies did to get us into this ecenomic crisis lol.

I remember reading a book called "Speak" And the girl says "We are learning American history for the 9th time in 9 years, and we haven't gotten past the civil war". (or something like that. And every year that we've studied American history, we never even got UP to the civil war, except for last year)The only times we've ever learned something NOT American history was in 6th grade and the grade I'm in now. And eventually I will have to study American history again.

America is only 232 years old which is very small compared to the world as a whole yet they make us learn those 232 over and over again acting like it is something new when I just learned the same exact thing in previous years. I understand it is our country but they need to realize it is our and everyone's world. I want to learn about the history of the world too.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	We are taught American history because it's our nation and it's important you know the background of where you live and the reason you live the way you do.

If you have no hard copies of it, you 'may' be able to find evidence of it out. If you are able to, get the persons full name and type it in along with your address. If there's any info, it should come up with links.<br>  <br>  Other than that, if you believe in witchcraft, occult or divination, you could try doing a calling. But understand that it can be dangerous as you have no guarantee you know what is in there, or if you know it's friendly.

Maybe it's that.<br>  <br>  I have a tendency to be protective over people I know, who are females.|`|6hRbcDmmaa	I think there is a lot more to it than a "crush". Gays yearn for support and care, and a best fag hag can do the trick. But also, it would question your mentality of love. Perhaps you are afraid of stepping into a serious relationship with someone. Lesbians like girls so there is a connection, but you know it can't go anywhere else, unlike other people who like you (other gays and straight girls). You have to understand what drives you to her so much. You seem to be in a comfort zone of limitations.|`|4MCGZRQgaa	Yes, its perfectly normal. <br>  <br>  Alot of gay guys may have a small crush on a girl, but they don't want to physically "be with" a girl. <br>  <br>  Some lesbians may have a small crush on a guy, but they don't want to physically "be with a guy".|`|zAyqzEh9aa	YES ITZ POSSIBLE|`|uky2nsh8aa	lol, yeah. i kinda have a crush on a guy around here and yeah, he's gay... so yeah.... heehee.... <br>  <br>  maybe just call her buddy or friend cause sister? lol<br>  <br>  i have the feeling people see me as the little baby sister around who constantly makes cookies and messes with people. lmfao<br>  <br>  *gives you hugs and sweets*|`|grYkoDaraa	if shes like a sister then it is not a crush.  gay men can still think females are attractive just like lesbians can find men attractive but it doesn't mean that they like them in a sexual way.

Only we have free will instead of acting on instincts.<br>  <br>  The reason was for our creation this way was to fulfill our purpose at Genesis 1:28.  To be caretakers of all life on the planet.  This was only to humans while they were perfect.  Imperfect humans would not have the ability to do this as evident by God's command to Noah after the Flood.  Like Adam, they were to multiply but not be caretakers.<br>  <br>  Little wonder then that God has special interest in humanity.  As Isaiah 55:11 shows, God's plans always work out just as he originally purposed.  In this case, he made provision to bring humanity back to perfection by means of Jesus' sacrifice of his perfect human life to replace Adam's lost one.|`|9ZwFQadRaa	First off, animals and man have been here the same amount of time, they were created on the same day.

xv0ovZ63aa	Hey BQ, I understand your situation.<br>  <br>  AP crafts bright students (trust me, I know). It makes our future leaders and doctors. Students who completely put their heart into their books will excel in the long run. Forget about the AP exam. Students just whine to their parents that they got A's on tests but the AP exam was stupid (clearly false). In the future, if you think about it, you're not going to go far. Plus, at an age like high school, hook or crook is not only risky, but it stays with you. Now, would you really want a nasty AP student to operate on your heart who cheated his way to an A+? No, I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  In the long run, keep your sister away from FB or Myspace (seriously, I still don't have one- and I'm out of high school). Your sister will see the results in the future... And the teacher or another administrator is BOUND to figure out the trick. It always happens (trust me on this also).<br>  <br>  I have no right to force a decision on you. But all I can say is- do what's right. =)|`|24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	Your sister is really doing well in her studies. She got an A in the last semester and its really ok, if she doesn't get an A. Its important for her to be honest. The first thing you've to do is make the teacher aware of the cheating that has been occurring. That boy has got to be stopped. Its very wrong..he isn't helping other students. Instead, he is making them lazy and due to them, students who study hard like your sister are lured towards making him a contact in facebook. You please make sure that your sister wouldn't add him as a contact and take all this cheating into teacher's knowledge. If the cheating stops, automatically attracting towards it also stops.|`|7fPEgy6faa	You don't really have anything to do with the other kids. They will cheat even if you stop the tests on facebook. I would be concerned about your sister though. Don't let her be a cheater if you have any say in it. Because if you do tell people will find out that you did it so its not really worth it. Just don't let your sister cheat<br>  <br>  and as for the teacher there's nothing that you can really do<br>  <br>  the truth is they will get problems from this and they will pay so you shouldn't get too worried about them|`|KTMiNiQ4aa	If you want to tip the teacher off without getting the guy in trouble, you should write an anonymous letter and leave it in his classroom or mail it to him.  However, I believe that you should rat this guy out.  He is really hurting all those students that he is supplying answers to. <br>  <br>  <br>   About your sister:  I guess the main thing is to reiterate to her the points you have just made.  Sadly, each person has to decide what they will do.  Although it may take some time, you might just convince your sister against the whole thing, but don't forget: if she really wants to cheat, she can always get someone to print out the test.  Explain specifically to your parents why they don't want her to get a Facebook, and they will probably have a more effective means of dealing with this issue than you have.<br>  <br>  I sincerely applaud you for seeking advice on this issue. It's really good to know that there are other concerned sisters out there.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	if it was me, i would go to the teacher. even though you might seem like a narc, it will be worth it. what's the point of taking an AP class if you're just going to cheat? you're supposed to take them to learn.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Tough question..I think it sticks that kids can cheat like that..I know kids will be kids and lots do it but it isn't fair at all to the honest ones.. I might suggest you send a letter annomonous letter to the teacher or school and suggest to change the test or make a few different ones and never let on which one they will use for the day...Teachers should know by now how easy it is to cheat esepecially with all kinds of technology..I would suggest  that the teacher changes things all the time ,,It may take time and effort to do that but that is the teachers job... Or maybe give on oral test and just ask out loud instead of making a printed test...just tell them to do it the old way and give the kids a blank piece of paper and ask questions orally and have them write down answers ..<br>  <br>  I don't think it has much to do with facebook in majority except for this case.. I would maybe let her have facebook providing your mom or another grown up has the password...This might keep her out of trouble...If she dissagrees tell her NO facebook til  things get better.. It should be an open site and not be doing things on there that are secret.

The wind streams need to begin to travel south to north, instead of west to east. In order to create the Bering Strait 'bridge', we need to drop the water level at least 200 ft. So an enormous amount of water needs to be evaporated - about 20.82 million cubic kilometers, enough water to cover an area of 5 million square miles with a sheet of ice 1.2 miles thick. To complete the process, we need this massive evaporation to take place in the warmer climates of the south, then the moisture laden clouds need to break the natural laws of the planet and head to the far north so they can then 'dump' their precipitation as ice over the area of the Bering Strait. To quote from Professor Vine Deloria Jr., "We cannot today conceive of a natural process that would evaporate this amount of water and transport it safely from the temperate zones to ensure that it precipitated as ice in Canada." As you can see, when you begin to explore the facts, it becomes more and more clear how ridiculous the Bering Strait theory really is.

He represents Jesus.  It is actually God working through the priest to forgive our sins.<br>  <br>  We do pray directly to God.  Almost the entire Mass involves direct prayer to God.  Mary can intercede for us, though, like she interceded during the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee.<br>  <br>  We don't pray to statues, we talk to the people those statues represent.  Catholics use the term "pray" to mean "talk," rather than "worship." That's why we feel it's okay to pray to saints, because we are talking to them rather than worshiping them.<br>  <br>  Catholics use the term "dulia" to refer to the honor given to saints. We use the term "hyperdulia" to refer to the honor given to Mary, as God's greatest and only perfect human creature.  Mary is greater than all saints and angels combined.

Are Catholics saved?"<br>  <br>   The most crucial problem with the Roman Catholic Church is its belief that faith alone in Christ is not sufficient for salvation. The Bible clearly and consistently states that receiving Jesus Christ as Savior, by grace through faith, grants salvation (John 1:12; 3:16,18,36; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10,13; Ephesians 2:8-9). The Roman Catholic Church rejects this. The official position of the Roman Catholic Church is that a person must believe in Jesus Christ AND be baptized AND receive the Eucharist along with the other sacraments AND obey the decrees of the Roman Catholic Church AND perform meritorious works AND not die with any mortal sins AND etc., etc., etc. Catholic divergence from the Bible on this most crucial of issues, salvation, means that yes, Catholicism is a false religion. If a person believes what the Catholic Church officially teaches, he/she will not be saved. Any claim that works or rituals must be added to faith in order for salvation to be achieved is a claim that Jesus’ death was not sufficient to fully purchase our salvation.<br>  <br>  While salvation by faith is the most crucial issue, in comparing Roman Catholicism with the Word of God, there are many other differences and contradictions as well. The Roman Catholic Church teaches many doctrines that are in disagreement with what the Bible declares. These include apostolic succession, worship of saints or Mary, prayer to saints or Mary, the pope / papacy, infant baptism, transubstantiation, plenary indulgences, the sacramental system, and purgatory. While Catholics claim Scriptural support for these concepts, none of these teachings have any solid foundation in the clear teaching of Scripture. These concepts are based on Catholic tradition, not the Word of God. In fact, they all clearly contradict Biblical principles.<br>  <br>  In regards to the question “Are Catholics saved?”, this is a more difficult question to answer. It is impossible to give a universal statement on the salvation of all members of any denomination of Christianity. Not ALL Baptists are saved. Not ALL Presbyterians are saved. Not ALL Lutherans are saved. Salvation is determined by personal faith in Jesus alone for salvation, not by titles or denominational identification. Despite the unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, there are genuine believers who attend Roman Catholic churches. There are many Roman Catholics who have genuinely placed their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. However, these Catholic Christians are believers despite what the Catholic Church teaches, not because of what it teaches. To varying degrees, the Catholic Church teaches from the Bible and points people to Jesus Christ as the Savior. As a result, people are sometimes saved in Catholic churches. The Bible has an impact whenever it is proclaimed (Isaiah 55:11). Catholic Christians remain in the Catholic Church out of ignorance of what the Catholic Church truly stands for, out of family tradition and peer pressure, or out of a desire to reach other Catholics for Christ.<br>  <br>  At the same time, the Catholic Church also leads many people away from a genuine faith relationship with Christ. The unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church have often given the enemies of Christ opportunity to blaspheme. The Roman Catholic Church is not the church that Jesus Christ established. It is not a church that is based on the teachings of the Apostles (as described in the Book of Acts and the New Testament epistles). While Jesus’ words in Mark 7:9 were directed towards the Pharisees, they accurately describe the Roman Catholic Church, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!”|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	There were no Protestants till 1500s... and Jesus founded the Catholic church since there was no church before that, so of course Catholics can be saved. Of course, non Catholics can be saved as well, we believe that is possible. <br>  <br>  Many, many Catholics do not know what they believe. Honestly, I was one of them.  The fact that you that the Eucharist are crackers in a golden tin shows this =] If you want to know official catholic beliefs, I suggest you visit Catholic.com, vatican.va, or read the official Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Saints are NOT middlemen. <br>  We can pray directly to God. In fact, it is only with God's power that the saints can hear us. The saints pray for us, and with us, just like you pray with those in church, and ask friends to pray for you. Exact same idea, except the saints are in heaven now, alive in Christ.<br>  <br>  Priests DO not forgive us instead of God, they allow us to confess how Jesus intended. They repair our relationship on behalf of the community. God forgives sins. Priests are not the way to heaven, Jesus is. We believe He died for us so that we may have eternal life. No priest there. <br>  "‘As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.’ And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained’" (John 20:21–23).<br>  <br>  Praying to Mary= asking Mary to pray for us, not worship<br>  <br>  We can pray to God directly. Google traditional Catholic prayers: Our Father, Glory Be, Act of Contrition. Who is the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Lord, God, etc we are talking to? God of course =)<br>  <br>  Praying to statues... no, we pray to God. Statues are there as a symbol, to remind us who we are praying with/ to. Do you have photos of your family? At a funeral, if you pray there and there is a photo of them, does that mean you are praying to the photo? Or to God?<br>  <br>  Yes, you are correct. Praying to statues is idol worship, which goes against one of the Ten Commandments. Thankfully, Catholics don't pray to statues. If your friends do, tell them to stop. Its considered WRONG in Catholicism. Prehaps they should take a few classes to learn about their faith.<br>  <br>  No man comes to the Father but through Me does not mean we can't support each other on our journey towards God.<br>  We are saved, being saved, and will be saved... How? By God's grace.<br>  <br>  Catholics don't add or subtract from the Bible. The Bible had those books before there were any Protestants. They were taken out during the reformation. They have many more predictions of Christ in there.<br>  <br>  Where in the bible does it say it is symbolic? When Jesus said that you must eat his flesh to have eternal life, and have people uncomfortable with what He was saying? If it was symbollic, then His followers would have no problem. What about when He says, this IS My body?<br>  <br>  Saints are not dead. Christ conquered death on the cross, didn't He. They are alive in Christ. God is God of the living, not of the dead.<br>  <br>  I wasn't hoping to change your beliefs here, I respect yours but felt that I needed to clarify the Catholic faith. Also, please tell your Catholic friends that they shouldn't worship idols or Mary... because its not Catholic. <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: baptism: Jesus says that you must be born again. Born again= baptism. <br>  Baptism is part of salvation, through Jesus' sacrifice, NOT something extra. In baptism we die from sin and are born into God's family. <br>  God bless. =]|`|gQ3eJfFBaa	Your on the right trail. Try every spirit, whether it be of God or not.

Now if you obey God and do your job you'll end up with something like this. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. Now does it make sense? Trust the bible, God and to some extent yourself. When your done you are responsible and nobody else. If you want to understand the devil pay attention to other people because they are a reflection of ourselves and can show you how he works.

If they can't  give you a simple answer they don't know and thier pride gets in the way of saying they don't know. Knowing the answer is a prerequisite of maturity. Looking good and being good are two different things. But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have thier senses exercised to decern both good and evil.

Good Hunting|`|omxFGYMFaa	An Open Christian Response <br>  to a Person Claiming to <br>  Be a “Born Again” Catholic<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What you have claimed for yourself, all other Catholics can also claim, since Catholicism teaches one is born again at infant baptism. This, however, is surely not the meaning of this important term, as found in God’s word. To be born again as the Lord Jesus and Peter mention (John 3:3-7;1 Peter 1:23) occurs when a person repents of their sins and places all 100% of their trust in Jesus for their salvation. This is not what any baby can do, and is even flatly opposed to Catholic doctrine. As the Bible teaches that Jesus is to be the focus of our trust for salvation, Catholics are taught a different message.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That other message of Catholicism for salvation includes the sacraments, Mary and one’s own good deeds. Also, many still believe Catholic church membership is also essential, as they were taught before Vatican Council II.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To believe wrongly about certain religious subjects, as bad as that might be, is not as lethal as embracing a false plan of salvation. Any person (not just a Catholic) who is not trusting in Jesus to the point of faithfully obeying him is on the road to hell, even though he might claim to be born again and even do some kind things for others. If you will carefully read through the entire New Testament, and change your beliefs and behavior accordingly, it will bring true salvation to your soul. (There are many true Christians today that used to be Catholics.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Getting back to the Catholic plan of salvation, please ponder the unfounded emphasis that it places upon Mary. She allegedly is the mediatrix and dispenser of all graces. Since we are saved by grace, and she is supposed to be the mediatrix and dispenser of all graces, then Catholicism is indirectly claiming she is necessary for our personal salvation. This, in part, is why so many Catholics trust in her.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the epitome of the Roman Catholic Gospel is the Rosary prayer, according to Catholicism. When such is recited, Mary is openly proclaimed to be our life, sweetness and hope. Such a message is diametrically opposed to the salvation truth that Jesus is our life, sweetness and hope. Moreover, the real gospel does not describe Mary in that manner. In fact, Mary has no mention at all in the real gospel. See 1 Cor. 15:1-8. An error of that magnitude is enough to damn all who are so deceived.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Idolatry is a sin that will send any person to hell, unless it is turned from. On Good Friday, Catholics bow before and kiss the crucifix in an effort to show their love to Jesus. Though the intentions are good, the act itself is both pagan and idolatrous. Christians are to worship God apart from images (John 4:23,24). This is basic and was part of the commands given to Moses:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments (Ex. 20:4-6).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Catholics regularly bow before and kiss wood and plaster on Good Friday (and at other times) in their attempt to pass their worship and adoration on to Jesus (and others). Hence, idolatry is being committed on a regular basis. Consequently, if a Catholic does get Biblically saved, he must leave such an idolatrous system to stay saved. Again, no idolater will enter God’s kingdom (1 Cor. 6:9,10), but will instead be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When you go to a medical doctor you want the truth about your physical condition. If the doctor examines the evidence and then reports that you have a dangerous high blood pressure, pulse and sugar level, you want the truth even though it would be disturbing and life changing. To know the truth is vital so that adjustments can be made, before it is too late. How much more is it vital to know the truth about salvation and change accordingly before it is eternally too late?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  None of this is mud-slinging, disunity or confusion. Please be assured that this response is written out of genuine Christian love, which is described, in part, as not delighting in evil but rejoices with the truth (1 Cor. 13:6). Christians who know the truth must try to help others find salvation. (To remain silent would not be loving.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible does teach unity and love among the real/genuine followers of Jesus, but that can not include any person who aligns himself with a religious system that is dangerously disseminating false information about salvation and is himself without salvation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We have Christian love for all types of religious people and, therefore, desire that all come to salvation, the same desires as God himself (2 Pet. 3:9; 1 Tim. 2:4; Acts 17:30|`|zRyI5CMGaa	1,Can you be saved if ur Catholic?, <br>  <br>  YES!.<br>  <br>  2,''they pray to saint this and saint that'', ''also they pray to marry'' .<br>  <br>   It's called INTERCESSION we ask Mary and Saints to pray for us just like you would ask a family or friend to pray for you.

There is a big difference between "worship" and "honour." Catholics honour show respect to statues of Jesus, for example, in exactly the same way patriotic Americans honour show respect to the American flag. The flag is just a piece of colourful cloth, but it is honoured it because of what it represents. In the same way, a statue of Jesus is just plaster and paint, but we honour it because of Who it represents. A Catholic no more worships a statue of Jesus than a patriotic American worships the American flag. <br>  <br>  5,''and they believe that a priest can forgive you'', <br>  <br>  It is God and God alone that forgives our sins, The Catholic Catechism (#1441) says "Only God can forgive sins" and cites Mark 2:7.  Jesus passed on his mission to forgive sins to his ministers, telling them "'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven'" (John 20:21-23).  Because it's done in the name of Jesus, it's God who does the forgiving!. <br>  <br>  I hope this anwers all your questions!.<br>  <br>  Edit;<br>  <br>  ''also if u look in the catholic bible u see extra books like mackabees and stuff see deuteronmy 4.2 dont add or subtract''<br>  <br>  The Catholic bible was compiled long before the KJV, The KJV was  compiled to suit the protestant reformation and politics of the time, that is why there are 7 missing books and several mistranslations. It is the KJV which has had books taken away, not the Catholic bible adding books. The Catholic bible was compiled from the scriptures themselves!.<br>  <br>  ''how can a dead saint help me?? if i pray to them''<br>  <br>  it is Bibilical here you have some referance,Thus, in Psalm 103 we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:20–21). And in the opening verses of Psalms 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!" <br>  <br>  Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In the book of Revelation, John sees that "the twenty-four elders [the leaders of the people of God in heaven] fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints" (Rev. 5:8). Thus the saints in heaven offer to God the prayers of the saints on earth. <br>  <br>  Angels do the same thing: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar [in heaven] with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3–4). <br>  <br>    §wéétié???|`|zefFTf8Aaa	where do I start.....  <br>  this is what we do<br>  2634 Intercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray as Jesus did. He is the one intercessor with the Father on behalf of all men, especially sinners. He is "able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." The Holy Spirit "himself intercedes for us . . . and intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."<br>  <br>  956 The intercession of the saints. "Being more closely united to Christ, those who dwell in heaven fix the whole Church more firmly in holiness. . . . They do not cease to intercede with the Father for us, as they proffer the merits which they acquired on earth through the one mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus. . . . So by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped." <br>  <br>  Do not weep, for I shall be more useful to you after my death and I shall help you then more effectively than during my life. <br>  I want to spend my heaven in doing good on earth.<br>  <br>  Intercessory Prayer of Saints <br>  Rom 15:30 - join me by your prayers to God on my behalf <br>  Col 4:3, 1Thess 5:25 - pray for us <br>  2Thess 1:11 - we always pray for you <br>  2Thess 3:1 - finally, brothers, pray for us <br>  Eph 6:18-19 - making supplication for all the saints & for me <br>  Tob 12:12 - angel presents Tobit & Sarah's prayer to God<br>  Ps 148 - David calls upon angels<br>  Zech 1:12 - angel intercedes for Jerusalem <br>  Mk 12:25, Mt 22:30 - men in heaven are as the angels<br>  Rev 5:8 - those in heaven offer prayers of the holy ones to God<br>  Mk 12:26-27 - he is God of the living, not of the dead <br>  Mk 9:4 - Jesus seen conversing with Elijah & Moses<br>  Lk 9:31 - Elijah & Moses aware of earthly events <br>  Rev 6:9-11 - martyrs under altar want earthly vindication <br>  Heb 12:1 - we are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses <br>  Lk 16:19-30 - departed rich man intercedes for brothers <br>  Rev 20:4 - saw the souls of those who had been beheaded <br>  Wis 3:1-6 - the souls of the just are in the hand of God <br>  2Macc 15:7-16 - the departed Onias & Jeremiah pray for the Jews<br>  Jas 5:16 prayers of righteous man<br>  1 Cor. 13:12 - I shall understand fully<br>  1 John 4: 20-21 - whoever loves God must love his brother<br>  1 Cor 12:21 - parts of Christ's Body cannot say to other parts, "I do not need you".<br>  <br>  Images and Statues<br>  Deut. 4:15 - from this verse, Protestants say that since we saw "no form" of the Lord, we should not make graven images of Him.<br>  <br>  Deut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly "in the form of any figure." <br>  <br>  Deut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times. <br>  <br>  Exodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc). <br>  <br>  Deut. 5:8 - God's commandment "thou shall not make a graven image" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. <br>  <br>  Exodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God. <br>  <br>  Num. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural. <br>  <br>  I Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship. <br>  <br>  2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images. <br>  <br>  1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship. <br>  <br>  2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold. <br>  <br>  Ezek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches. <br>  <br>  Col. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the "image" (Greek "eikon") of the invisible God. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Statues <br>  Ex 25:18-19 - make two cherubim of beaten gold <br>  Num 21:8-9 - Moses made bronze serpent & put on pole <br>  1Kgs 6:23-29 - temple had engraved cherubim, trees, flowers <br>  1Kgs 7:25-45 - temple had bronze oxen, lions, pomegranates|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I think you are contradicting yourself. <br>  <br>  First of you are rejecting the authority of the Catholic Church but you are claiming authority to do so.

I write as an evangelical Christian who has been involved with missions in the UK for many years, and I've talked to many, many Catholics in that time. The evangelical and fundamentalist myths simply aren't true. If you ask the question, which has preserved the central truths of the faith during the last century, Catholicism or Protestantism? then there is only one answer; Catholicism.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you stop pretending to be confused, and stop pretending to ask serious questions, and spend some time actually talking to Catholics.

Catholics removing books from the Bible that the Catholic Church assembled? <br>  <br>  Yeah, right. Sleep through History and English classes much?<br>  <br>  You owe every Catholic on this Forum an apology for questioning our Christianity and our salvation. We were Christians long before Protestantism was even a gleam in Martin Luther's eye.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Cut me some slack -- surely you realize that Martin Luther REMOVED books from the Bible, don't you? Catholics assembled the Bible, but when Martin Luther broke away from the Church, he came up with a bunch of man-made doctrines of his own.<br>  <br>  He didn't believe in Purgatory, even though it is clearly mentioned in II Maccabees. So rather than abandon his heretical doctrines, Luther removed seven books from the Bible, including Maccabees.<br>  <br>  He wanted to have the Book of James removed, too, because it indicates that faith without works is dead. That was going too far, even for his fellow heretics, and that's why James remains in the Protestant Bible.<br>  <br>  Before you make it sound like you know all there is to know about Catholicism and religion in general, you need to do some serious reading and studying.

zgL6vMCiaa	Praise be to Allaah. <br>  <br>  Note that the things people see in their sleep may come under one of two categories : <br>  <br>  1 – Dreams/visions <br>  <br>  2 – Confused dreams <br>  <br>  Confused dreams in turn are divided into two categories: <br>  <br>  1 – The Shaytaan’s attempts to frighten <br>  <br>  2 – The workings of the subconscious. <br>  <br>  So it may be said that what people see in their dreams may be divided into three categories: <br>  <br>  1- Visions or dreams that come from Allaah.<br>  <br>  2- Attempts by the Shaytaan to frighten us<br>  <br>  3- The workings of the subconscious. <br>  <br>  These categories are indicated by the hadeeth narrated in Saheeh Muslim (no. 2263) from Abu Hurayrah, which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the time (of the Day of Resurrection) draws near, a believer's dream will hardly be false. And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: <br>  <br>  the good dream which is glad tidings from Allah; <br>  <br>  the bad dream which causes distress, which is from the Shaytaan; <br>  <br>  and the dream which represents what a person is thinking about.<br>  <br>  So if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should get up and pray, and not tell people about his dream…” <br>  <br>  It was narrated from ‘Awf ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Dreams are of three types: some are terrifying things from the Shaytaan, aimed at causing grief to the son of Adam; some are things that a person is concerned with when he is awake, so he sees them in his dreams; and some are a part of the forty-six parts of Prophecy.”<br>  <br>  (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 3155) <br>  <br>  It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Dreams are of three types: glad tidings from Allaah, what is on a person’s mind, and frightening dreams from the Shaytaan. If any of you sees a dream that he likes, let him tell others of it if he wishes, but if he sees something that he dislikes, he should not tell anyone about it, and he should get up and pray.”<br>  <br>  (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 3154) <br>  <br>  There follow a number of saheeh ahaadeeth which describe how to deal with what one sees in one’s dream. <br>  <br>  1 – It was narrated that Abu Qutaadah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone sees a bad dream that scares him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him.”<br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3292) <br>  <br>  2 – It was narrated that Abu Salamah said: I used to see such terrible dreams that that I began to shake and have a fever, but did not cover myself with a cloak until I met Abu Qutaadah, and I mentioned that to him. He said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone sees a bad dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him.’”<br>  <br>  (Narrated by Muslim, 2261) <br>  <br>  3 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him turn over, and spit drily to his left three times and ask Allaah of His goodness, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.”<br>  <br>  (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah). <br>  <br>  4 – It was narrated from Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan three times, and turn over onto his other side.”<br>  <br>  (Narrated by Muslim, 2262). <br>  <br>  5 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us the difference between good dreams and bad dreams. It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “If any one of you sees a dream that he likes, it is from Allaah, so let him praise Allaah for it and tell people about it. But if he sees something other than that, that he dislikes, it is from the Shaytaan, so let him seek refuge with Allaah from its evil and not mention it to anyone, for it will not harm him.” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7045). <br>  <br>  So it is clear that good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams which a person dislikes come from the Shaytaan, so he has to seek refuge with Allaah from their evil. <br>  <br>  6 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him get up and pray, and not tell people about it.”<br>  <br>  (Narrated by Muslim, 2263). <br>  <br>  7 – It was narrated from Jaabir that a Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I dreamt that my head was cut off and I was chasing it.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rebuked him and said: “Do not tell anyone how the Shaytaan is messing about with you in your dreams.” <br>  <br>  (Narrated by Muslim, 2268) <br>  <br>  So we may sum up from these ahaadeeth the most important points about what a person should do if he sees a dream that he dislikes, as follows: <br>  <br>  1- He should know that this dream is from the Shaytaan who wants to cause him grief, so he should annoy the Shaytaan by not paying any attention to him.<br>  <br>  2- He should seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan.<br>  <br>  3- He should seek refuge with Allaah from the evil of this dream.<br>  <br>  4- He should spit drily to his left three times, i.e., blowing with a little bit of saliva. <br>  <br>  5- He should not tell anyone about it.<br>  <br>  6- He should turn over from the side on which he was sleeping, so if he was lying on his left side he should turn over to his right side, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  7- He should get up and pray. <br>  <br>  If a person adheres to this etiquette, then we hope that this bad dream will not harm him, as it says in the texts. And Allaah knows best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Islam Q&A|`|4aveC2aaaa	yes, many dreams of mine were from shaytan. they were more nightmares than dreams. any nightmares, or terrible dreams are from the whispers of shaytan/iblees|`|WmU7jhObaa	plenty of times.

For that matter, so do a lot of adults. <br>  <br>  Try imagining how totally creeped out he'd be if he met you and you told him all of this, imagine him backing away slowly and calling security while his wife and kids watched you with pitying looks on their faces. <br>  It might help you reconnect with reality a little- it's what I do whenever I start fantasizing about a favorite actor or movie character (not purposely, but just because I have too practical a mind and instead of imagining the meeting how I want it to be, I see how it would actually happen and the fantasy is ruined.)|`|v3MqaYJIaa	look for a better one|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	ugh, i have a situation almost similar to this except i'm 21 and he's 34(?). i've met my guy before but it was just for an autograph signing so it wasn't that special and i was all nervous. lol. anyways, long story short i ended up learning to play guitar because i was so inspired by this guy, and last time i was at one of his band's shows i gave his band mate a letter to give to him, fan mail, you know. other than that there's not really much that you can do. just enjoy the fact that that person exists and draw inspiration from them and do your best! just live your life and have fun! because at the end of the day, they're just normal people like you and me. <br>  <br>  ps. though it would be really unlikely, one of my goals as a musician is to open for or tour with their band. :D

HqG4MDxGaa	The purpose of the U.N., as I have slowly come to understand it, is to gradually? (or maybe not so gradually, with the way things are going in today's world) to work toward a one-world government. In fact, it's also aligned with many other such "organizations" such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), WTO (World Trade Organization), the EU (European Union), CFR (Council of Foreign Relations), etc. - In fact, right now, as I have come to understand it, they are working towards an African Union, an Asian Union and soon, a North American Union (NAU), which will try to obliterate borders between the Canada, U.S. and Mexico. In fact, why do you think it is that some of Mexico's drug wars are "able" to leak over into U.S. territory near the border and nothing seems to be done? And how is it that such "terrorists" that tried to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge are able to even get into this country so freely, without hassle? And why does it seem like nearly the whole entire world is in on this whole entire "lets democratize the whole entire world!" thing? Hhhhmm, something about that seems kind've fishy, doesn't it?

Explains The Religion of the People of Israel: “Acts in imitation of the deity were regarded as service to the god. .?.?. [The sex goddess] Ashtart had a number of men and women ministrants who were described as consecrated persons .?.?. They consecrated themselves in her service to prostitution.” Adds scholar William?F. Albright: “At its worst, however, the erotic aspect of their cult must have sunk to extremely sordid depths of social degradation.” The worship of phallic “sacred poles,” child sacrifices, magic, binding with spells, incest, sodomy, and bestiality—all of these became ‘the way of the land’ in Canaan.—Exodus 34:13; Leviticus 18:2-25; Deuteronomy 18:9-12.<br>  <br>  God, on the other hand, is “mighty in holiness.” He could not tolerate such degradation in his worshipers. (Psalm 15) So, unlike the degrading Canaanite gods, God elevated his people. Uttering the words Peter would later quote, God repeatedly exhorted: “You should prove yourselves holy, because I Jehovah your God am holy.”—Leviticus 11:44; 19:2; 20:26.|`|TMb076n6aa	They can come from both.

AA10292210	This is an interesting question and one I have had.There is judgment that we are actually required to make as Christians.Jesus said "Judge righteous judgement."He said "by their fruits ye shall know them."He intended for us to make judgements,but not to condemn.Saying a erson will go to hell if they don`t turn to God is not judging.It`s telling them right.Just saying they are going to hell,period..that is judging.However,you are not accountable for what your Pastor does,but you ARE accountable for what you harbor in your heart toward him.You must have a gentle heart even to those who treat you badly and rub you the wrong way,but I don`t think a person is required to sit under a Minister that they don`t feel has their interest in mind.Don`t follow a blind leader.Pray and ask God what you should do.He can work it out so that you will have done nothing wrong in the end.|`|KWjfMo1gaa	I think when the Bible says thou shalt not judge, its referring more to their spirit.  As in, if you see a man sinning, you can't say, "Oh he's a horrible person." or, "He's definately going to hell."  Although we should try not to be so judgemental, I don't think its a black mark against you or anything haha|`|lOgwTGYnaa	No, the feelings are not unChristian. If I see anybody doing something jerkish or to rip off people it irks me too. That doesn't mean I hate them.

You can change churches if you want. <br>  <br>  *Try to have mercy.|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	I am curious if other church members feel the same way.  Church boards are to help the church decide if that person is worth keeping as a pastor.    But yet another church sounds like a great move.  I live near an Adventist ghetto.  Around these parks when people aren't happy in one church they go to the one down the road a few miles and keep searching until they found one that suits their needs.<br>  Sounds to me as if this matter is something you need to pray about.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	you should pray before changing churches and ask God if that is the right thing to do.<br>  as far as judging,we can judge sin,but we can not judge on whether or not someone should go to hell.<br>  <br>  if I say what the bible says about heaven and hell and who goes where,that is  NOT judging the person,that is just telling what God said about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Your pastor might have a lot of airs but try to focus on what he is saying and not how he is saying it.  Maybe he has a thing or two to teach you.|`|AA10014750	Ma'am, we allhave personality' quirks. Judge in the sense of whether you can work with him or not on issue X.

I think you should look inward and see what it is that has been said that has personally offended you and see if YOU line up with scripture or if your just reacting in the flesh.<br>  <br>  Of course I could be all wrong because we have a tiny little slice of situation with Absolutely no second witnesses and no testimony from the pastor.

The Kingdom of God is at hand!|`|YLW7cEjkaa	What does he say that makes you think that? I don't think you should leave that church just because you think he's pompous, because that would be judging his heart and you can't know what he really feels.

Be more careful next time, since you didn't use protection, STD's aren't the only thing you need to keep an eye out for.|`|beemNaN6aa	You should go to the clinic.

It is important, however, to distinguish between race and culture.|`|Of4BR8p2aa	I know of one or two white women who find Asian men attractive. Unfortunately Asian men do not get the celebrity attention Black, Latin and White men get. Blame it on Hollywood and Madison Avenue. These two institutions are the ones which determine what's "cool." From what I have seen of Asian men they are well educated, mannered, groomed and polite. They work hard and earn excellent salaries. In many ways I envy their intelligence and scholarship. I wish I could do so well. In short, if white girls or girls of any color or ethnicity for that matter do not find Asian men attractive, it could be that Asian men are too good for them. "Bad boys" who produce nothing except chaos, mayhem and tragedy seem to be the preference. Sorry ladies, I call them as I see them. <br>  <br>  PS<br>  <br>  I am not Asian|`|AA10880314	I thought it was more the other way around actually.

140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	It was the exposure of ethical and Biblcally wrong practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Martin Luther confronted the Church and began the Protestant movement. Among other things, his actions were instrumental to people beginning to read the Bible. <br>  <br>  Guttenburg's invention, the printing press, was first used to print the Bible mechanically in mass quantities, thereby affording the masses to read the Bible for themselves instead of relying on the Parish priest to interpret it to them.|`|iHDYncuXaa	In the early 16th century the Roman Catholic Church was in need of reform. The papacy had become an Italian political power, many of the higher clergy were concerned with worldly authority, and moral standards were low. With such an example, the parochial clergy showed little spirituality, and outside the universities clerical learning was meagre and misdirected. The Reformation owed much to the Renaissance – humanist scholars were able to show that documents establishing papal supremacy were false, and, even more importantly, by studying Greek and Hebrew, they were able to read the Bible in the original languages. Erasmus was a Dutch scholar who attacked the abuses in the Roman Catholic Church. His translation of the New Testament from the original Greek in 1516 showed that the medieval theory of doing penance had no foundation in Jesus' teaching. The advent of the printing press was an important factor in the spread of Protestant belief.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	Look it up on wikipedia.

About 1/3 of the world says they're Christian but it's not clear how many really believe.|`|nrXCCf76aa	With all of my heart(:<br>  <br>  Wanna know whyyyyy?:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I was about 7, 8 yrs old and it was Thanksgiving and there was a little "situation" with a pedophile if you know what I mean, and so we were planning to have a bonfire so we went to a park, and actually started one in a BBQ pit and so we burnt all the picture of us and that man, gifts, everything that reminded us of him. And at the end, we prayed and I prayed (my exact words) "I pray the fire will burn like crazy" and so we went to our friend's house to eat, and hang out, and before we left back home (another city/town), we went and saw the fire. And it had been 8hrs, and the fire was still burning, like crazy.<br>  <br>  And then, also, on Christmas day, it had been snowing in Corpus Christi, TX, so we were amazed, but we lived in Seadrift (small town, same as the last story) and so we were driving back to Seadrift and there was a bridge, and a deisel was on the other lane and so we were just driving, and my little brother wasn't in his seatbelt, and he was laying there sleeping, and so then we drove, across a piece of ice, and we started spinning (my mom had been on cruise control, which made it spin) and we were just holding on and screaming while the car spun around like an out of control roller coaster. And then when it stopped spinning, we got out and checked all around the car and there wasn't a dent or a scratch or ANYTHING. We could've easily fell over the bridge. And then the diesel driver just sat there in astonishment, so my mom went and told him all of us were okay, and then when my mom got back my little brother woke up and asked what happened. And we took it off cruise control and drove home w/our Christmas miracle.<br>  <br>  And once, this is quite silly, but there was this girl who kept stealing and breaking my stuff. So my mom, sister, and I were thinking of ideas for revenge and I said then started remembering the scripture that said God is Veangance and so I prayed and put it into God's hands. So the next day she came up to me and said "I'm sorry I stole from you, I never will again b/c yesterday my ipod got stolen so I know how it feels"<br>  That was like a shocker like so clearly God had answered my prayers.<br>  <br>  Once, also I always pray that God like seal my dreams in Jesus' name that I only get dreams from God, not my mind or anything and it always works and I had a dream about my grandpa riding a motorcycle down the freeway. And at that time, my grandpa had colon cancer for the 3rd time and so I woke up and told my mom and she said "What do you think that means?" So I answered and told her I thought the motorcycle meant freedom, and I said "Hey, is he free from cancer?" so then like later that day, they called and said they went to the doctor and that the cancer was gone or that he was healed.<br>  And also, another dream, I hadn't even thought of my Uncle Eddie in the longest time, but I had a dream that there was this magazine cover and it said "Eddie back with the chicks" or something. And it was my Uncle Eddie in a black truck and in the truck, he was driving and there was a ghetto lady with a black, strapless top with it, like, pulled down inappropriately and in the back of the truck was my Uumpa (other grandpa). And then I automatically woke up and it was 2am or 4am, can't remember. And the next morning my mom had talked on the phone with my Uncle Eddie who had talked about being with a girl last night and he started having pain in his neck so he went home around 2am (or 4am, can't remember) and I was thinking WHAT IN THE WORLD. That was the EXACT time I woke up. Creepy.<br>  <br>  I had a dream that I was at a circus type of thing-- and the leader guy (in my dream, the leader is the pedophile from the very beginning of my answer) looked like the joker off the cartoon (not Dark Knight) and I looked up and it was like a wooden roof with spaces. And on the spaces, were dead bodies of parents and grandparents. And at that instant I looked towards the "joker" (in my dream, the joker resembled the pedophile) and right when I looked there was a gun in his hand pointed at my mom, and so he then pulled the trigger, grabbed me, and took me to what now seems like it'd be a juvenile detention center. And there were tons of children there. And the new ones had to eat at the same lunch table with him and talk to him all the time. And I had visited the circus where my mom wasn't on one of the planks (she wasn't dead-- the dead people were on the planks of wood) and during lunch that day, my mom broke through a glass window and took me by my hand and we both escaped.<br>  That dream was symbolic. I had this dream twice-- once when I was seven (after the "situation") and once when I was 9 (after trial) and also, my mom had left me in the dream-- I was alone. So in real life, it was the same. She was there physically, but not mentally (she was.. making bad choices and such). And she "got well" when I was 9yrs old.

O4jGlC2caa	Don't pay her a dime.  You offered to originally shampoo the carpet, and she refused.  I also bet she is putting carpet in more than just your room.  Was the carpet old in all the other rooms too?<br>  <br>  1.) Break off all contact with her, and tell your workplace to tell her you are busy.<br>  2.) Go to the police and file a restraining order.  Also, if she shows up at your workplace, tell her to leave you alone.  If she doesn't call the police.  She is trespassing on that company's property.<br>  3.) Gather all evidence you have about this in case she does try to take you to court.  The texts... your canceled checks or receipts from her... anything. The restraining order will help your case though.  Someone who calls someone else's work 5 times a day will come off as completely loony.  Also, the fact that her rent is $850, and she made you pay almost all of it for one room is out-of-control.  Actually, as someone else said, if this is a few hundred dollars she owes you for the rent, you may want to sue HER.<br>  <br>  Don't admit any more fault.  Your story was that you would shampoo the carpet due to the dog hair, and you are sticking to that claim and that claim only.  People do not rip up carpets over dog hair.  I honestly don't think she is even changing the carpet.  I think she is lying.  In fact, you may want to pay a visit to the landlord to find out if she really is changing the carpet.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Do not pay her any more money, get a restraining order against her - who is she to harass you at work and to demand to know when you are paid!? I hope your employer didn't tell her I believe it's illegal to divulge such private information to the general public.<br>  <br>  I think you've paid her more than enough money and you really do need to take out that order to make her stop contacting you. What a horrible "friend".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.|`|FsVZCk0laa	I don't think you should. She pulled up the carpet, and previous to that, you attempted to offer to clean the carpet with the shampooer thing. She took money from you (I hope it's not a substantial amount...), you paid her gas money, bought food for yourself (which her and her family took...), I think you've paid her back enough. <br>  I wouldn't pay her back.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	You don't owe her for the carpet.  You paid her plenty.  It's between her and the landlord and I wouldn't get involved with that.  Keep your records of the payments for rent that you gave her in case she decides to sue you.  (but I doubt that she will).  And I agree with the others that you need a restraining order so this exfriend can't keep calling your job.  You probably need to tell your employer not to talk to this person and that they are bothering you too.|`|PwSAeg3Faa	The next time she calls or comes to see you, tell her you feel you have given her enough money.  It sounds like she was in violation of her landlord's rule (the dogs), so tell her that if the landlord is demanding that she clean the carpets, he can contact you directly for payment.  Ask her to give you her landlord's phone number so you can call him yourself and work it out.|`|e3defce8fefe8aa7e7dbf6bbcf7498fcaa	tell her you will take her to small claims court to re-coup the balance she owes you if she keeps bothering you.  tell her you will take her on Judge Mathis.  He would have a field day with this case.  Seriously, tell her if she keeps coming to your job and calling your work you will file a restraining order against her because what she is doing constitutes harrasment.  <br>  No way do you owe her for the carpet.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	Did you sign amy contracts with your friend when you moved in? She knew the story when 2 dogs moved in with you. She was in the wrong for allowing it if its agnst landlord rules.

AA12360579	Here's another con:  it restricts people from their freedom.<br>  <br>  And another:  there's a 99.9% chance that would get out of hand.  There was something called the Virginia Sterilization Act that sterilized the "insane" and the "feeble-minded" (and yet, strangely, the IQ tests they administered to determine this were much harder for minorities).  Doctors would secretly sterilize women under the guise of an appendectomy.<br>  <br>  If people want to have kids, they should be allowed to at any age, or any state of mental instability.  I would full-heartedly oppose it.<br>  <br>  The government needs to stay out of my sex life, and the sex life of young people, period.|`|w98UhLWvaa	I had something really long written for this question.

Like many other things, I compare it to humans trying to play God. Such a measure is also in support of "Eugenics," which is a "scientific field involving the controlled breeding of humans in order to achieve desirable traits in future generations." The problem with measures of this sort is that the people who intend it for good use only don't stay in charge. Corruption happens and people with more power or money could seriously abuse this kind of power over people's lives. They could easily change the requirements for those allowed to have a child to include things such as paying great sums of money, having only certain genetic traits, being in support of certain legislation, etc. The possibilities for corruption are endless, really. <br>  <br>  Ever since the government began legislating the marriage act in the 1950's, the divorce rates have gone through the roof, as well as a slew of other marriage-related problems. We should not want more government control in our lives, but LESS, always always LESS.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I have a better idea - lets just castrate all MALES over the age of 15 because woman can always get artificially inseminated should they ever want babies.....<br>  <br>   : (|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I would be all for killing anyone that would suggest such a thing, as a stated enemy of humanity.

Do only the well off and rich deserve children? Does someone like me, with chronic pain, get denied the chance to be a mother because of a persistent medical condition (nevermind that I am a damn good mother, if I do say so myself). What happens if, one day, the government decides all people of Middle Eastern descent should not be permitted to have children? How about everyone with an IQ lower than ###? <br>  <br>  No. It's WRONG. There is no good justification for it.

The basis behind religion is "faith" meaning that there is something else besides science. Would you like to prove to me that love exists? It is a feeling. People feel that it is true when they are open-minded. Besides the fact that the "days" in the bible werent actually like 24 hour periods as they are today, the fact that God can do anything makes all the scientific proof go away. I know this sounds dumb, but really God could do anything including create carbon dating. There is really no way to answer this because your 'proof' could all be created by a God who just wants the faithful to return, and if you choose to decide with facts in your brain than with your heart than you are doing what He would think is worng anyways. I know this sounds one-sided, but the fact that God can do anything (including create evolution) makes none of the scientific facts not very good either. Did the civil war exist? Nobody here could see it but it happened, right? We know because of records...like the Bible. Please be informed on religion thoroughly before you go around trying to make others feel bad.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Look, you aren't a scientist. That's clear. The most basic point of scientific progress is to see something to be wrong and THEN (maybe) to know what that is. <br>  <br>  Evolution is definitely wrong. I have studied Plant Biology for 6 years and E. cannot be true. But I don't know what is true.<br>  <br>  You mark yourself as Stone Age by making everybody who disagrees with you into a Creationist. That is totally unscientific.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	None.  The more honest creationists will even admit that the evidence doesn't support their beliefs.<br>  <br>  They simply don't care.<br>  <br>  1-2-3, I am a biologist and evolution is definitely correct.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	goddidit to play a trick on you<br>  <br>  The bible is proof that all fields of scientific study are wrong.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	Nearly everyone does believe in evolution in some form. However natural selection is a far cry from the limitless process imagined by Darwin. A more interesting question is why nore than 60% of the scientists believe in God.<br>  <br>  Natural selection is a far cry from the creative, 'uphill', limitless process imagined by Darwin. But the bottom line is that natural selection, by itself, is powerless to create. It is a process of 'culling', of choosing between several things which must first be in existence. There is no known natural law through which matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or material phenomenon known that can do this.<br>  <br>  As for the physical "evidence" ...The Cambrian Explosion makes a shipwreck of the fossil record for example. Rather than seeing simple life forms such as worms and jellyfish appear to be followed by trilobites and fish and the like, we instead see representations of all major phyla appearing AT THE SAME TIME! Hense the problem of finding "missing links."<br>  <br>  Saying after billions of years anything could have happened is not science!|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	You believe the facts that you look at and what you want to believe I will do the same what kind of "scientific proof" do you have "everything" in the Bible. No seriously a theory that states we evolved from monkeys meaning people make the rules and we can act like animals if we want(this goes aganst the Bible so you don't have to even take a look at it.) aganst (the Bible the word of an all knowing,not able to lie,infalliable,loving,truthful,all powerful, and living God's word, who this God is the reason logic is and the reason you are able to think to look at evidence from an unbias standpoint and seek knowledge and God with all your heart you will find. You and everything in this universe are my proof science supports the Bible but the facts don't support evolution because in evolution it's a bias to fuind absolute evidence to prove it right.) I'm intrested in what kind of knowledge "YOU" who doesn't know everything but believes what you want can come up with to disprove God's word as all false. In your ignorance you ask qustions of people who have a relationship with God instead of getting answers through God's word and seeking knowledge. I have nothing to prove to you and I can't make YOU believe God is it is your choice. Good luck confused man who thinks he is a monkey. OO OO AH AH AH AH!|`|V1MptCMiaa	There are no arguments you could make against evolution.  There's scientific proof it happened and you can walk into any museum to see it.  And since creationism and evolution can't both of happened since in creationism, humans were the first things on earth, god is fake as is creationism.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	Well it is something that the bible has been accurate about the world around us long before scientists even knew what to study. Did not God tell about germs and how to treat diseases and that the earth was round long before man even understood, now it is common knowledge for some of these things, but evolution cannot explain the human voice, with all of it's range, dept and clarity, and why cannot even a trace of the missing link be found, if so much evolving was to happen, we would have found something by now, we found many things before and after but not that particular creature, did something just erase them from the planet.or was it never there in the first place, the bottom line is, If you want to eat and you want money for research, then you need a pretty good story and that is all evolution is, just a good story so people can get paid to find out, that why they are only always close to finding out, just like Vegas, you almost won, just keep playing you'll hit the jackpot, Surrrre!|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	While there is a mountain of evidence FOR evolution, the theory still lacks proof. <br>  "Preponderence of Evidence" is not Scientific Method.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	None with scientific merit.|`|rTplTuEdaa	All i will say that evolution is calling God a liar,,and I am not about<br>    to do that|`|70OClBEQaa	u can say god created evolution but yeah that would be hard wouldnt it be?|`|1a10b6b1127b07e424d93d828a3444d8aa	Most people I speak to that oppose Evolution don't have a clear understanding of what it is, what it means or even what their own dogma says.<br>  <br>  So it is basically ignorance spread via the mouth from one person who does not research it to another.<br>  <br>  wtim68 > I am not sure if you are talking about conservation of matter which would not apply but as for the ability to create new information I believe you are in error.  Evolution works 1st thru mutation where the DNA is changed which creates the trait that natural selection then determines is good, bad , neither.  Mutation can cut the DNA, change it, copy it twice, fuse chromosomes, etc.  So it is WELL within Evolution's ability to create new information.  2nd your argument about the Cambrian explosion is the same basic one I have seen for years which has been debated since it was 1st made by Darwin himself as he is the one who pointed out it could destroy his Theory and had a whole chapter about it in Origin of Species...But other analyses, dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian as well as research that suggests, not proves but suggests, that the movement of the techtonic plates could be an expliantion as the plates movements could destroy older fossils as the plates moved under the mantle and in the prcess of creating mountains.  So while it is an idea that yes could pull rug out of Evolution most data still supports the Evolution side at this time<br>  <br>  <br>  elaine 30705> That is your argument?  That is calls God a liar?  HOW?  Show me specifically where GOD'S own words are...not those of some unshaven barbarian speaking on God's behalf.  Also show me where Evoltion proves there is no God.  If God is so powerful, timeless and mysterious then Evolution would fit right in with God's style instead of the cheap poof tricks of a crappy magician.<br>  <br>  <br>  amy > so because God can erase all scientific laws then science is 100% wrong?  so I guess your computer is working off of faith and not electricity.  Anyway you talk about open mind and checking things out but claim bible as a good record...the same bible that has Jesus in it..a person that as important as he was is not documented in any other source ever anywhere in any way.  That is pure fact by the way there is literally no proof he really existed and his name was not even christ (which means anointed) so we do not even know his last name.  I understand the feeling with your heart but God gave us minds capable of thought so we would THINK and use them to grow, learn.....not to shove our heads as far up each other's rectums as possible and deny the creation around us.|`|Fr7eC5uUaa	To be honest, the bible really has nothing against evolution. It all depends on how you interpret the 7 days of creation.<br>  <br>  I persuaded a 'creationist' to come to terms with evolution, and he, like a very large number of christians, have blended scientific evidence for the big bang, evolution, ect, with their religion.<br>  <br>  He admitted that he was a 'creationist' because he never really thought about it before. Now he is not a creationst, yet still religious, and I am proud of him.<br>  <br>  most of the 'scientific proof' creationists have is total BS, its not really science.<br>  -Atheist.|`|VRHrppXRaa	Look up astrology, and read about things people discovered in astral projection. Just because you can't see it or touch it doesn't automatically mean it's not there. Maybe a higher power (whatever that may be, astrology, aliens, God) gave evolution influence, a little "push", a message to make things begin or evolve a certain way. I don't think that's so far fetched for an open mind, do you?|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	I'm president of the local "fossil hider's" club.  We wander around the earth and hide fossils in lower level rocks for so-called 'scientists' to find.<br>  <br>  it's really a hoot when they uncover one of our stone artifacts (which we make in a little studio here in town) and think it's a hundred million years old.<br>  <br>  Did you read the story of the old human footprints somebody found recently?  that was ours.  pretty cool, huh?|`|j4j8TXSVaa	I went to a carnival once and got taken by a girl because she was telling me what number was on the back of the clothespins.  I bring this up, now, because the evolutionists tell us that the earth is millions of years old without a shred of proof.  Their dating system that proves that so and so lived 10,000 BC or that TREX lived 400 million years ago, is malarkey, and<br>  <br>  we have an unbroken historic record that shows that we were placed here less than 6,000 years ago.|`|F57rNo3haa	I think all creationist are incredibly primitive. Open your mind and try to understand that your brainwashed. Look at the evidence, a humanoid skull from 200 thousand years ago, a cave man found in a glacier, cave paintings. The evidence is endless. Get with the program, your belief borders on fanaticism.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	Well you wouldn't have to disprove it.  God may have created humans with evolution.  The days that are referenced in Genesis may have been billions of years in length.|`|cQCVAq51aa	You can't make any arguments against it. So they incorporate it into their beliefs and say god is responsible for evolution too.IDIOTS|`|OugNf0x6aa	Answers in Genesis is most people's, but it is flawed.

Yfv1AvScaa	no if you turn on the lights you wouldn't see the white circle sometimes your body and your mind can play tricks on you especially when you ar paranoid it might be a hallucination when your TV is making noises probably because of certain movements from the ground when I couldn't sleep I try to go on a trance every time I do that the house make noises I couldn't explain why either but I know it's not a ghost it was from me.|`|jU2fhTCFaa	get ghost busters in. Invite other people around and see whether their willing to see if they notice the same patterns.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	anyone who says there is no such things as ghosts, it is because they have never seen one before. I have seen something, and it was interactive. I'm not gonna say it was a ghost of a person. It was definately in human form , but a shadow. It also did things like slam the door and smack me while sleeping. I only seen it once, but that was enough for me to want to move someplace else. There are things out there that we do not know about. At first I wanted to believe it was something else ,too , until the one day I seen it with my own eyes.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Possible. Get a audio recorder and have an EVP session ask tons of questions and see if you get a response. Also see if you can get an k2 meter. You can get one on Amazon. Maybe there is nothing there but at least you will know. If there is something there contact and you don't want it there contact a local priest and ask them to bless the house. Also do not under any cicumstances use a Ouija board. Bad stuff could happen.|`|VRHrppXRaa	Ghosts are gentle, it's not like you see on tv. It's nothing to worry about...Are they there every day? If you want to know if it's a ghost for sure, take a radio and tune it to a free channel (static). Put in headphones, turn it as loud as you can stand and listen to it for 1 or 2 hours. If you hear anyone talking (usually more than once), you've got ghosts|`|aAZaqTpEaa	search up orbs on google. This is so cool lmao.

Believe it or not, your body really can play tricks on you when you are tired.  The stroking sensation could be from a breeze such as a fan or an open window, or your own breathing.  The swaying from side to side and the mattress lifting up could also be due to fatigue and/or dizziness when you are tired.  Are you sure the clunking sounds are coming from your tv?  If they are, it is probably broken, but it could be coming from the heating, air conditioning, pipes, etc.  Houses have plenty of creaks and bumps.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad though.  Everyone has fears, and we do our best to deal with them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GZUZqazcaa	i agree with the person that said keep aware of your surroundings and that it could be a friend..I watched the Amityville Horror a while back,and I was seeing and hearing stuff after..stuff that I never saw before..and I heard noises and stuff in my house..and i even saw this litlte girl in our kitchen and she was like all yellow..not white like a normal ghost..I asked our preacher to come to pray  at our house and it went away..he said that the saying See no evil,hear no evil,and speak no evil are true because what you see can corrupt your mind and allow evil spirits to enter your body or your surroundings,what you say can do it and what you hear as well.For example,i'm a 9th grader,in my younger years,I never cursed,but the kids around me did,so me hearing them curse so much around me,I started to accept it subconciously and then I started to curse..So i'd get your house checked ASAP!|`|LuqEiapwaa	You may have vertigo. =D<br>  <br>  <br>  No, seriously.

Maybe a masquerade party.  No intense costumes necessary.  But masks.  Use guessing who's behind the mask as a game.  Another idea is coming up with a lot of (non-cheesy) birthday games.  I know a good one that works for any type of party, is the "you can't say that" game.  As each guest walks through the door, put a necklace on them (masquerade beads?) and tell them one word (the same word for everyone) that they are NOT allowed to say during the entire party.  If they slip up and are busted, the person who busted them, takes their necklace and the guest with the most necklaces at the end of the party gets something really COOL.  Pick a word that's really hard NOT to say.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what city you live in, but try seeing if you have any go kart racing places near you.  Try an amusement park.  Of course, this kind of stuff gets costly.<br>  <br>  You could also search on Google or Yahoo! for birthday themes and ideas.

You don't know Buddha is stupid because you don't that belief and i bet you haven't tried.

Just because they believe in a higher power that they do not name 'God', does not mean God is not present with them. Not all see the 'way' of Jesus as the only way to heaven.

YaMdGqxlaa	He says less to mean more. This is called a litote. <br>  In rhetoric, litotes[1] is a figure of speech in which, rather than making a certain statement directly, a speaker expresses it even more effectively, or achieves emphasis, by denying its opposite. For example, rather than merely saying that a person is rather attractive (or even very attractive), one might say that he is "not unattractive."<br>  <br>  Very charming. Don't leave him.|`|YoRRVvCGaa	It means he's drawing closer to you; he wants to be with you.  DON"T LEAVE!|`|98XPkvSqaa	It's just a bit of an understatement.

LOL<br>  <br>  Edited to add: Actually benitocanadian13, at last count in the US in 2001, there were well over 100,000 people identifying as Pagan. There were also over 100,000 Wiccans, many of whom also worship the old gods. And those were just the people who felt comfortable enough to be open about their beliefs!

Fold the paper over to form an invitation card. On the front, write “Bella and Edward invite you to…” in chalk, and provide all of your Twilight party details inside. Hole-punch the card and attach the vampire teeth with a white ribbon. Hand-deliver or mail your invitations to your guests. Make sure to ask them to wear their teeth to your party. You may also ask your guests to dress up as their favorite Twilight character, too.<br>  <br>  A good time to hold this party is dusk moving into night…the time when vampires come out to play!<br>  <br>  Decorate your party area with black and red decorations, including balloons, streamers, and tableware. The plastic vampire teeth would also make great napkin rings. Hopefully, it will be raining to give the feel of Forks. Place a sign on the front door, stating “Forks, Washington” for authenticity. Make sure to place bright red apples throughout the party area. If you can find Twilight movie posters, even better. Using the Internet, collect all of the best Twiight fan art and create a large collage to place in your party area, too. Scatter red candies all over. The Harry Potter Blood Pops are another good decoration and treat for this party. Also, Amazon has the Twilight soundtrack, which would be great to have as mood music for your party Host a party in grand Cullen style to celebrate the release of Twilight. Incorporate different parts of the characters and book into your theme party. Then, hit the theatres to see the book come to life on the big screen. <br>  <br>  Go Grand, Just Like Alice. Nobody can throw a party like Alice. Rival her party planning skills by pulling out all the stops.The cutouts are a fun party idea but they're not right for everyone. You can print out some pictures of the cast of Twilight and put them into picture frames and scatter them about the room. You can get tiny lights in black or red and decorate with them. You can even stand the books around the room. The main colors on the books are red and black and those colors would make for quite a dramatic decorating touch.Twilight Party Game Ideas <br>  You can play games that relate to the movie. Twilight trivia is a fun party game, but the kids today really know their trivia so be sure to have a couple sets of trivia questions. Make the second one more difficult than the first so it's a challenge to everyone.<br>  <br>  hope i helped and sorry its long but its worth reading|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Decorate it in red for blood put up posters of twilight wach the movie reinacte it the script is on twilight script at Imsdb and also you can read your favorite parts from the book and the you can spin the bottle and you have the picture of the guys of twilight and thats the one your meant for. Then you could tape that guys face to you pillow make it a sleep over. Also make twilight personalized teeshirts that have quotes on them fake blood and picture even. And you can all wear blue to stand for Edwards Favorite color. Last you can make a fort where you can hang posters of Edward and put the books there . Make sure to have plunty of snacks and refreshments at the party esspically a red apple , also bring a flower, red ribbon, and chess board . You can also make up your own script for movies 2-4 .

I don't believe there is a gene that makes me like redheads, it's just my personal preference, so then, what, in that logic, makes it seem like being gay is *Genetic*? My parents aren't gay. No one in my family is gay besides me. I swagger like a guy and when I was younger, I liked playing in the mud and dirt. I chose cops & robbers over playing house and getting married. Testosterone???

The data of life's experiences are processed through the sexual software into the circuits of identity. I suspect the sexual software is a mixture of both genes and environment, in much the same way the software of a computer is a mixture of what's installed at the factory and what's added by the user--never assuming that one or the other is omnipotent. Like all complex behavioral and mental states, homosexuality is neither exclusively biological nor exclusively psychological, but results from an as-yet-difficult-to-quantitate mixture of genetic factors, intrauterine influences, postnatal environment (such as parent, sibling and cultural behaviour), and a complex series of repeatedly reinforced choices occurring at critical phases of development.<br>  <br>  Behaviours are complex traits involving multiple genes that are affected by a variety of other factors. Even though, yes, genes in themselves cannot directly specify any behaviour or psychological phenomenon, Ithey direct a particular pattern of RNA synthesis, which in turn may influence the development of psychological dispositions and the expression of behaviours. Behavioural genetics always acknowledges both environmental and genetic influences on behaviour--never assuming that one or the other is omnipotent. Evidence indicates that sexual orientation is genetically influenced but not hardwired by DNA, and that whatever genes are involved represent dispositions, not predeterminations.|`|bRRNYsK8aa	i totally agree with you on that one, though no one ik seems to think so. lol. being gay isn't a personal choice, imo, because then you could " turn straight " any time you wanted to, which could so never happen.! yet even pplz who agree to that still are all like against the " gay at birth " theory. kind of hypocritical, imo. lol. :P<br>  <br>  some say it's hereditary to be homosexual, though if that were true then you're WHOLE family would be gay ... uhm, then how the hell would you get here.? xD<br>  <br>  some say it's based on your environment & the pplz surronding you who influence your " choice " to be gay. errrrrnt. that's wrong too. lol. i mean, if a girl is adopted by two lesbians, does that mean she too will be a homosexual just for the fact of having been raised by two who were.? uhm ... of course not. that'd just be silly. lol. :P<br>  <br>  no one can " decide " this for you - not even you.! it's inside of you, set to be a part of you ... as are the rest of your humanly mind-set traits. it just takes some longer to discover it than others, with coincidences on the side to make them believe otherwise, wehn rly it was always tehre ... idk. that's just my thougths. :]|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	I agree 100% that I was born gay.<br>  <br>  That said, I'd rather raise a child as a homosexual rather then a heterosexual because I think I'd push my kid to be/do anything he/she wanted to be, as opposed to some society conformity.<br>  <br>  EDIT: 2 thumbs down? I was defending the honor of a gay man to have children! The hell? lol|`|a1hevOG2aa	I agree with ya a bazzillion percent.

A relationship without trust is not one you need to work at keeping.<br>  Everything else you say does not change anything.<br>  Trust is number one in any relationship.

AA10292210	It has been a long time since I read in the Bible that contains Macabees,but there are many similarities in different books of the Bible.Revelations and Daniel and Isaiah,and Joel.They all have similar passages.For those who do not recognize this book of Maccabees,it is not a different Bible.It is an old book similar to Daniel that was just not included in our modern Bible.There are Old King James version Bibles that contain Maccabees another book of Daniel and the Book of Suzzana|`|WjRqYf6naa	Both are examples of Hebrews choosing death over breaking God's commandments.

My kids are still very young and we're living in the US so I heard it a few times. But anyway..., maybe this story is meant to teach young kids to be more careful with their toys.

I don't know.|`|db9f4e17f5a919d6fbcc6f293a58f828aa	I agree with you and I'm white.

This stems from a period many years ago when Black achievements were not acknowledged whatsoever, so an effort was made to attempt to balance this out by setting aside a time to acknowledge black history as it relates to America. By definition, this is discriminatory, and I do believe in this day and age that it would be more beneficial for us to acknowledge all races equally all year round without a "Race" History Month.<br>  <br>  Ultimately Black History Month is a tradition now and not intended to downplay White History in any respect because historically there has never been a lack of acknowledgement for white contributions to America.|`|lVIdENvqaa	I have an Irish background and I don't get offended when someone says something about  the potato famine.<br>  It's all a bunch of bunk to put so much stock in which race is superior.<br>  There's more to life than thinking who is best in this world.<br>  Harper Lee's book "To kill a Mockingbird" is one of a billion great novels written in history, and it does give you thought as to how blacks were treated in years gone by.<br>  It also lets us see how far we, as a nation, has come since those days and we continue to improve in our relationships with other nationalities and cultures.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Hmmm I'm Asian and I want a Japanese American Month lol.<br>  <br>  Anyways.  I don't necessarily think your coworker is racist.  It's just that she doesn't see really what the idea of black channels and things like that is.  I agree with you otherwise, USA doesn't need a white recognition month.  A black channel is for the advancement of colored people, because they are generally disadvantaged and aren't given chances to be featured on TV and such...  And because of the discrimination colored people need a source of pride, you know, a place to say "I'm black and proud!"<br>  <br>   ... Historically, "I'm white and proud!" = "I'm white and proud and better than the rest of you!"  And that historical concept hasn't completely disappeared yet and people often think of the extended idea when they hear "I'm white and proud" kind of exclamation.  Simply put, it's touchy.  There really isn't a logical argument around it, because though technically having a white channel isn't a big problem, there are PEOPLE who get OFFENDED by it, and that's a problem.  And whatever the reason you don't want people offended.<br>  <br>  Your coworker is also probably thinking black and white as either-or or a if-one-has-so-should-the-other kind of thing.<br>  Your coworker is also feeling some sort of competition between races, which is a legacy of racism, not that your coworker is actually racist.  Pride doesn't equal competition yet a lot of people think that way.<br>  You know, that's kind of like saying "the guys' bathroom has urinals, and the girls' bathroom doesn't!  Isn't that sexist?  The girl's bathroom needs urinals too!"<br>  Um, duh, the girls' bathroom doesn't NEED it, it has nothing to do with sexism.<br>  Besides, whining that because there's a black channel because there is no white channel sounds like a petty kid's jealously.  The black channel isn't saying anything negative about whites or any other race, and of course, a lot of white people must appear on it anyways.  There is no problem with having it, and there is no problem with not having a white channel.  Why complain?|`|zAfKvhW4aa	If you had ever read about the discrimination against the, "untouchables" or  the Dravidian people of India, you'd see that you are in a much better place then these people.<br>  <br>  Their is far more discrimination that occurs around the world much worse than in America. <br>  <br>  Every race ( white, black, brown, yellow, red) will continue to feel discriminated against for as long as people have personal preferences(even within are OWN families).<br>  <br>  Discrimination according to skin brightness vs. darkness occurs greatly by Black Africans by other Black Africans.<br>  <br>  Including by Indians by other Indians (just to name a couple nations).<br>  <br>  Every single nation suffers adversity no matter who you come from or what your race is.<br>  <br>  Rising above discrimination is by perseverance and distinguishment (education).<br>  <br>  Learning to live with other races rather than forming your own groups is paramount, very important to living equally and feeling like your on the same level as others.|`|xpUkgIyRaa	Sounds like racism to me, if one little channel bothers her that much then there seems to be a definite problem. First of all, as you said, America is a white dominate society, there for most of what you see on television is going to be white based. Black channels are simply ways of looking into another culture. Having a white channel would seem pretty pointless, when you could just turn to the next channel and see the same thing. Same concept as maybe they have a white channel in Africa.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	It bothers me that some white people get so angry about black history month as if it's only our history.  Just a minute.  Black American history is American history which means it applies to white Americans as well.  Why people still today don't see us as American is beyond me.|`|8fyEZtyNaa	yeah i sometimes wonder if the whites forget that most things are still catered to them. if whites hate black history  month so much, why dont they start teaching about black contributions during all the other months, besides white men contributions?<br>  <br>  they complain but they dont make the effort to change things to make it truly equal.<br>  <br>  and these so called black channels. most dont even watch anyways, and they arent fully black channels.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	Most of television is catered to the white majority. And no one is stopping any non-black person from watching a black-orientated network. If she is so offended by something like starz-black than she might as well be offended by Telemundo as well. Hell, by her standards channels like WE, Oxygen, and Lifetime are sexist because they are directed at women.|`|1yJWrccXaa	I think any time any race or group of people get special privileges it is racist.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	I totally agree with you.<br>  <br>  Its obvious that you are mature enough to understand.<br>  <br>  Its just like you said it:<br>  <br>  " I think most channels cater to white people anyway, and we don't really need a channel devoted to whiteness.<br>  <br>  It kind of gets to me when white people feel jealous that there's no white history month.<br>  <br>  I think because of the stereotypes of blacks in a white dominant society it's harder for black people to get ahead, but I don't think my co-worker can grasp that concept. I think she is a racist now."<br>  <br>  You hit it right on the nose!|`|hQWucH5uaa	There is a very real racist double standard here in the USA sanctioned by the court systems.  Affirmative action, minority quotas, forced busing are all court ordered institutionalized racisms.  Almost every university has a 'black student center' but not a white student center.<br>  <br>  This institutionalized racism has been a devisive and polarizing condition in the USA for the past 50 years, and is still a politically correct cancer eating away at America.  It solves nothing and perpetuates racism.

sVyH0jTiaa	It said try not to focus yourself too much and give all the information to people about Jehovah, Jesus and the words of God (Bible).<br>  You can't go on learning yourself what you have reading the Bible for yourself and you must tell everyone about the Bible and share with people that you have learned or know the truth.<br>  What I am saying is to share people with the good news.<br>  Tell people that you witnesses what Jesus  bear thorough witness to good news of what Jehovah is incredible love to all of us.|`|k03dYskYaa	Oh that's nice you asked that question, cause I just finished going over that lesson. It's really good and encouraging. <br>  Jesus said "Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations" Matt 28:19,20.<br>  All Christians were to share in preaching, not just the apostles. That's obvious because he spoke to 500 disciples, not just the apostles.<br>  Bearing thorough witness involves the door to door ministry as well as other avenues of service. Paul said "while I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house."|`|XSEWADI0aa	Are You Bearing Thorough Witness?<br>  <br>  “I thoroughly bore witness.”—Acts 20:21.<br>  <br>  WHAT one thing marked the ministry of Paul more than any other? It was his thoroughness in teaching the Word of God. Paul himself said: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” Then he goes on to say: “I thoroughly bore witness.” (Acts 20:20, 21) This theme or predominating thought of thorough witnessing comes impressively to the fore particularly in the book of Acts, where Paul’s wholehearted devotion to his preaching and teaching even under prison bonds is borne out in the words: “And he explained the matter to them by bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God and by using persuasion with them concerning Jesus from both the law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.”—Acts 28:23.<br>  <br>  2 Paul was no skimpy giver. He was wholehearted, generous, spontaneous, helpful and ever alert to seize his privileges and responsibilities to bear thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God. He really meant what he said, and he said what he meant. The people in Paul’s preaching territory saw him in their homes. There was no shortage of visits from Paul and his fellow apostles in apostolic times. There is no shortage today in the New World society. Now can you see even further reasons why so many were attracted to the message that Paul bore and to the same message being borne today by those bearing thorough witness concerning the kingdom of God?<br>  <br>  “BECOME IMITATORS OF ME”<br>  <br>  3 Consider for a moment the real significance behind Paul’s words at 1?Corinthians 11:1: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.” How did Paul thoroughly copy Jesus in his manner of preaching, yes, his whole life pattern, and thus set a sterling example for true Christians today? An examination of the Scriptures clearly shows that Paul carefully copied Jesus’ manner and procedure of declaring the good news. Please note how thoroughly he did this. For example, Jesus preached publicly, in the streets, synagogues and busy thoroughfares as well as from house to house and village to village. Jesus also made return visits on interested persons, conducted Bible studies with them and, on many occasions and in numerous places, conducted public meetings. (Matt. 5:1, 2; 10:5-14; John 21:15-17) Paul likewise participated in all these features of the Christian ministry. (Acts 20:20; 15:36; Gal. 6:6; Acts 20:7) What a wonderful example he set for all Christians who want to bear thorough witness to the kingdom of God!<br>  <br>  4 Of Jesus’ public ministry it was said: “He journeyed through from city to city and from village to village, teaching and continuing on his journey to Jerusalem.” “And you taught in our broad ways.” (Luke 13:22, 26) Comparably, of Paul’s ministry it is stated: “Consequently he began to reason in the synagogue with the Jews and the other people who worshiped God and every day in the market place with those who happened to be on hand.” (Acts 17:17) Yes, “every day” Paul preached in public places, just as Jesus did. So today Jehovah’s witnesses often preach on the street. Why? Because some persons cannot be reached at their homes but may be reached by preaching in public places. Have you not often seen these active ministers in the busy thoroughfares, in the marketplaces, wherever people are gathered, courteously offering them the message of life as contained in The Watchtower and Awake!? Preaching in the streets, synagogues and marketplaces was done by Jesus, by Paul, and is done by true Christians today. Have you ever seen your minister copy this example?|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	Just think of it the “good news” was spreading like wildfire. There was no dampening the joy and zeal of the apostles. When lawyer Gamaliel’s wise advice to “let them alone” was heeded, they “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of [Jesus’] name.” And how did they react to the Sanhedrin’s order to “stop speaking upon the basis of Jesus’ name”? The account tells us that “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.”—Acts 5:38-42.<br>  <br>   Like those apostles, where we have the freedom we search “from house to house” for those who are worthy to receive the “good news.” When we find them, we can revisit them and aid them through a free Bible study in the home. Of course, certain aspects of our work are different today, in that we do not go to temples or synagogues to preach. Also, we now have the help of the printed page, automobiles and other means of travel to facilitate our work. Thus home visits are an admirable way of distributing the printed message and returning to teach God’s Word to those who respond to the “good news.”<br>  <br>  the King James Version states: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”However, this committee, by a wide circulation of its Revised Standard Version, cannot destroy the name of the only true God of the universe, Jehovah. Why? Because Jehovah’s witnesses are still alive, and they will be busier and more energetic than ever announcing and making known Jehovah’s name to all kindreds and tongues in all nations of the earth.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	The meaning of the  term witness has been changed by christianity, from being at an incident to saying you were at an incident|`|hYQTOabRaa	Well said Friend of Jah!|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Jehovah's Witnesses are doing just this in over 230 lands and over 400 different languages worldwide! We make God's name Jehovah known and also 'bear thorough witness to the truth' the bible teaches. Here is a wonderful article on the subject:<br>  <br>  Determined to Bear Thorough Witness<br>  “He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness.”—ACTS 10:42.<br>  THE Italian army officer assembled his relatives and friends for what became a turning point in God’s dealings with humans. That God-fearing man was Cornelius. The apostle Peter told the group that the apostles were ordered “to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness” about Jesus. Peter’s witness bore abundant fruit. Uncircumcised Gentiles received God’s spirit, were baptized, and came in line to be kings in heaven with Jesus. What an outcome of Peter’s bearing thorough witness!—Acts 10:22, 34-48.<br>  2 That was in 36?C.E. About two years earlier, a fervent opposer of Christianity had a life-changing experience. Saul of Tarsus was on his way to Damascus when Jesus appeared to him and said: “Enter into the city, and what you must do will be told you.” Jesus assured the disciple Ananias that Saul would bear witness “to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.” (Read Acts 9:3-6, 13-20.) When with Saul, Ananias said: “The God of our forefathers has chosen you .?.?. because you are to be a witness for him to all men.” (Acts 22:12-16) How seriously did Saul, later known as Paul, take the assignment to bear witness?<br>  He Did Bear Thorough Witness!<br>  3 It would be fascinating to study in detail all that Paul did thereafter, but for now, let us focus on a talk Paul gave in about 56?C.E., as set out in Acts chapter?20. Paul presented this discourse near the end of his third missionary trip. He had disembarked at Miletus, a port on the Aegean Sea, and had sent for the elders of the Ephesus congregation. Ephesus was some 30?miles [50?km] away, though the trip was longer over winding roads. You can imagine how excited the Ephesian elders were when they received Paul’s message. (Compare Proverbs 10:28.) Still, they would have to make arrangements to travel to Miletus. Did some of them have to take time off from work or to close their shops? Many Christians today do so to be sure that they will not miss even one session of their yearly district convention.<br>  4 What do you think Paul did in Miletus during the three or four days until the elders arrived? What would you have done? (Compare Acts 17:16,?17.) Paul’s words to the Ephesian elders provide some insight. He described his pattern of life over the years, including when he earlier was in Ephesus. (Read Acts 20:18-21.) With no fear of contradiction, he said: “You well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia .?.?. I thoroughly bore witness.” Yes, he was determined to carry out his commission from Jesus. How did he do so in Ephesus? One way was by witnessing to Jews, going where many would be found. Luke reports that when Paul was in Ephesus about 52-55?C.E., he ‘gave talks and used persuasion’ in the synagogue. When the Jews “went on hardening themselves and not believing,” Paul turned to others, relocating in the city but still preaching. He thus bore witness to Jews and Greeks in that large city.—Acts 19:1, 8,?9.<br>  5 Some who became Christians qualified in time to be elders, those to whom Paul spoke in Miletus. Paul reminded them of the method he had used: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” In our time, some people have claimed that Paul was here referring merely to making shepherding calls on believers. But, no. The description ‘teaching publicly and from house to house’ mainly applied to evangelizing among unbelievers. That is plain from his next words. Paul said that he had been witnessing “both to Jews and to Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.” Clearly, Paul had been bearing witness to unbelievers, who needed to repent and put faith in Jesus.—Acts 20:20,?21.<br>  6 In an extensive analysis of the Christian Greek Scriptures, one scholar said of Acts 20:20: “Paul had spent three years in Ephesus. He visited every house, or at least he preached to all of the people (verse 26). Here is scriptural warrant for house to house evangelism as well as that carried on in public meetings.” Whether he literally visited every house, as this scholar claims, or not, Paul did not want the Ephesian elders to forget how he had borne witness and with what result. Luke reported: “All those inhabiting the district of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.” (Acts 19:10) But how could “all” in Asia have heard, and what might this suggest about our bearing witness?<br>  7 By Paul’s preaching in public locations and from house to house, many heard his message. Do you think it likely that all those who did hear stayed in Ephesus, none moving elsewhe

Out of these there are four classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:<br>  <br>    anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam<br>    anukulyena krsnanu-silanam bhaktir uttama<br>  <br>     "One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service."<br>     When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.<br>     Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.|`|xxEhpytpaa	Faith, however I do have a fear of God's wrath.

(1?Peter 2:17) However, such fear is not abject terror of a cruel god. It is reverential awe because of who Jehovah is. It is also the fear of displeasing him. Godly fear is noble and uplifting, not depressing or terrifying. Jehovah, “the happy God,” wants his human creation to enjoy life. (1?Timothy 1:11) To do so, however, we have to live in harmony with God’s requirements. For many, that means a change in lifestyle. All who make the necessary change experience the truthfulness of the psalmist David’s words: “Taste and see that Jehovah is good, O?you people; happy is the able-bodied man that takes refuge in him. Fear Jehovah, you holy ones of his, for there is no lack to those fearing him.” (Psalm 34:8,?9) Because they have a good relationship with God, all who fear Jehovah lack nothing of lasting value.<br>  4 Notice that as it applied in his day, David dignified his men by calling them “holy ones.” They were part of God’s holy nation. They were also risking their lives to follow David. Although they were on the run from King Saul, David was confident that Jehovah would continue supplying their basic needs. David wrote: “The maned young lions themselves have had little on hand and gone hungry; but as for those seeking Jehovah, they will not lack anything good.” (Psalm 34:10) Jesus gave similar assurance to his followers.—Matthew 6:33.<br>  5 Many of those who listened to Jesus were from the disadvantaged, lowly class of Jews. Thus, Jesus “felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matthew 9:36) Would such lowly ones have the courage to follow Jesus? To do so, they would need to cultivate the fear of Jehovah, not of men. Jesus said: “Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more. But I will indicate to you whom to fear: Fear him who after killing has authority to throw into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One. Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them goes forgotten before God. But even the hairs of your heads are all numbered. Have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.”—Luke 12:4-7.<br>  6 When fearers of Jehovah are pressured by their enemies to stop serving God, they may call to mind Jesus’ counsel: “Everyone that confesses union with me before men, the Son of man will also confess union with him before the angels of God. But he that disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.” (Luke 12:8,?9) Those words have strengthened Christians, especially in lands where true worship is banned. Such ones keep on praising Jehovah discreetly at Christian meetings and in their public ministry. (Acts 5:29) Jesus sets the best example in displaying “godly fear.” (Hebrews 5:7) Speaking of him, the prophetic Word foretold: “Upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, the spirit .?.?. of the fear of Jehovah; and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah.” (Isaiah 11:2,?3) Hence, Jesus is eminently qualified to teach us the benefits of godly fear.<br>  7 All who follow Jesus’ example and who obey his teachings are, in effect, responding to an invitation similar to one that David extended: “Come, you sons, listen to me; the fear of Jehovah is what I shall teach you.” (Psalm 34:11) It was natural for David to address his men as “sons” because they looked to him as their leader. For his part, David gave spiritual help to his followers so that they could be united and enjoy God’s favor. What a fine example that is for Christian parents! Jehovah has given them authority regarding their sons and daughters to “go on bringing them up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” (Ephesians 6:4) By daily discussing spiritual matters with their children and by conducting a regular Bible study with them, parents help their young ones to enjoy life in the fear of Jehovah.—Deuteronomy 6:6,?7.<br>  <br>  <br>  FAITH:<br>  <br>  Faith Gives Us Courage<br>  5 Faith strengthens us to declare God’s word with courage. Enoch courageously foretold the execution of divine judgment. “Look!” he said, “Jehovah came with his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” (Jude?14,?15) Upon hearing such words, Enoch’s godless enemies surely wanted to kill him. Yet, he boldly spoke out in faith, and God “took him” by putting him to sleep in death, apparently without allowing him to suffer its pangs. (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5) We do not experience such miracles, but Jehovah answers our prayers so that we can declare his word with faith and courage.—Acts 4:24-31.<br>  6 By faith Noah “constructed an ark for the saving of his household.” (Hebrews 11:7; Genesis 6:13-22) Noah was also “a preacher of righteousness” who courageously declared G|`|4swYFtsSaa	allah is the devil i dont get why muslims are satanists..why do they want to go to hell i dont get it, thankfuly american has steped in to help them see the light in the hellish country|`|XZKh86qsaa	Neither - there is no believing here.

If you're in a relaxed setting, it probably won't be that hard, but if you're dealing in business, I would suggest investing in a professional translator, because of the exactness and politeness demanded of such a setting.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	don't overvalue the importance of tones...<br>  some "wonderful teachers" like to scare their students in order to get more moneyu from them...<br>  that's not so serious...<br>  of course if you just say a syllable, there can be more than 50 different meanoings but as for a word with consits of two syllables, the variantion rate can be from 5 to ten, sometimes less...<br>  a complete sentences in a certain context (situation) assures people would understand you for 100%...<br>  however tones are nothing difficult... if you practice long enough you will be able to hear and reproduce them easily...|`|ae92e8a121c399eb3751b67c6557c92aaa	"what you're trying to say from the context even though you've used the wrong tone?"<br>  <br>  From experience, no. Tones are as important in distinguishing words as are sounds. Let me give you an example in English.<br>  <br>  Say you want to say the following,<br>  <br>  "The weather is nice today"<br>  <br>  If you mess up the tones in Mandarin, it can mean<br>  <br>  "Enter paddy field sweet strange lung colon like"<br>  <br>  Not only you mess up the meaning, you mess up the grammar as well. It makes it very difficult to understand what you mean. Remember, Mandarin has many homonyms (same sound and tone, but different meaning), so it is already a difficult task to contextualize what people are trying to say even when they use the right tones.|`|JWZbDoZHaa	That really depends on how different your pronunciation is. If the tones are wrong for all the words, it won't be surprising if the other party can't understand.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, for Mandarin, one sound can already mean many words, so getting the tone wrong can mean an entirely different word with very different meanings. Here's an example, "buy" is "mǎi" (third sound), while "sell" is "mài" (fourth sound). So getting the tones wrong can result in a sentence with the opposite meaning.<br>  <br>  It's hard to gauge without hearing you speak. I was searching on youtube for "worst case scenarios", such as Rachel Griffiths and Steven Weber here at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnxDEX30Znk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnxDEX30Z...</a> and yes, I'm afraid that I couldn't quite comprehend Griffiths regardless of the number of times I heard her attempt to speak Mandarin. So it really depends on how off you are.<br>  <br>  If you were to stick to simple and short sentences, and get at least some of the tones right for the keywords, communication is still possible. It might take some time for you to be understood, so be patient. And if all else fails, there's always non-verbal language!|`|vgyIefZpaa	Hey, I'm an ABC, and like many of them, I can understand but not speak.  I'm taking some Chinese courses now, but when I butchered the tones, my parents couldn't get it all the time.<br>  <br>  It all really depends on the context.  My parents tell me it's uncomfortable to listen to someone who is speaking with wrong tones.  As long as the context has been built up, I think they understand, but if you were to start a conversation with incorrect tones, they may just keep asking you to say it again.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that you have heard people with off tones.  It sounds unnatural.  Most Chinese people are smart so they'll get it if you get the words, but not tones as long as you have context.

pGf4mIw9aa	My friend if you depend on the bible to find God, you will be looking for a long time. God is with you, but he is with you in spirit. Not within the book. God want's to have a personal relationship between you and him. Not the bible. Let me ask you this. If your parents were to die, would their messages still be implanted within your heart. God is within our spirit, not within the book. The book is just a message from God to us to understand him. But once you get past the bible growth, that is when you can go directly to him. Which he is the source. Don't let atheist tell you something they know nothing about. They don't know God because they do not accept the things they do not know. Pray and ask God to reveal himself to you. And believe me, he will. God doesn't want to lose you, but he wants to grow with you. People make God out to be this terrible invisible spirit, but in truth, God is just like any father who is there for his child. If a baby is learning how to crawl, does the mother or father, teaches the baby how to crawl. No they are there to protect them and if they hurt themselves, that is when the parent is there to help them. But a baby will never learn if the parent is always there doing the crawling for them. God sees you as one of his kids. But you have to trust in him. Not putting your whole heart and soul in a book that was written by man. <br>       I am not telling you this because of heresy, I'm telling you this. Because I gave up on God for 17 years when I thought he wasn't there. I just didn't see the things I wanted to see. Remember the bible says, his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts. Trust me my friend he is there. You just have to call on him.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I'm not going to answer your supplementary questions, because I think that you should attempt to come to your own conclusions about them. Don't let people tell you what to think.<br>  <br>  Are you wrong for having doubts? Not at all! Doubt is always portrayed as a bad thing, but I think doubt is essential. Absolute certainty, especially about abstracts like god or moral issues, which will probably never be 100% resolved, is destructive, and even perhaps dangerous. Keep thinking and doubting your convictions.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Yes, you are wrong. And your question shows your wrongness.<br>  <br>  Take this case : Am I wrong, for having my doubts about marrying Susie ?<br>  <br>  Yes, if you are married already.<br>  No, if you aren't.<br>  <br>  Though I don't know you, you could just be trying to justify a treacherous turning of your back on God, assuming you were a believer. <br>  <br>  Read this :<br>  Discourse 11. Faith and Doubt<br>  <a href="http://www.newmanreader.org/works/discourses/discourse11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmanreader.org/works/discou...</a> <br>  <br>  ";—could a man be said to trust in God, and to love God, who was familiar with doubts whether there was a God at all, or who bargained that, just as often as he pleased, he might be at liberty to doubt whether God was good,  or just or mighty; and who maintained that, unless he did this, he was but a poor slave, that his mind was in bondage, and could render no free acceptable service to his Maker; that the very worship which God approved was one attended with a caveat, on the worshipper's part, that he did not promise to render it tomorrow; that he would not answer for himself that some argument might not come to light, which he had never heard before, which would make it a grave, moral duty in him to suspend his judgment and his devotion? Why, I should say, my brethren, that that man was worshipping his own mind, his own dear self and not God; that his idea of God was a mere accidental form which his thoughts took at this time or that,—for a long period or a short one, as the case might be,—not an image of the great Eternal Object, but a passing sentiment or imagination which meant nothing at all. I should say, and most men would agree with me, did they choose to give attention to the matter, that the person in question was a very self-conceited, self-wise man, and had neither love, nor faith, nor fear, nor anything supernatural about him; that his pride must be broken, and his heart new made, before he was capable of any religious act at all.

They know what they've read or been taught, and that's simply not enough. As far as the doubts you're having, it's called thinking, and people do it all the time.

You are human.  God created us with inquisitive minds.  Don't be hard on yourself.<br>  <br>  Reading many (again, not all) of the answers here from both atheists and Christians, I see a tug-o-war going on over your allegiance! Agnostics are most able to relate and are giving the most heart-felt answers.<br>  <br>  On the surface, it all seems selfish.  Like, 'chalk one up for the atheists (or Christians)' if you decide to lean their way.  Not a whole lot of reaching out to you in the place where you are at.  That's what I'd like to try to do.<br>  <br>  I don't know what religion you consider yourself, so I will use my past experiences as a Catholic to explain.  I've talked to God since I was a child.  In prayer, I'd see Him as a bright light way at the end of vast darkness.  I knew He was there and could see and hear me, but I wasn't allowed to get close.  All of this is true, except that I was the one not allowing myself to go to Him.  I did not know this was possible.<br>  <br>  I felt secure knowing that God heard me and cared about me, but the 'relationship' was a distant one.  Like two people corresponding by letter only.<br>  <br>  Once I realized that we were meant to be with Him, in His presence, and have a close relationship as Father and child, everything changed.  I sense Him here with me, and know when I am acting within or outside of His will.  I am not special; everyone has the ability to reach out.  But we each need to take that first step.<br>  <br>  It is His desire to be included in every aspect of our lives.  We ask for His help when we are hurt or upset, but He wants to be acknowledged when you are happy, too.  For instance, I love the sky.  When I see an awesome sunset, I thank Him for painting that beautiful picture for me.  He did so for my pleasure and it certainly got my attention!<br>  <br>  I also asked Him to guide me in writing to you in hopes that something here strikes a chord.  He knows you like no one else and if I was truly open to His instruction, you should be able to recognize His love for you... and that He is calling out to you.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk, I am reachable through email.

Every single part of the cell from the membrane and vacuoles to the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi bodies and DNA-containing nucleus had to come into existence simultaneously, or whatever it was would have died. Every part is necessary for survival.<br>  <br>  Men wrote the Bible but God told them what to write. The people who wrote it were eyewitnesses of the events recorded. Adam was there at the beginning to write about it.<br>  <br>  The religion of evolution, however, makes claims about times when no one was around to witness it, and yet they teach it as fact. No one was there to witness the "Big Bang" when "nothing exploded" and poof, here's the universe, all working and full of design and beauty and order and symbiotic relationships between living creatures (flowers & bees, for example, where each needs the other to survive). No one was there when "the soup came to life", yet "it must have happened" according to textbooks. No one has ever seen nothing explode and create a universe, and no one has ever seen non-living matter come to life without God's power...no one has ever seen any animal produce anything other than its own kind.

QIQNzE11aa	The simple tryth is there is no way to deal with it. You simply survive day by day through it all. It's always extremely hard. Allow yourself time to grieve and allow yourself time to release your emotions. <br>  <br>  In the future there will start to be good days and bad. Some experience guilt when they forgot to think about their deceased loved on for the day or if they had a nice day and laughed. Realize that stuff is normal. There is no singular way to grieve. They put out the 5 steps to grief but grief doesn't really come in steps. You can be dealing with step 2 for a week and suddenly revert back to step one again. Or be on step 5 and accepting it for a month and then slip back to step 2 or 4... there's no rules to grief. Grief is an emotion and emotions have no boundaries. <br>  <br>  Don't try to block it out of your mind, it just makes it harder to deal with in the future. Ask your parents to find a good grief group that you all could go too. They will explain how each person grieves their own way and how there is no right or wrong to it. They will explain that you need to allow yourself to grieve or else it makes it harder later on. They all sit and tell each other about their lost loved ones as well, a tribute to those you love. It helped me quite a bit.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes, let it out.  Cry, as needed. If there is someone near you who will let you talk it all out, do so.   And if there's a hospice or grief counselor in your area, make use of that.<br>  <br>  It is hard enough to lose someone when they're sick, and you know they are dying.  But to lose your grandpa suddenly like that makes it doubly hard.  <br>  <br>  I am really sorry.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.  Losing someone is never easy and an unexpected death is even harder to accept.  Give yourself time to morn and if you can cry. Crying will help you to release the tension and help you cope with what has happened.  It always helps me feel better and able to cope with the loss.<br>  <br>  I lost both my dad and my oldest brother within two years of each other and it was very hard to go through.  You just have to realize that they would want you to remember the good times you had with them and want you to be happy.  Remember it will take time and you will never forget them but knowing that you made a difference in their lives will help you cope with the loss.  My best wishes to you and your family.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I don't know if I can top Kel.<br>  <br>  When you lose somebody, remember the happy times, sometimes it makes it a little worse for a while, but it can help in the long run. And it is worse if it is sudden than if it is a long illness and you have some time to prepare, like if somebody has cancer or something.<br>  <br>  After my Mom died of cancer, for about a year or more, I had a lot of funny dreams. I would not dream she exactly came back to life, but instead of being dead she had been 'away', and was confused somebody else was in her house, or why I had her furniture, or things like that. Or she talked about her 'new friends' and sometimes they were deceased celebrities. It did not bring her back, but I would wake up laughing.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I lost both parents within 3 months, so I know that you are going through a hard time. Remember them with stories with your family members. You need to go through the sadness, it is part of the healing process.|`|1yJWrccXaa	I'm really sorry for your loss.  It is ok to be sad and grieve; actually it is unavoidable.  Talk it out as often as you need to.  And time truly helps.  I know from experience.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	I think you should just let it out.  It's a very sad time - there's no reason to try to hide it.  Let yourself cry it out....but just remember....when the tears are done, life does go on.  It can be hard at first....but time really does help to soften the sense of sadness.<br>  <br>  I lost my grandmother back in '92, and I still miss  her - but these days, I'm able to smile when I think of her.....she still lives on in me.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Don't just think about the sadness, think about the happy times you had with him as well. Death is part of everyone's existance. You're going to be sad, it's ok. Let it out, cry. The only thing that will really make it better is time. That may not be the answer you were looking for but it's the truth.|`|GBnj1lo1aa	do NOT do what i did for starters don't push it out of your mind and bottle it up.<br>  talk to someone about it and try to get it off your chest. cry it actually does help you get over it, and make sure you try and say goodbye properly even if that is just in a 'prayer' type thing or to his grave it can help you let go.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Y51v5cTOaa	Let it out . Don't hold anything in<br>  <br>  Then you remember all the great times you had with him and you'll realize he loves you and he wants you to be happy<br>  <br>  He is in a better place<br>  so sorry for your lose|`|RnnRlxEKaa	let god help you with this great loss he wants to carry our heavy burdens let him love you god is the best medicine that anybody can offer you
Bb6fQtl0aa	Yes I agree with the 3 points... this is what the Sahaabah were upon<br>  <br>  When we look at the Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him, they did not allow anyone to follow the Qur'aan and to reject any authentic statement of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Qur'aan and Sunnah are primary sources in our religion.<br>  <br>  @Thaan:  Issue #2 refers to people who reject parts of Islam because it doesn't go along with their personal opinions. The lecture talks about that.<br>  <br>  @wazgud, Jazakallaahu khayr for the link, i'm happy people are benefiting<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  With regards to the intellect, then yes, Allaah blessed us with it and taught us how to use it properly. Which is to use it to know that none has the right to be worshiped except Allaah and that Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the Messenger. <br>  <br>  We can't use our intellects as an independent proof to say "this is from Islam" and "this is not"... because only Allaah and His Messenger, peace be upon him, could legislate matters in Islam in the first place. So what it comes down to is, did Allaah and His Messenger, peace be upon him, authentically command such-and-such or not. So it comes down to a science of hadeeth issue of verifying reports.<br>  <br>  But it does turn out that many baseless practices people ascribe to Islam do not have any authentic evidence AND do not conform with an uncorrupted intellect. So sometimes our intellect can "give us a tip" as to what needs further investigation, but the intellect by itself cannot be used as an independent judge.<br>  <br>  All 3 points are important, because as mentioned in the lecture, groups of Muslims have gone astray by not upholding one or more of the points. Also the Companions adhered to all 3 points to the fullest.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL EDIT:<br>  And the second point, is finely illustrated by the famous statement of 'Alee ibn Abee Taalib, may Allaah be pleased with him:<br>   <br>  "If the religion was based on the intellect alone, then the bottom part of the leather sock would have more right to be wiped (in ablution) as opposed to the top. But I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wipe over the top of his leather sock."<br>  (Abu Dawood)|`|0NXdjyo2aa	Yes i agree, both Qur'an and Sunnah are essential and complementary to each other. Rejecting one or the other would lead us to incorrect interpretation and thus to misguidance. The Sunnah is the practical example of the implementation of the Qur'anic guidance, the wisdom taught to the Prophet  along with the scripture, and neither the Qur'an nor the Sunnah can be understood correctly without the other. <br>  The authenticity of hadiths is verified by through science of hadiths. Authentic hadiths are those which has been vigorously assessed, matched and sorted out by expert scholars of hadiths. <br>  <br>  Following the Prophet and his sunnah is a command from Allah:<br>  <br>  “He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. <br>  <br>  Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: “”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]<br>  <br>  Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: “. . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]<br>  <br>  <br>  @ Cannicus - <br>  <br>  Islam awakens in man the faculty of reason and exhorts him to use his intellect. It enjoins him to see things in the light of reality. The Qur'an advises him to seek knowledge and invoke Allah to expand his awareness: (Say ‘O, my Lord! Advance me in knowledge. ) (Taha 20: 114) Allah also says: (Are those who know equal with those who know not? But only men of understanding will pay heed. ) (Az-Zumar 39: 9) It is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said that: "He who leaves his home in search of knowledge (walks) in the path of God." (Reported by At-Tirmidhi) and that "Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim." (Reported by Ibn Majah and al-Bayhaqi) This is how Islam brings man out of the world of superstition and darkness and initiates him into the world of knowledge and light.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Trying to conserve bandwidth, so I cant watch that

Zzhgpe0Paa	This is not what Christians believe. It's certainly not what the bible teaches. Here is what we do believe ...<br>  <br>  That everyone is a sinner. Not one of us is perfect because we cannot be perfect. If we were, we'd be like God.<br>  <br>  We are sinners because we were born with a sin nature. It's not really our fault and God knows this.<br>  <br>  The penalty for sin is death, but a righteous God cannot condemn the innocent. We are innocent until we are mature enough to recognize that there is a right and a wrong and that there is a God behind all this creation. At that point we become responsible for our own salvation.<br>  <br>  But sinful man cannot even pay for his own sins. That's how imperfect his own sins have made him. So God became man, led a sinless life and died as a substitute sacrifice for man. This cleared the way for man to spend eternity with his Savior.<br>  <br>  The choice for you is either trust in God or trust in yourself. If you trust in God, He promises to take full responsibility for your eternal future. If you chose to trust in yourself, God has no choice but to allow you to take full responsibility for your own eternal future.<br>  <br>  I honor your decision to save sex for marriage and not smoke, drink or do drugs.

70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Well said, Jay!  It's not a matter of being Black or acting Black.  It's about being, sounding, and appearing uneducated.  Maybe 50-75 years ago, it was accepted that most blacks couldn't get an education.  Today in America, they can't make that same excuse.  Sure, it might be harder and some may have to put forth a little more effort to overcome certain hurdles in life, but it's something they need to do.  The opportunities are out there and for those that chose not to take advantage of them, it just makes them (and unfortunately, their race) look bad.  <br>  <br>  I don't look at a Black man/woman and assume uneducated, Ebonics-speaking, moron.

Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.<br>  O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...<br>  Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br>  O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.<br>  O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br>  All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.<br>  Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br>  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the QURAN and my example, the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray.<br>  All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O ALLAH, that I have conveyed your message to your people".

3WYcPsm4aa	We do more closely align ourselves with Catholicism than Protestantism.  Some even prefer Luther's original term... Evangelical Catholic.<br>  <br>  We do hold with Sola Scriptura, but not in the way that many protestant denominations have taken it to mean.  We believe that only scripture can interpret scripture, man cannot.  If you don't understand... read some more, read some other passages, the answer will be there.  Too many have taken Sola Scriptura as there personal means to interpret scripture however they want to and enforce scripture to the point of legalism.<br>  <br>  As for faith and works.... we believe that one has faith first, and then as a result of that faith and the grace, we do works.  But the works don't get us into Heaven.  And sometimes the spirit will call people to do works and their faith is borne out of the works.  Either way... we don't see works as part of the salvation formula.  It's the response to it.<br>  <br>  Even Holy Communion.  While we disagree on the how and the state, we both believe that Christ is truly present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  I know, for me, I can have a much better time and get more out of my time with the Catholic Women of the Chapel as opposed to the Protestant Women of the Chapel. Too many "protestant" folks are too judgmental of Lutheran doctrine and dogma.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Lutherans are caught in the middle, they are far away from Catholics and far away from being Bible beliving Christians.<br>  <br>  Most Lutherans I know today, are pretty liberal and Apostate:<br>  <br>  Of the three major Lutheran Synods in the USA, the Wisconsin Synod is closest to the Scriptures, the Missouri Synod is next and the ELCA, is very liberal.<br>  <br>  Folks in WELS and LCMS are both pro life.<br>  <br>  ELCA is pro choice and very close to starting to Ordain Gays.  They already have inter pulpit fellowship with denominations which ordain gays.<br>  <br>  My home Lutheran Church teaches salvation by Infant Baptism and also teaches that if you are true to the religion you were born into, you will still get to go to heaven since its not your fault what the religion was of the family you were born into.<br>  <br>  They teach that being Hindu or Muslim is just as valid as being part of a Chrisitan Church.<br>  <br>  One correction and this is argued by many online Catholics but all churches had 66 books in their Bible unitl 1546 when the Catholics added 7 extra books.<br>  <br>  No one until 1546 had Maccabees in their Bibles.<br>  <br>  Luther didn't take anything out of the Bible, rather in 1546, Roman Catholics added 7 books which included teaching on Purgatory.<br>  <br>  Official teaching from the Roman Catholic Church agrees with this so I don't know why so many online Catholics are so mis-formed.<br>  <br>  These extra seven books are labled in Catholic Bibles and Duetero Cannonical books.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocanonical_books" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterocano...</a><br>  <br>  Even the late President of Notre Dame taught that these extra seven books were added to the Canon in 1546 by the Roman Catholic Church at the Council at Trent.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm a former Lutheran, raised Lutheran during my childhood.<br>  <br>  I still visit Lutheran Churches regularly.|`|mJOkY8rzaa	Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran Church, believed in reform. He did not want to start his own church, but he wanted to remove things from the Catholic Church that were unbiblical and ungodly. For instance, the belief in purgatory has no biblical basis. Also, there was the belief in indulgences, which taught that you could have your sins, or the sins of a loved one, forgiven by paying money to the church. Such money was used to provide luxuries for church leaders, but it also condemned to hell and purgatory the peasants without money. Such indulgences tainted the Church and the image of God.<br>  <br>  As for your question in particular, if you study the creeds (or Credo), the Agnus Dei, and so forth, they are also biblically based. Also, we do believe in faith alone (sola fide), and there is nothing in our practice that suggests otherwise. As for infant baptism, in the early days of Christianity, everyone in a family, from Grandpa to Infant David, was baptized, so it is a sacrement to baptize an infant as long as the parents are committed to the faith.|`|89UOqaVNaa	I'm not an expert on this, but I'll answer the best I can.<br>  <br>  Back in the 1500's, the Catholic ("Universal") Church had severely strayed from the Word of God and taught many terrible heresies including paying money to pay for your sins and the sins of your relatives/loved ones (called indulgences, sadly being reinstated in modern days, according to a news page I saw). The Bible says that Jesus is the only way. Paying money to pay for sins is ridiculous and very, very wrong.<br>  <br>  A man named Luther sought to bring back the truth of God's Word, so the result was that they continued the good things in the church, like liturgy, psalms, confession, hymns, etc., while denouncing the heresies taught.<br>  <br>  Salvation is by faith alone, but faith without works is dead. If there is faith, there will be works. But the salvation does not come from the works, but from the faith. For example, you know that a tree is alive if it's producing green leaves each year, but it's not the leaves that cause the tree to be alive. Without the roots and trunk and water and sunlight, the leaves wouldn't be there. Not sure if that's a great illustration, but hopefully it helps.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	I was raised Lutheran and my church didn't use Latin names. Regards, I think the European Lutherans are a middle ground between the Catholics and the American Evangelicals.

Just that it is better than the rest of their arguments for god.|`|OeG9Mf8Aaa	I think its that atheists have a difficult time believing in something that they cannot experience. A lot of religious people say they believe in God because they "just know it", which is hard for some to understand. The wavelengths that you describe are observable, and therefore evidenced, with scientific instruments, just not with human senses alone. God cannot be observed by any of the senses with any technology or scientific instruments, therefore it is difficult to "know" Him without proof, from an Atheist's perspective.|`|IDZTtipeaa	From what I see, many Christians will take this two ways.  Either they believe that if you can't directly see, touch, taste, etc something, then it doesn't exist according to what they believe is atheist logic.  Or they think that because there are things we can't directly sense, then anything is possible, therefore God exists.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	You can lead an atheist to evidence, but you can't make him think|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Their understanding of science is limited. Religion and science do not play well together.<br>  <br>  In fact as mankind's understanding of science increase, the places god can hide decrease.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	I doubt anyone with even a modicum of intelligence would argue against the fact that things which cannot be perceived exists.<br>  <br>  What people are bickering about has more to do with religious pronouncements that directly contradict what is known about reality.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Christians are not anti science, we just do not believe that the evolution theory is a fact. We believe in supernatural powers and we know that some things are not explainable and we are not against attempts to trying to explain the unexplainable.<br>  <br>  I believe that God reveals things to us progressively. If we make a break through scientific discovery, Christians are wise to give glory to God|`|LF4vun1maa	It's not that the bible actually suggests its god is undetectable or anything, but there's a quote I like...<br>  <br>  "The gods were born of ignorance of nature, and it is knowledge of nature that will kill them."<br>  <br>  The more we understand about the way things work the more obscure and irrelevant the religious have to make their gods.  So now the mighty god of the bible supremely vengeful yet supremely just has become an undetectable FSM, hiding in the gaps.  Because we've already looked for the great and terrible god actually described in the bible, and he wasn't there.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	However, humans are capable of inventing devices to measure those aspects of our universe which exist beyond our natural senses, or else we'd still be ignorant to their presence.<br>  <br>  The same cannot be said for the existence of deities.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	they all still exist in the natural world.

QsbB6vkoaa	you know i don't have all the answers at handy right now but if you wish i can ask my bible study leader and i can get you the answers.<br>  4. a) in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ- this means that no one gets to God by any other means, you have to do it in the name of jesus. so although you are really making your ovation to god Jehovah, you must use jesus name at the end. because he is the way to god.<br>      b) and i am with you in spirit- when jesus left to heaven, he mentioned to his apostles that we were never going to see him again, but that his spirit would always be here with us.<br>      c) And the power of the lord jesus is present- well, it's like i mentioned above, his spirit is here, although we cannot see him<br>   The other ones i cannot answer since i'm not at that point in my bible study, and since you didn't mention scriptures, i couldn't find them.<br>  but as i said to you if you don't get the answers you are looking for, feel free to e-mail me and i'll be happy to ask about them.<br>  good luck|`|RPLsG63caa	i can answer:<br>  1. a man slept w/his stepmother (shocking to people)<br>  3. the man wasn't repentant and had to be expelled from the congregation.<br>  4E. the man being removed was no longer walking with the Christ and now would be part of Satan's organization<br>  <br>  if u read 2 Corinthians chapter 2 u will read about his reinstatement in the Christian congregation|`|CBUPymktaa	some Christians are pretty bad ... they go to church and work up some really good sins ..|`|588c4efaf310c2f71fabe2d5945551d1aa	hmmm.... sounds like you have some homework to do.....<br>  <br>  read read read 1 corinthians.<br>  <br>  god bless|`|XfMm1WEzaa	1.

A believer automatically would think of Peter. <br>  <br>  Matthew 16:23<br>  But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are an offense to me, because you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!"<br>  <br>  There is the whole answer, in a sentence. What is not 'God's thoughts' is the mind of Satan.<br>  <br>  This is in many many sections of Scripture. St Paul says, Whatever is not of faith is sin." <br>  <br>  I have to turn your question on you, even if it embarrasses you : Are you not aware that crop failures all throuh the Bible are blamed on the worship of demons !!! <br>  <br>  I KNOW because my rationality tells me that is stupid.

Besides if he did, trust me he would have caused a flood, tornado, or sumthing to kill us ALL by now...especially the believers...<br>  <br>  To answer your second question i would say no again.. WHy, well aside of common sense,the bible tells me that being dumb or foolish comes from lack of knowledge and this is what people will perish from. In reference to the incident you mentioned, i would say this person has some mental issues. <br>  <br>  With that said, i claim to know whether it is satan or not b/c for starters i dont beleive in superstiition.. that is for kids and imagination..That is like me saying i believe a four leaf clover will give me luck... secondly, the bible says every good  and perfect thing comes from the Lord and everything bad comes from satan. According to your example the death of the child is not a bad thing.. why? b/c we will all die... young, old,  middle aged etc and unfortunatley we have no control over the way this death will occur... GOD is the author of life, and only he can give it and take it.. Satan does not have the authority to take life unless GOd permits it to be.. if he did have that power trust me, the A-hole would have took my life when i was an atheist and he had me on his team.. i srsly doubt satan would wait until i found out the truth and became saved(which i am now)...<br>  <br>  Your additional details are a matter of opinion and fortunately for you , you are entitled to that right..

Lucifer desire to take hole of you if you give him that chance, that you may be his puppet and do his will and not the will of the lord .Why do you think that there is so much evil in the world today. I is because people pleasure more in following the devil and do evil then to follow God and do good. Lucifer hates God who is his father also, and he is our brother for we were all created in God image. For Lucifer rebelled against God in heaven and was cast out . It is the same today for all of us here, if we to rebel against God we to will be cast out of heaven, Just like Lucifer was, for then we are no better then Lucifer now are we, For God can not look upon sin in the least degree. For this cause the wicked are cast off, for they have no place in a place of Holiness. For God is a God of Love and loves those that love him, more then they that are disobedient. For the disobedient have there free agency like ever one else. for God Gave us our free agency to choose good or Evil. You Choose Heaven or Hell, what say ye. Whom shell ye choose, your Heavenly Father who loves you with all of his heart or Lucifer the Fathers of all lies who seek to destroy you if given the chance. For when the time comes that you will need Lucifer’s  help he will abandon you that you may be destroyed. For this is the work of the devil, for he laugh’s and pleasures because he knows that the lord will not take you unto him self when you follow him, and that you will be cast off, that you will have no place in heaven .These words are true, for when the time comes that We leave this world that your memory will be awaken of receiving this. You will then know that it was true, and because of those that decided to follow Lucifer. That now they  know that God will cast them off.. For the Lord say that, it would be more tolerable for one to be in hell, then to stand before him to be Judge with there shame by choosing evil over Good. For the spirit of the lord shell testIfy the truth of these things unto you. Amen.|`|XSEWADI0aa	"The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one," says the apostle John. (1 John 5:19) Of course, we do not want to become obsessed with the Devil or allow superstitious fear of him to paralyze us. We are wise, though, to stay alert to his efforts to blind us to the truth and to break our integrity to God.—Job 2:3-5; 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4.<br>  <br>  The Devil does not always use brutal means to attack those who want to do God's will. At times, he makes himself seem like "an angel of light." The apostle Paul warned Christians of this danger when he wrote: "I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ."—2 Corinthians 11:3, 14.<br>  <br>  We therefore need to 'keep our senses, be watchful, and take our stand against him, solid in the faith.' (1 Peter 5:8, 9; 2 Corinthians 2:11) Avoid playing into Satan's hands by dabbling in anything that is connected with the occult. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) Be a good student of God's Word, remembering that Jesus Christ repeatedly referred to God's Word when he was tempted by the Devil. (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10) Pray for God's spirit. Its fruitage can help you to avoid the works of the flesh, which Satan promotes so effectively. (Galatians 5:16-24) Also, pray earnestly to Jehovah when you feel under pressure in some way from the Devil and his demons.—Philippians 4:6, 7.<br>  <br>  There is no need to be in terror of the Devil. Jehovah promises real protection against anything Satan can do. (Psalm 91:1-4; Proverbs 18:10; James 4:7, 8) "Go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength," says the apostle Paul. Then you will "be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil."—Ephesians 6:10, 11.|`|O84V4pYIaa	The Bible says Satan is evil and a great deceiver. Therefore if you believe the Bible is true than you can assume that the mind of Satan is about causing trouble though deception. So you can assume he can cause people to be superstitious and idiotic.<br>  <br>  Satan would enjoy causing pain to anyone and everyone therefore I can reasonably assume he is at work causing the superstition.<br>  <br>  Witch vs. possessed by demons... totally different things... neither of witch I've heard of being "illegal" to say.|`|oChTv3k5aa	In this world you will have trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world- Jesus <br>  <br>  The devil roams around like a hungry lion, seeking those he may devour- Jesus <br>  <br>  The devil knows his time is short.-Jesus <br>  <br>  Anything that exalts itself against God is satanic.

I refused, and he got a little melodramatic, but I just brush it off. Some people, I think, are just so desperate to experience that level of intimacy that they will go to just about any lengths to have it. However, if you stand your ground and firmly assert your position on the situation (no pun intended), then this issue should eventually loosen up. If not, then your friend may have some issues controlling sexual urges. =3|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	well thats   whats wrong with gay people all gay people need to calm down and just make friends not boyfriends|`|W545hqrpaa	probably because u r a cool guy.|`|zRAjpm0kaa	I think it is because when you become friends with them you are nice to them etc etc and that is an easy attraction for a gay guy.<br>  <br>  Also if they are still somewhat in the closet, any gay guy they find they sort of attach to because its hard for them to find any other guys.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if its friendship I'd like to keep it that way, but if both are committed to a relationship then they should be honest and lay out the rules, because I know in my relationship I'd want a monogamous one.

As others have said:<br>  <br>  Gender is between the ears and sex is between the legs.<br>  <br>  Gender and sex match most of the time.  But for some it does not.  Transsexual people are born with a brain-body mismatch.  During early fetal development a hormonal wash is not timed correctly or does not take and it results in a person having a brain opposite of the body.  A further explanation can be found in this section of LynnConway.com:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/TS.html#anchor107763" rel="nofollow">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/T...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Especially note the concept of gender identity.  It has been found to be inborn and unchangeable.  Gender is NOT a social construct.  Socialization only builds on the gender identity that's already present at birth.<br>  <br>  People who are born transsexual (brain-body mismatch) lead a very difficult life as nobody sees them or treats them as the person they are.  That's why many (most?) go through the process of TRANSITION to change their body so that it matches their inner being. Transition is appropriate medical treatment for people born transsexual.  Once transition is complete transsexual people lead happy and fulfilled lives as their true selves.|`|hQSQx83Taa	Sex is biology... it's what chromosomes you have, what kind of genitals you have.<br>  <br>  Gender is social identity.

Although the energy is generated continuously inside the sun, it is transmitted intermittently. There is no regular pattern to that. The factors initiating a transmission are the alignments of other stars and of the planets in the solar system.  Gravity itself is also a form of universal energy, as are Black Holes.  Gravity energy flows continuously.  It is a combination of descension and ascension energy and is the binding force where all stars and all planets are joined.  The energy builds up inside the sun, pulsing there at the rate of one per second. A critical “pressure” is reached; a transmission is triggered by forces of gravity from nearby bodies at certain alignments of those bodies.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	What exactly is "Universal Energy"?  It's not a scientific term.  There is energy and there is matter, energy being another state of matter.  There is also cosmic microwave background radiation. It's energy left over from the big bang.

AA11047076	The reality is that if he is an Orthodox Jew, he is not going to marry you unless you convert.  The biggest issue here is that your children would not be Jewish- as you are not Jewish.  The fact that you father is Jewish is completely immaterial from a Jewish POV- only the mother passes down Jewishness.  Thus raising your children as Jewish, unless you convert, is a non-starter- they would not be Jewish at all.<br>  <br>  As for worrying about being accepted- that is something you do not need to worry about it.  Converts are readily accepted and welcomed in Orthodox communities.  And you are 100% correct to be seriously considering this before doing it.  Conversion in Judaism is not a surface thing- but a huge commitment<br>  <br>  edit:  ignore the suggestion to look at "Messianic Judaism"  No Jew in the world sees it as anything but Christianity in disguise.  Even if you become a "Messianic Jew" you will NOT be considered Jewish- on the contrary, you will be seen as apart of a deceitful missionary movement aimed at destroying Judaism|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	He must be a red hot lover , for you to change Gods !<br>  I would never accept a person who would not respect my religious faith or lack of it .<br>  <br>  Religion is a personal decision and should never be a condition of marriage .|`|G6Uy43coaa	I agree with Beans for Brains.

The Jewish community is very accepting even of the Gentile born, if you are truly willing to embrace Judaism.<br>   One of you must convert or this will never work. <br>   My ex is Ashkenzi Jew, I , at the time, was Christian. <br>   In the Jewish religion, if you two ever have children, they are raised in the faith of the mother.<br>   Even so, this combo will NOT WORK unless the two of you are of like faith.

She later followed her mother-in-law Naomi to Israel, and accepted the God of Israel as her God.<br>  <br>  "But Ruth said: <br>  'Entreat me not to leave you,<br>  Or to turn back from following after you;<br>  For wherever you go, I will go;<br>  And wherever you lodge, I will lodge;<br>  Your people shall be my people,<br>  And your God, my God.<br>  Where you die, I will die,<br>  And there will I be buried.<br>  The Lord do so to me, and more also,<br>  If anything but death parts you and me."<br>  (Ruth 1:16-17)<br>  <br>  Later in Bethlehem, Israel, Ruth confessed that she shall find favour in the sight of the man who owned the field where she gleaned heads of grain.

Most Orthodox Jews won't marry anyone outside of Judaism (those that do insist on an agreement that the children be raised Jewish - as you plan). Most Orthodox rabbis won't officiate an inter-faith marriage (some Conservative and even Reform rabbis won't either).<br>  <br>  If you convert, you would be accepted fully as a Jew.  Some believe that converts are even more treasured than those born Jewish because converts make the choice to take on all of the hassles and joys of being Jewish.  <br>  <br>  Just do it for the right reasons, not just to marry your man. Do you feel drawn to Judaism, do you find wonder in the religion? Do you believe in Jesus as a divine savior (that would remove you from the possibility of converting).  <br>  <br>  Advice - take an Intro to Judaism class, either at the Orthodox synagogue or other synagogue near you.  Talk with his rabbi, ask a lot of questions and be prepared to answer questions and don't be surprised if he isn't receptive immediately.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there and try to access where you're being called, my friend.<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  Added: DO NOT look into "Messianic Judaism" - it's not Judaism and is totally rejected by all observant Jews.  Twisting Jesus into Jewish holy days and rituals is dishonest and will not endear you to Orthodox Jews at all.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Well, i do not see it to be a big problem.<br>  <br>  My mother remarried to someone Jewish.<br>  My Stepfather's Father was Jewish, but his mother was Catholic.<br>  AND, My Stepfather's 2nd wife converted from Catholicism to Judaism.<br>  <br>  Actually MOST of the Family are of mixed marriages; very few married someone of the same faith. (My mom's side is different though; she is Christian and all of her side is either Christian or Catholic). <br>  <br>  I do not see why you would not be fully accepted? Most Jews do not reject people of other faiths, i mean, unless you walk into temple (a synagogue) and begin blaspheming OR like, go to a family function and start cramming offensive things down their throats.<br>  I find Jewish people to be more accepting of others that Catholics or Christians, but that is just myself personally.<br>  <br>  I think IF the two of you love one another, you should get married. <br>  You shouldn't let anything hold you back.<br>  <br>  I don't know how helpful this was, but ... well there you go.<br>  xoxo ?

8qyofB7Zaa	There are few things that make me more p*ssed off than this. I've seen women do this all the time and the next time I see this I'm going to push the woman out of the way and call her various names. Men are treated like second class citizens in Western societies. Men can be rape victims, both from women and other men, yet there are tons of organizations that give only women victims shelter and money, teach them self-defense moves, etc., yet if you're a male victim there's no one to turn to. Men are no more able to "hold it" than there women and those who have urinary or digestive conditions don't deserve to wait while female teenyboppers use their restrooms. It's no wonder that men live 7 or 8 years less than women due to disproportionate health care funding and number of charitable organizations for female diseases, yet men pay higher insurance rates. It's time for men to stand up for their rights against discrimination by women.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	I've never used the men's bathroom, but I have seen women go into the man's bathroom because the woman's was too crowded.

Personally I wouldn't use the men's room unless I have been holding it for like five hours.<br>  I just though of something, maybe it is because men have a higher incidents of rape than women (i am not saying that women don't rape just that men have higher incidents). So when there is a guy in the restroom a women might feel insecure, and they think that he was peaking or something.<br>   Good question.|`|UaOB9edEaa	The only way a women would ever use the men's dirty disgusting toilet is if we were going to explode if we didn't. And women (most anyway) would go into a guys restroom to see "anything" But if a guy walks into a women's restroom we think he's a pervert. It's just the way it is.|`|sMg6llrRaa	Girls are insecure and don't want guys seeing them with their pads or tampons in their hands or them fixing their makeup. I also think it's because it's a normal reaction to girls.<br>  <br>  For guys, well they are pretty simple. They just piss and leave. Besides, i don't think that many girls are that perverted as to go into the men's room just to look at stuff. Not that guy's do it on purpose either.|`|Qnop8tkjaa	I also think it is very disgusting and rude for women to do that!!

Do you own the restaurant or club? It is not YOUR restroom. You don't pay for it; you don't own it. Get over it.<br>  <br>  Finally, in general, men ARE perverts compared to women. A man might be trying to sneak a peek at a woman in the restroom; women are MUCH less likely to be doing that, rather than just trying to pee and get outta there. <br>  <br>  There is no reason why you can't use a women's restroom if you absolutely HAVE to (although I doubt there's ever a case where it's absolutely necessary, unless the men's toilets are BROKE!), but just make sure there are no women in there when you go.|`|ePcNVX10aa	Good question. I hear where your coming from.. I guess maybe it's allowed because men are usually physically stronger than women and the chance of someone getting attacked or raped is higher.  I don't hear of many women going into a mens bathroom to either rob or rape them. <br>  <br>  Not saying that it would be the reason for a man to go to a womens bathroom. That's pretty much the reason I could think of.  And I guess chivalry of course.|`|n30fNgLRaa	women are the so called weaker length so they get special treatment and the whole unfair thingy umm are you four cuz life isn't fair and you need to except that the whole disrespectful thing i do understand but i have never used a mans toilet or seen any chic use one and i doubt its cuz im a small town girl on yahoo answers|`|DuC5hfdfaa	A girl walks the restroom and lowers her pants to make use of the facilities.

It has a door, and a place for females to sit.  Guys stand before urinals with their penis exposed to urinate, but also use the stall to have a BM.  I would have no problem with guys using a females toilet if they went into a stall to eliminate.  Hand washing basins are not to be used as male urinals.  As well, I do not want to have to avoid viewing a strange males penis. And, fellas, if you did use basins to void in would you clean your splatters off the surrounding  area?|`|xrgHNGj1aa	Yeah I bet you didn't have a problem with hitting girls at school either did you. Us REAL men treat women with the 'gentlemen' standard as they are the 'fairer sex' to us and mostly deserve to be treated like ladies.

XUuDxlzaaa	Of course, Society has it in-bred into all of us. Stereotyping has become something of a second nature to most (not all) human beings. Stereotyping can be acceptable and sometimes neccessary. The thing is, if you close yourself off from a group of people because of the stereotype then you are shutting yourself off from a Community of people, and letting go chances. Of course, I would not even talk or have the desire to talk to a 'Emo' or 'Grunger'. I know I wouldn't get on with them. I dunno, Stereotyping is weird, "All Americans are fat" - Hey, I've used that one before... I know your not all fat. "British people eat hot cross buns (I think its hot cross buns) and drink tea with the Queen" Yeah, coz I really go and meet the Queen, I hope you know that no British/ENGLISH people would have that "honour".<br>  <br>  Positive/Negative Stereotyping? Such as; "Dumb Blonde"  Well, that could be seen as Positive and Negative, depends on how you as an individual look at it.|`|A1Dawc5paa	Hmm stereotyping and prejudice. My my, deep subject (:<br>  <br>  I think there's no way to stop it.There's stereotypes and prejudice on everything, race, gender, sexuality, age, looks and attitudes.Its what separates and unites us to our piers. <br>  Here's an example of when it can be helpful: if you see an older man staring at a young girl and you just assume this man is dangerous you'll probably take your kids away from him. Now, he might just be the nicest man ever, but its better to take the precautions than to regret an unfortunate event happening later on. <br>   <br>  Now to answer your first question, yes I do tend to stereotype different races. I don't think I'm better or worst then everyone but (for example) if I meet an american girl and a latina ill unintentionally have a little resume in my head of what each will be like. I don't find anything wrong with this because its right most of the time. Latinos and american kids tend to be raised differently, they have different cultural backgrounds therefore different beliefs, habits ect. <br>  <br>  Now, high school stereotyping (example: scene,emo,nerd,ect) are just pointless and a waste of time. They are just narrowing theyr friendship circle and making being a teenager even more dramatic then it needs to be. <br>  <br>  I get along with all types of people from a lot of different places, however they all tend to have certain traits depending on where they are from. Damn this is long... sorry I zoom out and keep writting.   And my english is a mess too, I'm sorry|`|KjuIYKxQaa	Why are gay people constantly crying and complaining and telling on people?

0c2df080a9bb3fa4e8e21511cd900443aa	Before I began studying Swedish, I thought the language was extremely foreign and would be difficult to learn. But that was only a na?ve, superficial analysis. I've come to realize that Swedish is not only simple grammatically (you could master regular-verb conjugation in under an hour) but it is very similar to English lexically.<br>  <br>  The only obstacle to learning Swedish is the lack of (good) resources. Rosetta Stone would be good for listening practice and building vocabulary. <br>  <br>  I have Rosetta Stone for another language.

I ended up falling head over heels in love with her, bedding her and later discovering that I was one of her many sexual encounters that month.<br>  <br>  There are some people with a complete lack of sentimentality, who'll throw around kisses and 'I love you!' like they're sweets.  People who pretend that they have enough love to go around.  She may say she likes you, but the question is, inbetween seeing all the other people she 'loves', will she have time for you?
QNwv4Efdaa	Wow. Religion is a very  touchy thing and i think that god wouldn't appreciate that she did that whatsoever. God might forgive everyone for their sins but if they are saying stupid things like that i personally think that they are very rude. That is not right. I also have a friend that gave up talking until april. and on the first day she was talking... like if you do lent you don't just not do it. God died for everyone and everything on the earth so i think that he should be more apperciated that any hamburger. So i think that you should tell her that. email me back and tell me how it went kaylademers31@yahoo.ca. xoxox good luck. :)<br>               Ps she might not be going "down under" for saying that, but if she does that anymore she's going to start to get closer to going there and it'll be her fault. say that to her shell be speechless lol|`|crVFU6lBaa	People are hypocritical about all things when it comes to religion.<br>  <br>  'Gay people arn't allowed to get married cus it's a sin..... but divorce is A-OK!!'<br>  <br>  I'm trying to give up chocolate for lent.

Let's put this in proper perspective here.|`|pakIAYWoaa	well she probably was compelled to give up meat in the first place.  The bible never orders a fast it is always something done freely.

And God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br>  30 "And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat [i.e. for FOOD, NOT for intoxication]": and it was so.'<br>  <br>  Amazing how you non-Christians will take a verse out of context, twist it to justify your own lifestyle, then accuse Christians of hypocrisy, or God as being unloving and too judgmental, when their views are corrected.<br>  <br>  The first two chapters of Genesis reveal the earth as originally created was "very good" in God's sight -- no earthquakes, no volcanoes, no tornadoes or hurricanes, no carnivory, no toxins, no death; not even weeds or thorns. This shows that death, far from being present for "billions of years" of struggle from amoeba to academician, is indeed an intruder on the scene, that did not enter the world until Adam's sin in the Garden of Eden (see Genesis chapter 3). Unfortunately, "intellectual" church leaders such as ArchApostate of Canterbury Rowan Williams, and his predecessors George Carey and Robert Runcie, have bowed to the "wisdom" of Darwinists (who weren't even there), rather than the WORD given us by the Infallible God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (who was, and actually created the whole thing).<br>  This attitude has led to the 'church' (ALL major denominations, not just Anglican/Episcopalian) largely sending out mixed signals, with some calling for the allowance of homosexuality within the clergy, homosexual marriages (what next -- paedophilia? Marry your pet? Necrophiliac marriages?), while others, notably Bishop John Sentamu, are required to fight the corner of Christian orthodoxy, instead of being able to recommend, with confidence to a person, the churches they can visit to hear the pure Gospel (see 1 Cor. 14:8).<br>  <br>  Until the church leadership stops "hesitating between two opinions" (1 Kings 18:21) and either plumps completely for God and His written Word (see John 17:17), or has the courage of its (lack of) conviction and leaves the church for New Age pastures, the established denominations will continue to haemorrhage congregants.<br>  Islam draws membership not because it is superior in truth (it isn't!) but because their leadership is sincere in following the words of a false prophet.<br>  <br>  Time prevents a more detailed response; suffice to say if you want truth about God, the Bible and the future you face, see<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thebereancall.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebereancall.org</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lightforthelastdays.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightforthelastdays.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.answersingenesis.org</a><br>  <br>  May God bless all who sincerely seek the truth about Him and His offer of salvation.|`|hXk1JGj2aa	Your body is supposed to be a temple of God and is to be maintained as one as it is not your property. ie: tattooing it or smoking the Mary Jane would be considered not taking care of it.

There are lots of things people can do nowadays that didn't apply then. But the Bible does tell us to use discretion, and to judge wisely whether or nor something is a good idea.<br>  <br>  It's not wrong to dye your hair pink or get tattoos. Christians don't think that if someone does so then their soul is in danger. The implication, though, is that they are more focused on making a statement with their appearance than showing others through example how they can live the best life possible for God.<br>  <br>  Smoking weed is bad, though. Any doctor would say so, and Christians believe that our bodies are sacred and should not be abused. And if you have a weed addiction, then how can you possibly focus first and foremost on being Godly and getting to Heaven?<br>  <br>  People aren't perfect, They judge, even when they're not supposed to. Being Christian and having faults doesn't automatically make you a hypocrite.

From reading commentaries, I have learned that these were done for superstitious reasons and also as part of idol worship. That makes sense. <br>  <br>  The Bible also says that people look at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart. That's what God cares about most.<br>  <br>  There are also verses in the New Testament that says our bodies are a temple of the Holy Spirit. Something to think/pray about is if tattoos are desecrating the temple or not. <br>  <br>  We also know that we live under grace and not the law though. I also see this verse:<br>  1 Corinthians 10:31  So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.<br>  <br>  If you can dye your hair, or have a tattoo while giving glory to God, I think it's OK.<br>  <br>  Kutless is one of my favorite Christian bands. They dye their hair and have tattoos. They said that they have had conversations with people about Christ that they would not have had if they didn't have a tattoo. <br>  <br>  Now about smoking weed. I think these verses apply:<br>  Ephesians 5:18  Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:12  "Everything is permissible for me"—but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible for me"—but I will not be mastered by anything.<br>  <br>  We know that getting drunk is a sin. I believe the same principle applies to weed. It masters us. We are not in total control of ourselves if we are high. We need to be controlled by the Holy Spirit.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Tattoos - Yes, I've seen a passage in the Bible that speaks against them.<br>  <br>  Dyed hair - No, I've never seen that mentioned in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Weed - No, again.

M3Xmqlt8aa	The shape of the letters mostly, what is called ancient Pheonecian today is actually the older form of Hebrew. Hebrew is a very complex and exacting language that has many features that other modern languages do not have, it is designed in a way that you can very deeply study the principals that are woven into each letter in a word. How it is spoken and how it functions has not been compromised in a way that has led to any confusion about how to read it or the meanings of it in written texts. The Modern letters are slightly harder to remember, but that is only an opinion.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Modern Hebrew tends to simplify the verb forms and assume a more Western ordering of sentence elements.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	No one can be sure how biblical Hebrew was pronounced. It is believed that the modern Israeli pronunciation (Sephardic) is closest to it, more so than Ashkenazi or any of the less common pronunciations.<br>  <br>  Spelling in biblical Hebrew was more variable, and there was a peculiar feature, whereby attaching the word "and" to a verb would reverse the tense of the verb. (future to past, and vice versa) ("and" cannot stand alone in Hebrew, but is always attached to the following word.)<br>  <br>  Modern Hebrew has attempted to use as much of the original Hebrew grammar as possible, often giving new meanings to old words. For example, the word chashmal, which originally meant a halo or aura around a holy being, is today the word for electricity.|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	Many people have spent a life time learning the accuracy of biblical Hebrew and today have an accurate  bible accounts.<br>  <br>  Now as to spoken Hebrew, we have many countries who speak english.  Yet, many words are different in Australia, Europe, and the USA and even in South America and South Africa.<br>  Of course no one has spent a life time trying to make english understood by even people in the USA.  From the Cajuns in Louisiana to the Texas drawl to the California, fast talking, slang they use.<br>  To those in New York city, english can be very different.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	As my Great Grand Father told me- In humor<br>  <br>  Speaking hebrew was a series of grunts groans spiting and cursing.<br>  <br>  Such was evident when he hit his finger with a hammer.<br>  <br>  In writing "Hebrew" is  a simple mode of communication encompassed by great meaning in every word, impacted as well by the arrangement of the words, choices of words used, and thus the emphases used, given the subject matter. <br>  <br>  I hope that makes as much sense to you as it does to me.|`|mNyhRGowaa	"Ambiguity has been long been a tool of Satan".

2e6d0bf8ecab06aa35b4c1cb6fa300d5aa	You mean like Asherah, who was said to be the consort of Yahweh? Or Sophia, Wisdom, the Holy Spirit?<br>  <br>  The word for spirit in Hebrew was “Ruah” this was a feminine word, when it was translated into Greek it was translated as “Pneuma’ which neutered it.<br>  <br>  (Nag Hammdi Library, the lost gospels) In the Gospel of the Hebrews that the Nazarenes read, Yeshua says, "Even so did my mother, the Holy Spirit, take me by one of my hairs and carry me away to the great mountain Tabor [in Galilee]." It also says, "Just now my mother, the Holy Spirit, took me."  Yeshua refers to the Holy Spirit as his mother. The Acts of Thomas gives a graphic account of the Apostle Thomas when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant and contains within it prayers invoking the Holy Spirit as "the Mother of all creation," “She that revealeth the hidden mysteries,” "compassionate mother," “mother of the seven houses,” along with many other titles. These Coptic Christian writings unquestionably link the "spirit of Spirit" as the "Spirit of the Divine Mother." “We glorify and praise thee and thine invisible Father and thine holy spirit the mother of all creation.” (Acts of Thomas 39)<br>  <br>  King Solomon worshipped her: “She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters; but she drowned their enemies, and cast them up from the depth of the sea.” (The Wisdom of Solomon 10:17-19) Notice it says “She.” In early Judaism the female aspect of god was called Shekinah.<br>  <br>  I think he defiantly encountered some. He even said he was the true vine and his father was the husbandman. Husbands generally have a wife. It wasn’t until man decided to hide the consort under the neutered term Holy Spirit has she disappeared, but if you search hard enough you can find her.|`|AA11923447	Given the part of the world in which He lived and the variety of religions active at the time, it is possible.|`|SsB7aRExaa	It's not very likely that He would have encountered them while He was here on earth.  The Jews would not have put up with any such thing going on in their land.  It was all around them in Rome, but would not have been in Palestine.  Of course, there would have been Roman soldiers who were devoted to various Roman gods and goddesses, but the Romans didn't have any goddess cults, per se.<br>  <br>  <br>  But don't worry - He knows all about them.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Doubtful, they would have flourished outside the geographic area where he taught (though there is the story where his parent fled to Egypt, though that seems to be a story inserted to fulfill a prophecy, as it contradicts the other birth narrative).<br>  <br>  But the texts were not written down right away, and as the growing religion came in contact with other existing religious beliefs, the writers of those texts could have come into contact with many other theological ideas and adapted them into the Christian story.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	Possibly.  There are mentions of "Diana of the Ephesians" in the book of Acts.  Rome at the time of Christ had many different religions, not just the Roman pantheon.  Some people were worshipping Isis (Egypt), some worshiped Cybele and Attis (Hittite religion), and others I can't remember.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	They were not cults, they were religions...<br>  <br>  One of the most popular religions of Rome<br>  at that time was the worship of Cybele. If<br>  you look at Roman coins, Cybele is on the<br>  back of almost every one of them, from <br>  200 BCE to 300 CE.<br>  <br>  Jesus could not possibly have been unaware<br>  of the religion of Cybele, if he ever looked at a<br>  Roman coin... In addition, the Canaanite goddess<br>  Astarte was extremely popular in his area... so <br>  I'm sure he heard of her.<br>  <br>  Jean|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Possibly.  John 21:25.  <')))><

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

However it was not uncommon for the majority of his audience to fall over from the weight of his words and the moving of the Spirit.<br>  <br>  I don't recall too much figurative language.  He tends to be very blunt and straight forward in his writings.  <br>  <br>  The relationship between God and Man was a dominant theme in many of his writings. He was hard core on the subject.  According to Edwards if you were not a believer then you're going to hell and hell is a very bad place.  I you are a believer then you will enjoy fellowship with God in heaven in joyful bliss forever.|`|YupMCYHlaa	You don't mention which sermon.  The one I remember was "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God".  I think that's his most famous one.<br>  <br>  Figurative language is only where you talk about something and you don't mean that thing, it is just a substitution for something else. The title talks about the 'hands' of God, and that is a figure of speech, because God doesn't have hands, and sinners will not be literaly in his hands but under his control.<br>  <br>  Here's an excerpt . .  <br>  <br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  That they were always exposed to destruction; as one that stands or walks in slippery places is always exposed to fall. This is implied in the manner of their destruction coming upon them, being represented by their foot sliding. The same is expressed, Psalm 73:18. "Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction."<br>  <br>  It implies, that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected destruction. As he that walks in slippery places is every moment liable to fall, he cannot foresee one moment whether he shall stand or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once without warning: Which is also expressed in Psalm 73:18,19. "Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; thou castedst them down into destruction: How are they brought into desolation as in a moment!"<br>  <br>  Another thing implied is, that they are liable to fall of themselves, without being thrown down by the hand of another; as he that stands or walks on slippery ground needs nothing but his own weight to throw him down.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  Here Rev. Edwards is talking a lot about slippery places, about sinners slipping and falling.  Of course he doesn't mean this literally.  It is a symbol for sinners going to Hell.  Atheism, humanism, secularism are 'slippery ground', and anyone who 'walks' there is in danger of 'slipping'.  It's an analogy.  See?<br>  <br>  So now read the rest for yourself and see what else you find.  People spoke in VERY figurative language in those days, so if you just read it you'll find many examples as good or better than the one I gave you.

They don't limit Jesus to a pale complexion, look at the majority of the depictions of Abraham, , Hedatsa (a.k.a. esther) Rebekkah, Sarah, Mary, Meriam (moses's sister)  Moses (I get a real kick out of this one especially) Adam, Eve, even GOD (yeah, they even try to claim that too) haha....|`|BZMPax7Naa	How could he have been black. If he existed at all he would not have been African.  He was a middle eastern Jew.  Talk about not being educated.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Jesus wasn't white. <br>  But he was from the Middle East so I don't think he would be black either. He would look like he was from the Middle East- you know what people over there look like.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Everyone should know Jesus was Middle Eastern!|`|hQWucH5uaa	White is a color and not a race.  Black is a color and not a race!<br>  <br>  Jesus was not a tall nordic Northern European caucasian as portrayed in the Shroud of Turin.<br>  <br>  Jesus was not a N*e*g^r^o!  (oh Puh-lease don't censor a scientific word for a race like Caucazoid or Mongaloid!).<br>  <br>  Jesus was a dark skinned Semite of middle eastern descent (not a black African).<br>  <br>  Now, do you consider Arabs and Palistinians to be Black (i.e. N*e^g#r^o?), then you have quite a debate on your hands and you possibly need to retake your Anthropology (study of man) courses.<br>  <br>  The Real Face of Jesus!?<br>  <a href="http://www.giveshare.org/BibleStudy/217.realfaceofjesus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.giveshare.org/BibleStudy/217....</a><br>  <br>  Now look at this historical reconstruction of what Jesus might possibly have looked liked - and is he black?  He looks like a Greek or Italian to me.  The debate continues ........|`|eskZfVBkaa	U r very uneducated if u think that Jesus was Black. He came from the area which is now Palestine, so he would have been Middle Eastern in appearance. Still racially classified as Caucasian, but nonetheless not White European...and NOT Black African!!!<br>  <br>  'Jesus Was Black': The Middle East is not in Africa u idiot! It is in Asia!!!! How ignorant can u get?!?!?!?!?|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I hope most people know the artist renditions of an Anglo-Saxon type Jesus are historically incorrect. Just before Easter last year, my largely Irish American extended family watched "The Ten Commandments" and laughed at how ancient Jews and Egyptians were played by British and American white actors. (Yul Brynner was part Asian, I think)<br>  <br>  But He was probably not Black, as in Subsaharan African, he was probably similar to a modern day Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, or other middle easterner. Many modern Jewish people have a lot of European ancestry so they don't look middle eastern a lot of times, but ancient Jewish people were probably no different than the people around them that we would now call "Arabs'..<br>  <br>  But I don't think he would have looked like someone from Kenya or Congo, even Ethiopia. We do know people in Ancient Egypt were much darker than modern Arab Egyptians, but still the people of the mid east were probably more like Arabs.<br>  <br>  I don't care, if Jesus was as Black as a man from modern Nigeria, he would still be Jesus, it does not matter. But I think historically, he was not sub-saharan African. <br>  <br>  But to many White Americans and Europeans, if they saw the real Jesus and not the Western European artists renditions of brown hair and probably blue eyes and light skin, they would be shocked, especially if they don't like Middle Easterners. <br>  <br>  I think God chose that part of the world because in many ways the people were a mixture of different groups, including some African and Caucasian, and possibly even Asian. We should not worry about which color skin Jesus had, just remember what he did for us.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	When I think of my Savior, I try not to think about race.<br>  <br>  I could care less what color he was.<br>  <br>  All I care about is that he died for our sins.<br>  <br>  Although I truly agree that he was a man of color.<br>  <br>  What color exactly?<br>  <br>  I do not know and I could care less.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	LOL no he is White.

i6Mi8uWIaa	I've always had a lot of respect for both Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Alveda C. King. It's just too bad that, like so many of us, they were blinded for a while by the lies of Planned Parenthood. There's a reason it's sometimes referred to as Klan Parenthood. <br>  <br>  Natural Family Planning, unlike the atrocities promoted by Planned Parenthood, is 99.9 percent effective and 100% SAFE.<br>  <br>  Condoms can irritate the skin and are only 98% effective when used properly, and let's face it, how often is THAT? <br>  <br>  Hormonal methods of birth control can raise your chances of blood clots, cervical cancer, and uterine cancer, because of they way they work, changing the lining of the uterus. They can also dry up natural cervical fluids and cause cervical erosion. The IUD scratches up the lining of the uterus and can cause PID. <br>  <br>  And don't even get me started on the risk of abortion.<br>  <br>  Natural Family Planning doesn't do ANY of that. In fact, by charting your basal temperature and cervical fluids, you can do much more than just know when you're fertile. It can also be helpful in determining much earlier if you're pregnant, determining if there's a possible infertility problem, and knowing what's normal for you, so you know if you should be talking to your OB/GYN about abnormal discharge. The woman who charts is less stressed and far healthier, often, than the woman who doesn't. <br>  <br>  And that is why I will never support Planned Parenthood, and respect Dr. Alveda King for speaking out against them.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	This is a cover up propaganda piece that conspicuously ignores the fact the so-called "pro-life" movement has in fact been the most violent social movemnet in modern social history.<br>  <br>  The Catholic church is the ones with the "lies" and the "agenda" ($$$) and we both know it.<br>  <br>  "Pro-life" is a Republican disclaimer that attempts to conceal the fact the Republican party harbors the deadliest businesses in history, including:<br>  -big tobacco<br>  -gun lobby<br>  -insurance industry<br>  -drug industry<br>  -defensde contractors<br>  -anti-gay groups soft on violence.<br>  <br>  In 1984 there were 18 incidents of violence and/or threats in and around a Planned Parenthood. By 2004 one third of all clinics had such violence.<br>  <br>  You blatant catholic hypocrite!|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Slippery slope-fallacy.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	It is certainly true that abortion is an act of violence, in fact, manslaughter committed against the prenatal child.  Where I am a bit skeptical is about how the Kings could have praised Margaret Sanger (an open racist), Planned Parenthood, and abortion without making the connection between abortion and the violent death of infants.  It is like someone praising the good efforts of Joseph Stalin and only belated recognizing his responsibility for mass murder.<br>  <br>  I remember first seeing the images of abortion in the 1970s, experiencing the profound tragedy and injustice, and dedicating myself to the right to life.  However, seeing the injustice first hand was just an energizer; I would never have imagined abortion to be innocent or somehow beneficial.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	I agree completely, Se spoke at my church a few weeks ago with operation save america :)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	She has been much stronger than that. Folks who hate blacks -- and there are many -- are getting there way more than ever :<br>  <br>  Dr. Aveda King, neice of the late great Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., told a gathering :<br>  <br>  ....that the killing of a quarter of the black population of the US has not been from the lynch mobs of her childhood days, but from abortionists, who plant their killing centers in minority neighborhoods and prey upon women who think they have no hope. <br>  <br>  The great irony, she said, is that abortion has done what the Klan only dreamed of."<br>  <br>  In my time, I've seen the family, the future, and the progress of the Black Community wearing away like a beach no one cares for anymore.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	And because she is black and related to an American hero, I am not allowed to say that is cobblers?

You'd be pretty uncomfortable, right? And would that be because you really believe in Allah and just want to deny him so you can rebel? No, it's because you don't believe in that god and you don't want others trying to wedge it into every aspect of your life, where it has NO business being. <br>  Hearing the word god is not what causes atheists to get upset. We even expect it in certain settings, and tolerate it easily. It's when religious activists try and get their religion hammered into places where it doesn't belong or is unconstitutional that we get annoyed.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	The same way we get angry when they make fun of the Bible & the Lord.......<br>  <br>  I love R & S|`|n55igpCUaa	Looks like you've been brainwashed into believing every atheist reaction is this way.<br>  <br>  If this is based off real life, then maybe you should stop showing them your dogma!|`|JUviY9hoaa	Generalization. <br>  <br>  I've never witnessed or got angry myself of a silly word. <br>  <br>  Try again.|`|TeJuytjZaa	We do?|`|6ELSwKKvaa	Because as nasty as an Atheist can get, Christians can get just as nasty. (Which is a shame because we are called to be loving) I had a lovely self-proclaimed Christian tell me "You are nothing" in a short note to me. I am a Christian and I am treated like this, I can only imagine how an Atheist is treated by people who "Claim" to come in the name of God.<br>  <br>    I can see why they would get angry at even the mention of God because I imagine they have often been bashed in His name. Yes, this is an abuse of the Lord's name but sadly many people do it. Instead of loving people where they are and taking an honest interest in their lives, many Christians walk around like they never sin and pointing out everyone else's sin. When the truth is we are ALL dust compared to what God wants from us. ( I don't care how Holy a person thinks they are... they do not live up to God's standard- Only Christ could do that)|`|uxRBp7JQaa	We are angry only because of the words "you must believe in God" (or "in my god").

Remember, not everyone in the world has the same views about God.

Religion is a choice, it isn't mandatory.  Man made all religions and expects everyone to adhere to these fabrications.  <br>  <br>  The scriptures were written by authors who included their own personal beliefs and emotions into their stories.  They imposed their own human traits and limits and conditions on to an unconditional and limitless Being.  <br>  <br>  People get angry when force is used on them, that goes for anything, not just the embellished stories that come from the bible.|`|LF4vun1maa	Not so much.

But usually they use it hold over someones head. Kinda like they are not just right but god agree's they are right. I see christians (Kirk Cameron/Mike Sever) going around telling people how evil they are and how horrible they are. I feel this is wrong. Who wants to be around people that only tell them they are evil. Who wants to worship a god that feels almost every natural instinct is wrong. I agree there are douche bag " non believers" out there but most of us are level headed aerage people you talk to everyday. And like. Also this debate is a swinging door. There are christians who tell people they are wrong and will go to hell for something they have never seen them do or they feel it is wrong only to them. I don't get angry at the word of god. I think the bible is a great grouping of parables to teach lessons. I don't like when people take it literal and say the universe is 6000 years old only, or evolution is wrong. I understand that your religion tells you it is wrong to believe that life isn't planned out by someone. That can be very scary to no you are alone in a choatic world. If people used "scripture" to help people in need of advice or guidance, great. But when you use it to put someone down, or try to make yourself feel superior, that is wrong.

YXGdwwTJaa	Life today can be hard, uncertain and even scary when we are threatened with loss of job, relationship troubles and illness.  In ancient Egypt it was even tougher.  If the Nile flood failed, you could starve; if you became ill or had an accident, you could die.   There was no police force, no insurance, many problems. <br>  <br>  Faced with what seemed like an angry world, the people had recourse to placating spirits or gods, whatever the the supernatural was.   To do this they had to make them up, startng with the sun god Ra, visible, blazing down in the scorching heat. Ra then created others. <br>  <br>  These varied according to where they were as deities, were (are) local.  Some had human form; others were part human, but with animal heads, whilst others had animal form.    They were given various attributes and jobs.  Creatures had the quality that could be seen in them, such as ferocity, care or trickery. Others had positions seen in society.  Some gods were worshipped in temples; the poor had altars in their homes for other gods.|`|641d79f1fb962fec1327d88ec4977c9daa	I have studied information that says there are Governing beings in the spirit world, that watch over every Country. These could have been the gods of old. The Powers and Principalities of the Bible. Maybe even the Prince of Persia mentioned in the Word.|`|EFe19wj7aa	One version states that originally Nun of the primordially water of Chaos and from Nun was born Ra. Ra then spit out Shu(air) and Tefnut(moisture)  who then gave birth to Nut(sky) and Geb(the Earth). From Nut and Geb most of the other gods were born including Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephths, and Horus the elder. The other gods were created through various different means.<br>  <br>  Now this is the version I learned through researching for a class.
MPOHHTtAaa	Oh I'm excited for you! I didn't work in the park but I worked on a guest ranch that was 20 miles outside of it. This is a GREAT spot to work! Yellowstone park covers Idaho, Wyoming and Montana I believe so you could work in any state, and what I did is google Guest ranchs and things of that nature, I worked on a guest ranch and they hired people to work in the office, the resturaunt, work with horses, clean cabins, they hire TONS of people! And they have bunk houses, one for guys and one for girls, they take a small portion out of your check for rent. It was the most fun I have ever had, we partied on the weekends and got to do everything for free that other people were paying thousands of dollars for! Google guest ranches, white water rafting companies etc etc...I worked for 320 guest ranch.

No charge for any of the treatment or operation.<br>  <br>  My son-in law had polyps in his nose. - Two operations, no charge.<br>  <br>  I was rushed to hospital with a tongue  that was filling my mouth every minute.

By Allah! I ask for forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day."<br>  <br>  <br>  But Jesus never asked for forgivness. Do you know why? He was perfect! True God and true Man.

7NEGq9iZaa	Before we look at gay marriage / same sex marriage, first we have to remember what the Bible says about homosexuality. While the Bible doesn’t address the concept of gay or same sex marriage, the Bible does clearly and consistently tell us that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1-13; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9). God does not create a person with homosexual desires. A person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of his or her own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving in to their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for them to give into those desires? Of course not. The same is true for homosexuality.<br>  <br>  We also have to remember that homosexuality is just as forgivable a sin as all other sins. God’s forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, liar, proud man, etc. God’s love and desire to save extends to homosexuals (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).<br>  <br>  To give sanction to homosexual marriage would be to give approval to that lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently condemns as sinful. I believe that Christians should stand firmly against the idea of gay marriage / same sex marriage. Marriage is ordained by God to be between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21-24; Matthew 19:4-6). Homosexual marriage is a perversion of the institution of marriage and an offense to the God who created marriage. God forbids and condemns homosexuality, so He clearly is opposed to homosexual marriage. As Christians, we are to seek to share the love of God and salvation through Christ with homosexuals. We are to be loving and kind to homosexuals, while at the same time not condoning their sinful lifestyle.|`|liVHnBhnaa	He's a lost soul, shame on him.|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	He's an idiot.

eG9PqkWbaa	I have to agree with you.  Having worked in the service industry I've experienced that "our people" don't tip or don't tip as well as people of other races.  I tip 20%-30% of the entire bill (tax included) for good service, fortunately I've never had to give a ten or fifteen percent tip for poor service.  I've been out with friends several times where they tipped poorly and I believe it's simply because they are not abreast of the standards.  Some just don't care.  They'll say things like, "Well I don't have it".  I respond by telling them that they can't afford to eat or drink out then if they can't afford to tip.  That is part of the experience.  People who work in the service industry get paid below minimum wage because it is expected that they'll be tipped by patrons.  It's hard work having to serve drunk people or people in general.  I've also had people say to me "They get paid for the job they do, I don't need to tip".  Some feel that the bartender/server must exceed their expectations in order to deserve a tip.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't think there is any real straight answer to your question but I have felt your pain.|`|36c219280f881fd9a869475fe716cf47aa	What a horrible generalization.  It could be as simple as the fact that your patrons may be broke!  With an attitude like yours, I'm sure the wealthier go to a more...upscale night club!<br>  <br>  I personally tip the deserving.  It's not a race issue.|`|mUuaZiSoaa	People get tipped what they deserve. simple as that. There is no law saying that you have to be tipped anything. sorry for you thinking that it is a race thing.|`|AA11263442	I'm not even black and I rarely tip at clubs because the price is JACKED UP like crazy anyways.|`|hVPZJxqBaa	the world is white and black....

If you've got an attitude like that no wonder you're not getting tipped! And if you're giving people the wrong amount of change, even if it's 50p, thats your fault and so no good service - hence no tip!|`|325543522d61fdf739d9d519bc6ab83eaa	While it may be a generalization to a degree - it's true nonetheless.  I've often heard complaints from the serving staff in establishments I frequent complain that black customers tip less (if at all) than others.  I play pool with a black guy I've known for 20 years.  I love the guy, but he'll give the waitress a 50 cent tip on a $10 tab after she's run back and forth (and given GOOD service) half a dozen times to make sure we're taken care of.<br>  <br>  I tend to over tip in part because I remember what it was like as a younger person to have to hustle my *** off to make a few dollars.  I try to acknowledge through my tip those who work hard to provide me (good) service.<br>  <br>  On a larger scale - Myrtle Beach, SC has a "Bike Week" each spring and fall.  It's mostly old white guys on Harleys.  The following week is "Sport Bike Week" also known as "Black Bike Week".  Many of the local businesses actually CLOSE their doors during Sport Bike Week because the restaurant and bar workers who rely on tips as a substantial part of their income - get almost NO TIPS during that week.  To be sure, age (the average age of the sport bikers is much younger than the Harley folks) plays some role - but I still agree there's a cultural difference in the mindset on tipping with many (not all) black customers.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I have heard about black people not tipping.  I work in an area where black people on welfare throw a fit over the $1 copay on their medication yet turn around and buy a candy bar with their food stamp money.  If they aren't obligated to pay for something, they won't.<br>  <br>  That being said, while I tip, I don't think it is fair that we should have to.  At a bar, you pay for an overpriced bottle of beer that cost the establishment pennies on the dollar.  They shouldn't have to raise their prices if people don't tip to pay their employees.  They should be paying their employees a full wage in the first place instead of this $3 an hour b.s.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	It could just be the economy, but if people, black, white, green or purple have money to go out to drink, they should know to have enough money to tip.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it's a racial thing, maybe yes, maybe no. When I was a little kid, my parents went out to a restaurant and as we were leaving,  I said "Mommy you left some money on the table." and she explained what tipping was. Maybe some people, no one race, but some people don't have experiences like that. Or maybe they just think a Waiter or waitress is rude, just to keep from tipping, whether it's the server's fault or not.
SUVbALgGaa	There is no "the" or "a" as such, but with "wa" you were probably talking about the dog already, so "the dog" is more likely. "Inu ga nonde imasu" probably just describes a scene, so it is more likely to be "a dog." But with such words, context is everything.

AA10626996	The ring means you are staying pure for your husband and no one else. That means no sex unless you get married. As for the ring , It is a symbol hun. All it means is that you will stay pure for your husband( Virgin)<br>  There is several places where you can buy Purity rings that don't cost that much. Personally , that is way too much to spend on a ring But the parents probably did it for a positive reason to ensure that their daughter would stay pure. Of course a ring doesn't guarantee a thing.<br>  If you still want one that bad , you can go to any Family Christian Store and they have silver ones that are really nice and won't break the bank. You could always take it to a jeweler and have it personalized ( which doesn't cost an arm and a leg) and that would make it more special to you :)<br>  I added some links to help you and maybe you will find one you like.<br>  The finger is the same as the wedding ring finger. <br>  I really hope you find one that is special and just for you because waiting is really a good idea. I wish I would have waited for my love and husband. I think that if more guys and gals did this, we would have less issues with divorce , diseases etc. <br>  It's a special thing ya know and as a girl , you are special and what you give away some day should be given to the one you wanna spend your whole life with. <br>  I hope and pray you wait., :)|`|AA10799714	The ring is just a symbol. You don't need a ring to be pure. What really counts is what's on the inside - your true morality.

It's what you do with those feelings that is important.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	You must be kidding.  But if they are it's because they have more reason to be (the double standard with what men can do and women can't). Also it's just seen as worse for a woman to be jealous even if she has reason to be. A 'nice' woman pretends to not notice or care when her man flirts with other women (or worse). To many people it means she has self esteem issues if she objects.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i dont think they are more jealous they are just more likely to show it to others.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	b/c u want to be like other folks|`|gspTDufpaa	Their just being very immature.

XLXncQu9aa	It depends on your perspective and the situation.  Have you ever heard the saying, "Everything that glitters isn't gold"?  That saying is actually contrary to the statement you are asking about.  What that means is, everything that looks good isn't always good for you.  It just depends on the situation.  Sometimes the grass is always greener on the other side.  And sometimes it isn't.  You just have to have the correct judgment to know that ahead of time before you make a life altering decision.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	It's the "lie" of the land!|`|f6qmRicQaa	Always without exception.

Most of the Indians knew that they were being lied to, and they actually said the White man or Pale Face talked with forked tongue Meaning the White man or Pale Face was telling lies or speaking untruth's.|`|pRF5LLloaa	I've heard that it originated in the movie industry itself, from quick and cheap screen writers.<br>  <br>  There is no evidence that any Native American actually said things like that.|`|zHmZkMStaa	Some early-era screenwriter invented the phrase for a Western film.

NWa45ZDIaa	Ha ha, oh these answers really make me laugh. How absurd can people be, I've been a JW for almost 40 years & I know for a fact that not 1 JW in the entire world goes to someones door at "ungodly hours of the morning," we never invade people's privacy, we never sell ANYTHING & we never have gone to people's doors to tell people how wrong they live their lives. How asinine are those claims? People are crazy to make such assumptions & even more ridiculous to post comments like these when they are so completely false!<br>  <br>  We as JW's are criticized a lot for all of our beliefs, we're often lied about being a cult, not Christians, that we would let our children die if they needed a blood transfusion, that we have our own Bible & our own Jesus, the list goes on & on.<br>  <br>  Why? Simple... because Jesus himself said that the world would hate his true followers just as it hated him. John 17:14-18 "I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. “I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one. They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth. Just as you sent me forth into the world, I also sent them forth into the world."<br>  <br>  Look up Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20 & see why JW's go out in the ministry. BTW, we DO go from door to door, but we usually find polite respectful people who do want to talk with us. We respect people who do not. We also talk to people out on the streets, at work, in school, everywhere we go. Especially these days when most people are not at home. Jesus said to "go therefore & make disciples", he went from door to door, town to town, etc. he didn't just stand in front of a building handing out pamphlets, right? Neither do JW's. I don't always like people coming to my door & when Its not a good time for me either, that's human. Sometimes I don't answer it, if it's important they'll come back. Same with Witnesses. =o)<br>  <br>  People are just pressured so much nowadays, there's so much distrust & crime & corruption in the world, that we all have to be wary of who we meet, even at our own doors. So we may often be confused as trespassers or that our intentions are bad. Even though that is NOT the case. But that's ok, Jesus himself often was mistaken, too. <br>  <br>  The next time JW's come to your door (which will be at a decent hour I promise) don't be afraid to talk to us, we're there to have friendly conversations with people who want too, to share encouraging thoughts from the Bible. If you don't want to talk to us at all, tell us so, we won't force ourselves into "your space" or insist you talk to us. We aren't there to argue, we aren't there to push religion on you. <br>  <br>  But criticism is something that we will always get in this system of things & that's to be expected since Jesus & his disciples were treated the same way.<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|Q7wTZXWEaa	Along with the obvious issues of 'trespassing' and forcing their religious beliefs on you...<br>  <br>  Most people consider religion a very personal thing that does not need to be discussed outside of their home or church.  The most religious person I have ever met rarely speaks of her religion at all.  Why try to convince me of her religion when she has everything she spiritually  needs?<br>  <br>  Ever religion needs to respect people's rights to privacy. physically, emotionally and mentally.<br>  <br>  If anyone wishes to know more about a religion they will come to you.  You will not need to seek them ot.<br>  <br>  The thing that religious orders fail to realize is:  The hard you push, the more ridiculous and irritating you become.|`|IBkJZ8plaa	The difference is that one of them hands you a pamphlet or tries to talk to you when you are already out in public, around other ppl.

I dont like for people to show up at my door cause I didn' ask them to come, but i do admire their effort, more christians should be proactive, but their motive is even more important. is it somthing they do cause they are taught to or do they do it out of genuine love. you dont want to do it just to do it or that is not effective it should be somthing done because the spirit of god lead you to do it. if not lead by the spirit, its just works and is not effective.|`|ayaQGEgnaa	Because Jehovah's invade your space and come to you.

Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a lurking place of every unclean exhalation and a lurking place of every unclean and hated bird!

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	YES! It's horrible...I'm a magnet for hatred and mean people. They love me... I hate them. <br>  <br>  My first long-term relationship lasted for 8 months and ended with my boyfriend cheating on me. When I asked him about it he called me every name in the book and gave me a brutal verbal beating while I stood there crying my heart out. Oh, did I forget to mention that the other girl was one of my friends? :) <br>  <br>  Another guy told me, "Your hot. I wouldn't date you but I would love to f*ck you" Yeah, because that's not a big slap in the face for my personality. <br>  <br>  This isn't really a relationship attraction related to jerks, but I drew this one in pretty good. A customer at work (I'm a cashier at a dollar store) likes to come in, wait until I'm alone at the cash and come start saying mean things to me. The first time he asked me if we carried something and I said I wasn't sure but if we had it it would be in aisle whatever. His reply was, "Dumb blondes like you never know anything." Second time, Dollar store raised its prices and he called me a greedy bi*ch for charging him two dollars for a two dollar item. Third time I gave him his coin change but forgot to pull out a five ( no big deal, open the cash and grab one) and he called me a stupid bi*ch and asked for his money. My coworkers won't allow me to be on cash alone when he comes in anymore, thankfully so that's over with.<br>  <br>  I breed pools of hatred and mean around me...|`|52VDjbNTaa	Yes!

wB3AbJyLaa	No doubt he did, but let me ask you a question: When you start a relationship, whether it's a friendship or a relationship that might possibly lead to falling in love, can you foresee the possibility that the other person may sometime disappoint you or hurt you or even walk away from you completely? So why do you ever make friends or start relationships? I guess it's worth the risk. Having good friends, and all the wonderful things about being in love, that more than makes up the risk of getting hurt. I think it's the same with God. He knew we'd rebel against him, but he also knew many people would choose to follow him. It must be worth it to him, because he not only created us with free choice, but he even created the way to bring us back to him after we rebel, through the suffering of his Son Jesus.|`|AA11992885	Satan never turned against God, and Satan was NOT the one who tempted Eve<br>  <br>  Satan has always ever been a faithful and loyal servant of God|`|AA11124121	Christianity claims that God knows everything. The theological term is "omniscience." There are some implications of this doctrine that non-believers find troubling or even unacceptable to the concept of a loving God.<br>  <br>   If God knows everything, then He knows that some people whom He creates will end up in hell. Why would God create people who are destined for hell?<br>  <br>   It turns out that there are many unstated assumptions in this question, which are not valid for Christianity. A related question, "Why wouldn't God just create everyone to enjoy the glory of heaven?" will also be answered.<br>  <br>  The first, and most prevalent, incorrect assumption is that a person who is destined for hell has been predestined for hell by God. <br>  <br>  This is false. People choose to go to hell rather than submit their lives to God. You have absolute free will within the confines of your personal ability. <br>  <br>  You can prove this to yourself. Determine two possible courses of action. They don't have to be big decisions, just any two possible actions. <br>  <br>  Assign each action to either "heads" or "tails." Flip the coin and do what whatever course chance decided. You can do this as many times as needed to determine that you do, indeed, have free will. Occasionally, do the opposite of what the coins tell you. Has God prevented you from doing anything? No!<br>  <br>  The second incorrect assumption is that God alone has created you. <br>  <br>  <br>  You are the product of choices made by your parents. Therefore, God has not predestined you to be born at all. How can you blame Him for creating you to send you to hell?<br>  <br>  This is not to say that God is not involved at all in the creation of life. The Bible says that once a new human life is made God creates a spirit within the fetus and knows us at that point, even calling some to serve Him from the womb.|`|faT4MyVkaa	He does a lot of things that would be puzzling to a being possessing any of the omni traits.

FhXzlnDOaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Hi magicofdawn (again),<br>  <br>  Upon review, we found that the following answer was not in violation of the Answers Community Guidelines or Yahoo! Terms of Service.<br>  <br>  "God said husband and wife should become one. He never said husband and wife and wife and wife and wife. Isn't there a hadith that says Muhammad woouldn't let his son-in-law marry another woman because it would hurt his daughter? It's obvious that having to share your husband would hurt, is degrading and could be harmful to the family. Every example of polygamy in the Bible shows consequences to that action. There were problems because of having more than one wife. It was never sanctioned by God."<br>  <br>  The Yahoo!

Xsen794Aaa	That's asking a lot. You're not going to learn a lot for free unless you have someone who wants to teach you and/or you're a genius with languages.  If you really wanted to learn it, you wouldn't worry about the price tag, but here are my suggestions:<br>  <br>  First read an encyclopedia article on the language; Wikipedia is good too. <br>  Check out podcasts; FrenchPod101.com has good ones, as well as FrenchPodclass.com.  You can get these from iTunes by searching the names, or just search for French and check out all the free podcasts.<br>  <br>  LiveMocha.com is really good, but it doesn't teach much.  Rosetta Stone is pretty much the same thing, but with a lot more content.<br>  <br>  You might learn a little by watching French films, or at least your own DVDs with French dubbing and/or subtitles, but in all, it's going to take a long time to learn anything useful with any free program and you're better off starting out with Rosetta Stone.  You'll learn so fast, it'll be worth it because the time you would have spent learning by "free" methods, you could have just worked more and been able to buy five Rosetta Stones.|`|6JvAjG5kaa	there are several free sites listed here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4750701_learn-language-online.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4750701_learn-la...</a>|`|cCeyBbYgaa	You sound exactly like me a few years ago!!!<br>  <br>  But I'm glad to say I now speak French fluently.<br>  <br>  Trust me, from painful personal experience, those big expensive language programs are NOT WORTH IT!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ideas:<br>  Label everything in French! - yep! just like in kindergarten.  "Porte" on the door, "Fenêtre" on the window, and "Chaise" on the chair.<br>  <br>  A lot of DVD's include French dubs, so change the audio to French and turn on English subtitles.  Then you can hear the way it's said in French as you see it in English.<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learner.org/resources/series8...</a><br>  This is a free video course, GREAT for beginners.  The entire thing is in French - the only English you'll hear is in video 1 and in the very beginning of each film (as an intro).  Le Professeur is suprisingly good at getting the point across without ever uttering a word in English.<br>  <br>  Make your own flash cards (don't buy them or find any online - making them is the best way to learn the words).<br>  <br>  Go to french.about.com and look through their articles.  There are several good lessons and practice quizzes/games/cool stuff.  Also, subscribe to their "mot du jour" (word of the day).<br>  <br>  Once you get more comfortable with the language and if you like chatting, go to <a href="http://fr.worldsbiggestchat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fr.worldsbiggestchat.com/</a><br>  -all French chat rooms<br>  <br>  Try to find someone to practice with.  Myspace is good for gaining pen-pal'ish relationships and might give a French person opportunity to practice their English.  Try searching for a "French Meetup Group" in your area - it's a group of French-speakers/students who meet up from time to time to help eachother's fluency.<br>  <br>  <br>  The trick to learning a language is immersion.  Try to surround yourself with French as much as possible and before you know it, you'll start thinking in French!<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

X9txA1GVaa	It's really difficult to wrap our minds around the fact that there is another spiritual realm outside of the earthly one. It's weird and it still freaks me out but it's so true. So when you started your search for God, be aware that Satan took note. He realllly wants to hold on to you and not let you give it all to God. So, he's going to try his best to make you feel uneasy. He's gonna try to make you feel unsure about your decision and inadequate and like you're doing something wrong. God doesn't want salvation to be a difficult process. It's the devil that makes us think that! But remember all this stuff the devil tries to tell you are ALL lies from Hell and I mean that. Also, be aware though, that just believing doesn't save you. The Bible says "even the demons believe I exist and shutter!" You have to make a real decision to give him your life and commit to his will. You will mess up. I do all the time. But the point is, we are to surrender to him and let him have it all. That means giving him any sin in your past, any regret, any shame. He's so willing to take all of that from you. He also wants your talents and skills though. He wants to use you for his glory. And he sooo will if you let him! It's awesome when he does! But be encouraged. The devil doesn't mess with people if they're not threatening him. So just the fact that the devil sees you as a threat should be a huge encouragement. I know that God is proud of you and wants to welcome you home. Try to get involved in a group of people who love God. That helps a ton! Email me with any other questions. <br>  Blessings.|`|c867f04c9a12e6c45d6827a59f7f536daa	Feelings can be deceptive.<br>  <br>  Sin alienates us from God.<br>  Realize that you cannot do anything to work your way to heaven.<br>  Believing that God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind.

You may have been on the search for God for a month- but He is the one that is truly seeking you.  No one can ask questions like you did, unless the Holy Spirit draws them.

You have much more than a chance- you can be sure of your salvation- and this is how-<br>  <br>  1- admit that you are a sinner-  I believe you already did this.<br>  2-  confess your sin, and repent<br>  3- accept without a shadow of a doubt that Christ paid the price that you could never pay for your salvation.<br>  Once you do this , through the power of His Spirit strive to grow in your faith, and live a life that pleases Him.

When you get saved, you should have faith and also come to repentance, which means you actually try to turn your life around in the sin area.  If it's not that, then keep praying to God and ask Him what it is that you're feeling and that if you're not doing anything wrong, then to take that feeling away.  I think if you really need to talk to somebody it should be someone like a pastor who's actually experienced and who can talk to you face to face.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You're misunderstanding salvation. <br>  <br>  You can't be "almost saved".

THAT SIMPLE!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|yvAR2vcXaa	Are all religions pleasing to God, or is just one? <br>  Jesus started one true Christian religion. So today there must be just one body, or group, of true worshipers of Jehovah God. (John 4:23, 24; Ephesians 4:4, 5) The Bible teaches that only a few people are on the narrow road to life.—Matthew 7:13, 14. <br>  <br>  Why are there so many religions that claim to be Christian? <br>  The Bible foretold that after the death of the apostles, wrong teachings and unchristian practices would slowly come into the Christian congregation. Men would draw away believers to follow them instead of Christ. (Matthew 7:15, 21-23; Acts 20:29, 30) That is why we see so many different religions that claim to be Christian. How can we identify true Christians? <br>  <br>  <br>  How can you identify true Christians? <br>  <br>  The most outstanding mark of true Christians is that they have real love among themselves. (John 13:34, 35) They are not taught to think that they are better than people of other races or skin color. Neither are they taught to hate people from other countries. (Acts 10:34, 35) So they do not share in wars. True Christians treat one another as brothers and sisters.—1 John 4:20, 21. <br>  <br>  Another mark of true religion is that its members have a deep respect for the Bible. They accept it as the Word of God and believe what it says. (John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17) They treat God's Word as being more important than human ideas or customs. (Matthew 15:1-3, 7-9) They try to live by the Bible in their everyday life. So they do not preach one thing and then practice another.—Titus 1:15, 16. <br>  <br>  True Christians love one another, respect the Bible, and preach about God's Kingdom <br>  <br>  The true religion must also honor God's name. (Matthew 6:9) Jesus made God's name, Jehovah, known to others. True Christians must do the same. (John 17:6, 26; Romans 10:13, 14) Who are the people in your community that tell others about God's name? <br>  <br>  True Christians must preach about God's Kingdom. Jesus did so. He always talked about the Kingdom. (Luke 8:1) He commanded his disciples to preach this same message in all the earth. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) True Christians believe that only God's Kingdom will bring true peace and security to this earth.—Psalm 146:3-5. <br>  <br>  Jesus' disciples must be no part of this wicked world. (John 17:16) They do not get involved in the world's political affairs and social controversies. They avoid the harmful conduct, practices, and attitudes that are common in the world. (James 1:27; 4:4) Can you identify a religious group in your community that has these marks of true Christianity?

5Bpzt3Cnaa	I dont think it's true...some people who are living in the middle east, southern asia ,north africa have got light skin (almost white) ,  the arabs who live in the desert are lighter sinned than black african people who live in tropical forests , isnt that unlogical? no it's just biological <br>  Native people of Australia are very dark skinned (almost black) but most of actual australians are of european descent and will not have black skin untill billion of years!|`|5HPkIxZHaa	they are. the native aborigonees are similar to black people. <br>  even white people look red there. it burns their skin. white new born babys are light, but as they grow to be 10, there skin, burns and they look redish.|`|nTvPLJ8Baa	Natural selection is already taking place: <a href="http://www.webwombat.com.au/lifestyle/health/skinc1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webwombat.com.au/lifestyle/he...</a><br>  <br>  The light-skinned will soon die off, leaving the dark-skinned.|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	The people you are referring to are actually descendants of an English penal colony, hence the light skin.  The aboriginal people are much darker skinned.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	No, because I live in California and not everyone here is dark skinned. We barely get any precipitation.|`|v1JBAwSTaa	A great Majority Aussies are White, and they will stay that way, unless they are Abo's or Immigrants.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	The Aborignal people are the indigenous people of Australia and are dark skinned.  The rest of the population generally come from Europe and are white skinned.  They are not dark skinned because it is not in their genetics.<br>  <br>  By the way - it is NOT sunny all the time in Australia.  Have you been there?
Z92LPUqaaa	No, <br>  <br>  1) Atheism is not a set of beliefs and it is not a set of practices.<br>  2) Atheism is not a body of persons adhering to a particular set of beliefs.<br>  <br>  <br>  While atheists may have a lot in common with one another, they also have a lot in common with theists.  To state that lack of belief in gods is a religion, would be the same to state that all people who lack belief in Odin belong to the same religion.|`|AA10295535	We don't really believe in anything. That's kinda why.<br>  <br>  Also, for clarification for all those dim-witted people out there, there is NO church of atheism, NO god or supreme being, NO title of religion (ie, we are NOT a religion), etc<br>  <br>  We are a bunch-o people who don't believe in god, or any other supreme being.|`|qVcDlp9Raa	No|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	I'm a Christian, but I don't consider Atheism to be truly a religion in the common sense. What I mean is that we need to be careful with language. I do agree that many Atheists have faith in science similar to a person would have faith in a false religion, trusting the religious leaders without questioning them.  But to me the word is having to do with man's relationship with the supernatural, or supernatural - or higher power beings. Atheists do not believe in a supernatural so their beliefs are not compatible with any religion, unless they are Satanists.<br>  I could go on and say that humanism is a form of a religion that puts man in the position of God. I think if you were more specific I could call it a religion. Just remember that many people are bitter about the hardship of life, and need to discover God's love for them through giving his son Jesus for our redemption.|`|po62AbPqaa	no<br>  <br>  <:3(    }~~~~|`|LqyOHY37aa	First, atheism is a lack of belief in a god.<br>  <br>  Second what freaking beliefs and practices?<br>  <br>  Atheism is not a religion by the very definition of both words, atheism and religion.|`|AA10504443	Atheism is the lack of belief.<br>  <br>  There are no rituals.  There are no priests, nuns, no elders, no deacons.<br>  <br>  There are no meetings, no teachings, no book.<br>  <br>  Not a religion.|`|uJO0MbShaa	Nope.  Atheism has:<br>  -  no doctrine<br>  -  no book<br>  -  no pope<br>  -  no church<br>  -  no congregation<br>  -  no tax exemption<br>  -  no symbols<br>  -  JUST NO BELIEF IN A GOD.|`|axiA5mMoaa	It is a belief but not a religion. Religion requires certain regulations & traditions that actually bind man to a relationship <br>  with an organization of man made gods.|`|c4zJp6bZaa	Yes because all they talk about is God. I consider that a religion. Have a good day.|`|xbGgF6dLaa	its kinda opposite because atheism is kinda non belief in something instead of belief. So i guess it half is.|`|FxVRPIm3aa	No. If atheism is a religion, bald is a hair color.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	No. You could apply 1 and 2 to any political party or club, that does not make them all religions.|`|PEUwnGHraa	Might as well throw them all into a bucket full of waste.. they are both not from God.|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	It is a belief, but it's not a religion per se.|`|CBUPymktaa	oh most certainly ..|`|te9y6MQkaa	My definition of religion is "a tying back" as in a tying back to spirit. <br>  <br>  So if a proclaimed dis-belief in the god of the church causes someone to go within and be more spiritual and treat others of humanity in a loving and kind way then their belief ties them back to spirit - and my answer would be "yes."<br>  <br>  According to _your_ definition I would say "no". For it seems that atheism is not formal. Of course some have tried to link atheism with materialism and America certainly has a formal pursuit of material wealth that could be construed as "a set of practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons."|`|AA11692063	it is awesome that you brought this up because I have thought for a long long time that atheism was a religion especially the ones who are so focused on evolution. everyone has an opinion about where we came from. believing we came from nothing is as difinitive as believing we did. the true non religious people are those who are agnostic because they are not sure what to believe. you pretty much answered your question when you put the definition under it. athiest feel protective about  their beliefs the same as christians do. thats why they argue their opinions. if there really is no God an athiest stands to lose nothing when he dies or gain anything, so why do athiest feel the need to convince others to believe as they do? do they need to convince someone else to feel more sure about it themselves?|`|6SSASXYfaa	My response to that is isn't "a different way of thinking" what Atheists call religion?<br>  <br>  So, by their own definition, they are religious. sort of..|`|gYV5ikdgaa	I would consider it a "Lack thereof theological belief"<br>  So, not a religion, but a "Religion Heresy", or "Religious counterpart"<br>  or a "religious byproduct"?|`|6nExSFMZaa	i believe the sun will rise tomorrow=religion?|`|3PO45ncPaa	No..its not a religion<br>  <br>  btw, science only goes so far, and then there's God.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	No, atheism is not a religion. It is a wide held belief but that doesn't constitute it to be a religion.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	Yes it takes a great deal of faith to believe that all of this come from nothing|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	No|`|yV8fog7Paa	yes, because they all believe in something whether it's a god or not. a Religion doesn't mean "believes in a God" it's a religious practice, so to speak, they "lack" believing in a god just like Buddhists who lack believing in a god.|`|AA11690436	It is no more a religion than theism is.  Theists can be belong to various religions, or individuals can believe in God or Gods on their own.  Atheism can be a tenet of religions like Buddhism or Taoism or atheists can not believe in God or Gods on their own.|`|AA11974194	No. Atheism is not a region. There is no set of beliefs.  It is a lack beliefs in gods,  and there are no practices either (i.e going to church praying, etc)..|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.|`|vOuSZnKxaa	No|`|67EaIAvbaa	sure..why not...just pray that your a good one.|`|sKMAuY8eaa	there is no set of beliefs, no practices.<br>  <br>  is theism a religion? no.  <br>  <br>  atheism is the disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings.  that's it.  that's all.<br>  <br>  so no, not a religion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Atheism|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	No I wouldn't consider it a religion.  But you may if it makes you happy.  As long as I believe there are no gods, I don't care what you call it.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	There is no good reason to consider atheism a religion.|`|84gK4XlHaa	No, I wouldn't.  Religion implies a common spiritual belief, not a lack of one.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	is not collecting coins a hobby?  is bald a hair color?

Therefore they may come across as less informed than they actually are.  For instance, I've traveled a lot in the US and met a lot of intelligent people, but some of them have come out with complete howlers, including congratulating me on how well I speak English (I AM English), looking at my driving license with 'United Kingdom' written all over it and then declaring 'oh, so you're from Germany' and asking me if I know the Queen personally.|`|n30fNgLRaa	maybe we are equally smart just some of us are rebels and that's seen as "stupid" but my opinion is not based on behavior its based on intelligence|`|l1ctIW7eaa	why do you think you are allowed to speak for all non-americans worldwide?|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Well...<br>  <br>  -they beat us consistently in math and science<br>  -they know more about our history than we do theirs<br>  -most of our top scholars and top performers in academia are, in fact, immigrants<br>  <br>  The average American adult doesnt know enough facts about his country to pass the citizenship test, and 20% of American teens didnt know who the last vice president was. We have shows called "Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?" and we actually attacked one of our presidential candidates for being "élitist" despite the fact that the alternative graduated second to last in his class, and his running mate was unaware that Africa was not one country, but a continent made up of several.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Authentic Black American, im not gonna sugarcoat the facts just so people like you (who yell the word PRIVILIGE at us and then spell it wrong) can live in a deluded state. Alot of you "real americans" badmouth the countries we come from and then resent us when we do better than you. Is it my privilige to live here? Yes, in a sense that I got economic opportinuty that's unavailable to me at home. However, we're all immigrants in one sense or annother so for you to "hardly call us Americans" is ridiculous.

Yx3Y0a00aa	You might be surprised to find that you have a wonderful, if scary, opportunity here. The more personally associate with and know a person with a different background, the more comfortable you will feel with them and others that you unconsciously see as being like that person. In other words, individual people are not strangers once you know them, only groups are made up of strangers. Plus, as you begin to include others in your circle of friends and associates, the better you get to know (and love) yourself. This has been a very beautiful experience in my life. The fact that these Pakistani folks are willing to associate with you is a blessing. All you have to do is leave your assumptions at the door and allow yourself to get to know them. Don't be too hard or punitive towards yourself because it's hard to overcome prejudice. It's a cliche but fear really is the antithesis of love.

When a man or a woman receives the salvation of God, the Holy Spirit of God imparts eternal life within them and they shall never die spiritually but will live with Jesus forever. Those who refuse Christ and the rebirth of the Spirit within, when they die, they will split hell wide open and forever in torments they will be throughout the annals of time, where there is no clock.

Now, for the right settlement of this holy state, next to the institution of good laws was necessary the institution of good order; and account therefore must be taken of the subjects of this kingdom, which is done in this chapter, where we have,  I. Orders given to Moses to number the people (Num_1:1-4).  II. Persons nominated to assist him herein (Num_1:5-16).  III. The particular number of each tribe, as it was given in to Moses (v. 17-43).  IV. The sum total of all together (Num_1:44-46).  V. An exception of the Levites (Num_1:47, etc.).<br>  <br>  Numbers 2 - <br>  The thousands of Israel, having been mustered in the former chapter, in this are marshalled, and a regular disposition is made of their camp, by a divine appointment. Here is,  I. A general order concerning it (Num_2:1, Num_2:2).  II. Particular directions for the posting of each of the tribes, in four distinct squadrons, three tribes in each squadron.  1. In the vanguard on the east were posted Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun (Num_2:3-9).  2. In the right wing, southward, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad (Num_2:10-16).  3. In the rear, westward, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, (Num_2:18-24).  4. In the left wing, northward, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali (Num_2:25-31).  5. The tabernacle in the centre (Num_2:17).  III. The conclusion of this appointment (Num_2:32, etc.).<br>  <br>  Numbers 3 - <br>  This chapter and the next are concerning the tribe of Levi, which was to be mustered and marshalled by itself, and not in common with the other tribes, intimating the particular honour put upon them and the particular duty and service required from them. The Levites are in this chapter considered,  I. As attendants on, and assistants to, the priests in the temple-service. And so we have an account,  1. Of the priests themselves (Num_3:1-4) and their work (Num_3:10).  2. Of the gift of the Levites to them (Num_3:5-9), in order to which they are mustered (Num_3:14-16), and the sum of them taken (Num_3:39). Each particular family of them is mustered, has its place assigned and its charge, the Gershonites (Num_3:17-26), the Kohathites (Num_3:27-32), the Merarites (Num_3:33-39).  II. As equivalents for the first-born (Num_3:11-13).  1. The first-born are numbered, and the Levites taken instead of them, as far as the number of the Levites went (Num_3:40-45).  2. What first-born there were more than the Levites were redeemed (Num_3:46, etc.).<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><
AA10473868	On the first day of service, Nadab and Abihu apparently used coals of fire that were not taken from the bronze alter as prescribed (see Lev.6:12-13 and 16:12).  It seems, too, that they offered incense other than at the morning or evening sacrifce.  Some feel that they were drunk because a prohibitgion against drinking immediately follows their punishment (see vs 9).  The fire that killed them came from the cloud of glory that rested over the cover of the ark or the Mercy Seat.  Though it killed them, it did not consume their clothes or bodies (vs 5).  Today we are under grace--we do not have to offer any blood/fire sacrifices to God as Jesus paid it all.|`|viMIbjrSaa	they farted.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	never heard of that one before

When Moses had numbered the people God did not say, By these shall the land be conquered; but, taking that for granted, he tells him, Unto these shall the land be divided. “These that are now registered as the sons of Israel shall be admitted (as it were by copy of court-roll) heirs of the land of Canaan.” Now, in the distributing, or quartering, of these tribes, 1. The general rule of equity is here prescribed to Moses, that to many he should give more, and to few he should give less (Num_26:54); yet, alas! he was so far from giving any to others that he must not have any himself, but this direction given to him was intended for Joshua his successor. 2. The application of this general rule was to be determined by lot (v. 55); notwithstanding it seems thus to be left to the prudence of their prince, yet the matter must be finally reserved to the providence of their God, in which they must all acquiesce, how much soever it contradicted their policies or inclination: According to the lot shall the possession be divided. As the God of nations, so the God of Israel in particular, reserves it to himself to appoint the bounds of our habitation. And thus Christ, our Joshua, when he was urged to appoint one of his disciples to his right hand, another to his left in his kingdom, acknowledged the sovereignty of his Father in the disposal: It is not mine to give. Joshua must not dispose of inheritances in Canaan according to his own mind. But it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><
DDFgKxcaaa	I agree with your premise.  If god exists and his ways are beyond our understanding, then to claim to know god's will is to claim to be on a level beyond human.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	The one and only acceptable way to pray is to the Father is in the name of Jesus. No other way of praying is acceptable. If we ask the Father in the name of Jesus to show us His will then He will.

When we give our lives to Christ, He gives us His mind- so that we can know His will.  If knowing His will makes us God- then we could also say- knowing what my parents wanted me to do as a child, makes me my parents.  That sounds ridiculous doesn't it?  I can never be my parents, but I can know what they want me to do, and how they want me to behave.  I can choose to do what they want or not, that is my choice, just like we can choose to do His will or not.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes. Please ponder, and let the source speak for itself.|`|AA11124121	In conclusion, it seems likely that "in the image of God" refers to the characteristics of the human spirit and the ability to make moral judgments - things that are not found in any animal species, even those to whom we are said to be closely related. <br>  <br>  Even evolutionists are beginning to recognize the uniqueness of human beings. Dr. Ian Tattersall, in Becoming Human - Evolution and Human Uniqueness, says humans represent a "totally unprecedented entity" on Earth, and "Homo sapiens is not simply an improved version of its ancestors - it's a new concept." <br>  <br>  It is the ability to make moral judgments that convinces us of our inability to "measure up" to the intended moral standards laid down by God.<br>  <br>  However, it is the spirit of man that allows us to communicate with God's Spirit through Jesus Christ so that we can once again be in fellowship with a Holy God and experience the ultimate relationship in the universe.|`|AA10057370	No atheist can know God's will is to repent,accept Jesus as Savior,know the joy of salvation.<br>  They can still say no.They can *** and mock Him and christians.<br>  Even christians can know God's will is to pray & fast,study the bible,witness the Gospel,love and help the poor & needy,encourage other christians,etc.They may for whatever reason say no.|`|AA11974194	Not any more than if we knew what Albert Einstein's will is, we would be geniuses.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	Just what kind of logic is that? smacks of Mormonism.

Burt Lancaster, Clark Gable, Don Rickels.  <br>  Last year I was watching the 3 girls (7, 10, 12) from next door and we watched an old black and white cowboy movie.  They thought that was great.

You were sure that the actors you were seeing hadn't been "digitally enhanced" or photo-shopped.  They were real people (sometimes in goofy space suits, but real), warts and all.   Today you don't know what's real and what's not.  Eyes are too blue, teeth are too even and white, boobs are too round and firm, skin is too airbrushed, etc.  With very few exceptions, the look of the movie has become more important than the talent of the actors or the content of the dialogue.|`|wwdllMzYaa	i do like a few older older ones<br>  i love the b/w version of wuthering heights, laurence oliver and melre oberon<br>  great story, good acting<br>  <br>  and gone with the wind of course, classic<br>  <br>   modern movies now compared to the 70s 80s and 90s are rubbish to me<br>  gone are the days of just pure unfiltered great action, great acting, and great story<br>  its all rubbish now<br>  <br>  see, i can sound old so i belong here ;-D|`|zauQuf29aa	I do know the old comedies just arent that funny any more.|`|U7EARdCkaa	No, try "Ice Station Zebra"|`|P8dOSNslaa	yes i do|`|f8812f78f1ba5e0fefd58a87005ce671aa	True, today's amazing production, awesome effects and all that other stuff are something to consider and make movies more, ah, involving.  But I don't know about the acting, and especially about the story lines.  Hollywood has so little originality left; they just keep coming up with the same stuff, over and over.  Remakes, redoes and already-done-that's.  Some day you will be watching Batman 45.<br>  <br>  I kinda like those old mysteries from the late 40's, early 50's.  And the old science fictions from the 50's are great, sometimes for laughs.  I get a kick out of watching movies where people drive up to a space ship, wearing everyday clothing, climb aboard the ship and head out for the moon as if they were out for a sunday drive.|`|CHXkInMPaa	i'm just the same as you. i was born in the 90's so i've definetly been spoilt and really and truly i find it really hard to pay attention to a movie pre 80's. and the ones in the 80's need to be something that i saw on tv from when i was young like "karate kid", "Big", "Splash", you get the drift. i can't watch 70's movies except from musicals i.e, "Grease", "the wizard of oz" etc. now anything earlier i need to need to have an actual interestin watching a particular actor or movie. for example at some point i'd like to get round to seeing "Carmen Jones" with dorothy dandridge. But i definetly agree with you|`|AA10565336	I made a remark to a friend the other day.  I said the last decent movie was in black and white.  Anyone can take a picture of an apple and have it come out red using color film.  Do it in B & W and you are an artist.  I do know what you are saying though, very few old movies have the WOW factor of newer films.  <br>  <br>  The only films I don't, won't or can't watch are "blood and guts" films and war movies.  Vietnam may be forty years old but it remains alive and well in my mind.  They are memories that are bad enough without stirring them up.|`|AA11089846	Depends on the movie, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Invisible Man, The Birds, Gone With The WInd, The Black Dahlia, and I can think of all the musicals like: Singin in The Rain, The King and I, Madame Butterfly, Oklahoma, The Sound of Music, Oliver, Music Man, The old Clint Eastwood Movies, James Bond Movies and I can go on. Let's not forget Spanky and our Gang either. Depends on a person's age too and if you automatically grew up with colored television.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Are you kidding? I love old movies! Great acting and fantastic cinematography were around then too.

Which means being made with the similar make up<br>  <br>  Trinity:<br>  Father-Son-Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  Triune (of human)<br>  spirit-soul-body<br>  <br>  <br>  Image, in the original Herbrew, broke down to a phantom, which also means a spirit.<br>  <br>  The body is made up of physical things we can see (like nerves, etc.) to help us interact with all the physical things in our environment.<br>  <br>  The soul is non physical and helps us identify our personality stream to interact emotionally with the things that cant be touched, (love, depression, etc.)<br>  <br>  The spirit helps us long for an understanding of where we came from, why we're here, who made us, and to become the full potential that we were meant to be by our creator.|`|iu2hnHp7aa	Another thing people don't understand is that GOD = SON = HOLY SPIRIT = SANTA CLAUS = FAIRY TALE.<br>  <br>  <br>  SJC, you do not have a Spirit, or a Soul, and even if you did, they are the same thing.|`|cXXSfRttaa	It is not quite that simple cut and dry.  But you get an A+ for effort.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Hmmm, interesting question.<br>  <br>  I have a spirit, a soul & a body but I am 1 person.<br>  <br>  Job 13:8 says, Will you accept his PERSON? willl you contend for God?|`|f03c850b840553e6b4d515cd723f6280aa	You certainly make allot of assumptions.  Can you back up one statement with any certainty other than some religious conviction?   You assume your truth based on what fact?
GItBUBL9aa	He's a big governent Robin Hood who believes governent is the solution to all problems.  Countries that were communist/socicalist had depressed economies until they finally moved to a more capitalist society.  Obama is going to spend us into the poor house.<br>  <br>  The U.S. just became the first govenment in history to post over a trillion dollar deficit for the year, and we are projected to have trillion dollar deficits for several years to come.  We have to borrow this money to pay for that, and the interest alone for these stimulus/pork packages is over half a trillion dollars.   We're going to end up borrowing money just to pay interest. <br>  <br>  Obama is spending like an idiot when we don't have the money.  He even just pledged 900 million to rebuild Gaza.   I often hear how smart Obama is, but I think people are confusing his ability to articulate with intellegence.  He's disappointing me with his inabililty to understand the problems that will result from ballooning the deficit.  It will eventually devalue the dollar which leads to inflation.  When the dollar devalues banks have to increase the interest on people's loans, and I'm not talking about new loans, the interest will increase on existing morgages or the banks would loose money.  The banking system is set up to where it automatically does that.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  The following paragraph from an article by a professor of economics at Stanford University sums up what Robin Hood is doing to this nation:<br>  <br>  <br>  "Mr. Obama's $3.6 trillion budget blueprint, by his own admission, redefines the role of government in our economy and society. The budget more than doubles the national debt held by the public, adding more to the debt than all previous presidents -- from George Washington to George W. Bush -- combined. It reduces defense spending to a level not sustained since the dangerous days before World War II, while increasing nondefense spending (relative to GDP) to the highest level in U.S. history. And it would raise taxes to historically high levels (again, relative to GDP). And all of this before addressing the impending explosion in Social Security and Medicare costs."<br>  <br>  For the full article, go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123629969453946717.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12362996...</a>|`|82AAOxCfaa	i think he's trying to do what is best for the country. do you have any idea the amount of debt we are in because of the war alone? all of this happen before Obama got into office. stay on the main point and stop trying to find ways to blame the man.|`|tpSgxP0vaa	His plan is to bankrupt the country,so the people will depend on the government for their needs.<br>  A modern day Robin Hood,yes!<br>  But it's not right!<br>  Class envy is a powerful weapon,and he will use it to his advantage.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Obama wants our economy to take a dive so that we'll be begging for his socialized medicine and chip implantation.|`|6nExSFMZaa	he is just a politician, what ever that means these days.|`|nI1N3pxqaa	Hard to know exactly what he is thinking....<br>  <br>  I read a quote by Margaret Thatcher this week that said "the problem with Socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money", and it applies. Doesn't matter if your are the United States of America and your intentions are good, you can run out of money.<br>  <br>  He is a very smart man, but doesn't know what he is doing with the economy.<br>  <br>  Capitalism, which is the best economic system in the world, runs when people accumulate wealth and share it themselves, or the church does, not when the government does.

cCeyBbYgaa	oh come on people, NO it is NOT necessary.<br>  <br>  Could it come in handy?  Absolutely!  There are a lot of people in both LA and Miami who speak little to no English, so learning Spanish might be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're wanting to be an Accountant or Financial Advisor (or really, most professions), you might get more business if you can speak Spanish, so again, not necessary but a good idea.<br>  <br>  And hey!  If nothing else, learning a second language is fun and gives you additional skills!  Can't really find a downside to it other than the effort put into it.  Sounds like, in your situation though, the effort will be well worth it!|`|H1T2sBF6aa	Yes it is. I wish I could take the time to do it. If you have the opportunity. Grab it and be better for it.|`|a95GfQulaa	Spanish is extremely useful, but in addition to that, it's extremely satisfying to be able to speak a second language.|`|XiiPmHELaa	I would say that learning Spanish would be a really good thing to do. Since there are so many Spanish speakers in all the places that you want to live in it would most likel be a good idea to at least learn the basics of Spanish and the main phrases, such as Hello how are you, and Whats your name? And so on. And Spanish is quite an easy language to learn so Im sure you would pick up on it really quick.<br>  Good luck!|`|NkIczELyaa	I would say yes, just from my experience I work in a courthouse and it would definitely come in handy to learn spanish, i would learn the basics to get by w/ and then when you get down there and meet people they can help you get more in depth w/ the spanish. Just my input though. LOL
Eirc20exaa	I answered this question to someone earlier and it is a heavily opinionated answer but probably Rosetta Stone.  Unfortunately programs like this will cost you a few hundred dollars.  Your best bet is to travel abroad for a month.  If you find the right people in place like Costa Rica (where I'm going this summer to study abroad), they will only charge you a few hundred dollars to live with them and feed you.  If you spend a month somewhere in a Spanish speaking country, if forces you to speak and learn it and your Spanish will improve better than any simple computer program can teach.  Also, they're are Spanish groups (people who speak English and get together to practice Spanish) that most major cities have around.  Your best way to learn it is to interact with others, I know, I'm minoring in it.
Y7tGKcjZaa	My guess is Bisexual. I'm a lesbian and the thought of being with a guy grosses me out, so I'm not sure your a lesbian. But you could be, and just haven't figured it out yet. Sometimes it take time. Maybe the stigma is preventing you from fully accepting it. But I honestly can't say. You have to do some soul searching and figure it out. Good Luck.
XDbC2Di1aa	I think you might just need to try some relationships out. The girl you're attracted to, try asking her to go to dinner, or a movie, or something. Just hang out, and also try building relationships with guys. Maybe you'll find that right now, you just don't "want" a relationship. Maybe you'll find you don't have a problem dating either in the end. Just try it out, take it slow, and see where it goes.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	I think straddling the fence is what you are trying to. The convenience of a relationship at work works best if non sexual at beginning. You are lonely and should get in touch with your sexuality in order that a relationship might develop. The ability to think of either gender as suitable is something you must face and accept as the best of both worlds until the special one becomes evident. Good luck and have many good days because love and life are going on with you.

Duh!|`|sohnrZDcaa	What do you know about Hell?<br>  <br>  By believing in Jesus and being “saved” the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your “unsaved” family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! That’s HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of “I told you so…” from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story written by the authors of God’s Holy Word, the Bible!<br>  <br>  Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us…) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). “Then he cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME.’ (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling… BTW, at this point you can tell the necessary IQ level to believe all this crap “in your heart!”) But Abraham said, ‘Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you when you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years…!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED!<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for “worshiping” this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever while poking fun at the damned in Hell…!!! Christians need to forget that the Bible writers are telling us that during the “Creation Week” as soon as God created Heaven and the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s “beauty and Holiness” and rebelled against him on the spot under the leadership of Lucifer* (*Light Bearer – The most beautiful Angel ever created!) and they became Demons and Satan, and so on.<br>  <br>  The Bible God promised the Jews to be “rich lenders and not borrowers” like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DON’T OBEY they will be poor “slaves and borrowers” like Lazarus in Heaven! I know it sounds screwy, but what the heck that’s the story that the Bible writers managed to say! That’s why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible should be taken literally… short of seriously! Especially the silly teasing words that Sweet Jesus aka “Creator of the Universe” will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL…!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that… or wouldn’t they? That’s about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!<br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Sweet Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a “slaughter house” religion and the preachers know how to profit out of it!)<br>  <br>  Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name." <br>  <br>  At the same time The Christians will be worshipping God day and Night WITHOUT REST FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER… Just how narcissist can the Bible God possibly get?  <br>  <br>  Revelation 4:8-9 (KJV) …and they REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come* (*that’s also some stuff that the Christians will be doing for ever and ever and ever when they get to Heaven).  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne…<br>  <br>  In reality there is no Heaven or Hell outside of the Bible. Even so some the most honest Bible writers say so, too. The whole idea is a very primitive religious people control device and a money making scheme banking on human gullibility! The Bible writers had God certify King Solomon to be the WISEST MAN ever to set foot on this Earth, and he has this to say... <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is God’s word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.<br>  <br>  The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind… <br>  <br>  Job 7:9 (NIV) As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.|`|VWMbRHlOaa	Jesus is right around the corner.  NOW is the time to repent and ask for forgiveness!!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	God's Word is truth, and those who believe in Jesus will be saved- however, I don't think the way you shared God's word would help others to come to know the love of Christ.  I am 100% Christian, who is very thankful that God saved me, and I will share with my faith with others, but I share how Christ first changed me. That helps draw people to a savior that is loving, and holy!!|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	No|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Well, the Bible says that the most important thing is to love God with all your heart and soul and mind.  It doesn't say love the Bible with all your heart and soul and mind.<br>  <br>  But we see many examples of "lifestyles" clashing with His Word.  For example, today those who promote homophobia are trying to redefine morality and God's Word.  They do everything they can to indoctrinate others into believing that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans."  <br>  <br>  Christ never condemned gay people and He certainly never condoned homophobia.  I think I will side with Christ on this issue rather than a bunch of angry unrepentant homophobes seeking to justify their sinful, anti-gay lifestyle.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Excepting reality is a good thing .|`|AA11124121	no hell..no heat..no nonsense.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Praise God.

I don't care much for my own nose, and if I could have afforded it when I was younger, I would have had it fixed.

Either way:<br>  <br>  Plastic Surgery- your body is your body, do with it what you will<br>  <br>  God- That would be a severely complicated question and my opinion is that there has to be a God for him to care what you look like. However, if you believe in a Christian God then the form your body takes would not mean anything to God; Isn't that the whole point of heaven and the eternal spirit? Anyone who tells you differently is completely ignorant of the Christian religion.

GOD has free will to decide the outcome<br>  <br>  So, if you're okay that you might die on the operating table, then go ahead.  If you're okay that you might get a terrible staph infection and die a few days down the line, then go ahead.  If you're okay that you something could go horribly wrong and you're disfigured for life, then go ahead.<br>  <br>  Make YOUR decision based on the fact that God gets to act last.  Be sure about your decision because you can't be sure about His.<br>  <br>  Or you can do as the Bible says and die to self, FORGET about your will, and ask the Lord what He would have you do.  If you do what God would have you do then there's no need to worry about His free will.  You did as He would have you do, right?<br>  <br>  So, either act first and then pray OR pray first and then act.  Your choice!|`|LZJPMl8raa	If you are injured, then there is nothing wrong with surgery. But if it is a surgery to make you more beatiful, that could be a sin|`|3A73oIoraa	You sound very young.

Its philosophical dictums of Samkhya Yoga are what I subscribe to.<br>  <br>       It postulates a deity, one "Isvara", who is responsible for evolving, maintaining and involuting what we call the universe: it's a never ending, beginningless, endless cycle - has no abosolute initial beginning nor end point - beyond time.<br>  <br>       Sin, forgiveness, salvation and the like, has no relevance - only Karma: any choice has an inevitable consequence(good, or bad).<br>  <br>       In my view, any institutionalized, dogmatic religions are encumbrances to ultimate realization, of ultimate reality.<br>  <br>       I look upon Isam as one of these: nothing more, nothing less.<br>  <br>                                                     Alberich<br>  <br>  edit: boy did I ever make a big blunder; should have read your profile before responding to this question - a big waste of time, energy and effort on my part.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Bad.<br>  <br>  I felt sick to my stomach the first time I picked up the Quran and read Sura 2.|`|FSDjC3Uyaa	Spiritually speaking, I believe islam to be the most evil religion in the world.

Islam is one of the three great monotheistic faiths with Judaism and Christianity. It share many of the tenets of the other two, and recognises people such as Moses and Jesus Christ. It is, arguably, a purer monotheistic religion with its founder not being given the status of a God (where I have fallen out with Christianity is over the doctrine of the Trinity - I just cannot get my head round that effective fudge created by the Council of Trent in the 4th century) Let us not forget that it was Islam that saved much knowledge from the ancient world and that Moorish Spain was a beacon of intellectual light in the midst of what was a barbaric Christian Middle Ages. To brand all Muslims as hate filled terrorists is as bad as labelling all Christians as ignorant fools merely because of the actions of so called creationists.<br>  <br>  Your point about slavery is bad - do not forget that the Christian world - and the rabid Christians of the southern states of the USA condoned slavery until the mid 19th century. It took until the 1960s for black people to be recognised as full citizens in parts of the USA by people who paid lip service to a book which states that its adherents should love their neighbours as themselves. Rape of captured women has happened in all times by soldiers of all faiths..<br>  <br>  Later, sorry you comment about the Trinity just proves my comment about what a fudge this is and what logical leapfrogs are needed. If Christ was 'The Son of God', then he was different from the Father ('no man comes to the Father but by me..') The Holy Spirit is hardly mentioned in the Bible (and never in the teachings of Christ) - it was an invention of the 4th century church fathers. How, with all this Christianity can claim to be monotheistic totally escapes me|`|uJO0MbShaa	It's a religion and there's nothing positive about a religion because it enslaves people to follow a million rules just because someone said that someone claimed that somebody else declared they talked to god and got all the rules from god and everybody must obey because of that.... or die.  And people do!|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	I do not have sufficient insight into Islam to answer the question or debate the raping of girls. However, I would point out that the raping of boys is also frowned upon, and is linked to authority figures within the Christian community. So it is not wise to bring this up.<br>  Also slaves were common in Christ's time and after and were part of the economic framework of pre-capitalist society.<br>  If you wish to debate this point you need to do it in terms of established doctrine. even within Christianity there are divergences, even among people who claim the Bible is the literal word of God, as between the "born agains" and the followers of Harold Camping.<br>  When you bring up the issues you have with Islam, you need to support it with references, otherwise people can say you are incorrect or misinterpreting things. <br>  I am not taking sides, I am just trying to help you move your argument along, since someone like me cannot tell if you speak the truth or not without you documenting your references. I assume you are interested in spreading the light of truth.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Like many other religions, there are millions of Muslims who would never hurt anyone and read the Koran as a loving text.<br>  But the extremist few have ruined it's reputation.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	I don't agree with the religion of Islam (or any religion for that matter), but I believe the vast majority of Muslims are good people and deserve respect in my view.|`|sMbIzXbUaa	mostly good. there are some crazies out there.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	Islam is a violent, sick religion. It's founder, Muhammad, created the religion by taking 600 children, murdering their parents, and raising the children as his own, brainwashing them. Muhammad was under influence of Satan. <br>  <br>  You say the extremists are giving Islam a bad name? The extremists are mainstream Islam. They are following the Quran closer than anybody else! When Christ comes back he will deal with this evil crap and dispose of it Himself into the bowels of Hell where it belongs. It, and all its followers. What? You can't imagine how God would throw all Muslims into Hell? Well for one, God doesn't throw ANYone in Hell. People choose themselves. And only about 10% of people go to Heaven. I'd be surprised if it were any more than that. No one knows how to love anymore, no one cares about anyone but themselves anymore. Being "good" has nothing to do with it either. You don't go to Hell for being bad and you don't go to Heaven for being good. <br>  <br>  <br>  BW<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'd almost have to agree with Alberich's edit. Dakota, you can't pledge your allegiance to the US and God at the same time. You can't serve two masters.

Each of the 400 people could conceivably compete amongst themselves, but eventually, they'll learn that if they band together, they'll be able to overcome others. But if the land can only support 100, then a group of 200, or 300 won't do. Only 4x groups of 100 or less will work. So naturally these groups will form, and they will begin to compete amongst themselves through tribal and societal wars. And obviously if one group of 100 people decide they are going to be nicey-nicey, they won't last long when it comes down to who gets to eat. So, eventually those that are born with a mentality that will support an "us vs. them" mentality will survive. <br>  It is literally a biological imperative.

Moreover, *do not call anyone your father on earth*, for one is your Father, the heavenly One.  *Neither be called leaders*, for your Leader is one, the Christ." --Matthew 23:9-10<br>  <br>  "...The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances ... by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; *forbidding to marry*, *commanding to abstain from foods* which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth." --1 Ti 4:1-3<br>  <br>  (Catholic priests have been forbidden to marry for hundreds of years.

sAYrfp1Gaa	You can't simply qualify an entire country like that. In general, middle America is ignorant of other cultures outside of their own simply because they are uneducated about people and are taught to gang up on people because of their differences instead of making an effort to get to know and understand them. Trust me, I've been in the school system for over 15 years now and I know plenty of people from all demographics and I've been to schools all along the east coast, from Mass to Florida, so my sample size is rather large. However, there are many places you can go, like say, San Francisco or New York, that is full of culture and tolerance and people who make the effort to learn about things that do not mirror their upbringing. And citing the fact that America is a melting pot does not necessarily prove it's cultured-ness since many of our non-Caucasian communities are segregated from each other. Think: Little Italy, Chinatown, Harlem--these places all just becoming more integrated, even 10 years ago would have been a vast difference from what they look like today. And not to mention, America does have it's own culture, some would argue it's a capitalist, consumerist culture which I personally agree with but, there are other people who hold the "American Dream" and the idea of social mobility and democratic values etc to be the essence of American culture. Who knows? Culture is simply what a group of people develop as their traditions after having lived as a community for a long time. So I guess in the sense of what it means to be cultured--to be educated about things and people you weren't raised knowing and aren't familiar with--we aren't very cultured as a country, but we have a long history regarding our contact with other races that is still a barrier to accomplishing that feat.

hXHBm1BSaa	Since you are always asking about people insulting you, banning you and generally doing things you do not like, I would suggest you look at yourself, not them. This many people will not abuse and insult you unless there is a reason. Maybe you are doing things which upset them. Considering we all live in the same world, you really need to make some attempt to live your own life, without totally disrupting the lives of those a round you. If you can't do this, go off and live in a desert somewhere so you can do exactly what you like without upsetting anyone.

I have only two bedrooms and my kids visit often from out of state. She yells at night and I can't lift on her and she is incontinent so I had no choice.Sometimes life sucks and today it sucked really bad.

8UnSNDPxaa	it's impossible to determine if somebody is gay. although there are some things such as innuendos or mannerisms that somebody might make that indicate that they like you or somebody. <br>  <br>  1, Do they look at you? If they look at you longer then they would look at somebody else, then they most likely like you. Especially if they smile while looking. Sometimes they might even glimpse over just to see if you're looking.<br>  2 How close do they get? Straight people now about personal bubble but if somebody likes you then they aren't afraid to invade it. They might touch you or stuff like that. (hug, move feet so they're touching yours)<br>  3. How do they act? Differently around you then around others? How do they speak? With a lisp? (some gay men speak with lisps) stuttering could be a sign of nervousness which means they like you and care about what you think. How do they walk? sometimes if men walk very feminine this could (not always) mean that they're gay.<br>  4. How do they dress? are they into fashion? how well do they put an outfit together?<br>  <br>  p.s all the answers above apply to men, I'm not so sure about women, <br>  hope I helped!|`|3dlBt6vaaa	show him your twat and if he screams and runs away, he is gay.|`|2lim0SHvaa	Ask them if they want to spent the night with me.<br>  If they say yes, they are gay.<br>  If they say no, they are shy and gay.|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	Ask him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wrong assumptions will cost you a lot.<br>  I learned that lesson the hard way.|`|CjAknKT8aa	OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

From places you go, what you drink, and what you eat, to how many times you scraped your knees or what medicines you have taken.

It would involve detachment and ignoring the status quo.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe it's both. As to whether it applies, it's another question. Individuals may vary.<br>  <br>  There's a choice in being self identified as straight, gay, bi, lesbian, pan, celibate...  <br>  <br>  lack of physical or anatomical attraction, does not prevent people from maintaining loving relationships with someone which falls outside of their perceived sexuality, identity, beliefs or attractions. Nor does it prevent them from engaging in intercourse or other sexualized activities.<br>  <br>  But the sexual or physical attraction portion remains the steadfast component rather than personal identity, an examination of human relationships and social or cultural association. <br>  <br>  Sexuality in terms of being heterosexual or homosexual is irrelevant in the context of self. The only place it becomes relevant is in its pairings. <br>  <br>  If there's a core attraction to sexes, then its based purely on genitalia. <br>  <br>  So, otherwise, I suppose I coul dmake the argument that gender and sex is moot, and that it's an attraction of masculine or feminine attributes, which could be presented in either sex. <br>  <br>  Gender is social as is and to sexuality. <br>  <br>  There are other biological components and differences to consider, however those are not present in all males or females, nor is there a specific set of components to be determined as intersexed.<br>  <br>  But obviously, the argument is going to eventually focus towards a perception of biological sex and of social gender roles, and ones attraction to either, or.<br>  <br>  but for argument's sake, in binary laws, it's more effective to suggest that bisexuality is present in the womb as simple to accept as a neutral gender, well that is until development process begins... but bisexuality likely remains at birth as well, but sexuality is eventually shifts for multiple reasons, towards a homosexual or heterosexual association. <br>  <br>  Though one would think with the current population of the world, that heterosexuality is unnatural - particularly, at the current stage of our civilized development, which has otherwise eliminated the need for intercourse in order to produce offspring - offspring by a more reliable and safer method, as well as providing the option to terminate.<br>  <br>  And if homosexuality was a choice, that it would be more appropriate as well as being ethically and morally the right choice, as this would go to the promotion the human race and controlled breeding, while still allowing for companionship and human relations to further society's other goals. <br>  <br>  It's not particularly my own desire and leaves out many variables. But this is only a game of theory. <br>  <br>  And of choices, heterosexuality is rather out of control.|`|2Ss64ScQaa	Here is the thing... <br>  I CHOOSE to be discriminated against.<br>  I CHOOSE not to be able to make a family with my partner.<br>  I CHOOSE not to have all my rights.<br>  I CHOOSE not to be able to get jobs, just because I am gay.<br>  I CHOOSE to have my family hate my because of my sexual orentiation.<br>  I CHOOSE not to be able to marry the one I love.<br>  <br>  =/, OHH yea, that makes sense.|`|p35jBvMUaa	By birth,<br>  obviously.<br>  <br>  although i would make the choice to be gay, if it were an option and wasn't.<br>  <br>  Gay lifestyles  are so much more fun. hehe<br>  :D|`|3XLnDyupaa	Um, I'm pretty sure this question has been asked, and resolved, many many times.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BIRTH.|`|Ldq6ql3vaa	Homosexuality is by your mom! when ever a person sees you mom they turn gay!<br>  I'm really sick of people asking this question!

Unfortunately, it will be up to your teachers.|`|AA11124121	No single scenario for human origins gains total support from all paleoanthropologists. In general, current human evolutionary theory traces back our origins from earlier tree-dwelling stock to the Australopithecines first appearing about four million years ago. <br>  <br>  The more recent genus Homo is thought to arise about two million years ago and contains sequentially such representatives as Homo habilis, Homo erectus, archaic Homo sapiens, the Neanderthals, the Cro-Magnons, and finally modern man, sometimes designated as Homo sapiens sapiens. <br>  <br>  Evolutionists reject the notion of a single first true human being. They view human emergence as a gradual process of becoming more intelligent, more self-reflective, and more capable of consciousness – a process called “hominisation.” <br>  <br>  Clearly, this evolutionary perspective rejects the notion of a single set of first parents.<br>  <br>  But man’s intellective soul does not admit of “gradual emergence.” It cannot be only “partially” existent, since between being and non-being there is no middle. <br>  <br>  The intellect’s exercise may be diminished or even extinguished through brain deficiency or injury, but intellect itself is fully present in every true man.|`|QvDOyPjBaa	You can choose how much it affects you.  As a Christian, I believe both evolution and creationism is possible.  You just need to figure out what you believe in and go from there.  You don't have to conform to a certain belief just because you think it's taboo to do so.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Evolution is the backbone of modern biology. I don't think they would get very far if they held on to a Creationist view of the origin of life. Just my view.|`|AA10265685	I don't think you have to believe in evolution to be a great scientist.  In fact, evolution doesn't use the scientific method at all to prove itself.|`|9UQlhzitaa	go forward brother<br>  <br>  Christianity will make you a very good scientist because everything  in science is about proving a  theory.You have already prov en one theory to be wrong so continue to do that as you were gifted to do.<br>  <br>  also Family Life Today can give you lots of those in the science field whom are believers|`|c5ffa63bef1a57e12459947bb46f6b28aa	The creation myth is an inadequate foundation for any career in science and I don't see why you would want to mix them in that way.

The problem is that all the atheists are in the "politically correct" places; therefore, they have more influence. Fortunately, many scientists are starting to have doubts about the nothing turning into something theory. If you want to know more about being a Christian scientist read "Case for a Creator" by Lee Strobel. As far as criticism goes you are going to get quite a bit just remember that Jesus warned Christians of this in the NT. Stand up for what you believe in and be ready to give an account for it.|`|dGX35OCTaa	As long as you stand by what you know is right, you will be ok. There are many Christians who are scientists. <br>  One of the things that I found in college when writing papers was to back up my beliefs. Understand that the professor is more interested in why you believe what you believe and whether you can support that belief than he/she is interested in what you believe. What I mean by that is that if you find yourself in a position where you need to write on creation, support your stand on it.<br>  You can find some really good resources on Creation science from this site <a href="http://www.icr.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.icr.org.</a> They are tops in Creation Science as far as I am concerned.

53f1d35346c26102777b3d43102257c3aa	I've heard that big time drug dealers that control big regions can also help. IDK, but there are rumors that some of these people also have connections with the mafia, the problem good luck finding them. I know there are some mafia members in mexico but i don't know where, I bet its just business things like big companies and hotels, but you are not going to find them here in the internet.|`|AA11183969	You need to know someone who has a relationship with the mafia. Loan sharks and drug dealers are just some who have contacts with these people. Also, you have to enter the criminal and drug trafficking business or get into contact with agents from this business. Usually, the mafias would be represented by agents to search for new members and can be commonly seen in bars and pubs although you have to know which one. The bartender would usually be the one who can help you identify them.<br>  <br>  The original Mafias are Italian underground crime organizations that don't interact with society. They were active in the past around 60's and 70's and several wars evoked during that period including, the First Mafia War and the Second Mafia War. Their businesses range from money lending to heroin sales.<br>  <br>  One of the most famous mafia that still exist is the Cosa Nostra (USA). It is an offshoot from the Sicilian Mafia in Italy. Other famous ones include the Russian mafia, the Japanese Yakuza and the Chinese Triads although the most famous of these four is the Japanese Yakuza.<br>  <br>  However, there's a catch. Once you've been connected to the mafias, it is quite impossible to get out unless you surrender yourself to the police. Even so, the mafias would still be after you even after you have done your time. You can come in but you can't come out. Hiring mafias is a crime and joining them would lead to severe complications and it is also a crime. Well, contact them at your own risk. Just to tell you, don't play with fires.<br>  <br>  Once you have contacted the mafia, you have to make a deal with them and often, one of the conditions are to give your financial position and the details of your family members. Why? The mafias can find your family members and use them to extort money. Also, giving out your financial position is a very grave mistake one would do. Why? If you are rich, the mafias can easily extort money from you whenever they want EVEN after your job for them has been done. Keep in mind that they are criminals. If you are poor, they can easily threaten you to work for them.|`|DuC5hfdfaa	You have to be Italian and "in the family."

Oh sure a Mafia member might just read this question and contact you (and if that happens, WONDERFUL) but the Mafia generally doesn't talk to people they don't know.<br>  <br>  You'd have to network. BIG TIME. And depending on the actual Mafia (there's the Russian, the Sicilian and the Italian to name a few) you should narrow your search to populations that would be more predisposed (for a lack of a better word) to having Mafia connections.<br>  <br>  You could possibly do research in regards to people who are currently in prison and write them, but seeing how they are in prison, I don't think you'd get anything really juicy or reliable.|`|GokGEXfiaa	lol.....i suggest you dont.....<br>  <br>  btw, if you really want to know, then call their customer support number on 1800 BROKEN LEGS.<br>  <br>  actually they are a great bunch of people really who would never extort sombody who comes on YA asking for the real mafias phone number.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	You can afford me so sorry.|`|Tv8cuXmtaa	The thing is you don't<br>  the mafia contacts you and usually that is not a good thing|`|eQVvnq7Haa	you can call me.

sWXrnErnaa	Ok calm down, and dont stress, what you are going through is totally normal for any 16 yr old. You are young and putting a lot of pressure on yourself to have sex and to like it - that alone can be enough to stop you from enjoying yourself.<br>  <br>  At 16 your sexuality is manifesting itself and will do so in many ways, dont be alarmed, you are very young to be having a sexual relationship and before you think oh thats just an older persons view I had sex the first time at 13 (not a good move mind you).<br>  <br>  You see good sex isnt just about your body its also about your emotions, your confidence, your ability to relax, your feelings for the person you are with, your maturity and so much more.<br>  <br>  As for thinking another guy is good looking thats not an issue, there is no reason you can not differentiate between someone who is good looking and someone who you consider not to be that doesnt mean your gay it just means you can see and think.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is take this pressure off yourself, you are who you are, you obviously like girls and thats cool (and would be cool even if you did like guys) the reason you feel scared and nervous is because you want these girls to like you thats normal.<br>  <br>  As for your first sexual experience....guess what most ppl are disapointed their first time, sexual satisfaction comes from experience, love, trust and security with your partner.<br>  <br>  So I tell you what just enjoy being with your friends, have fun dating and forget the sex for now, when you find the right person (female or male) you will know it is the right time. Trying to have sex because you think you should or to prove a point is just going to lead to more disappointment and stress. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps....|`|CjAknKT8aa	OMGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!! that was like so totally long!!!!!!!!! sorry hon!!!! i have like this like weard tendency to like fall asleep when like reading like a lot!!!!!!!!

ugjWHz39aa	haha idk. i've been stumped with that one for almost 4 years now. let me know if you figure it out and good luck =]<br>  <br>  btw, why is it vital that you stop liking them?<br>  <br>  yeah, me too. i've tried dating 2 guys and a few girls, but i always think about her when i'm with them. i always wish i was with her and i never stop thinking about her. and it gets worse everyday. i'm not sleeping much at all at this point...<br>  <br>  well, atleast something good has come out of the situation. i am 100% sure that i only like 1 girl and that's never going to change nomatter what i try to do about it, and i can look forward to seeing her whenever i get the chance, even though she doesn't know i like her. or atleast i don't think she does...<br>  <br>  just curious, do you ever wish that the person you can't stop thinking about feels exactly the same way about you? i do.<br>  <br>  <br>  are you older or younger? and by how much? and why wouldn't she like you back?|`|YW9syZpbaa	First, I'm sorry, cause it hurts and it sucks.  No matter whatever the reason (they are married, they are straight, they are in a relationship, whatever...)<br>  <br>  I think the best way to stop liking someone is to write a list of the qualities about them that you admire.  Try your best to incorporate the qualities of them into you.  In a way you are bettering yourself, and incorporating a piece of them that you will always have with you.<br>  <br>  For example, as a gay guy, I've fallen in love with a straight guy, and the best thing I did was to take what I loved about him and tried to be more like him.  It actually helped me to let him go.<br>  <br>  Also, try to make yourself as a cup full and overflowing, ready to give.  Not half empty waiting for someone to fill you up and make you feel complete and full.<br>  <br>  Find activities that help the community, the elderly,  children, etc., and lose yourself in that, and you will then become more independent and move on.|`|Ef8iNZL1aa	Well i would ask another guy you like to go out.

FATyhyZ2aa	To begin, recognize that being jealous will not remove the beautiful women from the class.  It will make you act differently toward your boyfriend which may make you look less appealing in his eyes & decide it's easier just to get a new girl friend.  So jealousy is just going to take away the very thing you want to keep.  /  You CAN tell your boyfriend about your feelings.  If you can't then that's the root of your jealousy, lack of trust.  /  You can change your looks.  Point out different things on these other women.  Asks if he likes that.  Ask how he would feel if you tried that hairstyle, make-up, type of fashion?  /  Keep in mind that a man may want to see a woman in a see-thru top, but would not like to see that on his girl friend.  /  The main point is that you think your looks are what is keeping him around.  This lack of security can be very unappealing to a man.  /  I had a beautiful friend who never got guys when we went out.  So when she went to the bathroom, I asked the man who'd be flirting w/ her, then changed his interest to me, WHY?  He said,"She is lovely and very sweet but there is something in her eyes.  Like she's too needy or desparate.  A guy just knows when a woman brings to much baggage with her."  (Actually, he was right.  My friend had once told me that she thought that she could never be loved.  She was very needy.)  Don't be that person.  Find ways to build your confidence. Try praying for that instead of beauty b/c confidence will last longer.  /  You are still so young.  You will have time to develop that.|`|iLFYj6Qgaa	You say that he likes you and loves you. That means that he has chosen for you and not for those other beautiful girls. Maybe he looks at them, but there's nothing wrong with looking. After all, it's with you that he goes home in the evening and that he shares a life. Be proud of yourself, be proud that he's with you. Once you feel the pride and you show it, you will automatically be prettier than you were when you cried all the time. Beauty is not only made of the perfect measures and the perfect hair color, you know. It's for a great part made of what you show to people. So have a positive attitude, so that he will always keep on choosing to go home with YOU.
wSeOxs7Jaa	You're going to need to talk to a lawyer. Every country and state has different laws so there's no generic answer.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I hate to say this but, unless her adoptive father signs away his parental rights there isn't anything you can do, he is legally her father.<br>   <br>  Each state has it's own laws regarding adoption and parental rights.

0c9JITaWaa	The best advice I could give you is to think before you speak. The Hispanic culture is not much different than that of the  American one. They are hard workers, family oriented and faith based. Don't over analyze, we are all one in the same. <br>  <br>  -Till Christ Returns<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|C9QQPROkaa	lol i felt the same way when i met my bf's family for the first time.|`|CPGMIcEoaa	well it really depends on what you said and how...maybe the timing it wrong just like in the american culture. if you are really concerned say "que paso?" meaning what happened in spanish...we don't usually take anything offensive although there are latino guys who can act rude if you are trying to get one of the girl that they like..but that shouldn't stop you from talkin to any latin girls.|`|DvZdB66maa	Well, Latinos in general are very affectionate and so, at times, it might seem like they are in your "personal space" but it's just how we are.<br>  <br>  Other than that, just show a genuine interest in the culture. Be open to new experiences. Learn to dance, if you don't already know how to. Depending on which ethnicity you are most interested in (Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, etc.), learn how to cook at least a couple things from the culture. Learn Spanish, and don't be afraid to try out your skills on your Latino friends... just make sure to ask them to correct you if you say something wrong.<br>  <br>  Latinos aren't easily offended, so I don't know what you could have said that would offend someone.

Xsen794Aaa	Well, first of all, when you say "late" + *name,* it means that the person is deceased.  If used correctly, it means that the person died recently, but many people just use it to quickly and respectfully explain that the person is dead.  <br>  <br>  Instead of saying, "My dead husband," which seems cold, widows will often refer to their husbands as, "my late husband."<br>  <br>  Like I said, it used to mean someone who has recently died because another meaning for "late" can be "recently, as in the phrase "as of late."  My guess is that a phrase like, "the person who passed away as of late" got shortened into just "late."<br>  <br>  "Speaking of," is used when we are already talking about the person or thing and we wish to continue talking about it, but with a different subject.

Xsen794Aaa	I think we should back up a bit and explain a little about Japanese.  "Roma-ji" (not "Ramaji") is just the Roman-letter phonetic system for writing Japanese.  In other words, the letters I'm using now are roma-ji.<br>  <br>  No program or "site" has ALL the kanji.  No human being who has ever lived knows all the kanji.  If you know about 2,000, that's good enough to consider yourself a fluent reader.<br>  <br>  You can find all the hiragana and katakana in the articles on Wikipedia.  While you're there, you should also read the articles for "Japanese language" and "kanji."  <br>  <br>  You should learn some of the language before you try to read it though, otherwise it's going to be really hard.

He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him…<br>  <br>  John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>  <br>  John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <br>  <br>  Jesus didn’t answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!<br>  <br>  John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, “Where are you going?”* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).<br>  <br>  Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldn’t remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka “Another Comforter” was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?)… The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!<br>   <br>  Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<br>  <br>  BTW, Jesus started to shed blood even before going to the Holy Cross, but the savvy theologians are saying that this blood was worthless to save anybody from their sins. The Blood of Jesus had to flow freely from his limbs while nailed to the Holy Cross! The Roman soldier that poke a spear into Jesus’ right side rib cage drew WATER that had nothing to do with any plan of salvation!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah… naughty Jesus! God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it “because it pleased God!”) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED* (*the Bible writers were not too careful writing about Jesus credentials, but the Christians today are willing to kill to defend what the preachers tell them! I know that Islam is much worse, but that is not an excuse to pick the Christian religion or “Jesus” or any religion at all! A lot of high profile people are declared Christians and they won’t be the first ones to change even if they figure out that Christianity is the biggest scam in the world today!)<br>  <br>  I can almost still hear Jesus crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didn’t spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time of the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion… it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit in preparation for hanging totally naked on a Holy Cross as the “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! The next time that a sweet Catholic lady or nun prays before a crucifix she ought to know that the diaper is NOT there! She can go ahead and ask the Pope if the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victims with a white clean diaper before they crucify them!   <br>  <br>  No wonder the Bible writers have Jesus sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven “to pass the cup”. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a “Guardian Angel” to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach and a pervert mind to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the “Slaughter House Religion”! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Christ Saint Paul comes along later on and finishes WHATEVER PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the “elect” and for their salvation so they can go to Fairy Heaven when they die!<br>  <br>  Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of “his body, which is the church”.* (*crappy talk, but what the heck!)<br>  <br>  For his work the Bible writers have God rewarding Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!<br>  <br>  Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (“I lie not!” –Saint Paul)<br>  <br>  You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is… not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on/in every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS don’t read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybody’s book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read the Bible carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible! I know that thousands if not millions of free loaders are making a living on any religion, especially the “Jesus” religion… They managed to convince a lot of people and even national leaders in this world that the Clergy and the Preachers speak for a higher authority!|`|MdUUGUPCaa	LOL<br>  <br>  He preached and preached until his hands fell off.......|`|te9y6MQkaa	Ask the Gnostics.|`|AA11692063	ignore what pink said, its not naive. its thinking a little deeper. some people take forgranted that God is real, with a real personality, hes not just some great God far away, he's here living among us. in the bible he's called emanuel translated as God with us. you could get to know him personally. not everything he did is in the bible but God is not dead so it is possible to get to know him, talk to him. some might think im crazy but every since I was a little girl ive known God. after all, all praying is, is talking to God. I ask him advice and i hear him in my head or i'll feel a peace about doing somthing. who knows if god has a favorite color, but I heard in heaven there are colors we've never seen.

zeTGmB3faa	Since you did this a few times, now you are over-thinking it. When this happens be able to laugh at yourself and say something like," my mouth isn't working today. If you can find the humor in it, and admit the funny mistake, others will laugh too. It will take the tenseness out of it and will probably improve. Don't worry, it happens to most people.|`|GBKaftrJaa	You might just have a very busy, hectic and stressful life and that's all it takes to mess us up a bit in what we are trying to say.  Try to relax, take a few deep breaths, and then speak.<br>  <br>  And if it doesn't stop or gets worse see a neurologist.|`|yMQf0ZMlaa	It happens to everyone.  Next time you say something like, for example... I was condunckting the meeting when..... then correct yourself by saying conducting the meeting, rather than starting from the beginning of, I was conducting, so it doesn't sound like such a big deal.  Try to read a bit more an pronounce the whole word while you are reading.  Don't try to speak too fast.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Hey, it's all good. I think there could be so much stuff floating around in your brain and you're pressuring yourself into saying things "just perfect" that you might me messing it up.  I'm the similar way, I tend to use 8 words when 4 will do.  It's from a LOT of reading, I think.  <br>  <br>  I suggest taking a few extra seconds to think what you're going to say before you say something.  It may not take it all away, but it will probably remove the # of occurrences.<br>  Hope that helps.<br>  Good luck!|`|GqfiRXu3aa	You're probably just nervous.

tNNLYT41aa	Well, a lot of what you've listed (though common amongst ftms) is just circumstantial. Lots of girls are tomboyish, and dislike girly things. You say you hate your body. You mean the feminine things about it? That's a more telling clue. <br>  <br>  Really, as we tell most people with these types of questions, no one can really answer that but you. Transition is hard. It'll turn your life upside down. But, if you really are trans, then it'll be worth it. The first step is usually to find a therapist who's well-versed in trans issues. You can't start hormones without their recommendation, and they can help you sort out whether or not transition is something you want to pursue.|`|VFjQ8hujaa	I'm sorry you feel this way.

OsY0lmTCaa	Any person can catch HIV, which will become AIDS by sharing bodily fluids. If there is an open wound in the mouth than acquiring the virus becomes more likely via kissing.|`|CSWNU2REaa	From www.wwc.org (The Whitman Walker Clinic)<br>  <br>  Whitman Walker is a well respected authority on the subject.  Another poster is correct in that if there is an open sore there may be contact with blood.<br>  <br>  HIV/AIDS BASICS<br>  <br>  HIV INFECTION<br>  <br>  People who know they are HIV infected are strongly encouraged to monitor their CD4-cell counts.  If a declining trend in CD4 -cell counts is apparent, or if CD4-cell counts fall below 350, persons with HIV should seek treatment to prolong the time before further decline.  There are a variety of treatment strategies available for persons with HIV.  Several anti-viral drugs that slow the reproduction of HIV are available through doctors of clinical (investigative) drug trials.<br>  <br>  Many HIV-related diseases can be prevented through the use of available  medications.  The earlier treatment is begun, the better the potential for enhancing the quality and length of life.  There are government programs that can help people pay for these drugs, which can be very expensive.<br>  <br>  TRANSMISSION<br>  <br>  Certain sexual acts, drug-using habits and needle uses can put someone at risk of becoming infected with HIV.  A woman with HIV infection can  also pass the virus to her unborn or newborn baby.  Also, anyone who received blood transfusions, blood products or an organ transplant prior to 1985 may also have been infected with HIV.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is difficult for HIV to move from an infected person to an uninfected person.  Transmission can only occur if infected blood, menstrual  blood, semen, precum, vaginal secretions or breast milk enters a person's blood stream. <br>  <br>  Which can transmit HIV:<br>  <br>  Blood, Menstrual Blood / Period, Semen / ***, Pre-*** (pre-ejaculatory fluid), Vaginal Secretions / Juice, Breast Milk<br>  <br>  Which have never been shown to transmit HIV:<br>  <br>  Syliva, Sweat, Tears, Urine, Feces<br>  <br>  HIV is not transmitted during casual contact such as hugging, holding hands, sharing living space, food or utensils.  HIV is a very fragile virus and cannot pass through unbroken skin.<br>  <br>  HIV INFECTION AND AIDS<br>  <br>  AIDS — Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome —  is the final stage of a serious health condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).<br>  <br>  HIV causes the body to lose its natural defenses against disease.  The body eventually becomes weak and open to attack by several types of infections and diseases that the body is unable to fight.  It is one or more of these diseases that leads a person to be diagnosed with AIDS and may eventually result in death.<br>  <br>  There is no way to tell if a person is infected with HIV by looking at the person.  Many people currently infected with HIV don't know it.<br>  <br>  HIV can be passed from one person to another during certain sexual practices, the sharing of needles while injecting drugs, or by a mother to  her baby.  Some people were infected by HIV through blood transfusions.  All US blood banks began screening donated blood for HIV in 1985 and today's blood supply is safe.<br>  <br>  Children With HIV/AIDS<br>  All children born to mothers with HIV have HIV antibodies because they are born with their mother's immune system.  Approximately 30 percent are actually infected with HIV.  The other 70 percent will usually shed their mother's antibodies before they are two years old.<br>  <br>  HIV disease in infected children usually progresses much faster than HIV disease in adults.  Some children with HIV are born with symptoms and most will develop symptoms by age two.<br>  <br>  HIV DISEASE PROGRESSION<br>  <br>  Once infected with HIV, individuals can live for many years in an asymptomatic state —  showing no symptoms of infection.  After a period of time, though, the immune system can become compromised and clinical symptoms can develop.<br>  <br>  While in the body, HIV slowly reproduces itself and is attracted to certain cells that play critical roles in the function of the immune system.  Although not the only cell attacked by the virus, CD4 cells (T-helpers) seem to be the primary target.  As a result of the destruction of  these cells, the functioning of the immune system becomes compromised.<br>  <br>  The number of CD4 cells in the body is used to determine how well the immune system is functioning. Most healthy people have a CD4 cell level  between 800 and 1,200.  When the CD4 cell counts begin to fall below 200, many people with HIV develop opportunistic infections and certain cancers.  Some of these infections and cancers are not usually found  in people with fully functioning immune systems.  Others are more common, but are still more prevalent in people with HIV.  Common diseases associated with HIV include:<br>  <br>      * Opportunistic Infections<br>        Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, oral thrush, Mycobacterium avium complex, (MAC), vaginal candidiasis, pelvic inflammatory disease, genital  ulcers, CMV retinitis, tuberculosis;<br>         <br>      * Cancers<br>        Cervical tumors, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), lymphoma.

The problem comes up because modern day racial classifications would have you believe that if you have small features, you are Caucasian.  Think about Europeans, you have tall blonde Nordic types, and then shorter darker Mediterranean types, and these are all considered white.  I find it interesting that when it comes to blacks, we are not allowed to have the same amount of variety, it is always because of being "mixed".  While its true that most people today are mixed, the variety is not always because of that.<br>  <br>  Edit  *Sigh* Anoshora, I know that Meditarraneans have some Arab in them.

Surely, you can see the differences. <br>  <br>  Bob B.-your third link is a picture of Iman-half Arab Semitic White(father)-half Black Somali(mother). <br>  <br>  -_ELHY_- [Level 62] -Berbers ARE an Arab Semitic White/Black mix-they are NOT full Arab.<br>  <br>  Zumaria and Anshora-Arabs of themselves, are NOT mixed as proven by DNA testing. Arabs are Semitic White-Anshora you are Semitic White(Assyrian/Babylonian-Semitic peoples), although not Arab or the closely related Jews.Not all Mediterranean peoples(i.e.-Greeks, Italians,Iranians/Persians, Jews, etc.) are Arabs, but all Arabs are Mediterranean peoples.Zumaria, the Arab admixture is what gives these peoples the less classical Black features. The difference in features clues us into  the different ethnicities-yes, there is general variation in all groups, but a great deviation indicates admixure-President Obama is a very good example, as is models Iman and Lila Kebede.|`|BWt4mj13aa	Yes.
6zr8aRUdaa	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. You are, and so is everyone else. Just keep that in mind, and don't try to force others to believe your ideas, and you are ok.|`|shaO0coWaa	You can believe whatever you want but you shouldn't push your beliefs down others throats.I'm not a feminist and I'm not ashamed.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Yes, basically you are saying that every female should conform to your ideals or else they are open to scrutiny and should be ashamed of themselves. But your opinion doesn't really matter to most people and most females (and males) probably do not care about your opinion because you are just an average person with no power at all.|`|Uy58ixnvaa	Feminist - someone that wants fair rights for women so that they are completely equal to men. <br>  <br>  Most people in society believe we should be equal (unless they're very old/old fashioned) so everyone is feminist to some degree. <br>  <br>  Just because they don't go around with parades and rallys and ready to hate men (like radical feminists do) doesn't mean they don't have some of the same beliefs.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	I'm not a feminist. I don't think we need to change the spelling of women to womyn. Feminists, a lot of the time, turn out like PETA people: boring, repetitive, stupid and over-assertive to push their views on you. However, I do believe women deserve equal rights. If in the USA, women can't be equal, imagine how horrible it is for Islamic countries. Women are just property. Fathers marry 8 year old girls off to 40 and 50 year old men in exchange for money. It's like slavery.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Yeah, that's wrong. I see feminists as extremists. I think that equal rights should be expected, but I don't go for that "I am woman, hear me roar" bs.|`|fEEbx6XTaa	Yep, it's wrong.|`|OOP6Hesyaa	Yes. Feminism was originally about respecting the choices of individual women. Are you not just as bad as "the patriarchy" by telling women what they should and should not believe, and how they should and should not live their lives? <br>  <br>  Also, I think a lot of feminists do not understand why so many women reject their ideology. The feminism ideology tells women that they are victims of men. It is no secret that feminism, whether deliberately or not, breeds feelings of misandry among many women. Also, in many cases, the feminism movement has proven that they do not want equal rights with men, but rather special rights over men. <br>  Most people do not reject feminism because they believe that women should not have equal rights with men. Most sane people believe in equality between the sexes, but do not believe that feminism is the best tool to achieve that goal.|`|u3fJ2cMWaa	Feminism is about choice to live their lives as they wish regardless if that is a housewife, lawyer, mother, teacher or so on.  It is about the choice for a woman to pursue any life she wants.  So therefore you are wrong.  They have a choice to be a feminist or not.|`|FK4h4buWaa	Yes, I think this is wrong. People don't have to believe in exactly the same things that you do to be considered a good person. That's why freedom is such a good thing, because we have the right to believe whatever we chose is the best decision.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	Yes it is. Judgementalism is shameful. If you support other women you won't label them and set yourself as so superior.<br>  You're either a troll or a prig or a hypocrite but it doesn't matter which.|`|pfke6Jieaa	you can believe in equal rights without being a feminist. its like being a racist to believe in equal rights between racist. did u even think before u asked this question?|`|NBxA1auFaa	Feminists are such a turn off, and that is importaint because than they will marry some asshole and have to raise his idiot kids.|`|BWt4mj13aa	No, I agree.|`|600U6iAWaa	There is no reason for feminism whatsoever. Women are graduating with 60% of degrees today, women on average have higher IQ's than me, you graduate high school with higher GPA's, the AP system is like 80% women, and percentage of women employment is higher than ever. All the double-standards work for you...<br>  <br>  Why would there any reason to be a woman feminist? Men don't really care about gender, it's women that make a big deal of it.|`|HxxHEihNaa	Feminists are retarded.

hI1V3SB5aa	Yes. If they worship the Gods of Greece exlcusivly then they would more respectuflly and specifically be called "Hellenic Polytheist" or, if they worship in a semi or fully traditional manner, "Hellenic Reconstructionist".<br>  <br>  Specific organised Hellenic religions have specific terms for their followers, i.e. Dodekatheist for those in the Elaion group. "Hellene" is another term, but is rarely used outside of Greece.|`|S7XZ6KCpaa	yeah. I used to be one. that was my first real pagan religion I followed.

I just love that Canadian flick...<br>  <br>  The book...  Any of Sara Waters novels!!!|`|KBBonf97aa	I recommend the novels "Tipping the Velvet" and "Fingersmith" by Sarah Waters, who's an amazing British writer.  "Tipping" is about a girl who falls in love with a female Vaudeville-type performer and moves to London with her, at which point her life becomes a gigantic adventure.  It has romance, comedy, drama, and just about anything else you could want from a novel.  "Fingersmith" is a lesbian love story embedded in a plot about a group of small-time criminals with bigger aspirations.  It's a little darker than "Tipping" but still great fun.<br>  <br>  As for movies, both of those novels were adapted for the screen.  "Tipping" was done as a miniseries, so it's about three hours of fun.  It has great musical numbers and stars Rachael Stirling, the daughter of Dame Diana Rigg (Mrs. Peel from "The Avengers").  "Fingersmith" stars Sally Hawkins, who recently won a best actress Golden Globe for "Happy-Go-Lucky."   Both movies are available through Netflix.

gyrihMqhaa	Having finished his hajj to Makkah, the Prophet of Allah  returned to Madinah and the great multitude of Muslims went back with him. At Ghadir Khum (Brook of Khum) somewhere on his way to Madinah, he received the order of Allah to appoint Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib  as his successor and the commander of the faithful after him.<br>  Allah, the Most High, for some purpose only He knew, willed that this place should be where the Divine order would be communicated to the people.<br>  <br>  The sun was slowly climbing in the sky and soon noon was approaching. It was a hot, sweltering day. It was so warm that when the Messenger  stopped the Muslims to tell them Heaven's order, they began wrapping their feet with garments to ward off the heat of the gravel. It was the extra importance of the order, which by no means could be postponed, that made the Messenger  halt, at that place and to deliver the new message.<br>  He stopped them at crossroads from which they would go in different directions. Many of them would not see or hear the Messenger  thereafter.<br>  <br>  It was the last hour for many of the Muslims to see the Messenger  and hear him telling them that Ali , and only Imam Ali, would be their social and religious leader. It was the hour of good-bye and such an hour would be etched in one' s memory and so would be its implications. It had a distinguished flavour with deeply rushing sentiments. Had the Messenger  delivered the news of the appointment of Imam Ali , say 10 years earlier, the importance may have forgotten or it could have been subdued. But at the behest of Allah, he made it the last thing he communicated to his people so that it would live in the conscience of the ummah and remain alive in their memory.<br>  He stood upon many mounts gathered for the purpose, so that all could have him in view. He praised and thanked Allah and said:<br>  <br>  "O people! I am about to be called to Allah and depart to Him. I am responsible and so are you. What do you say?' <br>  <br>  'We bear witness that you have delivered the Divine Message, fought for it and were faithful in guiding the people. May Allah reward you with His rewards,' they replied.<br>  <br>  'Don't you,' he said,' bear witness that there is no god but Allah, Mohammad is His servant and Messenger, His paradise is right, His hell is right, death is right, resurrection day is right, the Hour would undoubtedly be coming, and Allah would raise people from the dead." <br>  <br>  'We bear witness to these,' they said, <br>  <br>  'O Lord! Bear witness,' he said.<br>  <br>  Then he went on saying,:<br>  <br>  'O people! Allah is my Master and I am the master of the faithful and I have a greater claim on them than they have on themselves. Whoever I have been his master Ali is also his master. O Allah! Befriend every friend of his and be the enemy of every enemy of his. O people! I will depart from you and you will certainly meet me at the Fountain: A Fountain that is wider than the distance between me and Sanaa and has two goblets of silver as large as the space in which the stars are swimming. I will be asking you, when you return to me at the Fountain, about two weighty things: The weightier one is the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Glorified, which has two bonds, one is in the hand of Allah, the Most High, and the other in your hands. So hold tight to it, don't go astray and don't change your faith. The other mighty thing is my progeny, my household. The Knower of subtleties, the Aware has told me that they will join me at the Fountain as soon as their life on earth expires".(107) <br>  <br>  Then he came down and offered a two-rakat prayer. His caller to prayer summoned the faithful and the Holy Prophet  led his companions in prayer. Then he sat in his tent and ordered Imam Ali  to go to his own tent.<br>  He ordered the Muslims to give him their pledge as the successor of the Prophet .<br>  It was an unavoidable and necessary step on the part of the Prophet  to enhance the prospects of the Islamic call.|`|423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	REVELATION OF VERSE "THIS DAY HAVE I PERFECTED FOR YOU YOUR RELIGION"  AT GHADIR-E-KHUM:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/8.5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/8.5.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-islam.org/peshawar/</a> (Book)

ku2tP4eEaa	Political correctness has little to do with your manners and politness.  What might have seen in the beginning as a method of taming certain words has become a direct assault on freedom of expression and speech.  The "polite" people are used as cannon fodder by the poltically correct in power to spread their agenda.  Often these folks do so without the slightess idea they are being manipulated.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of how political correctness is misused:<br>  "Apparently, there was a big to-do in Texas yesterday when a City Board member said that "The tax payers money is disappearing into a black hole." Two other board members are demanding an apology and claim that the remark (therefore the phrase) was racist and demeaning. It's beginning to look like we will have to find new phrases for many things. Just think of all of the things we say, quite innocently, that can be taken as prejudice, or racist."<br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/When-Politically-Correct-becomes-Absolutely-Stupid" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/When-Politically...</a><br>  <br>  One of the best examples of political correctnees used to the point of abuse was in the Duke lacross students alleged rape case.  Shamefully, American prejudiced fire by ONLY political correctness, wrongfully judged innocent young men.<br>  <a href="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/gaynor/071104" rel="nofollow">http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/gayno...</a><br>  <br>  You see it used in Seniors category all the time.  A certain member has made false accusations against another member based solely on his or her interpetation, irregarl of the facts.  Claiming this or that words indicates the person saying that word is unfitt for society, is mean or rude.<br>  <br>  Political correctness had it's birth in Marx philiosphy.  It was widely used in Russisn Communist parties to structure the speech of the people.  Many people think that PC is a new form of Communism. <br>  <a href="http://www.students.org.au/political/correctness/" rel="nofollow">http://www.students.org.au/political/cor...</a><br>  <br>  For those of you that wish to read a good article about the basics of political correctness, check out this.<br>  <a href="http://www.contumacy.org/14PoliticalCorrectness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.contumacy.org/14PoliticalCorr...</a><br>  <br>  Now a question.  Do you Seniors ever become educated?  I have demonstrated the issues and problems associated with political correctness.  Are you folks still gonna think it is all about being polite?|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Being politically correct means to use language that would not make anyone feel excluded, diminished or devalued.|`|mptnpn9maa	Being politically correct is more than just being nice, although, if you are nice and a people person, your actions may be politically correct without the effort.  What Politically correct really refers to is being sensitive to other races, religions, political, sexual preference, disability and so forth. It is important to be aware of how a particular group prefers to be addressed. For instance, at one time it may have been appropriate to say someone was oriental, now, I believe the accepted term is asian. It is important not to use terms like gypped because it is derogatory to gypsies or use the term "to jew it down" because that is insulting to Jews. In each case, someone could be very nice to someone and use the terms innocently but they would still be called politically incorrect for using them.|`|24vQ8D71aa	ok ,it started out as a good idea, to not be offensive to any one. it has ,however, gone berserk.<br>   prime example : in oz some people wanted to stop santa from HOHOHOing because it is a degrading term against women , somewhere in america.

What your granny used to call "be nice".|`|f8812f78f1ba5e0fefd58a87005ce671aa	well, supposedly it means using words, definitions and behavior that are not offensive to any particular type or class or position of people.  But the problem is, the words and definitions that 'offend' keep changing and growing in number so that most people can't keep up with them.  It has ended up being very difficult to avoid making any kind of statement in which somebody will find some kind of offense.  What is worse, political correctness can be, and is, used by some folks to silence those that have opposing points of view, or to excuse bad behavior.<br>  Being polite isn't necessarily political correctness.  In fact, some people find politeness to be patronizing and, therefore, politically "incorrect".|`|vujx4LBFaa	A "politically correct" term is a term that isn't considered offensive or rude in today's sensitive society. Being politically correct is neither saying or doing something that might offend someone's sensibilities.<br>  <br>  Ex: <br>  "Mentally Handicapped/Disabled" instead of "retarded."<br>  "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder" instead of "shell-shocked." <br>  "Academic Dishonesty" instead of "Cheating."|`|wnsFO3GCaa	To me, the term encourages empathy. You may have been brought up to be polite but you may also have been brought up to look down on a certain group of people. Being politically correct is to not discriminate at all. Treating everyone else how you would like to be treated is being politically correct.|`|5sNOUCRKaa	The first person is right. I believe you try to say proper things and what people expect.

X3Lp0ewMaa	Well yes my mother and grandmother and aunt and Great Aunts used to answer all my questions. It was great having them around and so full of advise as a youngster. And the funny thing is now that I am older I do Mentoring at my job now. It's great because as a Lead Driver (bus driver/ trainer) the new ones who come in have no clue how to deal with student behavior. So they come to you when they have trouble and you help them through it, and sometimes it is not easy but rewarding. I think that as long as the young ones come in and behave themselves we are an open forum and have a lot of answers to their questions that their families do not give them. So we are Mentors to them.

I found that adults would always find something about me that was bad or offensive, and would become very unfriendly towards me.  I was one of those kind of kids that pi**ed everybody off.  Conversations with any adult was usually very one-sided with the adult yelling at, or accusing, me of doing something wrong.<br>  <br>  Its OK with me if young people ask questions in the senior citizens section.  Just quit asking if "old people" should be prohibited from driving, or why are "old people" this way or that way, or why do "old people" do this or that?.  And they should realise, as I described about myself, we were young once and suffered bad experiences as well.|`|nDvrN6Qgaa	Well I did have 4 grandparents until I was in my 20's and in the Army but I can't recall ever really going to them for advice.  I guess they were more or less role models for the way to grow up and act.  You know all the things like do the right thing, an honest day's work for a days pay, things like that.  I don't believe they hurt me in the least and I did try to pass them on down to my 3 kids.  Seems to have been successful so far.  good luck to you.<br>  ...Mike S...|`|0rpN2419aa	I enjoy it when the kids come here with their questions.  Takes me back to the good old days and worthy of a respected answer.  It is pathetic  when people are unkind to anyone for any reason.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Yes I did, my grandma was with me until I was 20. . we were very close !<br>  I love it when the kiddies visit. . I go out of my way to help them . . . I even got a violation from the last one I helped by posting the link to her Q in other sections of Yahoo. . . I had no idea this was against rules ? ? ? But it does not stop me from helping. . I even appreciate their input in an answer to one of our Q's. . it helps me to keep up with the times and in communication with my grandteens !! lol|`|b3h0ovgRaa	No problem for me. I didn't have a grandmother or grandpa to talk to so I let it go or found the answer somewhere else. Here when the younger ones seek answers I don't mind as long as they are sincere and their questions don't throw you in overdrive..Poppy|`|AA12038658	My mother was always there for me, and there were a lot of older people on our block who would let me come over to play in their yard, play with their pets, plant flowers, etc.<br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with young people asking questions in the senior section as long as they are not asking something about being a senior in high school. Ex: What's a good senior prank? Who should I ask to my prom? etc.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	oh yes, I had my Mom and older sister I could always go to,I also had my grandmother. I was very lucky.<br>  <br>  The nice people are still here isotope. i am not sure if you are referring to a particular question or just in general. If is is a particular question look and see if we seniors who you know answered it or if people from the home page got a hold of it.<br>  <br>  I do enjoy questions from the younger ones, it always seems to liven things up when they are here and some of the questions do make you think. I am a firm believer any question is valid in seniors except ones the belittle a another person, group, sex, etc..... i know many others feel the same way.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	I always had my Granny after my mother passed away - when I was 8 years old.<br>  <br>  My mom was wonderful - her wonderful mom/my Granny took over for her.<br>  <br>  I owe all I am today because of the love and great example she showed me - I speak for my younger brothers too.<br>  <br>  I do my best to be kind to the young seniors who drop by.

I have had to rely on myself my whole life to get by.  My mother had two sisters and a brother, so I had aunts and uncles but they never came by because my mother was so insufferable.  I guess they figured out of sight, out of mind when it came to the abuse I was forced to endure.  <br>  <br>  I always thought it would be nice to have grandparents.|`|492180924fe32381f3e8cd7774074fe9aa	umm no didn't have anyone.. i knew my g,pa, thats it.. but he only spoke italian and i didn't know that language.. and then he moved back 2 italy when i was yough, so i didn't have a lot of time with him.. never knew my g,ma's.. i see your point on different ages here, i to wonder why the yough adults wanted 2 be with the older crowd and now i know. i never answered them either way because the question was already answered..|`|LQ52bOFFaa	No, never did.  My dad was in construction and we moved from job to job, all over the country.  Rarely were we around any relatives.<br>  <br>  I feel all is welcome in this section just like all the others.  There are a lot of kids who's questions are put here by Yahoo because of the word senior.  Most are trying to ask other high school seniors questions.  We shouldn't be rude to them.  Some others are asking here to just be ornery.  They ask insulting, rude questions.  Some think they will shock us.  Some genuinely need some good answers.  We should be mature enough to be able to tell the difference.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	I never had anyone like that when I was growing up. G-parents were all gone, and Mum was not a person to consult if you wanted any sensible advice. I wish there had been a YA then - a kid could ask away, and get advice from all sorts of people, and anonymously too. That would be nice for them ! I'm always happy to see younger people on this site, though I'll admit to being a bit annoyed when they use the term "you old people", usually followed by "should you still be driving" or "do you still have sex" or such silly things. But the site is for everyone, not just older people, and I love when young ones ask our advice. They are always welcome !|`|ur3vgbXoaa	I don't remember going to any older <br>  person with my "problems."  <br>  <br>  It seems like we all just lived <br>  our life and did not even realize <br>  if we had problems or anything of the sort.  <br>  <br>  Not that we were blithering idiots who <br>  went around 'lalalalala' all the time, <br>  but we just didn't have anything wrong, <br>  so to speak.  <br>  <br>  Now everybody has got something <br>  wrong always something wrong wrong <br>  wrong.. They have PMS and ADD  and <br>  ADHD and lord knows what other <br>  alphabetical afflictions.  <br>  <br>  OR they are bored OR they are sad <br>  OR they are tired....I just give them this<br>  advice...GET a life!  Grow up.<br>  <br>  Put on your big girl panties <br>  and DEAL with it.  Am I mean <br>  or unfeeling?  Lots of these people<br>  who are having lots of these problems<br>  seem to be so self centered and<br>  worry about no one but themselves.<br>  <br>  I guess people today don't have <br>  the grit that we used to have.  <br>  Am I right?  I don't think I am mean.<br>  And I would never tell anybody they<br>  aren't old enough to be here.  <br>  <br>  I think they come here for more<br>  like companionship - not with <br>  a problem.
9fsBstvDaa	Fear, Dogma's and the allowance of other interpretations to govern our own. <br>  <br>  Religious text weather it the Bible or Veda's are meant for each individual to see what is meant for that individual. Our world religious leaders all have their own agenda. Plus it is human nature. When we as a society judge another's action or conduct it is because we do not want or are not ready to look at our own life.<br>  <br>   I was brought up Baptist and dancing was a NO! My Grandmother is flipping in her grave if that would be possible, or maybe now she has been enlightened and realized how much pain she caused for not only herself while living, but those in her life. Our families are the one's with the harshness of judgments. I'm a semi-professional dancer and teacher.<br>  <br>  The question's you ask really depend on the person. If we applied the principle of Non- Harming to our everyday lives all the other things would fall into place.<br>  <br>  The 10 comandments all fall under the principle of non harming. If we all set our intentions daily to uplift ourselves and others their would be no problems.<br>  <br>  Judgements are the one thing we pass out freely in this world. Everyone of us gives and will accept more than our share. It can also cause the most harm to ourselves and others. <br>  <br>  Smoking and drinking are not sins. But they do cause harm to the one doing it and to others and the environment. Anything in excess is harmful, sleep, eating etc.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	I agree Zac, hypocrisy and Christianity rarely go hand in hand...I mean...seriously, denouncing homosexuality and then allowing priests to touch little boys and defending them?  Yelling love thy neighbor, and always forgive, and then telling homosexuals they're going to hell?  Preaching and preaching and pushing their beliefs, but the second one explains theirs its wrong and irresponsible, and ignorant?  No Christians aren't hypocrites, they're just misunderstood...|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Because most Christians today believe in a half a gospel and still have all their sins intact in their hearts.

CBUPymktaa	yes ive noticed that .. its either the antichrist is all over us or we are waiting for that big blessing instead of giving thanks for what we have and trusting God ..|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Yes, Jesus wants us to occupy until He comes. He also told us not to be caught unaware or asleep. He's given us the signs of the times and if we don't know that it is coming soon then our heads have been in the sand. We go to work, take care of our families, tend the garden, go to church, etc. etc. But, always we must be vigilant in looking up awaiting His arrival. He's told us to watch and pray that we be accounted worthy to escape the things coming to this earth. Let's not get so caught up in our lives that we forget to look up. We are called to be Kingdom people which means that we should be walking in obedience to Him. If we are not there is a price to be paid. <br>  No, the Anti-Christ hasn't made his appearance yet but it'll be soon. I believe he's already here just waiting for that right time. As far as the tribulation well, it's already started with some of our brethren in third world countries, China and Russia. This however is just the beginning. There will eventually be world wide persecution.<br>  There should be excitement in the air with the believers.

y03E1v8haa	Don't worry about it, just ask for forgiveness and be at peace.<br>  And as for andy e - I cannot believe how someone would dare to be so RUDE to a young boy on his OWN question. This is the religion he has chosen to follow and he can believe it as he pleases, I have been a Christian all my life and when I got to his age I did decide to follow it with a whole heart. Why don't YOU grow up and find something that makes you a little less bitter towards other people. I have spent my whole life defending myself to small minded twits like you, and frankly it is sad that people cannot just learn to respect other peoples ideas. See right now I respect that you have no faith in God above and don't give a rats *** what happens to you when you die or what he thinks about you in your time on earth. But I don't respect the fact that you feel like you can bash on people (especially a young kid who is trying to find out who he is) for making their own choices, even if they ARE choices that their parents have helped them make.|`|pSfW0ROmaa	It doesn't matter what you do - you're doomed-JK:)<br>  <br>  Not eating meat on Fridays during Lent isn't even in the Bible. It is just a tradition started by the Catholic church (for info on the date it began etc go to www.mtc.org). It is not a bad idea to practice self sacrifice, but it is a bad idea to make people believe that they can go to heaven or hell based on their actions. We are saved by faith not by works.|`|RtBJO60Naa	As long as it was an accident, I don't think it is a big deal. You could always try not to eat meat tomorrow to make up for it.

dmCAiuMGaa	Thank you!  I wish I knew.  Why someone would follow the examples of animals who don't have morals or know right from wrong?  No clue.  The reply "we're animals too"...yes we are.  But it's not an excuse.  Most of us humans know how to use our brains.<br>  <br>  If you want to tie religion in, then great.  God gave humans domination over all the animals; He made our intelligence superior to animals.  If you don't, then fine.  Animals also eat their young, cannibalize each other, eat their feces, drink their urine, and kill their mate after sex.  Still want to follow the examples of animals?  Sorry, but I know better.|`|84gK4XlHaa	As much as I don't approve of the homophobic message you're trying to send, I actually think that this is a good point.  We're not animals.  Not in any real sense of the term.  We posses an intelligence and a level of consciousness that they do not.  We overcome our animal instincts every day with invention and progress.  Leaning on that as an excuse for criminal activity or selfish behavior is unacceptable.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	I'd have to see an example, but my experience has been that those arguments are generally used as counters to the argument that humans with sexual practices other than strictly monogamous male-female married sex are acting "unnaturally".|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Humans are animals, just animals who use their brains differently.|`|AA11430900	Human beings are animals even if some human beings don't care to admit it.  We have instincts and some choose to dampen them, some choose to follow them.  From that, what is 'moral' is different based on a number of factors.  Drawing similarities from other groups of animals when they are similar to our own isn't 'evil', it merely shows that there are base instincts that run through nature.<br>  <br>  I would say that everyone should be concerned about their own behavior and leave others to theirs.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	Because they are seeking any excuse to think they are not at all accountable for their behavior. If they believed that they were created by God, in  His image, and are not mere animals, then they would have to recognize the fact that they are accountable to God their Creator.<br>  <br>  So, they look at animals, claim to be no different then they are, and believe that excuses them from accountability for their actions; free to do as they please without any consequence.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Because, darling, humans are animals.

Spiritual significance of the precepts of Moses respecting different kinds of food<br>  <br>  Now, wherefore did Moses say, You shall not eat the swine, nor the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of scales? He embraced three doctrines in his mind [in doing so]. Moreover, the Lord says to them in Deuteronomy, And I will establish my ordinances among this people. Deuteronomy 4:1 Is there then not a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual reference. For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, You shall not join yourself to men who resemble swine. For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord; but when they come to want, they acknowledge the Lord. And [in like manner] the swine, when it has eaten, does not recognize its master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving food is quiet again. Neither shall you eat, says he the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven. You shall not join yourself, he means, to such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others. So these birds, while they sit idle, inquire how they may devour the flesh of others, proving themselves pests [to all] by their wickedness. And you shall not eat, he says, the lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish. He means, You shall not join yourself or be like to such men as are ungodly to the end, and are condemned to death. In like manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom. Moreover, You shall not, he says, eat the hare. Wherefore? You shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like such. Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as many years as it lives so many it has. Moreover, You shall not eat the hyena. He means, You shall not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such. Wherefore? Because that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he means, You shall not be like to those whom we hear of as committing wickedness with the mouth, on account of their uncleanness; nor shall you be joined to those impure women who commit iniquity with the mouth. For this animal conceives by the mouth. Moses then issued three doctrines concerning meats with a spiritual significance; but they received them according to fleshly desire, as if he had merely spoken of [literal] meats. David, however, comprehends the knowledge of the three doctrines, and speaks in like manner: Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, even as the fishes [referred to] go in darkness to the depths [of the sea]; and has not stood in the way of sinners, even as those who profess to fear the Lord, but go astray like swine; and has not sat in the seat of scorners, even as those birds that lie in wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this spiritual knowledge. But Moses says still further, You shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant. What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him, is visibly made glad. Well spoke [Moses], having respect to the commandment. What, then, does he mean? That we ought to join ourselves to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their heart on the commandment which they have received, those who both utter the judgments of the Lord and observe them, those who know that meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state [to come]. Behold how well Moses legislated. But how was it possible for them to understand or comprehend these things? We then, rightly understanding his commandments, explain them as the Lord intended. For this purpose He circumcised our ears and our hearts, that we might understand these things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace!|`|3ioUdPuZaa	Perhaps because people who are doing things they know, believe or think isn't right, or who are doing things they THINK OTHER people will see as wrong, do not want to HAVE to give up the behavior, so they seek a method...ANY METHOD of justifying it. I would suppose animals and nature are used because most people "accept" animals and love them...to look at them anyway. They are most usually NOT hated or judged, they are accepted for what they do and what they are without question.<br>  So there, I believe, are TWO things to remember in this question and answer...that no matter how hard hearted or hard headed a person may seem about their life and habits, deep down they want to be accepted and appreciated without judgment. AND number two would be a perhaps dangerous point for the person using animal comparison...THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING MAY BE OR IS WRONG AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO CONTINUE DOING IT ANYWAY. <br>  God doesn't judge us for what we do wrong, until we commit our lives and are given the TRUTH of how wrong it is, AND STILL DECIDE TO SIN. This is a dangerous place to be.<br>  Bunny7|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	Its not to justify it. |these points are brought up in response to the claim christians make (to justify their bigotry and try and rationalize their stupid dogma) and that is that 'homosexuality is not natural' when it clearly is.<br>  <br>  "the dominant species on earth"... oh please.|`|wsc96EDmaa	the penguin example is a response to people who say that homosexuality is not natural.

If it has to do with relationships then you must think logically and examine the subject having to do with your personal experience.We humans are basically animals with higher intelligence. We are driven by the same basic survival programming that animals have. The need to eat, to sleep, to reproduce, preservation of our family/tribe/pack/etc. and self preservation which is basically the same thing. Do not confuse Western Society with reality. Is a woman equal to a man physically, no, possibly mentally because women whine and manipulate men to get what they want. Polygamy and promiscuity among males is found in almost every form of animal life. In much the same way there are almost always more females than males. Logically this keeps our numbers up as 1 male can reproduce with thousands of females, while one female can only reproduce once per year with only one partner. So the animal instinct is what prevails in the end. Whether it is in seeking to dominate a situation or person. We build cities and machines and that is what sets us apart from the other creatures(ants, bees and termites build cities too but not machines or technology). The problem is that is basically all that sets us apart from the creatures is our mental abilities as they are much more physically stronger. Animals commit every crime that we do. They murder, they are jealous, they steal food and lovers. And homosexuality is not evil, it is just that the animal instinct that makes me want a woman makes another man want a guy. A form of defect but not a negative one. We are basically two people. One person is the personality that we deal with every day that is our friend and the other is the one that is activated when you are hurt threatened or your life is in danger. That is the animal inside you taking over in order to keep us alive. (Temporary insanity)So,even though we are smarter than the other animals and have opposable thumbs, we are still animals ourselves.|`|hiCSVwchaa	People reference animal homosexuality when others say that homosexuality is only learned/deviant behavior. <br>  <br>  Promiscuity makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, in all animals.

Rc9SNllPaa	The soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and therefore has all the qualities of the Supreme Soul but in different quantity. As part and parcel of the Supreme Soul it is the duty of the individual soul to serve the Supreme in a way that is satisfying to the Supreme.<br>  As the Supreme is eternal, likewise the individual soul is eternal. <br>  Every soul has an individual loving relationship with the Supreme which is eternal and will fully satisfy the soul when re-established. The Supreme is independent, so therefore the soul has it's own minute independence. Due to that minute independence the soul can choose whether to love and serve the Supreme directly or not.<br>  To Supreme has three major energies, the superior energy, or spiritual energy, the marginal energy, and the inferior energy or material energy.<br>  The soul is originally superior spiritual energy, but due to it's contact with material energy and it's acceptance of the material energy, it has rendered itself marginal or tatastha. Which basically means it has choice to stay in the material world or again re-awaken it's dormant loving relationship with the Supreme and return to the eternal spiritual world where life is eternal full of bliss and knowledge.<br>  The soul can have a relationship with the Supreme in five different moods or mellows. 1. neutrality. 2. servitor. 3. friendship. 4. parental 5. conjugal. The nature of the soul is to engage in loving relationship with the Supreme through one of the five mentioned mellows or relationships. That will fully satisfy the soul. The purpose of the soul is to engage in loving exchange with the Supreme through one of the five relationships.<br>  The soul in this material world has forgotten that relationship with the Supreme, our eternal lover and best friend.  So the real purpose of the soul in this material world, is to re-awaken that dormant loving relationship with the Supreme which is eternally individually ours. That will be completely satisfying to the individual soul and the Supreme. Nothing else will satisfy the soul. The soul in this world is like a fish out of water.<br>  This material world is duperena nalena cha. Temporary and full of miseries, whereas the spiritual world, our eternal home is eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge, where every word is a song and every step is a dance and all are engaged in eternal loving service with there eternal Lord and lover in the most satisfying, ever increasing mellow of pure spiritual loving rapture. <br>  Upon attaining that spiritual nature again, the soul knows there is nothing greater to be gained.<br>  So the soul must endeavor to re-establish or re-awaken it's dormant spiritual consciousness which it has forgotten due to contact with the material energy.<br>  The science of the soul is known to very few<br>  So many lives are wasted in not knowing what to do<br>  Engaging in acts that only go against the soul<br>  Birth after birth diseased and growing old<br>  <br>  Spiritual by nature by slapped by material natures hand<br>  Illusioned into thinking this world's at our command<br>  On the mental platform of duality<br>  Forgetting we are all part of the Supreme<br>  <br>  I'll leave it there and thank you for the question.<br>  Take care and very best wishes always<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|aBxdyqShaa	Lots of interesting answers.

That is the definition in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: muktir. .. svarupena vyavasthitih. The svarupa, or actual identity of the living entity, is described by Lord Caitanya. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': the real identity of the living entity is that he is eternally a servitor of the Supreme Lord. If someone is one-hundred-percent engaged in the service of the Lord, he is to be understood as liberated. One must understand whether or not he is liberated by his activities in devotional service, not by other symptoms.<br>  <br>  SB 4.24.77 P    Chanting the Song Sung by Lord Siva<br>     As stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.22), yam labdhva caparam labham manyate nadhikam tatah: if one can attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has nothing to aspire for, nor does he desire any other gain. When Dhruva Maharaja became perfect by austerity and saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, he was offered any kind of benediction he wanted. However, Dhruva replied that he did not want anything, for he was perfectly satisfied with the benediction of seeing the Lord. Except for the service of the Supreme Lord, whatever we want is called illusion, maya. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said: jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa' (Cc. Madhya 20.108). Every living entity is an eternal servant of the Lord; therefore when one engages in the service of the Lord, he realizes the highest perfection of life. A faithful servant can fulfill any desire by the grace of the master, and one who engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord has nothing to aspire for separately. All his desires are fulfilled simply by engaging constantly in the Lord's loving service. Lord Siva shows us that any devotee can be successful simply by chanting the prayers which he has recited.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.36-37 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     Bhakti refers to those activities performed in the service of Lord Vasudeva. Because Lord Vasudeva is the Supreme, one should engage oneself in His service, not in the service of the demigods. Devotional service begins from the neophyte stage--the stage of observing the rules and regulations--and extends to the point of spontaneous loving service to the Lord. The purpose of all stages is to satisfy Lord Vasudeva. When one is perfectly advanced in the devotional service of Vasudeva, one becomes completely detached from the service of the body, that is, his designated position in material existence. After becoming so detached, one becomes actually perfect in knowledge and engages perfectly in the service of Lord Vasudeva. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': "Every living entity is by constitutional position an eternal servant of Krsna." As soon as one engages in the service of Lord Vasudeva, he attains his normal constitutional position. This position is called the liberated stage. Muktir hitvanyatha-rupam svarupena vyavasthitih: in the liberated stage, one is situated in his original Krsna conscious position. He gives up all engagements in the service of matter, engagements concocted under the names of social service, national service, community service, dog service, automobile service and so many other services conducted under the illusion of "I" and mine.<br>  <br>  SB 7.11.2    The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes<br>     Sanatana-dharma means devotional service. The word sanatana refers to that which is eternal, which does not change but continues in all circumstances. We have several times explained what the eternal occupational duty of the living being is. Indeed, it has been explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': the real occupational duty of the living entity is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if one prefers to deviate from this principle he remains a servant because that is his eternal position; but one serves maya, the illusory, material energy. The Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, is an attempt to guide human society to serving the Personality of Godhead instead of serving the material world with no real profit. Our actual experience is that every man, animal, bird and beast--indeed, every living entity--is engaged in rendering service. Even though one's body or one's superficial religion may change, every living entity is always engaged in the service of someone. Therefore, the mentality of service is called the eternal occupational duty. This eternal occupational duty can be organized through the institution of varnasrama, in which there are four varnas (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and four asramas (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa). Thus, Yudhisthira Maharaja inquired from Narada Muni about the principles of sanatana-dharma for the benefit of human society.|`|AA11676104	FRIEND,<br>  <br>  What is SOUL in your view?<br>  <br>  Why the SUN is SHINING?<br>  <br>  Why in the deep forests , where no human or animals tread , the beautiful flowers blossom up and spread fragrance?<br>  <br>  Why the Air is moving and the ocean has waves ?<br>  <br>  Can you attribute a motive or a purpose to these?<br>  <br>  The SOUL is what all of us want to REALISE.|`|RzX1c1nxaa	if there is no observer, there is no observed.<br>  <br>  a man buying a precious art work by selling his both the eyes is meaningless. for a full blind man a Picasso painting is not there even if it is right in front of him. so every thing is nothing if it cannot be sensed.<br>  <br>  your soul only make sense to ask this question. otherwise rhis question will not arise.|`|XQ1ZBfMGaa	The Human birth is stepping stone to Moksha (formless energy).<br>  <br>  Here the Soul carries the impressions of our Karma (deeds).<br>  <br>  This recording decides our future as Soul does not die.<br>  <br>  Realized souls of Saints like Jesus ......  can change bodies and take forms to help people.

If you really want you can try confronting your former friends more directly and let them know that all the things that made you their friend in the first place are still the same and ask them why they are rejecting you, some of them may only be doing it so that they don't fall apart from the general crowd.

Some of your friends, but not all or even most, will probably get over it when they see that you really haven't changed that much.<br>  <br>  You move on and do the things that you can enjoy doing without them.

RGe6Et0Xaa	The law described in Leviticus was more civil than religious. When they talked about sin, they were talking about breaking the law.<br>  <br>  Logistically, the Levites ran sacrifices in the tabernacle (and later the temple) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They later worked in 12 separate 2 week shifts throughout the year. Their tribe comprised roughly 12% of the Hebrew population. And the Levites were not allowed to own their own property or keep their own livestock - all of the food for them and their families came from these offerings that you are talking about. The altar in the courtyard was huge, and they had a work force of thousands of men to run constant sacrifices. But yes, the Hebrews were lined up for miles to offer sacrifices, especially during the high feast days.<br>  <br>  Concerning unintentional sins. The sins requiring offerings were specifically those that violated the civil code. They did not make offerings for things like telling a lie (the punishable offense was purgery, not lying), or thinking bad thoughts (the punishable offense was actual adultery), etc.<br>  <br>  I should also point out the distinction between priests and levites. The "sons of Aaron" were priests who performed liturgical functions within the Holy Place of the temple. Most of the sin offering were processed by the rest of the tribe of Levi. Every adult male of the entire tribe of Levi was responsible for working in the temple courtyard.|`|6fnN5XMwaa	Today........... we have millions who will only confess what they want to confess. So What you say is possible<br>  <br>  Sin does not have a different meaning. Jesus sacrificing his life for us did away with the sacrifice of animals.............. It is man who has altered the word|`|J3W93q55aa	that the old testment you are talking about we live in the new testment|`|PEUwnGHraa	NO. Sin is sin.<br>  <br>  James 1: 12 - 15<br>  <br>  Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which GOD promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. <br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  I think what you are referring to is that when Jesus came in the first century, he fulfilled the old law and gave us the new law. This does not mean that everything in the old testament should still not be heeded though; all scripture is inspired by God, beneficial for teaching, for reproving and setting matters straight. (2 Timothy 3: 16 - 17)<br>  <br>  Both the old and new testaments go hand in hand, but Jesus fulfilled the old law and preached love and forgiveness as part of the new law.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	hey herf.<br>  <br>  There are really only three kinds of offerings in Leviticus related to human failure.  And only one of them, the day of atonement, was for sin as we understand it (although even here, purification is also included).  All the rest were for purification, or restitution.  Getting into the theology surrounding purity is way to big for this forum.  There was also the notion that when one inadvertently desecrated something, a debt to God was incurred.  This has many parallels in the surrounding Ancient Near Eastern cultures.  That's what the restitution offering was all about.  There is no sacrifice for willful rebellion under the Levitical system.  That was handled through repentance, confession, and pure grace on God's part.  One of the biggest misconceptions among Christians is that forgiveness was obtained in the OT differently than in the new.  That's simply not true.  God's forgiveness of willful sin has always been pure grace (looking forward to the cross in OT times).  As to the logistics.  After the Jews settled in the land, regional sanctuaries were set up.  This didn't all happen in one place.  Milgrom covers all of this exhaustively in his commentary. <br>  <br>  peace|`|AA11992885	the Hebrew word "chet" which translates as "sin" was something done BY ACCIDENT, and most of the time, COMPLETELY UNKNOWN to the person, hence the text constantly reads, "when it (the sin) will become known to him......." THEN he shall bring forth a sin offering<br>  <br>  all sins were accidental ONLY|`|zMcHYQeBaa	That was the whole point behind the Law.<br>  <br>  No man could keep the whole Law.<br>  <br>  only God Himself could.|`|T0fwqL2baa	Hello...I just came by because someone said y'all were talkin' bout me....hehehe|`|AA10847209	OT you were "saved" thru' obeying the Laws. In the NT you are saved by repenting, and then by faith thru' grace. Human infractions ( aka sin) have not changed at all over the centuries, in fact through technology we are constantly inventing faster and easier ways to do evil. However, belief in the saving love of Jesus appears to offer a somewhat less stringent way of making our amends. Also, Christianity offers "heaven" as a reward for one who repents of their sins. In Judaism, there is no assurance of an afterlife that I am aware of. Note: this all assumes a mindset of sin, good, and evil--ideas which are human constructs. The last sentence is my opinion, just as I am inclined to believe that nature overall is neutral. Perhaps some day we will know.( it rains on the just and the unjust alike!)|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Sin is defined by the 613 laws of the Torah. These days, people have added to and taken from this as they choose and include in "sin" anything they personally don't like. Growing up, I was told that space travel, science fiction, Rock n Roll, dancing, smoking and drinking were all sins. Now, smoking is a sin under the rule that you are to take care of your body, and drinking can be a sin if you do it too much, but the rest have absolutely no Biblical basis. These same people told me that cowboy movies and country music were okay, btw. <br>  <br>  The animal sacrifices were replaced in the Christian faith by the one sacrifice of Christ so that we wouldn't have to do that anymore. The Jews stopped the sacrificial system after the destruction of Solomon's Temple in 70 AD by the Romans. Prophecy dictates that the system will be revived one day when the temple is rebuilt, and this is one of the signs that the end is near.

It is earned by showing up on time, listening intently, displaying a solid work ethic, and being thorough in all that you do on a daily basis. <br>   Respect is also earned by going above and beyond what is expected of you without expectation of anything in return for doing it. This also means that you shouldn’t stand around bitching, complaining, and making statements such as, “That’s not my job.” It means that occasionally you will have to perform duties that are outside your scope of responsibility. <br>   During this age of the entitlement there is a common - lack respect for others yet expectations of respect from peers.  o_O|`|vdJg22MKaa	why you axing this question fo?

Verified By History/Archeology<br>  2.1.1.1. Abraham’s home city of Ur was excavated by Sir Leonard Woolley.<br>  2.1.1.2. Solomonic cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer have been excavated.<br>  2.1.1.3. Isaiah 20:1 was challenged by critics because they knew of no king named Sargon in lists of Assyrian kings. Now Sargon’s palace has been recovered at Khorsabad, including a wall inscription and a library record endorsing the battle against the Philistine city of Ashdod.<br>  2.1.2. Verified By Fulfilled Prophesies<br>  2.1.2.1. In Zechariah 8:7-8, the prophet said God would bring the Jews from exile back to their homeland (Israel) and that they would be able to live in the city of Jerusalem again. This prophecy has been fulfilled more than once. About 2600 years ago, Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and took many Jews as captives to Babylon. But many Jews later returned from Babylon. The Jews rebuilt Jerusalem but the city was destroyed about 1900 years ago by the Romans. The Romans killed more than 1 million Jews and forced many more into exile. And, the Romans banned Jews from living in Jerusalem. More than 1800 years passed before the Jews had control of Jerusalem again. They reclaimed control of their ancient capital during the Six Day War of 1967.<br>  2.1.2.2. Daniel 9:25: Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. This includes a mathematical prophecy. As we have noted in previous articles, the Jewish (and Babylonian) calendars used a 360-day year; 69 weeks of 360-day years totals 173,880 days. In effect, Gabriel told Daniel that the interval between the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem until the presentation of the Messiah as King would be 173,880 days. The commandment to restore and build Jerusalem was given by Artaxerxes Longimanus on March 14, 445 B.C. Jesus entered Jerusalem on April 6, 32 A.D. When we examine the period between March 14, 445 B.C. and April 6, 32 A.D., and correct for leap years, we discover that it is 173,880 days exactly, to the very day!<br>  2.1.2.3. In Isaiah 45:1, the prophet said God would open the gates of Babylon for Cyrus and his attacking army. Despite Babylon's remarkable defenses, which included moats, and walls that were more than 70-feet thick and 300-feet high, and 250 watchtowers, Cyrus was able to enter the city and conquer it. Cyrus and his troops diverted the flow of the Euphrates River into a large lake basin. Cyrus then was able to march his army across the riverbed and into the city.<br>  2.1.3. Verified By Its Unique Structure And Unity<br>  2.1.3.1. Although the Bible is composed of 66 books, it contains no contradictions or internal conflicts.<br>  2.1.4. Verified By Its Endurance Against Attacks<br>  2.1.4.1. The Scriptures have been attacked by various groups and nations all through history. It continues to be attacked today. The question is, “Why are people so afraid of the Bible?”<br>  2.1.5. Verified By Changes Lives<br>  2.1.5.1. The Scriptures have changed countless lives, past and present. Countless men and women have died for their unwavering convictions of what it says.<br>  2.1.6. Verified By Jesus Christ On Every Page<br>  2.1.6.1. Throughout the Old Testament, Jesus Christ can be found boldly displayed on every single page. For example, in Genesis, Joseph foreshadows Jesus Christ in over 100 different ways.<br>  2.1.7. Verified By Its Scientific Accuracy<br>  2.1.7.1. Dinosaurs are referred to in several Bible books. The book of Job describes two dinosaurs. One is described in chapter 40 starting at verse 15, and the other in chapter 41 starting at verse 1.<br>  2.1.7.2. 1Corinthians 15:41 says that stars differ from stars in glory. All stars look alike to the naked eye. Even when seen through a telescope, they seem to be just points of light. However, analysis of their light spectra reveals that each is unique and different from all others.<br>  2.1.7.3. Job 26:7 describes the suspension of the Earth in space.<br>  2.1.8. Verified By The Accuracy Of Manuscripts<br>  2.1.8.1. Ignoring spelling-oriented (orthographic) changes and similar small differences, the Dead Sea Scrolls match the Hebrew text behind today’s Old Testament, in spite of the passage of over 2,000 years (where one would expect errors to creep in).<br>  2.1.8.2. The New Testament’s earliest manuscripts date from 25-50 years after composition, and there are about 5700 extant manuscripts.

The prophecy is 100 percent true. What I mean by prophecy is not just predicting the future. I mean that when you study the Bible you see intelligence there that is far beyond what a man could have made up, along with various predictions about things just as the very day that Jesus would be hailed as king (when he wrote a donkey into Jerusalem, Jesus even said "if they knew this very day".)<br>  The reason Christians continue to study the Bible is not just to memorize it. They are looking for God's great wisdom and prophecy in the Bible. It's amazing stuff. But if you just dismiss it you are missing out. Have you ever heard a song and didn't like it but others did, and you just dismissed it? Then later you find the song or the band is pretty good. That's how the Bible is, but only when you study it you don't realise you are missing things all the time.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	You study up on it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-english-bible-history/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatsite.com/timeline-englis...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-history.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testame...</a>|`|67EaIAvbaa	Genesis 1-1..if you can just believe that,your set.If not..the whole rest of the bible will be very difficult to believe and understand.Please..respect the bible.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Personally I don't see how anybody can make that claim considering the fact that no-one even knows who wrote it.|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	It's not.

They pierced My hands and My feet;   17 I can count all My bones. They look [and] stare at Me.   18 They divide My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots. now if you red the account in the gospels you will have trouble denying that all these things happened , but that would be a couple of instances in which Christ was prophesied to come,there are over 330 other prophecies like this in the old testament , now heres the kicker, if i were able to tell you 8 things about a man before he was even born like what kind of job he would have , where he would go to college , what hospital he was going to be born at , how old he was going to be when he died , how he was going to die, if the child were going to be a boy or a girl, what will take place during his lifetime in great detail, etc, for me to get just 8 of those things right , would 1 in 10 to the 17th power that would be<br>  10 with seventeen zeros, but to answer your question i myself could go all night writing about the word of God and try to prove to you it is authentic but there is no way i can make you believe anything, without your consent to trust in the first place.|`|ayanbp01aa	Someone forgot to bring the digital recorder to record the actual sayings.<br>  <br>  Hence, the question of "text" of 'man' vs. "word" of 'god'.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the truth does not always show visibly or in any form and substance.|`|Myn9aKZoaa	Well you follow your faith.|`|li22L9gZaa	Easy...you don't.

rcPnnfmmaa	How do you prove ordinary things? How would you prove Australia was there? Or that gorillas exist?<br>  <br>  You can see Australia and gorillas, and when you stop believing in them they don't go away.<br>  <br>  I suppose you could also think of things that are best explained by Australia or the existence of gorillas. Gorilla footprints, for example. Or Fosters. This is a weak form of proof because Bigfoot would be an excellent explanation for Bigfoot footprints and to some people pyramids are excellent proof of Atlantis. Unless you have someone who can walk on water or do something else that's really hard to explain without divine intervention this will never go anywhere. Especially with Chris Angel running around. Do you understand where we're coming from?<br>  <br>  Ah, but unlike Australia or gorillas God's invisible. How then do you prove the existence of the invisible? Scientists don't sit around waiting for gnostic revelations concerning new kinds of particles, they devise ways to make the invisible visible. Build me a godoscope, a godometer, something to let us know this is something that is can be seen and not just imagined.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  To make God completely immaterial and unquantifiable is to say that he's no different from an idea. If he has a mind capable of orderly thoughts he must have some kind of order himself.

Why would he bless those mothers with the ability to conceive? Yet so many women will never know what it's like to feel their unborn child move inside of them. What it's like to see the combination of themselves and their mate as one. To nurse their own.  And you cant say that HE gives us choices, because none of those women would ever choose anything that prevents them from bringing a little life into this world to nurture and love and watch grow. Not only that, but those women will never have grandchildren. All powerful?|`|5VXSD7C4aa	The universe has to come from somwhere.

Another problem is that many of the different denominations have a different light - a different understanding of scriptures that was shared or given to them.  Some of those beliefs are false and strictly based on a feel good philosophy. <br>  <br>  If you really check into the Catholic faith you will discover that the early priests co-exisited with the pagans and chose to merge some of the pagan customs with their church in an attempt to have a united body of believers.  The first thing they did, and it is written in the Catholic historical documents, was to change the Sabbath from the seventh day of the week to Sunday.  They also persecuted true believers - the Waldenses had to hide from them,  and Bibles or copies of written scripture were not permitted beyond the chosen few of the Catholic priests / monks.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	Okay, it can be confusing to people who have not experienced being a part of different sects.<br>  I'm part of the Assemblies of God, and I will stick with this denomination for life.<br>  We take the Bible as it is written, we do not add or take away from it.<br>  Baptists believe you must be baptized in order to get to heaven.<br>  MANY other sects do not allow speaking in tongues during church services, which is absolutely Biblical, so why not allow it?<br>  Every sect disagrees on one aspect, enough to start a separation.|`|AA12209909	It's all about little differences, especially about the differences in ritual practices.

They broke off from the Catholic church and formed their own churches, adjusting the beliefs and practices to how they felt they should be. This happened continuously through the years until the grand daddy of messed up Christian religions appeared. (Mormonism.) So to make a long story short, they didn't like what the original system told them to do, so they changed it. Basically they changed religion to fit their needs...which kind of goes against the whole idea of religion in the first place.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	God through His Son only established one Church.

Had catholicism existed during the time of Acts, the first Christians would have rejected catholicism completely.<br>  <br>  Catholicism cannot save anybody.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9).  <br>  <br>  The truth is that only believing in Jesus alone for salvation, is what saves you. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

He sent his disciples out to tell what he had done.  It was several centuries between this and any organized church as the Christians were persecuted and living in caves during most of the Roman period.<br>  Protestants believe that man is responsible to God (while Catholics believe man is responsible to the church and the church speaks for God).  Therefore if I have one idea of what God wants and you have another, Protestants will do what they believe God wants.  Whereas Catholic lay people have no ideas about what God wants but blindly follow their leaders.  So it is easier to keep the Catholics together, but the Protestant experience is usually deeper.

If you read history you will find all these terrible things happening. But we all know Catholics don't do any of these things any longer. One recent pope even asked for forgiveness for these cruelties, and I think we should respect that. My hope for the future is that all Christians will respect freedom of religion and also each other, even if there may be differences in beliefs. Also I hope protestants will speak about the  Catholic Church according to what it does today, and not according to what it did in the past.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Before the Catholics God existed...and He established His true church here on earth through Jesus Christ.

Typically, heretics were considered the very worst of sinners—far  worse than murderers--because they had the potential to turn innocents away from the true faith and into damnation. <br>  <br>  In Christian history, that unified Church was the Catholic Church whose leader was the Pope, and whose advisers were the Bishops and Cardinals. The Catholic  Church remained unified for about a 1000 years when it split into the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman) bodies, cursing and excommunicating each other. <br>  <br>  But the more fundamental split was the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism in the 16th Century, under leaders like Luther, who were rebelling against the corruption, worldliness and depravity of the Catholic Church at the time. Teachers like Luther taught that a person could communicate with God without the intercession of a priest, could read the Bible and understand it without the necessity of Church teachings, could confess to God and be forgiven without the back up of the Church and so on. All this reduced the traditional power of the priest, who in Protestantism was little more than a gifted preacher. Inevitably the Church’s authority was also reduced, since it was taught that a man might read and understand the Bible by his own lights. Just as Luther rebelled and left the Catholic Church, new ministers with different attitudes and ideas rose up and formed their own denominations and cults, all of them claiming to be the true Church. <br>  <br>  Today, there are about 2000 different Christian denominations, nearly all of them springing from the original Protestant movement.|`|PEUwnGHraa	It's not just Christianity, honey; it's all of FALSE RELIGIONS -- ALL ORGANIZED RELIGIONS.<br>  <br>  Organized religions, sects, denominations are made by imperfect men to control the masses; a lot of men and women love to control others because they feel some sense of empowerment over other humans, but it has never worked and never will. Imperfect humans cannot and do not successfully govern and rule over other imperfect humans. That is God's job for he did not make us to be independent of his rule. He made us perfect but in subjection to him. <br>  <br>  Adam and Eve [of whom he made perfect] lost perfection for us, so we need God more than ever now. We have inherited that imperfection from our ancestors, Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  Organized religions are a way to control and brainwash one another. They are also a strong group of greeds and corrupt evil people trying to "be over" other people. Organized religions promote greed, sexual abuses, serious criminal behaviors and other debauched immoral behavior that they try to cover up. They try to cover up their atrocities because they want to keep their cults going, and keep up the greed and brainwashing; mind control. They don't want their dirty little secrets to get out that make them look bad.<br>  <br>  Trouble is they forgot along the way, God sees all.

Many of the descendants of these people have followed the lead of their forebears and in turn left their organisations and started other ones of their own supposedly based on a better understanding of the Holy Bible than anyone who came before them received. (Some even claim to know more than the apostles!)<br>  <br>  That's the short answer but if you're wondering why there isn't unity in Christianity please don't blame us Oriental Orthodox, we approved the Three Ecumenical Councils and have never changed the Faith which was once delivered to the saints.<br>  <br>  Pray for me please.<br>  ~~~<br>  EDIT:<br>  llanolyn, speaking of experts and group reflection, how about the Ecumenical Councils?<br>  <br>  myles325, the Coptic Orthodox Church never excommunicated the rest of the apostolic Church.

The answer would be for all expect the Lutherans, at the Great Vigil of Easter which happens on Saturday night, after sundown.<br>  <br>  It is always amazing to me that many Roman Catholics know nothing about the theology of their own church.  The Great Vigil of Easter is done after sundown on Saturday, because Jesus rose in the night. The tomb was empty in the pre-dawn time when the women went there. In keeping with the Jewish idea that the day begins at sundown the Vigil begins anytime after that point. For most of us who attend the Vigil at the point in the Vigil when the lights come on and the music begins it is Easter!!  Many of us do not go to church on Sunday morning, since we have already celebrated Easter the way it was done in the early Church. If you have never been to  the Great Vigil of Easter, I encourage you to experience it.  It is a very moving service. Starts in total darkness and the fire is kindled as in the beginning of creation. Then different parts of creation history are read from the Old Testament leading up to "this most Holy of nights". Has a lot of symbolism throughout.  Find a Roman Catholic or Anglican church and go check it out. If you are not RC you can not receive the communion but you can still go. If you are Baptized you can receive in the Anglican church.

Believe me, I speak from experience on this. I am a devout Christian and one time I made a "joking" remark about the crucifixion on a Good Friday (only, I didn't KNOW at the time that it was on a Good Friday), and later that night, the Lord sent a VIOLENT-A@@ lighting and thunderstorm that made me think the world was about to end. I was TERRIFIED! Everytime I had the thought of "ah, come on man, it wasn't THAT bad!", BAM! BAM! BAAMMMM!!!!!!, closer and closer to my window. And everytime I had the thought of "well ok, I guess that joke wasn't appropiate....especially on a Good Friday. I'm really sorry", the storm would start to die down a bit, until finally I said how sorry I was and prayed for forgiveness on my knees and repented with all my heart. The storm got weaker and weaker and then finally went up into the sky and disappeared in a huge white ball of light in the sky. Talked to my neighbor the next morning about the "great storm" and he said "what storm?" which would signify that God only sent that storm for ME & no-one else at the time....So the moral of the story is, don't mock God, even "jokingly", otherwise there's a chance he might come back and bite you on the *** about it the way he did with me! No joke.|`|qNpLxKtkaa	No, not a pizza-religion nation. Because I'd be "agnostic".

Usually that is reserved for visiting relatives. Prison security does not cooperate very nicely with visiting Evangelist. <br>  Secondly, visiting prisons for the sole purpose of evangelizing is a gift that not all have. The Holy Spirit gives gifts, each according to his needs and abilities. <br>  Thirdly, from my experience, the prisons do have prisoners that do share the gospel with those willing to listen.

We are called to serve as the body of Christ in our fashion and as the OPPORTUNITY arises.<br>  <br>  it's interesting you took the name of a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1959.  I'm guessing that's your political statement that you are somehow an innocent victim in the plight of your incarceration.   Like every alcoholic, YOU should come to grips with your own part in your incarceration - being prosecuted as a criminal and removed from society as a threat to it.   Maybe Jesus has something to say to YOU and not to all those mean old Christians who failed to visit poor little you in prison.

Your only personal relationship is with Jah, the Christ.  Kind of depressing at first, but you don't HAVE to believe it.|`|67EaIAvbaa	while our heavenly bodies may resemble our earthly bodies we will in some ways be like angels ..matthew 22:23-33|`|rx20pKgOaa	My faith teaches me that not only will I see and know my friends and family in Heaven but my family will continue and my husband & I will be eternally in love. ;) (I like that part.)<br>  <br>  There are those who don't have much love in this life but that doesn't mean there aren't those who love them in the next.  Every person was a child once and that child was loved by someone.  A grandparent, even a great grandparent - those will be there to greet us and love us in the next life.  <br>  <br>  I believe that there will be an abundance of love to share when we reach the Heavens. <br>  <br>  Have a wonderful evening!

rGEZup0Zaa	Religious tolerance is intellectual cowardice.|`|AA11440601	Before you start practicing religious intolerance, I suggest you thank Theists for creating, implementing, and protecting the freedom of religion that allows you be even be an Atheist.<br>  <br>  The entire world agreed to include freedom of religion in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. See Article 2: <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html</a><br>  <br>  The citizens of the United States think this freedom is just as important as the freedoms of speech or the press. All are part of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/...</a><br>  <br>  Even the Catholic Church seeks and supports the freedom of religion for all human beings. In the Vatican II document, Declaration on Religious Freedom, Dignitatis Humanae (Human Dignity), the Church states: <br>  <br>  The human person has a right to religious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with others, within due limits.<br>  <br>  For the entire document, see: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_counc...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	If you witness a murder and do not do anything about it, does that mean that you "approve" the act?<br>  <br>  Legal systems say yes, and so do I.<br>  <br>  If you see me breaking into your car and manage to steal because you did and said nothing, does that mean that you approve my stealing it?<br>  <br>  Absolutely.|`|I11BEwi5aa	it is a moral duty to be rid of religion.<br>  <br>  It is harmful for the species in the long run.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>At what point does religious tolerance become support for theism?<br>  <br>  Basically, at the point where anyone's rights are being infringed upon due to an allowance made for a religion or religious practice, or where religious proselytizing is going unchallenged purely due to not wanting to offend religious people. Religion is a lot like any other kind of ignorance; if someone was going around door to door and telling people that 2+2 really equals 5, what would be the limit of an acceptable response to that? Imagine the same principle applied to religion.<br>  <br>  >Help me here, if we aren't against them does that mean we are actually with them?<br>  <br>  What do you mean by 'not against them'? How far do you want to take it?|`|IBkJZ8plaa	Hmm, perhaps at the same point that tolerance of atheism becomes atheism itself?<br>  <br>  I'm a "religious" woman, to some extent, but I have no problem with atheists, fully believe that any persecution of them would be morally and legally wrong, and support their right to speak their mind in all levels of our society.<br>  <br>  That doesn't make me an atheist.<br>  <br>  I would say that an atheist who was similarly tolerant of religions would also not be a theist.|`|jnHwmvSkaa	Tolerance does NOT mean that you respect or accept religion in any way. <br>  <br>  All it means is that you do not try and oppress those who disagree with you with the force of law. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not respectful of superstition in the least, but I'm tolerant of it.|`|SGLXcWa8aa	i dont think that you'd be with them if you arent against them<br>  <br>  many think that religion has poisoned humanity but i think that it is the way that men react to religion that poisons humanity.|`|0lnamekJaa	As long as they limit their hate to WORDS...

I stood where they told me to and as the claw of the backhoe swung toward me to bite the earth from where I stood the worker man saw me and stopped the swing just short of me. He opened the glass at the hoe control and yelled at me. I pointed at the rear wheels spinning backward and said the old people asked you to stop and look. He did look and realized his thermos strap had hooked the lever on the console and shifted the machine to reverse. He said one or two more claw bites and the outriggers would have sunk low enough to have thrown the machine into the hole. All the commotion awoke my mother and when I told the story the man cried because the old people seemed to remind him of his parents. This took place in Goose Bay Labrador which is very isolated and he would have had no or very limited medical help. This was not my first nor last experience, just one of many. I was preschool at the time and knew nothing of ghost nor spirit and was unafraid. Not so my Mother who searched the house and cried.|`|psVbIAF6aa	i know ghost's are real. i will tello you what has hapend to (keep in mind i am 13 and that this has been going on 4 a year)<br>  <br>  once me my mum, my mums friend and her daughter were sitting a the table talking about stuff. and then i felt that a spirit had come into the room(some times i get that feeling so i just ignored it). mum and her friend started talking about thier friend who had passed away recentaly and then i felt some one start rubbing my left leg. i look under under the table to see if it was my lil' sis but there was no one under the table.so i just pretended it didnt happen (blaming it on my imagination) less then a miniute later i felt some one rubbing my leg again and i look under the table again but there was nothing so by that time i knew it was the spirit. then it started again but it didnt stop even when i crossed my legs sting on the chair. it went on 4 about ten minutes then i got up walt into the kitchen and walked back and sat down and it started again. by this time i was shaking. and then suddnley i had an idea i asked mum and her friend if thier dead friend ever like rubbing peoples legs or getting hers rubbed and then looked at my funny and said she loved getting her legs rubbeb expecualy her left cause it sometimes got sore and as soon as i asked that i stopped! <br>  <br>  once i turned the lights off ready to go to bed ilaydown in bed closed my eyes for a few seconds and the i just knew that there was sumthing in the coner off my room so i opend my eyes and sure enough standing in the coner of my room was a black figure. i stared at it for 10 seconds to see if it was just my imagination but it didnt go away. by this time i was freecking out. so i closed my eyes.reached for my phone on my bedside table and open it and shone the light in the coner and i it was gone<br>  <br>  a nother night i woke up and got up to get a drink (it was about 1:30 at night) and it was pretty much pitch black and i got this really weird feeling that there was something in the hallway connected to the kitchen so i slowly open the fridge door and the light from it passed over a kid in the hallway it was only there for i split Second but i looked like a boy about 9 or 10 years old. i only got a quick look at the face. it wasn't like a white floating figure it look like a normal human just very pale<br>  <br>  hear are some other things that happen to me<br>  <br>  i hear footsteps walking towards my bedroom at night when every1 is asleep. i hear chairs moving when i am the only one home. my dog barks at nothing (that i can see or any one else). i here heavy breathing outside my bed room. i always see shadows moving out the corner of my eyes. i sit in chairs that a warm but nobody sat in them for hours. radios turn on for no reason. i get cold in sum parts of the minutes or a few minutese and them i get warm again. i get the feeling someones watching me.once<br>  <br>  i walked into my bed room and it was dark and i saw a black figure standing up against the back wall but as soon as i turned to the light on it was gone. <br>  <br>  and another time in the middle of the night and got up to go to the toilet and i saw a white figure standing in the hall but as soon as i look at it disappeared.<br>  <br>  <br>  11:33 a nother night i was sitting a a computer desk in a dark room (well there is a little light from the computer) and out the Corner of my eye i saw i white figure walk in the room and i turned towards the door and there was nothing there and whilst i was still watching watching the door a black fog or mist or cloud i dont how to describe it just flooted through the door it was about 1 and a half meters tall and a meter wide it stoped for a second and dissaperd<br>  <br>  i could go on but i better not<br>  <br>  sorry if i wrote to much<br>  <br>  any quietions or want to know about anything else that has happened to me feel free to e-mail me at julia_luvs_horses_4_life@hotmail.com

bRLCxmP6aa	You've got the right basic idea, but you should get a linguistics book for more information on this subject - language families have been extensively studied, and there is more information all the time.<br>  <br>  English and Sanskrit are distantly related - both are Indo-European languages. About 450 languages and dialects are descended from Indo-European, including many from Europe and from Southwest, Central, and South Asia (about 220 in Indo-Aryan sub-branch). This relation means that many basic word roots are the same, and some grammatical structures are the same as well.<br>  <br>  Your examples are interesting, but you are not taking cultural blending and borrowing into account with the words you point to...some of the words you point to were borrowed from English, either to express a concept that was not covered in the original language or became the fashionable or accepted way to express a particular concept. Words like "civirai" seem much too modern a coinage (in English) to have been shared as part of Indo-European.|`|T1beLIQqaa	The Tamils of India ARE Indo European Aryans/Anglo Saxons, actually having their origins in Ireland.Yes, they are Caucasian with very dark brown skin.<br>  <br>  Hamza, Arabs are Semitic White, no relationship to the rest you named, whom are Indo European Aryan, NOT Semitic, Whites.|`|5HPkIxZHaa	some indian people in the north are caucasian. so they are relatives of arabs, persians,afghans, muhgals, greeks, turks. so yeah our languages are similar too. arabs, and persian who are definelty caucasian,(more than indians) have influenced india alot. so their language would also stay in india|`|Woeq7tp3aa	Yes of course it is possible and actually probable.

How can writing this be bad?  Yes it does mean something like what you wrote.  Name of the Father, son and Holy Spirit.  Why are you worried?

Then again that's what I thought till I saw "I'm not black."|`|0UjFOsHkaa	Just realize not every white person is bad and out to get you. Just like not every person of every race is like that. Slowly just try to socialize with white people. If it is a really big issue, maybe try therapy just to get you're issues and feelings sorted out. There are a lot of white people out there, so when you get into the real world you will find it next to impossible not to have to interact with white people. Remember, not all of us are bad people|`|TarcVqGEaa	Maybe you take racial stereotypes too seriously. Maybe the fact that there are not as many racial stereotypes of whites portrayed in the media makes white people seem mysterious to you, and therefore untrustworthy. You shouldn't take the portrayals you see on television and in movies so seriously if that's what you're doing.|`|Woeq7tp3aa	Yeah I have heard white people are bad.

Many Christians seem to claim to believe in a religion without even knowing what it is about or what their particular bible even contains.|`|TdKfsALAaa	Good question. I agree that "believe in the Lord" is the better way to put it. But "believe in the Lord and believe him," that's the best.

Many today in other countries ARE dying for true worship!<br>  <br>  Me, I would hope and think I would be loyal to my God, Jehovah no matter the cost to me.<br>  <br>  Jesus died for pure worship. He died because of his beliefs. As his disciple, I would like to think I would as well.|`|f5IcUlXTaa	Yes, most would because of the total and complete control of the watchtower over the members.  The faith of these members is phenomenal.  Unfortunately, it is a misdirected faith. Their undying faith should be in Jesus.  Their persecutions should be for Jesus sake.  For His name and none other.  Just as the bible commands.  They pride themselves on being the only group who follows the bible to a tee.  But because of the NWT committee changing the bible to fit the watchtower doctrine, the beliefs and faith of these people are totally umbiblical.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	Shitler-Hitler.

I know of this being a former Witness. However this breaking the law, right, therefor a sin? Just wondered.<br>  Is one sin somehow less of a sin then another?

Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to the concentration camps during the Nazi era. Many died because they would not sign a document of freedom by renouncing on their faith.<br>  Jehovah's Witnesses were neutral in World War II. We do not fight against humans but fight for God's kingdom.<br>  <br>  "Modern day" as you call it Jehovah's Witnesses still are imprisoned in countries and are killed for their faith today.<br>  In come countries the preaching of the good news of the kingdom is banned but it still is continued even at great risk to personal safety by servants of Jehovah God.<br>  <br>  What good is saving our temporary life in rejecting God's commandments and lose out on the opportunity of everlasting life?<br>  <br>  Matthew 10:28<br>  And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 6:12<br>  because we have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am not saying it is impossible for some individual JWs to save his life when under great test. The apostle Peter himself denied Jesus and was forgiven. But as a clear vast majority as a whole as history has proven this to be the case, Jehovah's Witnesses will not let their integrity to God be broken to save themselves.|`|wRtzGgRxaa	Shitler?  I'm not sure who that is.  Must be Christian slang, in a respectful way, of course.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	I would have to say that some might and others might not.  Like everything else in life, we will respond to our challenges with what our character is made of. If  we are faithful people then we die faithful.  If we are faithless people....who knows?<br>  <br>  An example of some who might not be willing to die is this group of elders:  Back in March 2002, right after 9/11, a few elders took some congregation youths to a March Madness game. As with any American sport, the national anthem was played before the game started. As many probably are aware, if a JW attended school pep rallies, assemblies, games and never stood up for any of the anthems/pledges (nothing much ever happened, their friends just called them a 'commie').  The Watchtower has forbidden any such participation.  You might be suprised when during the Star Spangled Banner, one elder gets up, leans over and says that the group should probably stand up, which the group did. Later on, he did some damage control and told them that because of the state that the country was in after the terrorist attacks, it wouldn't have been wise to continue to stay seated.<br>  <br>  If an elder would stand up because of fear of being attacked by a mob of basketball fans, what was the difference between foregoing 'christian neutrality' because of circumstances and preserving your life through a blood transfusion or signing a sheet of paper that says you will no longer be consider yourself a jehovah's witness like the Nazis demanded of the Bible Students during WWII?<br>  <br>  Haven't we as jw's and former jw's always heard 'encouraging' stories of brothers & sisters in far away lands perservering after being persecuted for their beliefs. But when you REALLY think about it, if push REALLY came to shove, how many would have taken that blood transfusion, or would have signed that sheet of paper if it meant that they wouldn't get hurt, jailed or killed. Granted, there are hundreds of witnesses who've been killed, jailed or attacked for their beliefs, but what if the government suddenly took away the rights and the priviledges that we as Americans enjoy and we learned that we simply had to renounce our faith, how many witnesses would have left in a heartbeat?  Perhaps this is what the mark of the beast will be? Simple disobedience? A pinch of incense for the emperor? A single act of worship?
n3Ylo56Waa	No. <br>  <br>  There are extremists in every religion. I know you're referring to Arabs here even if you don't come out and say it. Let me give you some statistics.<br>  <br>  I took advanced Islam courses, Arabic, and a course on the life and culture of the Arabs. <br>  <br>  These aren't the exact amounts but are pretty close, okay? About 80% of all Arabs are Muslims. But Arabs only make up around 30% of the Muslim world. A LOT of it is in Indonesia and Malaysia. There are large groups in parts of the US, India, huge sections in Africa, etc. <br>  <br>  The thing about Islam is, because of what's going on in the world right now, everyone is focusing on the radicals. The media's really only showing us the worst side (there is an ugly side to every religion: It's called extremists) We're also viewing Arabs and Muslims as the same thing. You'd be surprised at how many people don't know there's a difference. That is one BIG difference. One is an ethnicity, the other is a religion. <br>  <br>  Right now, the world isn't being shown the true nature and faces of Islam. I've met Muslims that actually FOLLOW what their religion preaches. They are not racists nor do they condone violence. I'm a white American agnostic. They are Arab Egyptian Muslims. They're some of my best friends.|`|FRNgFcuhaa	Islam is a universal religion my friend. Anyone (including you) from any race, creed or background is most welcome to embrace it as a way of life.

db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	eternal security is taught in the scriptures<br>  <br>  1 corinthians 5:5 is one verse the man was in the flesh yielding to satan but was saved by the soul.<br>  <br>  To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  A person who is not saved in the day of the lord Jesus will not see his soul saved but condemned to the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  <br>  Paul stated in romans <br>  Rom 11:28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. <br>  Rom 11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. <br>  <br>  Israel by the gospel is a enemy to God, for the church's sake, but as the election they are beloved by God.<br>  <br>  The gifts, which is salvation by faith, and the callings, which is Israel, are without repentance. The greek word with out repentance means irrevocable, not able to be changed or canceled.<br>  <br>  ephesians 2:8-9 salvation is a gift of God.<br>  <br>  If salvation was not eternal them if you lose the salvation just once for any one sin you could never obtain it again.<br>  <br>  Paul said<br>  Heb 6:4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, <br>  Heb 6:5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, <br>  Heb 6:6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. <br>  <br>  its impossible for anyone who has tatsed the holy spirit of promise and been enlightened if they fall away, to renew them to salvation. repentance is a change in heart, mind, and soul at salvation by the holy spirit.<br>  <br>  So every little sin you commit would cause you to lose salvation and therefore lose it forever. If you told a lie you would lose salvation forever because you could not repent.<br>  <br>  But that is not what God is saying salvation is forever.<br>  Eph 4:30 And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. <br>  <br>  God says not to grieve or cause distress to the holy spirit where by you are sealed unto the day of redemption not until you commit a sin but until God gives you the promise of salvation when it is fulfilled.<br>  <br>  Eph 1:13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, <br>  Eph 1:14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. <br>  <br>  <br>  In who (Jesus Christ) we also trusted, after we heard the words of the truth, the gospel of your salvation. In who (Jesus Christ) also after that you believed, you were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise.<br>  <br>  Which is the earnest of our heirship until the ransom in full of the acquisitioneded possession.<br>  <br>  In other words the holy spirit is the down payment of our heirship with God until salvation is fully given to us, when we go to be with God.<br>  <br>  Paul said about Sin<br>  Rom 7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: <br>  Rom 7:23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. <br>  <br>  Rom 7:25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. <br>  <br>  Paul says his mind sought to serve God but his flesh sought to serve sin. But he was still saved.<br>  <br>  We are to try to be holy as god is holy<br>  but we can sin<br>  <br>  1Jo 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: <br>  <br>  A advocate or mediator (Jesus christ) between us and God to ask god to forgive us our sins.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	I don't believe it does.|`|uFAoq4idaa	The doctrine of Eternal Security had clouded my mind with doubts.

Evolution is not "supposed to make everything better".  Evolution is a natural process.<br>  <br>  4.  Atheists probably ask you to "prove God" because you are asserting that one exists.  An atheist cannot accept that assertion on faith and needs to see demonstrable evidence that will stand up to scrutiny.|`|5urfAbazaa	you might want to take a physical anthropology course.|`|OKClYfDQaa	That's the problem with atheists: they failed to disprove their own illusion. The fact is . . . that we don't have to prove the existence of God; He exists even without proof. He even exists before we came to be. On the other hand, you can't prove the existence of something in places where it doesn't exists -- say, God in the mind of an atheist.|`|AA11124121	evil walks among us..in human form..|`|84gK4XlHaa	I really don't think that you're stupid for believing in God.

How does that equate to me not "believing" in evolution?<br>  <br>  If your god can always exist without need for a creator, why can't the universe?<br>  <br>  Evolution isn't supposed to make everything better. It only makes living things better equipped for their environment. That doesn't always mean a bigger brain and therefore more intelligence.|`|2QuGuphYaa	You have shown your lack of understanding in evolution.

Evolution does not, despite what your preacher or parents might tell you, say that there is no God.  Evolution is about the change in life over time. <br>  <br>  Nor is the big bang theory and the existence of God in opposition.<br>  <br>  Most Christians, in fact, fully accept the big bang and evolution and believe that God was the cause of them.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, atheists asking you to prove God in no way reflects doubt in evolution, or even doubt in their atheism, just like you asking them to prove that God doesn't exist does not reflect your doubt in His existence.|`|29zyJ95Eaa	If God really existed, how did he come into life if he supposedly 'created' humans?

Till then, go Darwin!|`|80yTYedUaa	Evolution is not a fact.It has no relevance to science. Darwin's theory of evolution is a hypothesis. The theory has not been experimented or proved.

This idea that it can't exist without being proven to a reasonable doubt in fact, is a scientific statement. Science has always been around, even when the Bible was written. Now, Atheism has been around for at least as long as civilization itself. Atheists have been mentioned since Mesopotamian times, which were before the Bible was written. Thus, Atheism is far older than the Bible itself and has existed alongside science for nearly as long, and science was known long before the Bible. Following your 'argument', we can conclude that the Bible cannot tell the future because your bases have all been disproved.|`|FxVRPIm3aa	I'm hoping English is not your first language. <br>  <br>  Your question is a little hard to follow, but are you asking how I explain how the bible knew of atheists existence even before they existed?

No one will ever be able to change my mind on whether or not there is a god, jesus, or heaven and hell. Not all christians are the same. some believe in the lord, but no hell or heaven. I think that we live life not to have a benefit after our life. our benefit is life, in general.  God gave his only son for us. So that we can make mistakes in life, and that by far is the greatest benefit in life. To know that God is not ashamed at us, and has given us the opportunity to redeem ourselves to him.|`|YWwRgDkvaa	If there were no heaven and there were no hell, and you were not going to be held accountable for your works and such here on earth, there would be no purpose for being here, and we wouldn't be here.

FLAtdWrmaa	Jesus was definitely human.  There is reliable and independent historical evidence (documents from ancient Romans, mostly) that supports the idea that Jesus was a man who actually lived.<br>  <br>  Was he God?  There is no way to prove it. You can only believe that he was, or believe that he wasn't.  There is only some evidence which, if you choose to believe it, suggests that he was.  But no proof.  So if you believe he was God, you have faith.  It's not prove-able *truth,* but the "truths" of faith soothes the souls of millions of humans.<br>  <br>  So it's silly and arrogant to call anyone a liar, or mistaken, or damned to hell, etc., for *not* believing Jesus was God.  The reverse could just as easily be the real truth.|`|hDR0fOCdaa	From my understanding, Jesus was the (human) son of God.  It is said that he died for the sins of humanity and then was resurrected, ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  So, he was human...he was the son of God...not God himself.  Only Jesus' father was divine, not Jesus himself.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	He was both fully human and fully God.  He had both natures in Him: human and divine.|`|Wng05H8uaa	He was like both. Its hard to understand, but he was God and man in one person. He went through the same temptations we do, but he was completely sinless because he was God.|`|y6I1f78gaa	No Jesus was God's son. And since God is considered "a spirit" and Mary was a human...

He was the first angel that his father ever created - in fact the first anything that was created. He lived with his father for untold millions of years before willingly leaving his place in heaven to be born as a man.  When he was born, he was perfect, just as Adam was originally perfect before he sinned and fell into imperfection.  But, he was completely human - he didn't even have any memory of having lived in heaven.  It was at his baptism that "the heavens opened up to him" and he got back all of his heavenly memories from before he was born on earth.  He was still all man.  After he was killed, he was brought back to life as the angel he was at first.<br>  <br>  If he'd had a child, the child would not have been half-god, but would have been perfect, and thus not subject to sickness and death, just like Adam was never supposed to die - remember, death was punishment for eating from the tree, and was never supposed to be part of the plan.  As long as that child stayed faithful, they would not have experienced death, and therefore would still be alive today.<br>  <br>  Jesus and God (whose name is Jehovah) are indeed 2 different, well, I can't say people since neither is human, but two different spirits, or personalities.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Assuming that he did actually exist then he was human

He says hey to me and so on, but we're not really all that close.<br>  I just can't help it though; he's got to be one of, if not the #1 cutest, guy I have seen in our whole school! Whenever he talks, he always smiles and just seems so happy.<br>  The only thing, though, is that I don't think he'd be into me. (Like anyone would) I've checked his Facebook and it says "Interested in : Women" :'( He does, however, seem like he may be a little open to just trying it once...<br>  What's really throwing me off, though, is his actions. He's generally a nice guy, etc. He'll up and like, man-hug some of the guys when we're in the gym. He's originally from Brazil, and since nearly every other country besides US seems to be generally closer in terms of guys as friends, I can't read a whole bunch into his behavior.<br>  What also sucks is that I'm a failure at dropping hints. I never catch the right moments because I'm always too busy with schoolwork, etc. And anything else I try is only a sad attempt at fooling myself into thinking I'm actually dropping hints. (As if he'd notice that every time I get the ball while we're playing Wall Ball my throws *just happen* to bounce towards him...)|`|2HrQQ3tJaa	Not really.

Good luck with that, because Christianity is about being saved by faith through God's grace. So it's totally useless as a system of morals, because the moral standard for someone that doesn't believe in God is way to high, and the moral standard for a believer who thinks they can be saved by works is too high. <br>  If you both believe in the teachings of the Bible, then read John 3:16, and read the book of Romans. It shows how it's not about works, or a system of rules, but about faith, and God does the work.<br>  Sorry.|`|2QuGuphYaa	Children should not be raised with religion or politics.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15.

7cjn2u9uaa	We know that anything physical must be created at some point in time, we also know that it must come from somewhere or something...everything is made out of something! so if we go back to the very first particle, or speck of matter or whatever it was we still need something to exist before it so it can be made or created.<br>  Claiming the universe always existed is not logical because we know that the universe has a beginning and claiming it was created or formed from nothing means that something was made out of nothing and we know this isn't possible.<br>  The only way for the first physical thing to be created is for something before it to exist and this something needs to be outside of time because otherwise it would need to be created itself.<br>  When there is no time there is no beginning therefore there is no need for creation.<br>  <br>  The first thing that ever existed needs to be outside of time otherwise it would need to be created itself, if you exist outside or time you were never created therefore you always existed, we know the universe cannot exist outside of time so the universe can not have always existed, this leaves us only with one option.

Many people (including me) can look around them, see the wonder of life, and know instinctively that this great amount of diversity did not happen by accident, but you can't call that proof.  It's your opinion, and that's why you have FAITH, something that cannot be proved but can be felt within the very core of your being.  I suppose you could say we each have what we believe is our own individual proof, but it wouldn't hold water in a scientific study, therefore, it's faith that motivates us, not solid evidence.|`|pakIAYWoaa	i think DNA and RNA  are impossible hurdles to get over.

However, the best I have heard is that written by I think C.S. Lewis.  There is a moral law that seem to be universal, such as not killing, not stealing, etc. This would point to the possible existence of a God who made us in God's image. One can also say that a mystical experience of the presence of what we call God is also a universal experience and can point to something outside of us that exist in another realm outside of time and space.|`|FRNgFcuhaa	A simple example would be the universe that you can see around you as well the parts you just cannot see beyond your horizon. That is a living proof that God exists, as He is the Sole Creator and Sustainer of the Universe and all that lie within it, including us humans.<br>  <br>  You must begin your search by asking questions, such as, "who created this universe and all that lie within it". If your answer should be 'nature' then explain what is nature? Or some people might say "science" created them, but then what is science?"<br>  <br>  Then you might ask, "who created 'night' & 'day'?" and then add, "who gives life to all plants and animals, including us humans?" and "who takes away life from plants and animals?"<br>  <br>  You can go on and on asking questions after questions you'll find that you will never be able to come to a conclusive answer. For anything to even exist (both in the physical and supernatural sense) there must be its creator. Man surely is not the creator. Science is just a bye product of man's knowledge and tool. There must be and there is indeed a Super Being who creates all the elements of the universe, and that Super Being is none other than God, the Almighty!|`|LgIcM5Xgaa	Thank you for asking this question because for some time I have been meaning to say:<br>      Proof of God's existence is improbable, not impossible but improbable, because like trying to discover how this planet and the solar system was made is a question that is far from being answered. Could there be a higher plane of existence, I wouldn't completely disagree. I look forward to seeing your remarks because after all what is history but a story told by the victor. What is the bible but writing of rich and powerful men, what is theory but speculation. The only thing that you cannot deny is Dinosaurs, and If you don't believe that then that is just plain ignorance.<br>  <br>  OH and you know the thing about the dinos, they were never mentioned in the bible, so if God created the world and Adam never met a dino, wouldn't that create a falseness in the infallible Bible|`|ALYKjSxuaa	I actually am not a Christian... however I strongly believe in God.

If the universe wasnt enough (and obviously for many, it's not), God proves himself in other ways.     <br>  <br>  One day I was  laying in bed, depressed, lost, hopeless. I was sobbing, I felt heart broken and worthless. I reached out and said "God, please help me, I dont want to feel this way anymore." Almost instantly this unexplainable calmness came over me.

fHA6zk07aa	It is a fair question.Christ manifested the Love of God and the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>  People who don't know that spiritual love that comes from the Holy Spirit are not comfortable because it interfers with what they want to do. They don't want to lose their will,so they despise those who would do Gods will.  We can't do God's will and do our own will too.That would make us hypocrites. God is the attributes of love,which is kindness,commpassion ,mercy & forgiveness and many more good qualities.God made us in his image,so when God said love me with all your mind & heart & soul and your fellowhuman beings as you love yourself .God was saying be like me in this nature. Those who care only about themselves can't do this. They don't see it in their purpose to feed the poor,or help the begger,or feed the starving children,or be kind to the unkind or to understand the troubled soul. I judge no one, but they judge themselves in their heart if this be true or not.<br>  Those who have in them,hate,jealousy,greed,endless lust,cannot do the will of God. So they make an excuse to defy God and all that is Holy. They do not have kindness ,or mercy or forgiveness. <br>  As Christ said when they crucified him,forgive them Father for they know not what they do. We too must forgive them and be kind to the unkind. None of us are good ,none of us are better than anyone else.

You are thinking of Indian Hindus.<br>  <br>  Hinduism<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus</a><br>  Hinduism is the predominant religion[1] of the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism is often referred to as Sanātana Dharma, a Sanskrit phrase meaning "the eternal law", by its practitioners.[2] Hindu beliefs vary widely, with concepts of God and/or gods ranging from Panentheism, pantheism, monotheism, polytheism, and atheism with Vishnu and Shiva being the most popular deities. Other notable characteristics include a belief in reincarnation and karma, as well as personal duty, or dharma.<br>  <br>  Among its roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India, and as such Hinduism is often stated to be the "oldest religious tradition" or "oldest living major tradition."[3][4][5][6] It is formed of diverse traditions and types and has no single founder.[7] Hinduism is the world's third largest religion after Christianity and Islam, with approximately a billion adherents, of whom about 905 million live in India.[8] Other countries with large Hindu populations can be found across southern Asia.<br>  <br>  Hinduism's vast body of scriptures are divided into ?ruti ("revealed") and Smriti ("remembered"). These scriptures discuss theology, philosophy and mythology, and provide information on the practice of dharma (religious living). Among these texts, the Vedas and the Upanishads are the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. Other major scriptures include the Tantras, the Agama, the Purā?as and the epics Mahābhārata and Rāmāya?a. The Bhagavad Gītā, a treatise from the Mahābhārata, spoken by Krishna, is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas.[9]|`|nw0fqXj9aa	when did this start? lol *face palm*|`|bF7yUXy5aa	I think you're thinking about Hindus.<br>  <br>  Cows were given to the high priests as gifts.

They have received the books before us (meaning Torah and Injil). We have received the book after them (meaning the Qur’an). Friday was their day to be glorified. However, they disputed on that while Allah had told us Friday is the day to glorify. Thus they will follow us. The Jews glorify Saturday, and the Christians glorify Sunday."|`|8927d354bcc7758ca946e0b5d715c39baa	Because they have Friday prayers--special weekly prayer alongwith the other daily prayers. <br>  <br>  It's similar to the Jewish Sabbath, but Muslims can "work" on Fridays.|`|JZMfUDylaa	no thanks for not telling me the details! >.<|`|35xruAUYaa	Uhh, maybe its like Sunday for Christians, a day of rest.

As your previous answer stated, we have freedom of speech in this country and therefore people are allowed to say what they want, regardless of who it may offend.  That is the very nature of freedom, is it not?  Of course, we have boundaries to this and when someone starts inciting violence because of what they say they have broken the law and can be arrested.  Therefore I see nothing wrong with this country.  We don't curtail our basic freedoms just because we don't like what someone says; that would make us as bad as the terrorists trying to disrupt us.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Yeah well over there they are afraid to stand up.

The fact that much of what we say falls on deaf ears doesn't matter to me. The same is true of the door to door work if you can even find someone at home especially when working rural territory.<br>  <br>  You can always expect very foolish answers here; mostly by opposers but sometimes by our own if someone doesn't take the time to check your profile and they assume you are someone that you aren't.

So out of 40 hours on this site I might count 2 hours of service, if that.  <br>  <br>  The main purpose of being on R & S is to provide an effective witness and it strengthens my faith.

1CS2KR7Taa	I agree with the second one.<br>  But the first one needs some adjustment.<br>  They say that the single most important rule of the Bible is: "Love your neighbor as yourself".<br>  Following this rule can lead us to a human society, where everyone is connected to everyone, like cells in a healthy human body. In that state everyone is for everyone we are giving mutual guarantees for the well being of the whole.<br>  So in that state there is nobody, who is not for us, or against us.<br>  And if we want to get to that state, we need to choose a motto like:<br>  One for All, All for One.<br>  I hope it helps, all the best.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Both good.

In my opinion, the rapture is just used as a scare tactic to make sure people still follow Christianity. Why wouldn't people want to be saved during the rapture rather than being left behind on earth to die? That's my opinion. To keep people scared into following a belief.

But God has not even come close to the number of people that Satan has killed.... And the book of Genesis tell you how that came about..... Now Adam and Eve were created, They were created to live forever, Now when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and obeyed Satan and they both ate that fruit and God not only kicked them out of the Garden Of Eden But God stated that mankind can not live forever in sin That was a death sentences for all mankind So now who was at fault for misleading mankind God or Satan...

AA10858522	god, I don't think Satan actually killed anyone throughout the entire bible. So much for god's love. To argue that Satan killed Job's kids would be 10 but god sent him to do it as part of a bet. So it would be god's fault. Everybody else who died by god's hand alone would be in the millions.<br>  <br>  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job ... And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.<br>  ...<br>  And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the LORD ... put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.<br>  <br>  (Job 1:18-19) And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house...And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.|`|q57P8uJbaa	Doesn't all life belong to God in the first place?<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 32:39<br>  "See now that I myself am He!

In fact, in the book of Job, God tells Satan that he can hurt Job all kinds of ways but can't take his life.  Judeo-Christian doctrine generally teaches that God is the creator of life and doesn't permit Satan to take life directly (only through influence on people).<br>  <br>  There are many instances of God directly taking life.  There is that unfortunate guy who steadied the ark of the covenant.  There are all those Egyptians who got killed in the plagues (including the first-born son one) and more who were drowned in the sea when they were chasing the escaping Jews and the water came down on them.<br>  <br>  But for those who believe God created life and that death is just the next step, it is not a big thing is God decides that now is a good time for somebody to move on (for whatever reason).<br>  <br>  Those who don't believe in God probably don't care what the old testament (or other holy books) says or who is reported killed by whom.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, God was giving complete protection and provision until Eve and adam accepted  Satan as their God(Gen ch 3). So all pain, sickness, suffering, wars and death are because of this. Basically humans are still following Satan who is classified as the prince of this world. This is why we can't blame God for the evil happening now. We can come back to God because Jesus paid the debt for all sin. When we accept Him he transfers his righteousness to us, This is the only way we can have eternal life here and beyond.

bae05fc0b937cc0c315763576b05e5d7aa	Yes, I grew up in a Christian home and had seven sisters (i'm the only male child in my family). My parents taught all of us kids the Bible. Any time we had questions about sex or sexuality, out came the Bible. As teenagers we were made to read proverbs 31 about what a virtuous women looked like. As a male my Dad made me read Songs of Solomon, so I would learn what it meant to love a woman. The book of Ephesians was a constant source of how to treat a lady with love as a husband. I still remember my Dad kissing my mother every day before he went to work, and the first thing he did when he got home was find Mom and give her a kiss. My parents were examples to us kids of what a loving relationship looked like practically,as well as spiritually. Dad was the Head of the house, Mom was the keeper of the home. We we all taught how to cook, clean, sew,and be responsible for ourselves and each other.Dad read the Bible every night to the whole family.We grew up having morals, and values, as well as character. These are the things I've tried to instill in my 4 children (2 boys and 2 girls ). The world is a different place than  when I grew up, But the lessons I learned from my parents,I'm handing down to my kids. Oh, by the way, I've been married for going on 26 years to the same woman, who loves God, and takes such good care of me,I thank God for her every day. Maybe, if we teach our children what's right (and correct them when they are wrong) Society wouldn't be in the mess it's in today and all this confusion about gender roles would be a thing of the past.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Mine did, but I don't think they were comfortable.<br>  <br>  You didn't say where they came from, but that may make a difference.<br>  Americans talk about sex, but are repressed about having it.

I'm still a teen, so he still answers any questions that I have.  Whether you're Christian or not, talking about sex with your kid can be very awkward.  You're looking at (what you perceive as) your fresh-faced little baby and telling them about things that most social crowds wouldn't tolerate in open conversation.  Your parents may have just been too shy in that area.  Oh well.  At least you've been intelligent enough to seek education for yourself.  A lot of kids just follow the bogus playground idea that having sex underwater keeps you from getting pregnant.|`|tmfhieP7aa	I have no religion, my dad is Jewish and my mom is Christian kind of but I will still answer your question:<br>  <br>  Nope, they never talked to my about it. But somehow I figured it out on my own and when I actually found out how things went down I was so happy because I knew what was going to go where. Anyways back to the question. I really wish my parents talked to me about it, even in middle school and high school. The thing is I have had sex, but my parents don't know and I wish they did but they seem to disregard that that sort of stuff happens at my age (18) and they like to think that I will never do that before marriage. I wish they were more open adn accepting so I could talk to them and ask questions.|`|rIvp1BToaa	I do not remember  my parents  talking to me  but  then  my mum  died  when  Iwas 11.  saying that  I do not think  I  was ever able  to talk openly with my  children  more   because they  did not want  to.  particularly  my daughter  who is now  25 and I believe still a virgin  she said  she  will not make the mistakes I made  getting pregnant at 19 and marrying an alcoholic  which  did not work out.|`|QAJ1dbDEaa	No they did not, except to say wait for marriage.  Christians are usually the worst when it comes to sex ed|`|li22L9gZaa	Well, I hope you don't mind that I'm an atheist, but I used to be a Christian and was raised in a conservative Christian home as well.  My parents never said a single word about sex to me or my siblings (that I'm aware of).  Well, my sister got pregnant out of wedlock.  I wasn't confronted with the "sex talk" until after I was out of the house (in college).  Even when I did get the sex talk, it wasn't from my parents. My mom convinced my sister to spring it on me because she didn't want to talk about it.  She only felt it was necessary because I was in my first relationship.  Oh and when we covered sex ed in middle school, my mom did not sign the permission slip, so again that information was hidden from me (not that I had much to do with it in middle school).  Suffice it to say that my parents avoided the subject at all costs, and look where that got my sister.  Luckily I have the common sense to avoid my sister's fate, but talking about sex with your children is the best thing a parent can do to prevent unwanted pregnancies and stds.  Witholding information only hurts the situation.  My advice to you is not to be "afraid" of sex.  It is not some evil horrible thing that needs to be hidden from you.  According to Christianity, it isn't the sex that is sinful, it's sex in certain contexts (outside of marriage etc.) that is sinful.  There is no sin in learning about sex.  If anything, it will better prepare you for marriage.  Do you really want to be learning the logistics and effects of sex all during your nuptial night?  Also, viewing sex in a negative light all your life can really mess with your perception of sex when you finally do get married.  You might even feel guilty having sex with your husband because of all the "sex is bad" feelings you accumulated before getting married.  Sex is a natural biological behavior that is nothing to be ashamed of, as long as it is used responsibly.|`|e4yczpKsaa	Haven't yet, probably won't for a while.|`|SGSl5yeAaa	The most my parents did (and this is mostly my step-dad) was make disgusting innuendos in my presence.

At the time He made man in His image, man was perfect too. The serpent is actually satan. Satan is an angel gone bad, he wanted the same power as God, couldn't have it, and was pretty hacked off. Adam and Eve did have wisdom, they just didn't know the difference between good and evil. The tree was for them to make a choice, God doesn't force anyone to love Him back. The serpent tempted Eve, and she fell for it because she was human. She had Adam eat some of the apple too, and then they then knew what was bad and what was good, making them imperfect. God didn't want the serpent to tempt Eve, but like He says, He doesn't want anyone to be forced to love Him, it is a choice.|`|Z1dLsDdtaa	God is perfect. God made the serpent so we would have a choice to love him instead of being forced to love him.

We had wisdom but we did not have to worry about sin because their was no sin.|`|I1FvTUapaa	The serpent that told Eve to eat that apple was Satan, who was cast down from Heaven, for his rebellion against GOD, scriptures also state that Satan was also known as Lucifer who was also GOD's favorite angle. After Eve ate that apple, she also had Adam eat it, once that happened they tried to cover theirselves up because they knew they were naked, GOD asked them how they knew that, once told they were banned from the garden. I feel that before those apples were ate being naked was about beauty, but when they had wisdom, wisdom lead to sin, such as sinful thoughts, such as lust. Let's not forget that Eve was made from Adam, thus making her is wife, so if sexual intercourse would occur it would be good and ok in GOD's eyes because the Lord feels that a man and woman should be married before intercourse but with temptations of the world today its sad to say few people follow including myself because I am not married but I ask GOD forgiveness everyday. It boggles my mind though how Satan started the rebellion against GOD in Heaven though, like how would he even think of something like that while everything is supposed to be peaceful but it did happen. We all have a choice to love and accept GOD, which isn't hard because our GOD is a loving and merciful GOD. Either way GOD's will, will be done, no matter what.

Men would draw away believers to follow them instead of Christ. (Matthew 7:15, 21-23; Acts 20:29, 30) That is why we see so many different religions that claim to be Christian. How can we identify true Christians? <br>  <br>  <br>  How can you identify true Christians? <br>  <br>  The most outstanding mark of true Christians is that they have real love among themselves. (John 13:34, 35) They are not taught to think that they are better than people of other races or skin color. Neither are they taught to hate people from other countries. (Acts 10:34, 35) So they do not share in wars. True Christians treat one another as brothers and sisters.—1 John 4:20, 21. <br>  <br>  Another mark of true religion is that its members have a deep respect for the Bible. They accept it as the Word of God and believe what it says. (John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17) They treat God's Word as being more important than human ideas or customs. (Matthew 15:1-3, 7-9) They try to live by the Bible in their everyday life. So they do not preach one thing and then practice another.—Titus 1:15, 16. <br>  <br>  True Christians love one another, respect the Bible, and preach about God's Kingdom <br>  <br>  The true religion must also honor God's name. (Matthew 6:9) Jesus made God's name, Jehovah, known to others. True Christians must do the same. (John 17:6, 26; Romans 10:13, 14) Who are the people in your community that tell others about God's name? <br>  <br>  True Christians must preach about God's Kingdom. Jesus did so. He always talked about the Kingdom. (Luke 8:1) He commanded his disciples to preach this same message in all the earth. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) True Christians believe that only God's Kingdom will bring true peace and security to this earth.—Psalm 146:3-5. <br>  <br>  Jesus' disciples must be no part of this wicked world. (John 17:16) They do not get involved in the world's political affairs and social controversies. They avoid the harmful conduct, practices, and attitudes that are common in the world. (James 1:27; 4:4) Can you identify a religious group in your community that has these marks of true Christianity?|`|MyIWPJq4aa	christians waste their entire lives trying to please some imaginary douche bag|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	Despite its social order that it brought to the Romans or whomever back in the dark ages, people have thought of the bible and the "literal word of God," a bit too literally. As a result, many innocent people have died, or been brainwashed or been sick, or other things. Now, there is hate, discrimination, miseducation, violence; the works.

Not many people have it unless it was dyed...consider yourself unique :O!|`|jV99kgWbaa	Be proud to be a redhead!!!<br>  <br>  The others are just jealous.<br>  <br>  I heard a theory presented on TV once that the reason some English people have something against red hair is that the Norse invaded the country and they were mostly redheaded.  So an aversion for red hair was apparently somehow passed down to future generations.<br>  <br>  Personally, though, I think I was right the first time. They're just plain green with envy :)<br>  <br>  Just change the words of a popular song and sing, "Don't you wish your girlfriend/boyfriend was red like me?" and laugh it off.|`|EuZXOM41aa	I think there have been tests that have shown that bright orange colours cause some people to get angry or irritated kind of like the way bulls get angry when they see the colour red.
TdKfsALAaa	It's easy to memorize anything if you do it in chunks. It would also help if you imagine, as you recite the Creed, that you are, with all conviction, telling God and whomever else would care to listen, that you believe in him and that you believe all his revelations of himself.<br>  <br>  As for the Apostles' Creed, take note that it talks about what you believe about: <br>  1) God the Father<br>  2) God the Son<br>  3) God the Holy Spirit<br>  4) The Church<br>  5) The forgiveness of sins<br>  6) The Resurrection<br>  7) Eternal life<br>  <br>  I believe in God the Father<br>  .....Almighty<br>  .....Creator of heaven and earth<br>  <br>  And in Jesus Christ<br>  .....His only Son<br>  .....Our Lord<br>  .....He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>  .................born of the Virgin Mary<br>  .....He suffered under Pontius Pilate<br>  ..........was crucified<br>  ..........died<br>  ..........and was buried<br>  .....He descended into the dead<br>  .....On the third day, He rose again<br>  .....He ascended into heaven<br>  ..........and seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty<br>  .....From there, he shall come to judge the living and the dead<br>  <br>  I believe in the Holy Spirit<br>  ..................the holy, catholic Church<br>  ..................the communion of saints<br>  ..................the forgiveness of sins<br>  ..................the resurrection of the body<br>  .......and in life everlasting.<br>  <br>  Amen<br>  <br>  Have you noticed also the story of the life of Jesus Christ summarized in there?

Saint Martha and Saint Julian the Hospitaller are two who are often mentioned. <br>  <br>  As far as I can tell, Saint Martha is more oriented toward maids and housekeepers and such, while Julian is more oriented toward actual innkeepers and people who run hotels.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Maybe that guy who put Mary and Joseph in the stable overnight, to make sure Jesus' birth was as "humble" as possible.
BUXhsFZHaa	People who are not in a sorority really can't give much of an educated opinion although they can tell you their experiences with individual members.  At most schools, each individual sorority chapter typically have around 100 members and people often make broad, sweeping assumptions about the entire membership based on their experience with only one or two members.<br>  <br>  Please take a look at the link I've provided; I encourage you to keep an open mind as you learn about sororities and then make your own decision.

Find one man or one woman, whichever you are most strongly attracted to, fall in love, and get married.|`|ij5Sv6staa	This is the R&S section, here I would advise you to pray to God to drop a gay man in your lap....perhaps Jerry Falwell is available|`|ZjSgawcpaa	Wrong section, honey.

2lim0SHvaa	Seduce him with your intelligence, charm, and animal magnetism.<br>  Str8 guys are easy to get if you flatter them.|`|qpmGLd7laa	I tried to answer this question with advice, but I've come to the conclusion that the only thing I can do is present you with possibilities that you're already aware of, I'm sure.  They are: that he's really gay, that he's curious, that he's joking, that he's awkwardly nice, ....... maybe I'm missing something...<br>  <br>  I don't know but I used to flirt with gay dudes until they started taking me seriously.  I'm straight, I just flirt with everyone who I think will not take me seriously, including married women, straight men, etc.  I guess I just think of flirting as a joke in itself.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Tell him you'd like to know him better and find out if he's comfortable with that. See if he's up for a swim, or sauna, or sleepover.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8Pbevy7laa	I would say tell him and find out, I had a similar crush on a guy in high school and I never told him or explored it. Now I'm 28 and I've always wondered what would have happened if I did. It's not good to live with things you regret so find out. If he happens to be straight then hey, at least you gave it a shot, It's far better to find out and deal with the outcome than to always be left wondering. Good luck :)|`|KPjvW0Auaa	Ask him if he's straight again.  And tell him WHY you're asking him - because you are starting to have feelings for him and that with everything you two have talked about (really enjoying YOUR company, smily faces, etc), you're getting the idea that, well, maybe he likes you too.<br>  <br>  and see how he responds...   If it's not to be, keep in mind, that's why they're called crushes.|`|11UC8GcGaa	guess what.....im gay...but i say im straight...hahaha<br>  <br>  if he is REALLY accepting i would say just tell him that you are gay...dont tell him that you have a crush on him though...if you tell him that you are gay then he will almost definately teel you once you have told him.....i had a friend who i thought was gay...and we used to act the same way you and your friend do....we even have slept together (not sex) and have hugged eachother hello and goodbye.....when i told him i was gay he was totally accepting......but he wasn't gay :(<br>  <br>  <br>  so even if he isnt gay......he may just be a great friend...just try to tell him soon so you dont get to attached ok?<br>  <br>  you dont want to fall in love and then get your heart broken....*hugs*<br>  <br>  goodluck =D|`|BcuCuWVyaa	He seems to be giving you a lot of clues. Just because he says he's straight doesn't mean he necessarily is. You might just want to ask him if he likes you. If he says no or reacts really negatively you can either (a) play it off like a joke or (b) tell him that knowing you didn't makes having a friendship with him easier. Once you know you'll feel SO much better, no matter the outcome.|`|emhfvpNMaa	depending on how long you've been talking about sex with him, jokingly or not, you may want to wait a while to tell him how you feel<br>  <br>  if he continues to say that he's straight even though he is gay, he probably is uncomfortable or insecure about his sexuality<br>  <br>  if this is the case, he most likely wouldn't be ready to be in a relationship yet with you or with anyone else<br>  <br>  but if he's flirting with you, don't look too deep into it, he probably is gay and also interested in you, but maybe not prepared to make a commitment|`|MoK5vTjWaa	In all honesty he could just be Feminine <br>  I had a friend like that once.<br>  And he was very straight.<br>  And alot of guys joke around with their friends.<br>  My boyfriend does, and I'm POSITIVE he's straight, lol.<br>  But he could be gay.<br>  Just kinda watch and see if he acts like this with other friends.<br>  Good luck:)|`|g2DRPyfPaa	It sounds like he's comfortable in his sexuality and maybe bi-curious.  I think he may want to experiment with you.  Please take it slow.  He seems like a cool dude make it worth his while, but please allow him to make the first move.  If you make the first move, he may react negatively.  Just allow it to play out naturally.  Focus on being good close friends.<br>  <br>  BTW is he hot what does he look like?  what do you look like?<br>  <br>  ---straight female who likes boy on boy action|`|yDT9k44caa	i rlly frikin hate that dude... i got friend like that in wrestling...WRESTLING....so hard to control myself.... id say go for it dude just go and talk to him start a conversation and let it slowly drop into the conversation|`|YGmmdGD4aa	Maybe hes not ready to come out yet. or maybe he really is straight... only one way to find out, step up and tell him your gay/bi|`|XJnvI64saa	*sigh* Im in the same boat. I love him so much. Just hang in there. If its meant to be, it will happen|`|IwQynLjtaa	Just ask him if he likes you!|`|777d96dc0fd85404642787620d16b927aa	He probably isn't ready to come out...so if you like this guy become really good friends with him and maybe later you should ask him, if he's interested on anyone; he might come out and say that it's you he likes ! :D lol

Giving someone the skills and resources to succeed on their own. A second chance. <br>   The middle right card represents the force drawing you towards the second possible outcome.

They come true fairly often.. such as when I told my coworker that she should stop screwing around on her boyfriend, because chances are he would find out..  He found out.<br>  <br>  I knew this because she loves to gossip,  and was ignoring him.  In a way we can all predict the future, and the better we are at memory recall and pattern recognition, the more likely we will be correct.|`|ij5Sv6staa	My predictions always come true...I knew you were going to write this as far back as yesterday.|`|JL8KpDYnaa	It's all about the cash, kid...|`|XqpRYh52aa	I knew you were going to ask that question
hj76FSKdaa	Well, part of this is purely physical and part of this is mental.   But the mental part is the sin.  For example, when I was 17 or 18, I had “wet dreams,” pretty much nightly.  It was natural and it was physical.  But when I was older, it happened less.  I hate to be blunt, but the reality on this question is what you are thinking about.  If you are thinking about something that would be sin (if you did it in reality), then it is sin.  For example, imaging sex with some woman  (or man) you saw on television or on the web is sin –- because it is not your wife or husband.  <br>  <br>  The real problem if being young is the high sex drive.  That's something you have to struggle with, less so than older folks.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Matthew 5:30<br>  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Not a word.

".get a grip"|`|P544Sbmqaa	The Bible doesnt mention it.  And the spilling on the ground thing has NOTHING to do with masturbation, so your first reply needs to go back and read that passage.<br>  <br>  The only thing relavant to masturbation is that lust is a sin and some people think it is impossible to masturbate without lusting.  <br>  <br>  It is mentally and physically healthy...  it IS possible to masturbate without lusting after someone.  I feel it is NOT a sin.|`|7cjn2u9uaa	"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might" Ecclesiastes 9:10

(Matt 24:14)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thus he would align himself with:<br>   <br>  A relatively small Christian group<br>  One unpolluted with false Babylonish doctrines<br>  One doing the same work of making his father’s name known <br>  One preaching about God's kingdom as the only hope for mankind.<br>  <br>  <br>  ergo, Jehovah’s Witnesses.<br>  <br>  Do you see anyone else giving scriptural reasons for their answers?

s9llEdf8aa	If you are close with your Mom, then tell her your beliefs. Talk about it with her, and tell her why you believe what you do. It's okay to question your faith, everybody does at some point. On the same note, you are so young... your beliefs will change again and again before you really discover who you are and what you believe.

nS7YEeP9aa	Well my fiance and I don't do a whole lot in public.  A short kiss is as far as we'd go with anyone present.  But holding hands has always been something we've done.  And heck, we hug alot of people, not just each other [although hugging each other is different].  I guess we basically feel like showing each other affection all the time.  And we don't really care who is around.  We kinda figure they can get over it? lol. Obviously we won't do anything rude in front of other people like frenching [or beyond].  But the things you listed aren't that big of a show.  So we don't really like to hide our affection just because somebody is around. <br>  <br>  We don't do it Because people are around.  We do it Regardless of whether they are around.  Hope that helps :]|`|UdatjYEQaa	i do this because i'm not afraid to broadcast my love.<br>  i'm a happy person, and i'm in love.<br>  and i don't care if the world can see it.<br>  maybe just by holding hands or kissing in public can strengthen someones faith in love?<br>  who knows.<br>  but i do know one thing,<br>  i love the person i'm with and i have nothing to hide.<br>  it's a wonderful thing to show your love with someone else, (not in a distrubing way either)<br>  it shows that are you confident and happy <br>  but most of all...<br>  in love<br>  :)|`|nkAHoiDbaa	After almost 40 years of marriage to the same wonderful guy, I am first in line to hug and kiss in public. Why?  It is a turn-on. And it is an example of true love that lasts.  I still feel like I am a young girl in love with a terrific man. Why hide it?  We are never lewd or disgusting.  I don't hang on him or French kiss in public.  But we put our hands in each others jean pockets or around each others waists when we walk. Or we just hold hands. Go for it!  But don't be too sloppy.|`|yaAhsEwxaa	i dont know but i think that if they wanna show their love for each other in public then hold hands or say i love you,,but dont rub up on each other or make out.show respect for eachother,,its annoying when they do show PDA,,kind of childish.|`|QiXiGiNZaa	Well hugging and holding hands I do that all the time!<br>  <br>  but kissing i public is just nasty.

We hold hands but, we would rather be in private for that kind of thing.

They can help you figure out if the psychic was making sense with the cards or not, and if the lady's advice was worth listening to or not.|`|wTmNCQhcaa	Why do people come in here and comment if they don't even believe in tarot cards? Do you people have a life???|`|dz5Og81Qaa	yes, it's ok|`|6t5eDPBeaa	Whether or not it's bad to talk about your reading depends on you and your friends.  Are they going to ridicule you for getting a reading done?  Do you feel guilty?  Are you excited about your reading?  If you are happy about it (or upset and need someone to talk to), and you think your friends would be willing to talk to you about it, go ahead!  There is nothing wrong about talking with someone about your tarot reading.  Tarot readings are a way to help you view yourself and the world around you.  Don't be ashamed and feel free to discuss it with whoever you want!|`|BucDukvnaa	Probably not. <br>  I like the Tarot cards as a symbolic interpretation of life, <br>  a bit of fun. <br>  Like the astrology / 12 birth signs column in the newspaper. <br>  But you are going to get some extreme answers from fundies, <br>  who seem to think it is a direct connection with ? <br>  Anyway have fun with it, and don’t take it to seriously. <br>  I don’t know what you were on about with lempias?|`|tXjYGp3taa	Please, do not go to future tellers- they cannot tell the future.

aNlT1NRqaa	I clicked out of curiosity to your beliefs and other people's answers.<br>  <br>  I wasn't going to say anything until you assumed I was close-minded & was only here to attack you.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in God, but I don't insult people who do. Most of my family is very religious, why would I insult my family?<br>  <br>  Why do you have such a nasty attitude towards atheists? Do we make you nervous?<br>  <br>  There are many close-minded and belligerent people on both sides of the issue. There is no way either of us can prove we're right until we die, so why fight over it?<br>  <br>  Lastly; eliminating atheists, who is right & going to heaven? Jews? Catholics? Protestants? Episcopalians? Muslims? Hindus?<br>  <br>  All these groups have at one time or another (including today) killed members of the other groups for being heathens. I believe if there is a God, He won't let anyone who hates others for who they are into heaven.<br>  <br>  In my close-minded atheist way, I have even given thumbs up to Christians who give intelligent, non-hateful responses. Thumbs down to the others (Christian & Atheist)|`|wnkoTEqVaa	i just click on every question i see.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	I don't believe in God... there, happy now?|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Haha, well said!<br>  <br>  Get ready for the flood of atheist answers. <_<|`|9YMLsk7Taa	I love it!!!!! You go!!!|`|AA10351261	Good posting any you are right. I agree with you 100%.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	Ironically, I clicked the link for your question while I was answering the following one:<br>  "Why do people believe in false religions?<br>  Our Savior Jesus Christ is the only person who can save us. Muslims, Buddhists, and Atheists will all go to hell if they don't believe in Jesus. Aren't they afraid of going to hell?"<br>  <br>  So atheists have the nasty attitudes? <br>  <br>  I don't really care whether you believe in god, but I do care that many of you don't seem to be able to respect any belief but your own...that, and the antipathy some Christians express for science, are the reasons I find some, but not all, Christians to be closed-minded. It is that apparent inability of some Christians to be respectful of others and the endless injection of their religious beliefs into my life, the laws governing me, and the education of my child, that I object to, not the beliefs themselves. I guess that's my version of "love the sinner, hate the sin."<br>  <br>  I clicked the link because I find the idea of addressing questions only to one particular group in a public forum to be a bit odd - and a bit off. This is not a forum for Christians only (regardless of what some Christians believe).|`|8Pbevy7laa	1. This site is denoted to religious and spirituality debate, trying to shut out one side of the argument IS being close minded.<br>  <br>  2. we don't, I only say it when I'm bombarded by scripture and nonsensical verse rather than a considered logical argument which is about 75% of the time.<br>  <br>  3. It all depends on your perspective I don't think I've got a nasty attitude, I try and consider all points of the argument and then make a considered statement. <br>  <br>  4. Atheists have as much right to be here as you, and if you don't care then why did you ask this question?|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	As a Christian gay man, I'd like to remind you that atheists aren't the ones putting measures on state ballots to take away the civil rights of law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans.  I consider treating other Americans unequally under the law much "nastier" than free speech debate on a website.  Homophobia is a sin like lying, stealing and murder.

I like thinking and philosophizing about things. I didn't come to troll your question, I wanted to see how I would answer your question.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't generalize. Not all Atheists are evil sinners, in the same way that not all Christians are bright rays of holy sunshine.|`|AA11938604	As a Christian I clicked on it because I thought you were an atheist troll trying to start something.  I thought to myself, "now what?"  I was pleasantly surprised by what I found instead.  Good job.  Now I will get "thumbs down" from the atheists who did look at your questions.<br>  <br>  Edit: It's funny.  I'm noticing that some of the atheists who DO answer your question prove point #3.<br>  <br>  Edit: Two "thumbs down" and counting.|`|axiA5mMoaa	Most are ignorant to the word of God, by trying to convince us they feel that they are already convinced. they are only fooling themselves to their own demise, that is why I continue to pray that if at least one comes to repentance it will all be worrth it for the glory of God.|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	I do it because I want to inject my point of view into the list of answers in the hope that it will be somewhat thought provoking and help play a part in that persons eventual deconversion. that would be nice. Interjecting what I feel is more rational. <br>  I have read the bible and been a christian for more than 2 decades. my youth was robbed by it, now I want to use that info for some good. <br>  you may call me a swine.|`|64d4971b423834237e69be41acf11cc9aa	Because Jesus said people will hate Him and us because of Him.

It bears repetition .<br>  <br>  I don't get upset you amuse me . Why are you upset ?|`|n3Ylo56Waa	*grins* You got me! <br>  <br>  Though, technically, I'm agnostic. <br>  <br>  As for my reason for clicking on it: I like seeing what people are asking when they call out to a specific group. I've looked at ones for Muslims and Buddhists too. Usually these kind of questions are offensive. <br>  <br>  Sort of like this one.<br>  <br>  Over all, you mention that a lot of atheists on the site are rude. True. But there are plenty of them out there ready to give an honest answer without bashing your faith. When you go on the offensive like this you're only setting yourself up for more "nasty attitudes" and remarks.<br>  <br>  I do have a serious question that I'd like you to at least think about even if you don't want to answer it. <br>  <br>  Have *you* ever gone to a question that reads "Atheists only..." or something along those lines? <br>  <br>  Have you read the offensive responses and questions religious people give? There are just as many rude religious (I'm not going to single any religion out here) people on this site as there are atheist. Just look at the responses of a lot of religious people that you got from this question, for example. <br>  <br>  Atheists could easily ask: <br>  <br>  1- Why do you keep trying to force your beliefs on me?<br>  <br>  2- Why do you keep saying I'm wrong and use holy references against what I personally believe/think?<br>  <br>  You're only looking at one side of this. In those questions you typed you have made it a war between the Christians and the atheists. You've become as close-minded as the atheists who have mocked you. You've put atheists into a single category; and even if you haven't, you've made it appear that way. <br>  <br>  There will always be the trolls. They jump out from under bridges and eat goats and we cannot stop them. <br>  <br>  Don't be a troll.

sZFLtCbdaa	The definition of a senior citizen is rather stretched. Some organizations begin that number at 50 (as in AARP) some will say 55. Others if giving a senior citizens discount at a coffee shop will say 60. Either way, I am already entrenched as a senior citizen. I ask for my coffee discount when I'm low on cash.<br>  Some of the best movies were those prior to the 70's. I will go as far back as the 40's in black and white.|`|QdKvj3Exaa	bcptm ~ you are correct. Forums are open to anyone. But, just like atheists answer spiritual questions (go figure), it is puzzling that a non senior citizen would be interested in posting here.<br>  You certainly can and will learn a lot from Seniors. We have lived long and should be wiser, if not smarter, than the youth. We have seen things that you will never see and do things you may never do.<br>  To the asker, that is just how it is. This is not a closed forum. If I were young I would probably be on here also. I have been in forums that I "don't belong" just to learn. So, let's just be nice and answer their questions and have patience. They will be "us" soon enough and we may not be here to talk to them.|`|wnsFO3GCaa	Actually the encyclopedic definition of a senior is one of old age. Old age is normally considered to be 65 or older in Western countries. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age</a><br>  <br>  That aside, this section is for answering questions pertaining to senior citizens. The only age restriction on Y!A is that you must be 13 to participate. If you are over the age of 13 you have the right to participate in any category on this site. Since questions about senior citizens can be extended to all citizens, it makes this one of the best places to be ; )<br>  <br>  EDIT: I didn't say pre 1970s movies weren't good.

Some people can hear much higher and lower tones than others, but nowhere is there an age differential.<br>  <br>  Some people can hear the dog whistles that most people cannot hear.  The very high db are heard by some people / adults and some people can't hear them.  The more damage a person has to their hearing, the more their hearing is hindered.

jM7CyxQzaa	The Pentagram is a five pointed star, if it's a five pointed star within a circle then it's a Pentacle - not exactly the same thing although a lot of people confuse one with the other.<br>  <br>  The Pentagram dates back to ancient times, that is it goes back to Mesopotamia (3500 BCE as it's earliest recorded use) and has been in use by various cultures ever since, the Greeks considered it to be a 'symbol of perfection' and the Pythagoreans considered it a symbol of the human being (if you imagine a man standing with arms and legs outspread his head would be in the top point and the rest of the symbol would be where his limbs would be - I believe Leonardo Da Vinci painted this and if you're in the UK you may remember it in use on the tv programme 'world in action' opening credits) <br>  <br>  The Jews used it to represent the five points of the Pentateuch and Truth.<br>  <br>   It was also in use by the christians to represent the Five Wounds of Christ, but fell out of use in favour of the 'star' as seen on christmas cards and the like - basically it is a symbol that has had many meanings and continuous use for millenia.<br>  <br>  Nearly every use of this symbol has one connection though, it is generally seen as an amulet of symbol of power and protection. Several different uses have been associated with the five points (as mentioned above) and in our current age this symbol has come to represent Pagan beliefs, notably Wicca. This is because the Pentacle and Pentagram are found in a magical grimoire called the 'key of Soloman' which is a book dating back to medieval times, it gives details of various magical talismans and symbols one of which is this one. This symbol was used by the Golden Dawn and other Magical orders that Gerald Gardner used some of the teachings of when he created Wicca back in the early fifties.<br>  <br>  Within Wicca the five points represents the four Elements- that of Earth, Air, Fire and Water plus the fifth element 'Spirit', hence they are woven together within a continous line (within wicca often (tho not always) the lines of the pentagram are woven rather than drawn over each other ala celtic knotwork) and are used to mean that all things are connected.<br>  <br>  It is also a protective symbol (especially used as a Pentacle) and has been used as such also for millenia. Wiccans also use it to represent Power on the alter (again as a pentacle) it is the 'Seat of Power' on their Altar, and is treated with reverence according to it's use which is to 'charge' items that need it, or whatever work needs doing.<br>  <br>  The symbols is most often seen with one central point upwards, within Wicca if the point is down then that means Second Degree Initiation (the pentacle is also much used within the Initiation system of True British Traditional Wicca as opposed to Popular WIcca which is what most people use to mean Wicca - ie solitary practice) it's meaning in this position is 'going within' or 'facing the dark night of the soul' In other words facing up to your fears.<br>  <br>  This 'upside down' symbol is also used to represent the Baphomet the Goat Headed God, the points represent the head, ears and horns of Baphomet the goat headed god with the top two points the horns, the next two the ears and the single point downwards the long pointed goat face. Baphomet himself is not particularly 'bad' he dates back to first mention in the time of the Crusades.<br>  <br>  There is some thinking that the name 'baphomet' actually comes from Mohammed and is a corruption of that name that originated with people who did not know how to pronouce Mohammed correctly, again it was the time of the Crusades and came into use to mean Knights Templar who had been on crusade for a long time and had come to use some Islamic systems in worship. (they were there to Convert the Unholy to Christianity'  so you can see why using the Islamic beliefs would be so frowned upon - in reality they probably came to realise that Islam was not as 'bad and evil' as they had been led to believe and so they were more open minded towards it)<br>  <br>  (check out Wikipedia for some more info on this one)<br>  <br>  Anyhow then a guy called Eliphas Levi wrote a book called Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (dogma's and ritual of High Magic) and he used Baphomet a lot in this publication. From here the God was used eventually to mean satanism (The Goat head came to represent the 'devil')and hence the Five Pointed Star (in an upside down position) came to be associated with Satanism, the fact that not everyone knows why it's used as it is for any belief system means that a lot of people will associate ANY five point star with Satanism. In fact as some people are afraid of 'The Occult' (translation 'hidden, unseen knowledge) all uses of the Five Pointed Star are treated with fear and loathing. This is also why some non magical people decide to use the symbol for their own use, as in the case of this band and also the Gothic culture and fashion. It's a symbol guarenteed to get a reaction! a marketing ploy for this band I would say.|`|BvY47ts6aa	In the ancient times when it was considered very hard to divide a circle into 5 equal parts, they have a secret society of wise men who holds the secret formula on how it is done. Anyone who holds that symbol was therefore considered a member of the circle of the wise. Another symbol which holds an important degree in the ancient times was the heptagram, a seven-pointed star, also called sometimes "elven star".|`|qsY57rnVaa	well my experience with it is pagan, the earth, wind, water, fire, spirit, learned that from my pagan roommate, i could not tell you which point means what.  but no it is not satanic or anything, feel free to wear it|`|mjQhyQktaa	No, nothing satanic.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	No. <br>  <br>  <br>  One point up it is the 5 elements. Head and heart over body. Making good decisions.<br>  <br>  2 points up it means body over mind, only used in sex and should be in moderation|`|cTKrByOzaa	Sue's answer is bang on the money although she did miss out the pentagram used on the shield and heraldry of the Arthurian Knight Gawain which represented the five Knightly virtues.<br>  <br>  Anyway you seem to have confused a pentagram with a heartagram. The band HIM use a symbol called a heartagram in which two of the five points are rounded to create a heart shape.

However, a big part of it are also the people.  Even someone's own ethnic group/people for example because they actually are buying into it.  The truth is there are neutral (a common voice/style for all) singers and bands meant for everyone to share, but then there are the bad stereotype kinds who are not neutral in looks and music, and they portray damaging and self-defeating images.  You have to choose your forms of entertainment and models wisely.

(Matthew 16:28)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Most Christians do not realize that Jesus' promise of his second coming did not apply to our generation or to a future generation, but only to the generation of his time. Also, Jesus said in Rev. 3:11: "Behold I come quickly..."<br>  <br>  Those poor people of early Christianity! They thought the texts got written for them, yet Jesus never fulfilled his promise.<br>  <br>  Two thousand years have rolled by and yet many "true" believers still await his "quick" return. As any school child knows, anyone who does not keep promises does not deserve our trust, much less our admiration.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, to believe in a second coming and the end of the world gives no reason to feel concerned about the long-term future of Earth. Why should we care about the environment, wars, or suffering if we believe that the world will come to an end soon and that everything will get taken care of in heaven?|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Yes!!<br>  <br>  (I just had to say that once haha)|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Yes..were all DOOMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	God alone knows the future, not man.|`|3uscldalaa	From what i've heard YES!<br>  If you are Christan an believe and God and were good in your life time you go to Heaven and get to look upon every who were not saved. The people that remain on earth are then identified with a number that is 90 numbers long in a microchip. This microchip will be implanted into every human that was not saved. No money will exist everything will pretty much be non-existent. Supposedly Europe will come as one and rule the earth (this won't be Obama...He is NOT the anti-Christ!!!!!)  Everything that is happening in the world right now like the economic mess is all leading up to the world's end. The lack of money which is the recession that we are currently undergoing, Global Warming (Islands are already starting to go under the sea!!), the first black president (Obama!!!)...There are many more things that are happening that is all leading to what will happen in 2012. I get goosebumps every time I think of it because I don't know what to believe.<br>  If this really does happen and anyone who is not saved, DO NOT TAKE the microchip. It is a 666 microchip and that is the number of the devil. It will eventually kill you. And if you don't except it you will die anyways because you have no way of living. Basically you're doomed so be good in your life!!<br>  Another thing, the ones that are saved and go to heaven, won't know there mother as their mother, or their friend as their friend. They will just no that they care for this person but have no relation to them.<br>  Is this true or not!? NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE.

On Dec 21, 2012 (or Dec 19, 2012 depending on which calculator you are using) the date will again be 13.0.0.0.0. To the naive, this may mean that the "world is ending".

aO4iCwtoaa	Shifra means beautiful, or lovely  - There are many girls' names that mean this (Belle and Bella are probably the most common)  - I suggest going to a baby name site and looking there for examples.<br>  <br>  Yocheved (English spelling is generally Jochebed) means glory of G-d.  Gloria is probably the closest English name<br>  <br>  While some Biblical scholars say they are the same woman, the actual Bible text does not.  If you are trying to specifically make reference to Moses's mom, I would steer clear of using Shifra since the association is only in midrash (rabbinic commentary) and the allusion you're trying to draw would be less clear.<br>  <br>  Even though the names sound unusual, in the Jewish community they are both fairly common.

cd2etz5Raa	The thing about purity rings is that they're about YOU. Sure, they're a public statement of what you believe in, but it's mostly about YOU and reminding yourself of what you stand for, whatever it may be. Whether it's "wait until marriage" or "wait for the right time"<br>  <br>  I can't honestly say that I have a link for you, but what I'd like to say is that since purity rings are about you, then you don't really have to go out and buy a $300 ring. Just a cheap, $10 ring would do nicely. Would the extra $290 do anything to enhance your commitment and make it better? No, but it wouldn't make your wallet or bank account unhappy. <br>  <br>  Take care!!! :)|`|7ylYxklsaa	I'm pretty sure that they don't have some wacky magic spell on them that makes you wait.

Single people should be celibate.<br>  2. Married people should be faithful to each other (adultery is wrong).<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church recognizes the power of sex when it teaches, "Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul."<br>  <br>  Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person. A chaste person's body and spirit lives in unity and opposes any behavior that would impair that unity.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is contrary to the human dignity of the person, anyone about whom the person has lustful thoughts, and the dignity of human sexuality.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 2352 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.shtml#2352" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Technically, no, it isn't. The Bible doesn't say anything about masturbation being sinful, in fact it doesn't say anything about masturbation at all.<br>  <br>  What it DOES say is that one, adultery is sinful, and two, thinking lustful thoughts about someone who isn't your spouse is equivalent to committing adultery in your mind. So if you think lustful thoughts about anyone who isn't your spouse, that's a sin. So apparently, from the christian God's point of view, you can jack off all you want, just so long as you aren't imagining so-and-so naked while you're doing it...or any other time, for that matter.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Does it matter?<br>  <br>  Personal pleasure [as long as it harms no one] > Dogma|`|q57P8uJbaa	I have thought about this before and came up with this scripture, quoting Jesus, which seems to give the answer.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:28 (New International Version)<br>  28But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br>  <br>  ...now masturbation goes even beyond just looking at a woman lustfully.|`|APjnSYKuaa	The Bible basically defines adultery as involving a man and another man's wife only.

That's a bit of a no-no, and could certainly be considered a form of adultery.<br>  <br>  The physical act of pleasuring yourself? In my mind, it's not adultery at all.  Like many things in life it's about intent.|`|PEUwnGHraa	When you are committing masturbation, what are you thinking of?

Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet that is what some of YOU were. <br>  ------------------|`|AA10858522	If you are a christian it is a sin to be attracted to anybody in any kind of way according to what Jesus supposedly said:<br>  'You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart'" (Matt. 5:27-28, NIV). <br>   Sexual attraction is instinctive behavior, sexual desire is just that as well.

Now if we are talking about the present, that they hate people from other color, then I wouldn't blame you|`|vYAgIMLdaa	Can you be racist and know its wrong at the same time?<br>   Sure,  it doesn't stop anybody from hating though.|`|s5XNGbOMaa	I'm NOT racist. You have no reason to hate most of the white population. They are people like you who want to be accepted and to live happy, healthy lives. Why can't people look past the color of one's skin? It is so immature and superficial. Base people on the "content of their character" (MLK).

SPQdFOwKaa	It would be called "Life is Fabulous But Sometimes It Can Get Pretty Exhausting" and the plot would pretty much be that of a gay boy being raised in a home where homosexuality isn't quite acceptable. There would also be fights and school bullying but also love and one particular guy who changed the main character's life for ever. It would be filled with alternative rock songs and I'd love it if Ewan McGregor was starring in it!|`|kavhzTXgaa	Be True, Be Happy<br>  <br>  It would be about a girl who did everything she could to be hetero, but then realized that its okay to be a lesbian.

They fall in love despite the obstacles (a psychotic ex, the young woman coming out of the closet, a religious parent, an abusive, drug- ravaged parent, an anti-gay atmosphere, meddling friends).  But they come together and get married, and their relatives show up for the event, accepting the younger woman and the lesbian marriage.|`|sqnSe9FEaa	I think that the musical of my life would be called "The Most Boring Musical You'll Ever Watch."

c3MFIbeUaa	It is another sign of the dividing of the church.<br>   One cannot believe in creation  and evolution as non confliction of terms.<br>  And still be a Christian and believing in the Bible as whole Truth.<br>   It is the church trying to appease the masses that have been brainwashed to accept what is taught falsely in schools. However since schools never allow for a rebuttal point of view to evolution, kids accept that falsehood as truth.<br>   This only shows that churches that change their doctrine to appease people really accept nothing as truth.<br>   Therefore the vatican is stating their founding beliefs were wrong from the beginning.<br>   I suspect money to be the prime suspect of this change in heart by the church.<br>   What pray tell will it be next?<br>   The actual Divinity of JESUS CHRIST himself?<br>   Macro evolution is not the same as micro evolution because macro implies life is created from single cells.<br>   Micro evolution is more of adapation of dog species from a single species of dog.<br>   GOD created life to adapt not evolve from a single amoeba cell.That would discount the bible.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Some believe in creation but believe there is some evidence of evolution too at the same time.  But I would be astonished if the pope believed in the whole theory of evolution because that would certainly contradict the Bible.  We didn't come from the apes and certainly not from amoebas or microscopic organisms.|`|WalnRzfGaa	you can believe it, but you can also believe that pigs have wings and fly.<br>  <br>  Evolution is directly contradictory to Genesis. there is no way it can be literally interpreted and still work with evolution.<br>  <br>  if you cant take the Bible as literal truth then why take it as any truth?|`|A01w1dHqaa	It's an allegory, a story, a parable. It's how people explained things back then. Someone hooked it up to the family tree of Jesus and people thought it  really happened.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Believe Genesis Creation as what?  Nice stories that teach about the relationship of Man to his world (and by extension, God) using the mythological framework of the communities they grew up in?  Or believe it as physically occuring upon the geological earth?<br>  <br>  Or is it your contention that people should pretend to believe something they can clearly see is superstitious story-telling techniques?<br>  <br>  It seems to me you Christians would be a lot more effective and convincing if you'd all stop playing King of the Hill with who you think is the "better Christian" by the amount of literal garbage they are willing to eat.|`|vxSXsn59aa	Perhaps the Vatican takes a more mature and enlightened view of the bible than you do. Biblical scholars and other serious theologians agree that Genesis should be read as allegory, not history. If you insist upon literalism, then you can't accept both the bible and evolution. If you are willing to read Genesis as allegory, or metaphor, then you can easily accommodate both views, like the majority of christendom does.<br>  <br>  "You can take the bible literally, or you can take it seriously."|`|AA11058044	The Vatican, through a papal bull of 1983, has stated that in Catholic belief, the story of Genesis is to be taken as allegory, and not literal truth.  It is quite possible to believe in the moral or message of a story with believing that the whole things is literally true.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	The Vatican is an Independent Sovereign State and the pope is the head of it.  And yes the pope should believe in the Bible.  They just translate it differently then you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  "I'm not too up on the Catholic church. So please help me out here".  <br>  <br>  For not being "up on the Catholic church" you and the rest of the SFECU sure spew alot of hatred towards them.

Both theologians and scientists make mistakes, change their minds, and even occasionally perpetrate falsehoods for the sake of their own reputations.

If God wants to include an evolutionary process, he can. The Vatican is not saying that we come from monkeys, or that it supports such a belief. It continues to hold that we came from a single set of parents and the soul does not and cannot ever evolve. The soul is infused in each human being at conception. <br>  <br>  What the Catholic Church refuses to do, is confine and limit God to our personal interpretation of scripture. She only says that a belief in evolution does not conflict with a belief in God. Because God is much greater than we are and has all of creation to work with.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	It all depends if you care whether what you believe is true or not.  <br>  You can certainly reconcile them if you try (god created the world and then evolution went on from there), but why try?  Why not just say, "Look, I'm going to choose to believe in what the bible says because I want to.  I'm not interested in making it fit with scientific fact."    That would be the most honest approach, and you can stop worrying about getting mythology and science to match.<br>  Edit:  JC, so you're saying the creation of the world had nothing to do with science?  That's only theology?  No, you're trying to have it both ways, and you just can't, unless you're willing to completely ignore logic and fact--which it looks like you're most willing to.   But please don't carry on like you're making any sense or that such an attitude is anything to be proud of.|`|sJegUB11aa	The catholic church is led by the pope who lives in the vatican, which is in Rome, yet independent of Italy.<br>  <br>  At least the catholics and mainstream protestants agree that some statements in the bible are a mystery.  That is better than keeping yourself in the dark ages with literal fundamentalism.|`|pgn2eSpwaa	The theory of Evolution explains the changing nature of living things, but does not resolve the how it all started question effectively<br>  <br>  we can see mutations and variations which provide a positive advantage to certain individuals in their survival, and some faults that make it tougher for some to survive, so natural selection is at work (we try to combat that with artificial supports, but eventually those systems collapse and organisms cease to be viable in the present earth. <br>  <br>  The creation story seems to say that God took the primordial ooze (MUD/Clay) and formed it into a complex structure, and then differentiated it from other complex structures (the plants and animals)<br>   <br>  Evolution appears to support that the higher complexity of structure and function give the organism more ability to adapt to circumstances in it's environment, meaning MAN is likely to survive above all other non-sentient life, and can reason and deduce ways to overcome the forces of nature and the attacks of untamed creatures, etc (Have Dominion over them...)<br>  <br>  one can say that neither account is perhaps completely independent of the other, not does one negate the other.|`|iY6GQsRUaa	NOPE.<br>  <br>  Unlike many of my fellow atheists I don't give religious organizations freedom to change their beliefs or make them conform to modern science or reshuffle the deck. In my view, this is the main problem with religion. If you EVER rejected science under the pretenses or auspicions of your own conceited infallibility, then you ALWAYS reject it. The motives are revealed (that they accept or reject it based on the implications for their power base - therefore I reject their authority to either accept or reject science).|`|ZToZCLNBaa	According to the scriptures, The earth was created in 6 literal days. <br>  This is clear by the repetitive usage of the terms "and the evening and the morning ..."<br>  and the usage of the hebrew term "Yom" meening a regulare 24 hour day.|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	I 100% believe in the Creation Account. <br>  <br>  I believe that Evolution has occured and is occuring.  <br>  <br>  I rely on Science for Scientific information and I rely on the Bible for Theological Information.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	Sort of.<br>  Genesis explains the creation of life and evolution explains the diversity of life.

JXMpZiwxaa	To a large degree, yes. But they can regain faith by praying the rosary.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles.

J5zj8dWRaa	Say "I'm sorry, could you please speak a little slower".  That will save you both a lot of embarrassment by saying "what" all the time, and making her repeat everything 10 times.  People are usually understanding in a situation like that.<br>  <br>  As for your additional details... "English people speak English the way it's supposed to be spoken"...?????  So, you're saying that people from other English-speaking countries are somehow inferior to people from Great Britain?  That's pretty insulting to the citizens of those other countries - Ireland, Scotland, America, Canada, Australia, etc.  It's also insulting to the people who expended the energy to learn English as another language.  (Wouldn't you feel insulted if you spent time learning Spanish, just to have a Spaniard tell you "you're not speaking right, you wasted your time, go back to speaking just English"?)|`|swNHGx1baa	I would advise you to blame it on yourself, such as something like this:<br>  "I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you - My hearing isn't very good."<br>  I suppose that is the best way to do it. It doesn't offend the person who you're talking to.<br>  Good luck!|`|rThIVk2maa	Yeah, it is a bit awkward... but there's little you can do aside from what you did.

Could you speak a little slower please?  I think I'll be able to get everything you're saying that way.".<br>  <br>  I deal with alot of folks from India and this seems to be a polite approach to the topic.  I usually find that if the person slows down their speech, then I can understand them better.  After about a week or two of listening to them, I can understand the person quite well, even if they return to normal speed.|`|faHWQYMIaa	if we have to learn to understand colloquialisms from english people who can barely speak their own language dont you think it in the spirit of neighbourly goodwill to try to learn how to understand those who dont have south east english accents?|`|0F8hauikaa	I've been in that situation more than once. You just have to explain "I'm sorry but I'm having trouble understanding your English. Is there someone else I can speak to?"

Over the corse of these some-odd 200 years or so, American have created their own dialect, and if not their own language that stemmed from English. Just as in any other English Speaking Country like Australia, we have our own Accent and our own slang with our own dialect to the English Language.  Americans speak English the American way, Australians speak English the Australian way, The English, speak English the English way(in terms of being from England, being English or British if you will).  Just take a look at the many and various spanish speaking nations of the world. They each have adapted the Spanish language to their own style.  Yes, if you go to let's say Peru, they speak Spanish, but at the same token, they also Speak Peruvian-Spanish with the Peruvian Dialect.  The Same goes for all Spanish Speaking countries.  Spain and Spanish people speak Spanish the way the Spanish people from Spain would.  People from Hispanic* countries speak Spanish but in their own dialects, accents, and with their own slang of the language of which they have adapted to their own liking which has become their very own version of that language.  Just like the Canadians and French, they speak it they way Canadians do, not exactly like the French of France do.  Same goes for Italian speaking regions in Africa like Tunisia, They speak Italian the way they do in their own dialect, not just how the italians from italy do.

tC1hF1y5aa	Many "Christians"  find themselves in a position of judgment on others, especially those whose "degree of Christianity" differs from their own.  Being judgmental is not a "christian" behavior.  We all have the power and right to choose what we believe - but some think that they are the only ones who have chosen correctly, thereby giving them the right to condemn.  They are so wrong.|`|AA11364538	We will all be judge one way or the other, and hate when people use that passage as it they are not judging those who are judging.  The truth hurts sometimes.  I agree that no one is 100% correct, there are flaws and errors in Christian doctrine there is no doubt about that.  However there are vast difference between the doctrine of Christains and those of the JWs and Mormons.  Just the simple idea of who Jesus really is can be strongly debated on all sides, and if they can't even agree with Christians, on a simple docternal issue, then there are bound to be other conflicts.  No, they do not choose to eb wrong, but they are.  Just like a child doesn't choose to be wrong when the answer math problems, but they are.  There is a truth, yes, we misunderstand, abuse, and get things wrong, but that is no excuse for Christians, JWs, and Mormons, to not live up to the standard that is presented in the Bible.|`|t88527U1aa	One thing to debate doctrine its quite another to dent the deity of Jesus Christ as God in flesh,God in Spirit,God when major issues as basic fundamental doctrine of Christianity it is a mandate to speak to these cult followings!|`|1ehmRBruaa	They believe those religions are cults.

A truw person right with God should not be making fun of anybody, the verse you are aking about does not say that it is okay to judge others, it states that you have no right to judge anybody lest God judge you.  <br>  <br>  "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with that measure you mete, it shall b measured to you again. And why beholdest thou mote that is in thy brother eye but considerith not the beam that is in thine own eye?" Matthew 7:1-3<br>  <br>  So see God said do not judge others otherwise you will be judged, for the people that are judging other you should pray for them, and it is the Mormon and Jehoa Witness choice to be in their religion just like anybody else, instead of judging them the christians should be setting an example or inviting them to their church<br>  <br>  God bless|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	We are all free moral agents and we all choose our religion.<br>  Most persons who pick on people in other religions grew up in  their religion and have never studied other religions and so know nothing usually of the bible or of other religions.<br>  Having a lack of moral fiber find it easier to pick on ones who do have.|`|pqveENjUaa	Because the beliefs that make the Mormons and Jehovas Witnesses separate from mainstream christianity are so different from the mainstream views that the Christians are convinced that they are severely flawed in their logic and must be stopped.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Because their ideas are ridiculous, and they are just blind followers of a cult.

I take issue with that stance and will challenge it every time I have a chance.<br>  <br>  edit: I offer as exhibit A the answer given by VC.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	The admonition that Christians should "judge not" doesn't mean that we can't form opinions.  I don't know of any Christians that "pick on" Mormons and JWs, but those of use who understand the Bible know that those two groups who claim to be Christians are really NOT Christians as structured by the Bible.  But I have no idea where you got the idea that those groups are NOT purposely choosing their path.  But if they can't see the value and exclusivity of the traditional Christian Bible, and choose to not follow that Bible, then how can you say they are NOT "purposefully choosing the wrong path."  At least they should stop trying to call themselves Christian.  Maybe they have a "correct path" to salvation - fine - just stop trying to convince people they are Christian.|`|WwCBomTMaa	This is a very harsh world, with almost every religion thinking that theirs is the one true religion. I am a Christian and know that I am not without sin. "Only those without sin may cast the first stone". I do my best to practice what I preach and know that God created this world full of diversity. In Revelations it talks about God's 7 churches. Now it's just a matter of figuring out which 7 religions are God's religions. Those that follow him and do not lead others astray by being false prophets are alright in my book. It's a matter of loving your neighbor as yourself, no matter their religion.|`|z74a7wvlaa	These cults teaches that Jesus is not God.

When I consider soul winning, I get a little bit turned off from the word itself, and there is a reason why.  The Lord did not see Himself  as winning people to Himself, but more of presenting Himself to them as the Bread of Life, as the Living Water as the Resurrection and the Life.  He lived His life on the earth to minister to the needs of others, from thier most desperate spiritual need for a Savior and Shepherd to even taking care of their physical hunger as they followed Him while He taught and preached the Word of God.<br>  <br>  If someone comes up to me and tells me that " I need to save your soul"  I am not sure how I would take that. And many times, if we present the gospel in this way, in a ' soul winning' driven way, then I am not sure how appealing and effective it is.  <br>  <br>  I personally prefer " lifestyle evangelism"<br>  With this lifestyle evangelism, I have found that it requires some shepherding.  It is not good enough to " deliver and give spiritual birth to a new one in the Lord" and then leave that little one on its own to fend for itself. <br>  Not all kinds of gospel sharing may lead to follow up shepherding, but whenever at all possible, there should be the care of this young one in the Lord after you have shared Christ as the gospel to them.<br>  If this is a lifestyle of evangelism, then there will be " remaining fruit"<br>  For me, lifestyle evangelism begins where we live.  Do our neighbours " See" this Christ being lived out from us?  What of our co-workers or our school mates? Is our day to day life and its living a way for the Lord to be manifested in us AS the gospel?<br>  <br>  Many people, and I am sure that most of our gospel friends that participate in this forum are more impressed with lifestyle evangelism that they are of ones trying to " win their souls"<br>  <br>  I have yet to see this kind of method used by the Lord. People were drawn to His very Person. From Tax collectors to Prostitutes, to Rich young men and Priests like Nicodemus, people from all walks of life were drawn to this Godman because of the way He lived. From His mouth flowed words of Spirit and Life.  This to me, is a pattern  for us. And lifestyle evangelism also affords us the blessing of shepherding these young ones.. becuase like a nursing mother, in order to give food to your little one, you yourself need to feed.  So there are the benefits on both sides.<br>  <br>  Ty for this awesome post sister<br>  Yours in Christ<br>  sandy<br>  <br>  Add.. sista.. I really enjoyed your sharing. amen!|`|2bC0dvPKaa	We should try to help people toward truth.

Certainly I have no problem about teaching someone *about* other religions.  When I deemed them old enough, I might permit them to choose which sect of Christianity they prefer.  I would require some sound reason for switching sects (something more persuasive than, "this really hot chick goes to church there").  However, I would (of course) hold "veto" power if the sect proved inappropriate in some way (teaching non-Christian doctrine or untrustworthy).  If a child of mine wants to leave Christianity for some other religion, they would have to leave home first.  I can foresee, at some age, if they reject Christianity that I should not force them to "go through the motions" - but I would also not permit them to attend non-Christian religious services while still under my guardianship.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I do allow mine to choose their own.<br>   <br>  My method is C, they learn about all and I allow them to go in the direction they want to go in.<br>  <br>  We are a religiously blended family so it just seems wrong to force any one of them to beleive a specific thing.

The honest truth is and was what we did with our children because we adopted trans racial children - Russian, Arab, African,Spanish, Japanese, Greek and 3 from my womb born in USA. We started out with our belief system of Christianity in their formative years to about age 12 when we introduced not only their religion to them but also each culture religion was discussed around the dinner meal every night.  We even discussed other religions around the world that none of them had ties to. As parents we believe that knowledge is power so the more we inculcated our 9 children to these concepts the better we felt that we were adding to their power base of education.  They were all raised as Christians till the first child was 12 then we started talking around the dinner table other cultural religious beliefs.  They were told that they could study and learn immediately about their cultural faith but we would take them to our Christian church until they graduated high school then if they elected to follow a different cultural faith then we would embrace it as a family. So in theory we did A, B, & C! We never insisted the children attend church it was just our wonderful luck that as a family we filled the pews with 11 people every Sunday.  We are a family of 1-Islam faith, 1-Greek Orthodox and 9 Christians.  We did insist that each child spend 3 months soaking up the culture abroad while 1 parent accompanied them.  My USA babies were allowed to select a country they wanted to visit so they would not feel left out!  One of my darlings decided to go to Israel because they wanted to walk the Via Dolorosa which is latin for way of grief or suffering- it was the walk that Jesus took on this way to his crucifixion. Plus we visited many historical land marks mentioned in the Bible. <br>  <br>  We are proud and happy for all the choices made and clearly embrace the choice of each of our children.|`|c1yfnzuVaa	Since I'm an atheist...

They are adults now and can follow whatever religion they want. My wife would prefer they continue Christian beliefs.<br>  <br>  You can be non-religious bringing up children. They will most likely remain non-religious when they get older.  <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|jinAwMGNaa	I believe C is the correct answer.  As science is making exponential discoveries in the Universe, facts about all religions could radically change.  Mankind is the most Intelligent species on Earth, but on a Universal Scale, Mankind is still in the Womb.  Personally, I believe The 10 Commandments are basic and Universal rules of intelligent species survival. Those that do not at least try to live by those rules, whether religious or not, will eventually self destruct and become extinct.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	I took them to 4 different christian churches, for a few years each then to a synagogue once,   and handed them the qur`an to read. they are all atheists, and were before I was.

I continued to take my children to different churches (just about every religion including Lutheran) though their early childhoods-preteen years, then I stopped going because I wasn't going to force them to go like my mother did with me. They are all grown now. Two believe in God and one is doubting, but it's their choice. I don't believe in forcing religion on anyone. I'm actually becoming a non-believer myself these days. <br>  <br>  I think it's generally good to teach your children right from wrong and give them knowledge of religioins...not just one religion....then let them choose.|`|JOVWBOOCaa	C for sure! My mother was pentacostal and my dad is catholic, we would go to both of their churches occasionally but for the most part went to a methodist church.

On the other hand, if you can make it to adulthood without falling into one of their traps then you most likely never will.  Perhaps we need some laws on the books to make indoctrinating anyone under 18 years of age into one of these mind control cults a form of child abuse.|`|E71jweytaa	A with a variant, if they choose to leave before 18 its there right, but I will raise them catholic.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I will be doing option D: let him explore and learn in his own time. I will certainly tell him of religion in general. But I won't teach him about each and every one. Firstly I don't believe I know enough about a large number of the world's religions to be able to do them justice. And I would feel it was unfair and manipulative to only teach him of one or two, and leave the rest out or only cover them briefly. And I also don't feel that he needs to be part of ANY religion if he doesn't want to be, and I would feel that teaching him about the religions in any depths would appear to a child, not only confusing, but pressuring them to need to pick between them, as opposed to giving them the opportunity to find their own way in life and decide whether or not they want to be religious at all. I personally developed my own beliefs in my late teens. They don't conform to a specific religion, but I'm happy in my beliefs and I don't wish I'd been pushed into anything sooner. I have no problem with letting my son find his own way in the same way, and anything he asks me ever, I will tell him (or research and then tell him) about.|`|vx4QvCosaa	I think, they have aright when they get older.

No matter what blacks did they never received equal anything, anything reserved for blacks was trashy and of low quality.  They knew the only was intergration.  Also, whites began to see that young black kids were learning faster than the white kids.  Mind you, the black kids were taught in smalll over crowded schoolhouses with no ventalation or accomodations.  They also had to share used books from the white schools.  When the southern govts saw that the black teachers were teaching the hell out of those books and the kids were surpassing white students, they knew they had to put an end to it.  Blacks were intergrated and white teachers began screwing with them.  All of a sudden they were special ed!  The black teachers taught them properly because they felt a responsibility, these kids were in their neighborhood, they knew their families.  <br>  <br>  This is a good point.

Who wants to keep a ring from a broken engagement anyway?  An engagement ring is given in anticipation of marriage.  When that marriage doesn't happen, that contract is essentially broken and the rings must be returned.  This is a special case because the guy invested money in the rings as well.

nEc0L0MRaa	No love spell on another person will work.  The nature of magic will defeat the purpose.  When you seek to bend another's will and emotions, love is lost.  I will add that magic takes years of practice and hard work to use. <br>  <br>  However, you went through the trouble of finding this, so I get the sense you will try to use it regardless of any warning we may offer.  <br>  <br>  Change the spell, leave out the other person entirely.  Focus only on you, You happy, in love, you at peace.  By omitting the other person and focusing the spell only on you, and your ability to love and be loved, you are working your own will and not another's.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to seal your spell that it cannot harm human, beast, or weather.  If a spell cannot work within this clause, it will not work.<br>  <br>  Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I'm not sure what you mean by "legit" - witches create their spells for specific needs.  My spell won't be exactly the same as that of another witch, but it doesn't make either one any more or less "legit".  They are a personal creation that one uses to focus their energy, will and intent.<br>  <br>  I would ask that you put some serious thought into your reasoning for this spell though.<br>  <br>  "I don't agree with some of the things he's doing."<br>  <br>  A spell will not change anything here - he's who he is and you are who you are.  You're not always going to agree on everything.  Compromise is a key ingredient to a healthy relationship.  But you shouldn't have to compromise to the point where you are sacrificing all of your standards and beliefs.  If the two of you cannot come to a compromise on your own about these "things he's doing" that you don't agree with - then why do the spell?  It's not going to change him.  When you love someone and want to be with them, you have to accept the "whole package" - flaws and all (everyone has their own quirks and flaws.)<br>  <br>  "Now I know what is meant to be will be. But I want us to last together forever." <br>  <br>  What is *meant to be* and what you *want* may not be the same things.<br>  <br>  "I want him to know how much I love him and how much he means to me."<br>  <br>  Communication - another key ingredient to a healthy relationship.  Talk with him.  Perhaps make him a gift - something he'll like, and/or write him a poem.  My boyfriend doesn't really like to get into the mushy "how do we really feel about each other" discussions - but we show each other our love and how much we mean to each other in numerous other ways.  We keep the lines of communication open and talk out problems if we have any.  We do a little something special for each other every so often - Like, I'll cook him his favorite meal and rent an action movie I know he's been wanting to see...he takes me to one of my favorite places to go for recreation, like for a picnic and hike at the local state park or to the closest beach.  I show interest in his hobbies that are passions for him (one is mountain biking, which I know little about, but I learn stuff from him by talking with him about it - guys are more than happy to talk about the stuff they love to do), and in turn, he does the same with me and my hobbies and passions.  Our relationship continues to grow stronger even when we don't see each other for a week or more at a time, because when we do spend time together, we make it special somehow.<br>  <br>  There are a million ways the two of you can connect without spells that will be more personal and meaningful.  Put some thought into it and be creative.<br>  <br>  Magic doesn't instantly fix all your problems, and within a relationship - it will take the two of you to make it work.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|cjWrSpfYaa	If you have very little practice with magick it most liekly will have no effect, think of playing a fine instrament, without practice you could strum the strings on a guitar but it would sound like crap.

Communication is key for relationship issues, spells don't fix things that you don't agree with.<br>  <br>  The spell is legit if you put all of your intentions into it.|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	It sounds like a legit spell, but personally I wouldn't use it for the problem you describe. I'd use a matched set of lodestones -- they're magnetic rocks that you arrange so their magnetic powers draw each other, and you name one for yourself and one for the other person (you can even put hair from each person beneath their respective stones.) Often one also dresses the stones with an oil like Love Oil or Stay With Me oil. <br>  <br>  You then set the stones together so they stick together due to their magnetic powers, and likewise you and your boyfriend will stay together. Then about once a week (Fridays usually) you sprinkle some magnetic sand on the stones to keep them fed. Every few weeks you can clean off the stones and reuse the sand that was on them as a sprinkling powder around yourself and your fellow to keep things strong.

N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  They are not against it in principle; the question boils down to the source.<br>  <br>  They are not against it if stem cell materials come from our organs, used umbilical tubes etc. They are just against grinding up human baby foetuses, given they believe it is a human in development.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Not all of them are.  You are confusing the Pro-Life movement with Christianity.  I assure you, there are pro-life atheists (me, for example) and pro-life members of other religions.  There are also pro-choice members of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Also, I know of no large group with a moral objection to stem cell research in general.  Pro-life groups oppose specifically embryionic stem cell research.  Adult stem cells are generally accepted for use even by pro-life groups.<br>  <br>  The reason pro-life groups oppos embryionic stem cell research is that most such forms of research cause the destruction of the embryo -- and thus kills a human life if you hold that human life begins at conception and not at birth (which is pretty much the defining view of the pro-life movement).<br>  <br>  Some recent research was done in extracting embryonic stem cells from an embryo in such a way it did not cause the destruction of the embryo, and many pro-life groups celebrated this find.  If you could get embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo, there would be no loss of human life from the process, and great good could come of the research.  While there may be, I do not know of any pro-life movement, groups or individuals who would object to embryonic stem cell research if these could be obtained without the destruction or harm of an embryo.|`|0aN1xIxfaa	It appears that an inaccurate question attracts inaccurate answers. If you had said "Why are some Christians against foetal stem cell research?" you would have had squashed all the prejudiced answers at a stroke. As it is, all we can hope for is that the misinformed anti-Christian people who falsely assume all Christians are against all stem cell research will read the informed Christian answers and now be much the wiser.|`|pakIAYWoaa	stem cells research is ok ..embrionic stem cells are not...how about growing a few lobotomized clones so you have spare parts when you need them..where does it stop? why did it start?

They use it to treat various cancers.|`|89UOqaVNaa	The same reason I would be against those same "researchers" putting you in a dungeon and doing cruel experiments on you and using your body parts as they see fit.<br>  <br>  A child begins at conception.

Some are fertilized on this trip down the tube or even inside the uterus, then some of them die or are expelled.<br>  So should we very carefully keep all these ovum and each of us have the amount of babies that we have eggs?  Because some of them may die if we practice birth control.<br>  Once they are expelled or are not placed in a women's womb they will not become a baby.  So if these dead tissues are used to help us to understand our bodies and its ability to heal I do not think it is a sin against God to do so.  Now having an abortion where the fertilized ovum is growing that is another story, I think that is murder.|`|7KeGDQyXaa	I am a Christian and i am not against stem cell research; however, i am against the potential to use human beings as spare parts for the rich.

This is when scientists remove stem cells from an adult person's bone marrow, and try to work with them to cure the patient. NOBODY has any moral objections to this.  Ironically it is proving to be the more scientifically viable branch of stem cell research.<br>  <br>  Christians oppose EMBRYONIC stem cell Research. This is when scientist use human sperm and egg cells to create a HUMAN embryo in the lab...they make a person...then they destroy the embryo and harvest her (or his) stem cells and use them for research. Christians oppose this because they feel that it is immoral to  break up a person for parts...even very tiny ones. (A Person's a Person no matter how small) and even if you are breaking up this person "for a good cause". Simply put, Christians take the radical moral position that it  is wrong to "part out" a person, like you would an old Chevy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Christians have encountered three main groups of opposition to this stand. There are pro-abortion people who are afriad that if the law recognizes that it is wrong to break up a human embryo for parts it might lead to legal protection for the unborn, and legal restrictions on abortion down the line. Second they have encountered opposition from scientists who want to do the research (scientist like to get paid). Also they have seen their opposition to EMBRYONIC stem cell Research twisted in the press to make it look like they oppose ALL stem cell research, (which is simply a lie). This is done because A) Reporters are often stupid, and B) some people (as you see here) have an anti-Christian agenda and making Christians look like the are ignorant hicks who oppose science fits that agenda.  Embryonic Stem Cell research has proven to be less sucessful, as the stem cells have been  known to cause tumors and leave the patient worse off than before. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D96DLTT00&show_article=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=...</a><br>  <br>  The above groups often enlist the support of people who have diseases by playing on their emotions. I must admit that such an argument would be hard to resist ("You know, we COULD make you better...if it wern't for these nasty Christian Repulblicans who won't let us..."). There arguments often include unsupported and outlandish claims of how stem cells "could" cure everything from AIDS to MS to Cancer to the Common Cold to male pattern baldness. Technically they are true...they "MIGHT" actually do that...but in terms of actually having panned out these claims rank up there with "by 1960 every house in America will be powered by it's own atomic reactor."  These claims are just that...claims. They have yet to pan out. <br>  <br>  While the people who have the disease are sincere in their position, as I noted above, the arguments used to motivate them  are normally poltically driven and founded on distortions and lies. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	they are against embryonic stem cell research because they think souls exist in a clump of 150 cells in a petri dish<br>  <br>  Stem cell therapy could cure cancer, AIDS, and alzheimers, but that doesnt matter if it is against what "God wants"|`|vSlG3ayiaa	We're not against adult stem cell research.

I usually like conservatism, but not when it keeps old traditions without reason.  The Bible says in Deuteronomy that men and women are not to blur the distinction between the sexes, or try to make one sex into another.  One way of doing this is to imitate the opposite sex in clothing, adornments, and manner.  In the time of this document, both men and women wore long robes, but their adornment and mannerisms made it obvious who was male or female.  In some cultures, both men and women wore pants, but it was obvious who was who.  The whole hubbub over women wearing pants is a reaction from the early 1900s when fashions changed rapidly.  The Bible isn't saying that people can't wear comfortable appropriate clothing of any kind.  It says not to alter the distinction between the sexes.  It's about transvestitism.<br>  <br>  When I lived in the tropics, I wore skirts all the time because of the heat.  Back in a cold climate, I wear pants.

gP11453Waa	Meaning no disrespect for your teacher, I must say that NO ONE can easily define religion. Most such attempts are far too restrictive and eliminate many that don't precisely fit the given definition. I personally believe Paganism to be a religion, but I also believe Satanism is a religion, along with many of the so-called primitive beliefs and practices. Would the Native American beliefs not be religions? What of Shinto, Taoism, Jainism, Witchcraft, Druidism, and even Voodoo?<br>  There is clearly not room here to expound as much as I would like to, so I will try to respond briefly to your points and then include a few links.<br>  I have not aligned myself with any particular religion. My emotions overall on religion are mild, but I do wish more people would really practice tolerance and acceptance without being judgmental about another person's beliefs. As to Paganism, many fear it as a route to "the Devil," but I just accept it as part of what is and as a religion many people do practice. Some define it as an "umbrella" covering all religions not fit neatly into Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Back to the Native American beliefs, here is a quote that might make us think:<br>  "If you take [a copy of] the Christian Bible and put it out in the wind and the rain, soon the paper on which the words are printed will disintegrate and the words will be gone. Our bible IS the wind and the rain." Herbalist Carol McGrath as told to her by a Native-American woman. This paragraph and the following one are taken directly from ReligiousTolerance.org (Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance).<br>  These are derived from the third link below.<br>  Some interpret this saying as stating that the Native American Bible is stronger than the Christian Bible, and would destroy the latter. i.e. it is a type of "my God is bigger than your God" saying that has caused so much loss of life and destruction, and that threatens the existence of the human race. It isn't. It is merely saying that Earth-centered religions obtain their spiritual guidance from the forces of nature, whereas Christians obtain their guidance from the written Bible.<br>  Some insist that Paganism is not a proper name for a religion, for they think there are many forms of religion that are pagan in nature but that Paganism itself is not a religion. How could it not be a religion?<br>  Consider the following paragraphs through the one numbered 8. These are taken from <a href="http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2...</a> which is repeated in the link list below.<br>  In simplest terms Paganism is a religion of place, or a native religion, for example the Native American's religion is Pagan, Hinduism is a form of Paganism. All Pagan religions are characterised by a connection and reverence for nature, and are usually polytheistic i.e. have many Gods and/or Goddesses.<br>  Modern Paganism as practised in the west is particular to the native peoples of the west and although there are many forms most are descended from Celtic origins. Modern Paganism or 'neo-Paganism' has the following characteristics:<br>  1. Paganism is a religion of nature, in other words Pagans revere Nature. Pagans see the divine as immanent in the whole of life and the universe; in every tree, plant, animal and object, man and woman and in the dark side of life as much as in the light. Pagans live their lives attuned to the cycles of Nature, the seasons, life and death.<br>  2. Unlike the patriarchal religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) the divine is female as well as male and therefore there is a Goddess as well as a God. These deities are within us as well as without us (immanent); they are us. They are not simply substitutes for the Muslim or Judeo-Christian God. This is because the Gods of the major religions tend to be super-natural i.e. above nature whereas Pagan deities are natural, symbolizing aspects of nature or human nature. Having said that God and Goddess are split from the Great Spirit or Akashka which probably equates to the God of the patriarchal religions.<br>  3. The Goddess represents all that is female and the God represents all that is male. But because nature is seen as female the Goddess has a wider meaning. Often called Mother Earth or Gaia she is seen as the creatrix and sustainer of life, the mother of us all which makes all the creatures on the planet our siblings.<br>  4. There are sub-groups of named Gods and Goddesses called Pantheons, drawn from the distant past, for example Isis and Osiris from Egypt or Thor, Odin, Freya et al from Norse religion and mythology. Ancient Pagans would have worshipped one or a small number of Gods and Goddesses, whilst often recognizing the validity of other people's deities. The concept of an overall, un-named Goddess and God, the sum totals of all the others, appears to be a recent one but individual named deities represent particular human qualities or archetypes and are often used as a focus for celebrations and spiritual rites.<br>  5. Paganism has developed alongside mankind for thousands of years; as cultures have changed so has Paganism, yet it is grounded in deep rooted genetic memories that go back to neolithic times and before. Thus Paganism is not just a nature religion but a natural religion.<br>  6. Paganism in the west takes a number of forms including Wicca, Druidism, and Shamanism.<br>  7. To Pagans the four ancient elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water have special significance. The importance of these is hard to define because they have so many correspondences, for example they are associated with the four directions, North, East, South and West. Each element is a kind of spiritual substance from which all things are made especially ourselves and at the same time are Guardians both of ourselves and of the Goddess and God, and guarding the gateways between this world and the other world.<br>  8. Many Pagans believe in reincarnation in some form. It gives Pagans a substantially different view of life. Early Christians saw Karma as a kind of treadmill, trapping people in endless reincarnations, never free. But Pagans see reincarnation as, at best, a chance to improve or to continue unfinished work, and at worst just a simple re-cycling of souls.<br>  Well, I shall stop now and post this. Following are several links worth investigating. Of course, there are many more resources.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wildhunt.org/blog/2007/10/is-paga..." rel="nofollow">http://wildhunt.org/blog/2007/10/is-paga...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.spiralgoddess.com/Pagan101.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.spiralgoddess.com/Pagan101.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchc..." rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/nov_2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_de..." rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/rel_de...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutreligion.org/definiti..." rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutreligion.org/definiti...</a><br>  Great question, yours is!

It was invented as an insult word by the city folks and means a village idiot. The country bum kin. <br>  <br>  A religion is an organization. If you belong to a religion you are saying you are a member of an organization. Reality does not come into the picture with religions and their belief in an invisible sky fairy.<br>  <br>  Spirituality is the understanding that we are all fragments of the Universal Consciousness, what ever that is to you. Whether that means a god or scientifically from energy to matter is irrelevant. Because as such we are all divine beings whose value is beyond measure. Individual beliefs are irrelevant with such a concept.<br>  <br>  Christianities festivals are all plagiarized from the northern animistic Celtic festivals, dates and all.

Also remind him that religion is a belief or set thereof.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Wow!  That is so rude!  I can't believe your teacher did that.  I can't believe you didn't slap him, props to you for your restraint!  Who's he to decide what "real religions" are?  Maybe Buddhism isn't a real religion since Buddha isn't a god.  Maybe Hinduism isn't a real religion because they have several gods.  I think Paganism is definately a religion, and older than Christianity at that.  So he can just suck it :)|`|YupMCYHlaa	I think he is just wrong.  I guess it depends on your definition of 'religion'.  From the approach of sociology, he is probably considering religions that have had their mark on different cultures.  And from that approach, he is right, those five religions have had a major influence on cultures around the world, Wicca has not.  But religions similar to modern Wicca had a much bigger effect in ancient times, before the five biggies came to be, or got popular enough to affect cultures.<br>  <br>  Religion and politics have been so tightly twisted together since ancient times that it's often hard to separate them. Some of the strongest religious ideas are really political and vice-versa, and it's sometimes hard to tell them apart.  But Wicca, paganism, animism, naturism, etc., have had very little political effect compared to, for instance, Roman Catholicism, which ruled the entire Western World for about 1000 years!<br>  <br>  So a better thing for your teacher to say was "The minor religions have had very little influence on the things sociology measures and documents, so we don't consider those in our view of religion from the angle of sociology."|`|rcCYssKYaa	RELIGION:<br>  1. a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs. <br>  2. a specific fundamental set of beliefs and practices generally agreed upon by a number of persons or sects: the Christian religion; the Buddhist religion.  <br>  3. the body of persons adhering to a particular set of beliefs and practices: a world council of religions.  <br>  4. the life or state of a monk, nun, etc.: to enter religion.  <br>  5. the practice of religious beliefs; ritual observance of faith. <br>  6. something one believes in and follows devotedly; a point or matter of ethics or conscience: to make a religion of fighting prejudice. <br>  <br>  <br>  *Please note the first 3 words of the definition of religion - A SET OF BELIEFS...<br>  <br>  As for my opinion on the situation with your teacher - so much for separation of church and state.|`|wwdllMzYaa	my thoughts on this, not beign biased or subjective totally objective <br>  is <br>  hes ignorant<br>  <br>  1- i feel its a shame, but thats the consequences of religious intoelrance and ignorance<br>  <br>  2-i think he shoudl not be a teacher, and certainly not a sociology teacher as hes not looking at all objectively, that is very much a religious veiw, not a sociological view nor a realistic view<br>  <br>  3-feel i prety much said that in 1 and 2 and the sentence above ;-)<br>  <br>  4-knowing fine well that paganisim is one of the oldest religions<br>  <br>  5-evidnce, for or against, well, im not religious myself, all i know is hisotry<br>  and history points to it being a religion, which has several branch offs, as most do<br>  the only non religious pagans are usually eclectic pagans, liek myself<br>  <br>  your welcome ;-)|`|AA11124121	he may have been alluding to "recognized religions."|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Come and calm yourself. the word Pagan was coined by modern religions to those who practice their faith taken from an ancient form and ways of worshiping their God.<br>  Roman Catholics were among the first who called the Jews as Pagans and yet their members never realized that the way they worship their God in these generations were being patterned after an Ancient Roman Pagan belief in Mithra. (www.zeitgeistmovie.com)<br>  Religion is also a form of belief which everyone of them denies it as a religion but claims it as a way of life.<br>  Judaism was never formed as a religion since they were like that already from the beginning of their inceptions as a family, as a society and later as a nation. They have been living in the tradition of worshiping One God that created everything in this world. They were not formed as an organization. They became a registered religious group later in a country where they resided only to be provided with the right to practice their faith.<br>  Buddhism did not teach its members to go away from their Old belief (Hindu) it actually teaches one to search himself first before he finds himself in the world of God/s.<br>  I think it is just fitting not to associate those Wiccan and other pagan practices as religion because religion actually divides instead of bringing together all people as a human society. Have you still not noticed how each religion says that only theirs will lead you to heaven? and the others are bound to hell?<br>  Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism tells you about the consequences of your actions towards yourself and others<br>  Christianity and Islam tells  you of the consequences of your choice of religion regardless of the any actions you do.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	1. I don't really have any emotion for this, honestly<br>  <br>  2. I think perhaps that he is looking at paganism as without specific dogma or doctrine. The 5 he listed do have some sort of "rules", we in paganism are free to interpret and design our own "guidelines". So I can kind of understand his thinking.<br>  <br>  3. I think of paganism as a more Indigenous Religion<br>  <br>  4. Many paganistic theologies/ideas/rituals/beleif structures were formed in specific areas. Indigenous implies that the beleif structure exists from something from that area. A local coven tends to bring in some old Appalachian traditions into their rituals to make it there very own. I imagine that alot of people do this, thus making their beleif structure indigenous to their area...sort of. <br>  <br>  5. <a href="http://www.churchofwicca.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.churchofwicca.org</a> would seem like a powerful peice of evidence in support that Wicca (at least out of all pagan traditions/pathways) is in fact a religion.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  Just read your additional stuff. WOW, he has basically said that religion is based on having a physical place to worship. So does that mean the many 3rd world countries that have adopted Christianity as their faith yet cannot afford to have a church built not actually a part of Christianity? I know many Christians who do take the time to appreciate nature and may thank their deity for the beauty that surrounds them while they are on a nature hike, does that mean that their prayer is no longer valid since it is not in an enclosed space? <br>  <br>  We do have places to worship. A local coven that does public rituals holds them in various locations around town, some outside and some inside. They are currently trying to get "church" status so that we can have a goddess temple built and be free to pay honor outside of Sabbats. And of course I already gave you a link to a "church" not but an hour away from me.

Most pagan religions are much more female-centric than traditional religions and it has been the case for like a thousand or more years that female-centric religions are feared and oppressed by the patriarchy.

And in order to rule a land you had to conquer it. And anyone who did not or does not believe as the rulers where persecuted. To be honest I feel humanity has been very cruel in the name of gods. Its such a shame that people will kill in the name of their god, who they claim is so loving and caring. Think about what a real witch is. Not the fairy tale witch. Or the magic witch. Technically a real witch is someone who believes in the power of nature. Or as in modern times a health store owner selling herbal tea to sleep better. It is and will always be about power and religion is the best way to control the people.|`|LF4vun1maa	What is the meaning of "true religion" in this context?  Is it some kind of specific definition of religious practice?  A thing where a religion must have the properties X, Y, and Z to be called a religion, or it should be called something else?  (If that is the case it's strange that both Buddhism and Hinduism qualify, neither one fits the typical mold of "religion," really.)  Or was it a judgement on the truth-value of the religions?<br>  <br>  If it is the second a sociology professor has no business discussing it in class at all. <br>  <br>  If it's the first one then I would really have to know what exactly was said before I could agree or disagree.|`|OQlanljQaa	Because someone holds a degree or license, that does not mean they are qualified in some areas, it appears such is the case of your teacher..<br>  Please remind him that he may scoff at Pagan religions, however, it was only a thousand years ago,not very long ago, that Norse Pagans were and still do in some areas worship trees.. <br>  Now then, my emotions, I'm not ruled by them, <br>  my thoughts, above is an example and although I have many more examples, too numerous to list..

(And, by some definitions, Buddhism and Hinduism fall under the umbrella of pagan religions.)<br>  <br>  You made a valid point that Wicca, one of the many pagan faiths, is recognized as a religion.  <br>  <br>  It is recognized by the U.S. federal government, its groups are eligible for tax exempt status, and it is listed in the U.S. Army's Chaplain's Handbook - for 1 of your Edit.

Is a man-made building necessary for prayer and worship - is that the only way God will see/hear them?<br>  <br>  Our groups are called covens, and are led by an ordained High Priest and/or High Priestess.

Have you still not noticed how each religion says that only theirs will lead you to heaven? and the others are bound to hell?"<br>  <br>  Wrong - Wicca and most other pagan paths do not claim to be the "only right way" for *everyone*.  Heaven and Hell are concepts of the Abrahamic religions - they are the only ones who preach this.  Wiccans do not wish to divide, we wish for, at the very least, tolerance for differences in religion - better yet would be that we could coexist in peace despite our differences in spiritual choices.  We don't deserve to not be considered a religion just because the "mainstream" religions can't make peace with those who do not follow their ways.|`|VDrNhLMPaa	1.

It seems pretty obvious to me that your teacher is stubborn and grossly uninformed on the subject of religions and is not open to any other opinions on the subject. If he knew much of anything in regards to Paganism, he would know that while Hinduism is a major world religion, it is also a PAGAN religion. Also, Christianity is highly paganized itself, even though they don't like to admit it (that is, if they know to begin with).<br>  <br>  Pagan religions are most definitely real religions. We may not necessarily have a head guy (pope, dalai lama, etc.), and many of us consider the outdoors where we can feel closer to nature to be our churches/temples, but that does not make pagan religions any less of a religion!|`|jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet Sakura,<br>  <br>  A religion is an organized approach to human spirituality which usually encompasses a set of narratives, symbols, beliefs and practices, often with a supernatural or transcendent quality, that give meaning to the practitioner's experiences of life through reference to a higher power or truth. It may be expressed through prayer, ritual, meditation, music and art, among other things. It may focus on specific supernatural, metaphysical, and moral claims about reality (the cosmos, and human nature) which may yield a set of religious laws, ethics, and a particular lifestyle. Religion also encompasses ancestral or cultural traditions, writings, history, and mythology, as well as personal faith and religious experience.<br>  <br>  The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction. "Religion" is sometimes used interchangeably with "faith" or "belief system,” but it is more socially defined than personal convictions, and it entails specific behaviors, respectively.<br>  <br>  The development of religion has taken many forms in various cultures.

Also if the discussion is religion then Buddhism as a religion is inaccurate because it’s a belief based on philosophy not on a deity or deities.

It's sad that this teacher didn't do more research into Paganism and Wicca.  Paganism was one of the original RELIGIONS before christianity came along.  Pagan is more an earth religion than Wicca but they ARE religions.  I believe the Wiccan religion was recognized as a religion by the world at a conference in 1997 (?) at a big summit meeting on Wiccan Religion.  The US Government even recognizes it - the soldiers who pass over are now allowed to have the pentagram put on their headstones where it was not recognized before.  You handled it correctly!  Better to not draw attention to yourself by arguing with him.  We are not completely out of the closet yet as a lot people still think we do sacrafices, etc.  Your teacher was being very SMALL MINDED!  Perhaps when there is a way to get to the class before anyone else, you could leave him a book on Paganism or Wicca.  And there are many different sects of the Pagan Religion - including Hinduism.  The Celts are a big sect.  And it is thought they came from around India before settling in Western Europe.  Maybe leave you teacher a list of books he can read to better inform him so he doesn't look like a biggoted jerk again.  lol|`|Dd24GFSHaa	As a Pagan and a Witch for the past- oh, I don't know- 12 years!- The comments that your teacher said have offended me.  I  normally don't get too bothered when ignorant people say things about my religion, because they usually don't know any better.  But for a teacher to say that in front of his class?  That's just appalling.<br>    The Pagan religions are kind of jumbled together, but Paganism and Wicca as a whole are recognized by the United States of America (and other countries, such as England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy...) as a REAL religion.  In fact, it is quickly becoming the fastest growing religion.  You can receive more information on the legalities from the Witches' Public Awareness League.  <br>    No, we don't go around worshipping trees.  We worship Nature, but now-a-days, most of us in larger cities tend to do things indoors.  We try to keep in touch with Nature as a rule since everything that we need to survive is found in Nature.  There are no set places for worship unless you are involved with a coven, but worship can be done anywhere, with or without others.  Some people actually set up church-like atmospheres to worship in.  It's just a preference of the individual and community at large.  As for rules....  Well, there's no real set rules other than the Wiccan Rede, which basically states that you shouldn't harm anyone.  (Sounds alot like the "golden rule," right?)  Also, most of us believe in the Three Fold Law, which says that anything you do comes back to you three times, kind of like karma.  <br>    As for evidence of Paganism as a real religion, I would hope that if the government sanctions it, and if the church-like atmosphere has its tax exemptions just the same as any other religion's churches do, that others would see it as a "real" religion.<br>    Sorry if I rambled.

The word "pagan" (or more specifically Neo-Pagan) refers to a type of spiritual belief. There are many religions that can be described as pagan in variety of ways, but pagan is not a religion in of itself.<br>  <br>  Wicca is the closest thing to being recognized as a religion. There are many states and government bodies that recognize it as a religion in some way. This is because there is a documented set of rules and guidelines that allow its practitioners to express themselves spiritually (like Gardenarian Wicca).<br>  <br>  Your teacher is choosing to stick to an official definition of religion, which is his prerogative. The disorganized nature of modern neo-pagan beliefs can be a blessing or a curse. Neo-pagans tend to buck structure and institutionalization of anything, so it's unlikely they'll ever give up the free-formity of their community for societal recognition.<br>  <br>  So as for your teacher, he's right that Paganism is not a recognized religion, but he should keep his disdain to himself about a subject he obviously very little about.|`|cK8fDriPaa	From the viewpoint of your teacher and the subject he is teaching, on a scholarly and academic level, your teacher is correct! The five religions he quoted are the ONLY world religions recognized on an international level. <br>  <br>  Paganism is NOT a religion, but a belief system. <br>  <br>  In America, the only Pagan religions that meet the requirement of being recognized as a religion are: Wicca, Druidism, and Asatru. AND a practioner of these religions have to abide by these requirements to have their "freedom of religion" rights respected by the government. (I learned this in the military as a a Wiccan Priestess to be able to have my religious holiday off.) And part of these requirements include "training for clergy," so this means that only members of a coven meet the requirement; Solitary does not because Solitary is not in a "church" being educated by their religious Elders to become clergy. I happened to be an Initiate of a coven, so I qualified, but when I became a HPS I had to become legally ordained to get the holidays off to teach my students, and then charter my coven as a church to keep it going. I was given all the Sabbats off, and most Esbats nights off, in exchange I worked the Christian holidays, including Christmas and Easter. And in doing so, I got my requests off as a Wiccan when the Solitary Pagans did not. It really is necessary to be educated about how such things work in the real world.)<br>  <br>  So Pagan religions are not internationally recognized like the "Big Five" religions taught in a World Religion course. And most instructors will explain this, if they have an understanding of what the course is actually about and why. <br>  <br>  If you wish to learn about Pagan religions, these courses are found in Anthropology and in English World Mythology courses. <br>  <br>  Advocates for having Paganism recognized internationally are actually doing a very good job, and the one I am most familiar with is Selena Fox with Circle Sanctuary. She and members of her organization have been able to gain recognition of Paganism as a religion on several state interfaith councils in America, and have gained a seat of representation on the international level of religious interfaith. <br>  <br>  But I do not condone pushing your views on your instructor or your school that Paganism is equal to the "Big Five" world religions. And by understanding what they mean by "World Religions" you would understand that Paganism does not fit this description, nor should it ever do so. These are religions that advocate conversion to the religion, and have affected the world (hence the class description) by being a religion involved in politics, wars, and other major (and often destructive) means to change world events; for example, the Crusades. <br>  <br>  Paganism USED to be of the world religion in the Ancient World, and for this study, you will need to take courses on the histories of the Ancient World, and will need to focus on which area you wish to study. For example: are you interested in the Mediterrean Pagan religions, or the European ones? <br>  <br>  A great way to see the overview of how Paganism from Paleolithic and Neolithic times, through the Ancient and Classical Worlds, that lead to the rise of Christianity and the modern world, I would suggest a study in Art History and World Ethnic Art. Art is the first expression of religion in mankind, and the theme of art is often based in religious beliefs throughout the ages and cultures of the world. <br>  <br>  If you would like to prove to your instructor that Wicca or other Pagan religions ARE recognized as a religion, you will need to first look into what qualifies the criteria to be defined as a religion in America - look to the US Army Chaplains Handbook for this. You can find it online. And how Wicca became recognized as a religion by the government, look to Rev. Pete Pathfinder with the Aquarian Tabernacle Church - who was the first person to get his church and Wicca recognized as a religion. You can also contact Selena Fox and Circle Sanctuary to see what they do to promote and advocate modern Paganism as a religion to gain representation on the national and international interfaith seats. You can use the new Wicca recognition by the Veteran's Affairs to have the symbol of the Pentagram available on the gravestones of veterans and servicemen. Look on the offical VA website for this. <br>  <br>  And most of all educate yourself on your professed religion! Understand the history of it, the people who have advocated it, who are the "founding fathers" of modern NeoPaganism today...because my criticism is that most Pagans read books they find in the book store or what they read on the internet, which is a "pop culture" of Wicca and Paganism, and they aren't really EDUCATED on their religion! Which is just as bad as Christians who push their religion on others who are not familiar with their religion's history or their Biblical Scriptures. <br>  <br>  And keep in mind, that in America, if you are a Solitary Pagan, you are not recog|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	As a member of a heathen faith that  predates any of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic sects by many thousands of years:<br>  <br>  1. Annoyed but not surprised. <br>  <br>  2. People who belong to one of the new faiths will say and do nearly anything to justify their faith even if they do not follow it as closely as their heathen breathren. They are free to worship who they choose, but if they infringe on my right to follow the faith of my choice I just  may go all Viking on 'em. I would not have backed down.<br>  <br>  3. Your teacher is an idiot and most likely a bigot as  well. <br>  <br>  4. Those who claim another person's religion is "not a real religion" are just as bad as those who claim a black person is "only 2/3 of a person", if not worse. Monotheists in particular may as well  be atheists due to the large number of deities they deny on a daily basis - all of which are much older than their own. I feel "religious" people who routinely deny the existence of other deities simply because they don't want to follow them are somewhat weaker of class - which says a lot about what they're learning from their deity. The word "intolerant" comes to mind along with "uneducated douchenozzle who is so insecure in  their own faith they NEED there not to be any other deities to potentially annoy if only in their own minds". Kind of like how a very small child will cover their eyes and then think because they can't see you, you can't see them. I also feel they lack faith in their own belief system/deity(ies) or they wouldn't feel the need to deny the legitimacy of other belief systems with which they do not agree. <br>  <br>  5. Well over 8,000 years of human history points to many pagan and heathen religions that predate Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some of them are still being practiced today, either in reconstructionist form (such as ásatrú) or in the form handed down from generation to generation through thousands of years of a family or tribal group (Forn Sed, Nordisk Sed, etc - NOT the same as ásatrú, tho they are very similar and many "educated" individuals outside the faith frequently confuse them)<br>  <br>  I honestly don't understand people who have the overwhelming urge to deny that another person's faith is a legitimate faith while claiming they have faith themselves. That's one thing we don't do in my religion. We don't do it because we actually HAVE faith!|`|x7AHHWvaaa	If Wicca is not a "real" religion then why is there a Law Enforcement Guide to Wicca? Why are military chaplains required to learn basic Wicca principles? Why are our soldiers allowed the pentacle on their tombstone?<br>  <br>  Yes, if you haven't noticed, I am Pagan, NOT WICCAN! And yes, there is a difference. All Wiccans are Pagan, but not all Pagans are Wiccan. Wiccans follow the Wiccan Rede, I follow the 42 Laws of Ma'at more than I do the Wiccan Rede. As for our place of worship? Unlike Christians, Pagans do not need a building made "of wood and stone", we worship our Mother Earth, OUTSIDE! Not "to a tree" but to the essence of life! The essence that is both within and without us all. However, as it stands today, WICCA IS THE ONLY LEGAL PAGAN RELIGION!!!! And that is only due to the blood, sweat, and tears of Gavin and Evon Frost.<br>  <br>  I wish that people would actually research a topic before saying anything about it, one way or the other. But, what can you do?<br>  <br>  On a side note, after reading another answer - if your teacher is going off the basis of which major religions had an effect on civilization, what about the Egyptians? They were heavily Pagan and they have contributed more than most in ways of a legacy left behind... and I don't mean a blood trail (like the Inquisition or the Crusades...) I mean the Pyramids of Giza, Cleopatra, The Valley of the Kings, King Tut.... the list goes on.<br>  <br>  And as for his scoff at trees.... ask him if he gets a Christmas tree every year for x-mas.

Taking care of your parents is just the decent thing to do. So yes, I would continue to obey God's laws because they are what is best for me, both here on Earth and in the after life.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	If people obeyed God, they wouldn't be hellbound, so the "still" doesn't make sense|`|DxDfa3E7aa	Clearly you're speaking of Calvinism. If I knew I was going to hell, regardless of what I did, I would continue my disobedience of this christian god. I'm wiccan. And I have no idea why christians couldn't come up with a better name for their god than god. I mean, come ON!! At least other cultures have names for their gods!!

(by the way, carbonara sauce is made with egg yolks, not with cream, and the so-called bolognese sauce is "ragù". Beware of cheap italian reastaurants abroad!)<br>  If you both live in Italy, learning the language will make you more independant. Do it.

Worse yet, one of my brother's friends may try to hit on me. Even worse yet, a 12-year-old cholo may ride up on his little bike and try to get cute with me while his homies stand back and giggle like little girls, occasionally hitting their elbows and yelling 'pack it' at friends that pass by.<br>  <br>  I imagine that small town projects are nothing like Harlem.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look I have traveled a bit and the best way to avoid getting attacked is to walk like you have purpose and you can deal with any idiot that decides to f*** with you.

I would also advise you to pack heat but that is illegal there. (Gotta love New Yorkistan) Only time I came close was when one guy was following me. I just stepped inside a building and I was fine. Here in my beloved home state of New York they don't like the concept of self defense thanks to our excellent police departments.

My accent isn't that thick, but I've traveled with friends with really thick Boston accents, and the thing they get the most is people asking them to repeat a word just to hear the way they say it.  People on the west coast aren't used to hearing it, so they find it entertaining (and they always get a kick out of our use of the word "wicked").  Why don't you travel out there before the big move and get an idea of how people react to your lack of R's?|`|q9BItD25aa	Just pronounce you  " ers " and you will be fine.

Many supposedly religious ideas are political, and vice versa.  You really have to examine ideas to see which they are.<br>  <br>  Since the beginning of history (and before that!) religion has been used to reinforce the power of political leaders, to divide and conquer, to set one group of people against another.  This is diametrically opposed to the actual teachings of people like Jesus, Buddha, etc.  This is not religion, it's politics masquerading as religion.<br>  <br>  When spiritual leaders convince their followers that their beliefs are the only -correct- beliefs, and that as the holders of these exclusively correct beliefs, they are entitled to special rights and privileges, that is also politics.  You can see how the Republicans used the abortion issue and 'family values' to win the Southern states, in fact the fight against evolution and against womens' rights is part of this scheme.|`|AJr98ZReaa	Because they are convinced they are right.<br>  <br>  there is a large community of Lubavitcher around my area, who like to invite us over for shabbos. <br>  <br>  I imagine its the same for dealing with other nuts.

Why?  Because they know they are right and feel it is within their duty and their belief to make everyone believe that they are right.<br>  <br>  Not necessarily because they think they are better than everyone else, but because they want everyone else on this earth to experience the same peace, the same afterlife, the same truth, etc etc etc.|`|mlI1YvCnaa	I think it is human nature to be like that, sometimes you can get the same attitudes from all religions and also atheists they think they have an answer to life that non religious  people don't have, but they themselves may be giving in to an ego that is not of God in some cases|`|sJegUB11aa	For some of them, this may be the very reason they are religious.<br>  There are some that really seem to thrive and revel in the idea that other people will be punished forever for not being just like them.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	From what've seen on here,  many of the non religious do the same.<br>  So, It's probably the same reason why some of the non-religious do that.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	They are not religious peoples but they show themselves as religious peoples and they are foolish and friends of satan.|`|t88527U1aa	We state what has been given you do not agree and call us arrogant!

Onzxe6ysaa	Yes! if you say it too soon you risk seeming like "I love you" comes easily to you and it doesn't mean as much when you get to that point. Wait untill it is obvious that either enough time has gone by or he/she feels the same way. It's not a feeling you can help, but you don't have to say it. Guys scare easily.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	If you have been friends with the person a long time, then you could have felt that way before you were even dating them, so then anytime really, but if you have only known them for a short period of time, I would hold off unless you really know you do.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	um yes i think someitmes it can be too soon. say it when u mean it|`|a7IAkpJtaa	when you love someone just say it. it never too soon|`|SaQ5d420aa	Most definitely yes.<br>  <br>  First: if you really are not ready to move the relationship to another level.<br>  <br>  Second: when you don't know the person.  Such as: play the dating game = do you know his/her middle name, city they were born in, do they get along with their parents.  Is there an ex-boyfriend/husband, gf/wife.<br>  <br>  If you don't know enough about the person to write their autobiography, then you don't know them and really don't love them.  Get it?<br>  <br>  Your use of the words "too soon" indicates to me that you really already knew the answer to your question.<br>  Bide your time: enjoy the companionship before you decide to get all emotional.|`|ZzYy2szvaa	Well... I may just be a silly teenager with a puppy-crush (maybe not), but I have been in love this one guy for a long time.  If we were ever together, I would be able to tell him "I love you" quite soon into the relationship, but that would depend on how he would be coping with certain things.<br>  <br>  I think that, if you're thinking it, you should be able to say it - if your partner is freaked out - so be it!  They deserve to know how much you love them.  If they can't return it, that's fine.|`|wwTFw0faaa	Absolutely.  To really love someone you must know them.  Their hopes, where they want to be in 5 years, what books they read, what makes them sad, happy.  You get the idea.  <br>  Now some lucky couples can find this out after they have said "I love you" while only knowing each other 2 days. It is much better and the and the failure rate is much lower if you find out stuff first.|`|M1yfrNgDaa	there is always a time when its to early to say "i love you" in a relationship....the earliest i said it was 5 weeks into the relationship.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	say it when u mean it...  my gf and i have been together now for 10 yrs this year.. we're 28.. and she said that she loved me quite a few months before i said that i loved her too.|`|52VDjbNTaa	Yes, when you don't love them.<br>  Otherwise, no, there's not.<br>  If you've known them a long time & already grown to love them, even more so there's no time too early! =D|`|IJMyRWp4aa	no its never to early, just when ever you feel is the right time. i have said it as early as the second day that we were dating before|`|j59O3Jawaa	i don't think it's ever too soon. it's a feeling that you can't control. it comes at varius times.|`|7umNEMLeaa	Depends on how long you have known the person.<br>  <br>  If they are a long time friend you may have loved them long before you were dating.<br>  <br>  Just met?

JoVbT4noaa	It gives sanction to the stupid.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	Yes... if so then God also predestined 1/3 of the angels to become Demons! Praise the LORD!<br>  <br>  There is and always was free will in Heaven!!! According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven with all the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with “God’s beauty and holiness.” They rebelled against him on the SPOT and became demons along with Lucifer* (*Light Bearer who became know as Satan, The Devil, The Old Serpent, The Son of the Morning Star, and so on) who was the most beautiful angel ever created! IMHO this is a major glitch in God’s Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! God was very busy creating the rest of the Universe and Hell to do anything about this rebellion right away during the "Creation Week" so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the “Tribulation Period” after the Rapture? Most Preachers follow this primitive Bible script and claim that this event will take place any time soon! NOWHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE of billions if not trillions of stars some much bigger than the Sun there is going to be a single demon stranded anywhere in any other planet, but they will all be here on this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with “fire and sulfur” for ever and ever along with all sinners and those who never got to hear about “Jesus”! Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen...!? Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth…! (Please forgive my Christian hangover...!!! I can't stop “praising the LORD,” yet...)<br>  <br>  Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT<br>  <br>  So up to the end of the World SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information on their input DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to do it to this day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! (Jude 1:9)...<br>  <br>  It is a shame that not even one single “Guardian Angel” wa s available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. Considering that God Loves humankind so much and Eve was so innocent and ignorant about any evil issue like eating of a forbidden fruit that if left hanging on the tree will eventualy fall on its own and rot! God was very negligent not to provide a "Guardian Angel" like we see in so many cartoons trying to wise up the person undergoing the “Devil's temptation.” The Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell “prepared for Satan and his angels” (Mat. 25:41). The Bible God let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of an ignorant and FULLY INNOCENT woman! It was a set up! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her “eyes were opened!” It takes an all wise guy or GOD setting up Eve like that so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it to be that way “before the foundation of the world” because God's pleasure was to sacrifice his "only begotten Son Jesus Christ" to fix his own screw up!<br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:19-20 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:  WHO VERILY WAS FOREORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!* (*for “God’s sake” how moron do you need to be to be a Christian?!!! I am sure that the wanking perverts who wrote the Bible never imagined the success that their work was going to have on the bulk of humanity!) <br>  <br>  Later on after the “Creation Week” more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2) – This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be either very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish so they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their GOD ENDOWED sexual cravings. GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy in Heaven hardly 1,000 Bible years after the first rebellion...!  So the male angels had to look elsewhere to satisfy their Gopd created sexual cravings… and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same make believe God put together by the Bible writers! The Bible writers even say that without gullibility or rather FAITH it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible “as they were led by God the Holy Ghost”! In fact they claimed that they didn’t know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  There ought to be some higher schooling teaching how religions function in real life environment, especially Christianity! I imagine that Islam is easier to explain, but I was not a Muslim! Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about like the Muslims expect their mullahs to tell them all about Allah and Mohammed! The classical “When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know” is what makes Christianity so thriving! As far as learning or finding out where or how we came about to be religious people have it all figured out! I went to Christian College and I honestly read and taught the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard of the Bible, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, “HOLY CRAP!” It is amazing all the human excrement* (*sh*t) that a low IQ Christian, Mormon, JW, Muslim or what have you must believe to go to a place that doesn’t exist outside of the Bible or the Koran!|`|tx4bRDrXaa	“God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.”—Acts 10:34, 35, NW.2 But many religionists say God is partial, when they preach predestination, when they declare the individual’s destiny is divinely fixed before birth. Rather than being based on the Bible, the doctrine was sired by paganism and nourished by tradition. Many read horoscopes and believe in it ,but they also believe in other non-biblical traditions and that affects us more than their belief in predestination|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	Free will and predestination are mutually exclusive ideas, but plenty of people try to convince themselves that both are possible. <br>  <br>  As to how predestination effects our society:<br>  Well there's the nutjobs who claim every natural disaster, act of war, or other form of destruction is God's will as predestined.<br>  There's the group of people who console themselves when tragedy strikes by saying "God has a plan"  but otherwise believe they have the free will to act and are responsible for the choices that were already predetermined by God.<br>  There are people who believe they are special because they believe that whatever success they achieve is because God chose the plan for them.|`|425fca3256730fe3dbca29ae58671ec3aa	Predestination is a non-factor, maybe he planned something for us, but we can ruin it by making wrong choices,  Ergo: predestination goes flying out the window.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	I seem to recall the scripture saying God predestined some, not all.

(Galatians 5:22,?23) This means that the active?force of Almighty God can be brought to?bear on your behavior change and help you?to?succeed.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Find Out What You Really Are<br>  <br>  The Bible can do all these things for you because it is the Word of Jehovah, the perceptive true God. According to Psalm 139, God searches through you and makes an accurate analysis of what you are. As verse 1 says: “O?Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me.” God has been monitoring you since conception. He knows you through and through. He has had commentaries on human life written down in the Bible in all possible combinations. You will find yourself reflected somewhere in its pages, either positively or negatively.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Decide What You Want to Be<br>  <br>  The Bible urges you to change for the better, to adopt a “new personality.” Paul counseled: “You should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but .?.?. you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (Ephesians 4:22-24) The Bible shows you what these better traits are<br>  <br>  Step 3: Seek Worthy Examples<br>  <br>  Much of your behavior was established by your modeling yourself after others—friends, associates, parents, schoolteachers.<br>  <br>  Why not, then, after deciding on your desired behavior goals, look for someone who behaves in a way you wish to copy? Then seek that person’s help. A Bible proverb wisely points out: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise.”—Proverbs 13:20.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Get the Strength You Need to Succeed<br>  <br>  One of the foremost helps is personal prayer. Prayer provides a vital consultation service with the Source of the power necessary to change your ways. Prayer allows you to speak freely and openly at any time, even in mid crisis. Such access to a real and caring God far surpasses access to any human help and is immediately effective.<br>  <br>  Step 5: Cope With Relapses<br>  <br>  Keep reassuring yourself that any former undesirable course is worth escaping from. The apostle Paul referred to his former behavior and life-style as a heap of refuse, or rubbish. (Philippians 3:8) So if you, in making the change, are stumbled by an obstacle or a relapse, get up again, and keep going forward. Continue! Fight on! It will be worth it!|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	You can only feel genuine remorse.  the great thing about life is that you can change because life is always a series of fresh starts.  Your new life begins now as you make better choices
rKXf85ipaa	Just bring up talking about gay rights, that's usually a good way to figure out if you have a chance.  I remember doing this to my lab partner at the beginning of the school year, well I'm sorry people but we choose to be this way and we're all going to hell according to him... so I knew right away that wasn't going to work out. :(|`|ehfzZwDbaa	Don't talk about gay rights, thats not going to get you into this kids pants. Listen to the person who said take it slow. Don't even give him hints that you want to hook up, if he isn't gay/ bi it may make your friendship awkward. Telling him your bi first would be a start. I had 2 similar situations, both inwhich the guys turned out to not be straight. If you catch him staring at you, gaze back for a little longer. Next time you drop something, look back and see if he stares at your butt. Take off your shirt( don't do it randomly, or at a time where taking your shirt off doesn't make sense.) and see if he gets uncomfortable/flustered. Being drunk with him doesn't hurt, unless your the type to blurt out random things. Confidence is always attarctive, be confident around him, without being assertive. I also noticed, one of the guys who I was particularly sure had a thing for me got extremely jealous when I mentioned a gay guy I had just met. With time you'll be able to decifer whether or not he truly is attracted to men. Use your gaydar, it works, as long as your able to realize there is a difference between want and reality. There have been a few times in the past where I saw an attractive guy, and I was like yeah he may not be straight. Then after getting to know him a little more, I was like...nope straight and no longer attractive.|`|sqnSe9FEaa	These things need to be taken very slowly and delicately. I would recommend that you first come out to him before anything else. Give that a couple weeks to soak in, then, who knows, maybe he would have some interest in you! However, if he's straight, I wouldn't count on anything happening past that. =3|`|MYIwyTpcaa	you could always say something like "If I was gay/bi I'd do you" or something like that ..If he acts all repulsed, you could just explain it like you were giving him a compliment but if he acts interested you can pursue it more..|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	well<br>  ask if his bi or something calm down and relaxe just play around be smart don't come out just like that

Maybe you could contact one of them for help, but I have to tell you, after watching the show (forgive the term) religiously for 4 years, they've never found butkus.  <br>  <br>  If you go into your basement looking for ghosts, you're going to find them because your mind will provide them for you - in a shadow or a squeak.  If you go into your basement looking for rational explanations for things, you'll find them, instead.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oojO4WAraa	No. You can't.

Because you said "evil spirit" it leads me to believe that that's exactly what it is. In this case, keep in mind that the spirit can only cause you harm if you invite it to. You should directly confront it and literally tell it to go away.|`|Z7TloxtOaa	Mm, <br>  <br>  1. Remove and or burn any Object in your basement that is UNHOLY.

However He did not hang around very long when I resisted him by rebuking him in Jesus Name followed up with a season of prayer.<br>  <br>  He pretty well stays away now.<br>  <br>  He knows I know that Jesus is the Mighty God and my Father as well. He knows everytime he comes around I will pray. It kind of defeats his purpose.<br>  <br>  Proof....Isa 9:6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, The Prince of Peace. <br>  <br>  Joh 14:8  Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. <br>  Joh 14:9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? <br>  <br>  You see the devil and his little imps cannot stand the Name of Jesus since all power and authority is in Jesus Name. So when I rebuke the devil in Jesus Name and command him to leave they, the spirits of darkness, ghosts simply has no choice but to leave.<br>  <br>  Luk 10:19  Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. <br>  <br>  Mar 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. <br>  <br>  Obviously a unbeliever will not take the time to be baptised in Jesus lovely Name.<br>  <br>  Mar 16:17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; <br>  <br>  That is if you have truly been born of the water and the spirit as fullfilled by obeying the command of Peter.<br>  <br>  Act 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, REPENT, and be BAPTIZED every one of you in the NAME of JESUS CHRIST for the REMISSION of SINS, and ye shall receive the GIFT of the Holy Ghost. <br>  Act 2:39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. <br>  Act 2:40  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. <br>  Act 2:41  Then THEY THAT GLADLY RECEIVED HIS WORD WERE BAPTIZED: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. <br>  Act 2:42  And THEY CONTINUED STEADFASTLY in the APOSTLES' DOCTRINE and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. <br>  <br>  Jas 2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.<br>  <br>  Thats how to be saved from torment, fear, and run off the devil. <br>  <br>  If not the devil might tell you, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"

You use mujer if you are older, married or want others to show you more respect as a woman.  You use chica which is the correct translation for 'girl' if you are young, single in other words it is almost the opposite to 'mujer'.
