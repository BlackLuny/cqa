zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.|`|By2ZR1lfaa	cuz way yahoo rool werd a yooo g upp i kool 2 kool|`|AA11960743	Questions that do not receive Answers are removed from YA.

Either through the start menu > control panels > fonts (make sure you are using Classic View for the control panels - it's much easier). OR go to My Computer > Drive C > Windows > Fonts. Drag the new fonts (just the ttf/otf files) from the extracted folder or wherever they are into the fonts folder. A box should pop up showing that the font is being installed.<br>  <br>  The font should now show up in the font list of all your programs. If you have any programs running you will need to quit and restart them before they see the newly installed font. Worse case scenario - if the fonts aren't showing up, restart the computer.

5b5gOsIJaa	because if you think about it were given points and if we keep on getting points and theres no way to get rid of them not many people would answer questions on yahoo answers because your just getting points and thats it so what they do is say if you want to ask the public a question you have to loose points because its taking up the readers time so you loose points which makes you eager to answer more questions. and if you need to publish a question and have no points then yahoo answers is saying help someone out and you can get your points back. <br>  <br>  <br>  so basically answers take away points because they want you to help people to get them back =))|`|JLayHNZCaa	Because they can.

f7mosa6vaa	Take your mouse to the area of what you want to copy and then click on the left side of the mouse until you have the entire portion highlighted in blue that you want. Then press the Ctrl Key and the C (letter) key at the same time, that means you have now done a copy. Next step is to transfer the info you have copied into the area you would like it to be pasted into. Once you have that area just click again on the Ctrl Button and this time use the V (letter) key to paste.  That is it for Copy and Paste.<br>  <br>  If you have areas that you would like to have your personal info placed into certain Boxes, ex.

VQdqogD7aa	The Yahoo! mail button (envelope) on the Y! toolbar will not show the mail alert (number on the evelope) unless you are signed into Yahoo. One indicator that you are signed out of Yahoo is you see some default buttons on the Firefox Y! toolbar (behavior is different for IE).  I suggest you add the sign out button to the Firefox Y! toolbar.   Click the pencil icon, move mouse to Personal Options, click Add/Edit Buttons and under Choose Your Buttons, check the box for sign in/sign out button (under Other).  Now if you are signed in, the sign-out button will have an arrow pointing outward and conversely if you are signed out the arrow will be pointing inward.

You just dont know whose looking at these pictures downloading them and doing god knows what to them.  If you have posted pictures, please, please, please take them off as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  The parents of these children would be well within their rights to sue the a s s off you.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	it's not a big deal.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	No, it's not illegal.  Anyone out in public is fair game for a photograph, and any photograph you can legally take is legally owned (copyright) by you, and can be distributed, with a few exceptions, like if you take a photo of JUST the McDonald's logo, and post that as the picture at the top of your hamburger company's website.<br>  <br>  Naked photos of kids are a different story.  Even the kids' parents can be arrested for taking those.<br>  <br>  p.s.: the witness protection stuff people are talking about is a one-in-a-million thing that most amateur photographers are probably unaware of.  Even if it did come up, you could probably fight it on the basis that the parents/government didn't adequately protect the child, if they let it run around in public getting photographed unintentionally.|`|szyrw5P0aa	no. its perfectly legal as long as its not kiddy porn.|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	i doubt it is , some photographers put their phhotography on flickrs as a profolio .. im sure it would be okay.|`|YfsqXG3naa	it is not illegal but not safe a well <br>  display them at your own risk|`|GQbF0Twiaa	Yes it is because if the children are under protection or other circumstance   you could get sued thats why schools need parental consent to post pictures of students on their websites so just ask the minors parents for consent and you will be fine|`|0YvZPfe4aa	Uhm, i would ask the parents of the kids BEFORE you do that, just so they dont freak out when they see their kids pictures on some chicks webpage haha.

I answer questions mostly in the Yahoo! Products section, and usually hang around Yahoo! Answers and Yahoo! Photos. However, I do stray to other sub-sections of Yahoo! Products. The questions that get fifty or more answers are usually something that everybody knows the answer too. Polls, in the Polls & Surveys section, get a lot of answers, because they require little to no knowledge to answer. The reason some questions get two answers is because they are more obscure, and the answer is somewhat "arcane".

That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. Remember, it has to be in the JPG format, and it must be 5 MB or less. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile.

You will be taken to a page where you will see three boxes. One says "No Picture" underneath the box, one says "Use My 360 Picture" underneath the box, and one says "Use My Avatar" underneath the box.

RtmZ6cLWaa	The towel trick is the worst idea for your xbox. All it does is overheat your xbox and reset the motherboard chips to make it think it never had the red ring of death (RROD).<br>  <br>  If you still have your seal on your xbox under the faceplate then you probably send it in to Microsoft.<br>  <br>  If you dont have the seal or you don't want to wait a month or two, you can always try to permanently fix it yourself. Here is a video that can get you started.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19bTAWSAFWk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19bTAWSAF...</a><br>  <br>  Or you can always get a third party to fix it for you for pretty cheap.

HyUE9ON0aa	Please also check your flyleaf question. I explained something else over there.<br>  <br>  @@@@@<br>  <br>  There are a few reasons why your question got deleted.<br>  <br>  1- You posted a link that is flagged by yahoo, it could have been a photo hosting site or any site that might have a lot of nude pics on it and yahoo just automatically deletes it and then waits for you to file a complaint. 99% of the time they will tell you that they were right and your question had to be deleted.<br>  <br>  .<br>  2- Your question might have been asked the wrong way and might not have been a question at all. For example when you ask a question don't say give me a star or give me a thumbs up on the question itself. Ask it in the big box where you can type whatever you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  3- You might have run into a troll with multiple accounts that reported your question and if a new question gets flagged a few times it automatically gets deleted.<br>  <br>  4- You might have run into a Yahoo Nazi with a good reputation and those guys can also flag your question and it will get inspected and deleted.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	what was the question|`|4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	I didn't really look at the questions you have, but many are against terms of service just based off the questions.  I suggest you take a closer look at the following questions:<br>  <br>  "It's my birthday!  Give me a star!"<br>  "What is your favorite action movie?"<br>  <br>  I could probably find a few others.  They might not be against TOS, depending on what else you typed.  "What is your favorite action movie...and what makes it a good movie?" is not against TOS because it requires more than an opinion - it requires you to really analyze something in the answer.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you could make the "It's my birthday" question fit within terms of service.|`|Tx2Uk0KVaa	Most likely you posted it in the wrong category, just like your latest question.

Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.<br>  <br>  Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|cWuumdy7aa	a self satsfaction that you are god in answering and you are of help to others. dont look at in money term|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Acquiring/accumulating points allows you to move up through the Y!A Levels ... each successive Level awards you more Y!A privileges.<br>  <br>  That's it ... that's all ... no prizes!

Pls ask ur friend to send the message  by typing <Unblock All> to 58242<br>  <br>  Also remember ...that the recepient of the text msgs needs to reply to atleast one for every three text msgs they receive ...as per the yahoo & their partners' agreement ...else that mobile number gets blocked  again...and u will get the notification in yahoo msnger  while trying to text that particular number !|`|IiWz11Kraa	If you can't send only to one number, probably it's their problem. Check if they have text message plans on their phone.

It's good idea if you are going to wear bikini's or revealing shorts, like for gymnastics, etc. Don't feel stupid, we only find out things by asking someone. We all need answers about life at some point. Hope this helps.

ID for things like Mail, IM, Answers, etc. then you'll need to hide your 360.<br>  <br>  There are a few different ways to do this,<br>  <br>  1) Select the "Settings" option at the upper right of your 360 page and change all of you settings to 'Private'. This hides the majority of your content, if someone stumbles onto your page.<br>  <br>  2) Perform option #1 and then select the first "Display Me As" option on the Settings page. Now your profile doesn't link to your 360 page. Also, UNcheck the "Activate Simple URL" setting and the "Friend Search" setting. This way people cannot guess your 360 page by sticking your yahoo id onto the end of 360.yahoo.com or searching for you by name or email address.<br>  <br>  3) Perform options #1 and #2 and then delete your friends by selecting the "My Friends" link in the upper right of your 360 page. Select "Edit Settings" on a friend's name, then select "Remove <friend> from your Friends Page". Finally, delete all of your content, blogs, links to pictures, lists, reviews, etc. This pretty much makes your 360 inaccessible and/or unusable by anyone who happens to get there.|`|6d4f4168988ba4441ea73bbf75699962aa	You can't delete the page as it is all tied in with your Yahoo! account but you can delete everything off the page and make all modules viewable by just you and then go into your 360 My Page and click on Edit Contact Details and make the rest viewable by just you.<br>  <br>  When you get to the Basic Info tab, under where it says Yahoo! Identity Display, make sure the first option is selected then save and then no one will be able to access your 360 page.

AA10311580	???Changing the country for preferred Yahoo! is relatively easy to accomplish. First click the "My Account" link near the top of every Yahoo! page. Enter your password when prompted, you'll be taken to your Account Information page.<br>  <br>  ???Click the "Edit" link to the right of the "Member Information" header, you will then be taken to the Edit page.<br>  <br>  ???Scroll down to the "General Preferences" section. You should see a link reading Yahoo! +incorrect country next to "Preferred Content", click it. From the pull down menu on the next page select the Yahoo! content you'd prefer to see then click the "Finished" button. Click the "Finished" button on the next page.<br>  <br>  ???Your Yahoo! should now show content pertaining to the country you selected.<br>  <br>  ???This does nothing to your e-mail address if that's what you're asking, it merely affects the information displayed on Yahoo's main page. You can not simply change your e-mail from yahoo.com to a different yahoo. The only way to accomplish that would be to start a whole new account in the Yahoo! of your choice.

R8bxlEwXaa	If you are using the 8.1 messenger, you should receive an message telling u to try later. If you are sure you put in your correct Id and password. Occasionally yahoo messenger service does go down..|`|rP7Kt7KMaa	That happened to me before.  My system had a worm.  Do you have a good virus protection program?  I use AVG.  It's a free download, and works way better than Norton.  It was the only program that found the problem.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
