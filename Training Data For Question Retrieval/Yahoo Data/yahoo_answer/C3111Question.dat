20090128182117AAUsdki	Local Businesses;Australia;Brisbane	Living in Beenleigh, Logan City.?	I'd like to hear from only those people who live in Logan City, in particular the Beenleigh area.  How do you find the neighbourhood, the facilities, the people, the public transport etc?        Please include your age group and how long you have lived in the area.  Positive and negative comments are all welcome, however if negative please explain your viewpoint.      One thing I've learnt is that people make a difference.  The people of Logan City are sitting on a gold mine (in my opinion) due to the central location between Brisbane and the GC.  Yet there seems to be a real 'struggle town' vibe in many Logan areas, what do you think could change this mentality?
