20090131150412AAf5lnM	Pets;Dogs	Which gender do dogs prefer?	I didnt really know how to healdine this question. I have a female pitbull and two male kittys. I have heard from several different people that female dogs prefer men(human men) over woman and males prefer females(human females). For example my female dog seems to want my boyfreinds love and wants to impress him more than me. (Even though I spend way more time with her and feed her and walk her and let her sleep and snuggle on my side of the bed at night,without kicking her off or yelling at her that traitor lol ). Then, my male cats ALWAYS come to me. They NEVER sleep on my boyfreinds side of the bed and always come to me for attention. Can you imagine how I sleep at night? One cat on my pillow in my hair, one at my side then my dog in between me and my boyfreind under the covers lol and my bf who is 6'7 260pds lol!!!     So anyways is it true? Do female animals prefer male humans and do male animals prefer female humans?? If so why?
20090131145830AANMGi6	Pets;Other - Pets	Why do people STILL not get their pets spayed and neutered?	I volunteer in an animal shelter and see the very sad results that occur because people let their animals breed. They think "Oh I found homes for all the kittens/puppies" but the "homes" they find just mean that so many more cats and dogs left in shelters will just stay there longer (or be euthanized on death row if theyre not adopted in a certain amount of time). Also MANY people will adopt a kitten or puppy because theyre darn cute, but when the animal grows bigger and maybe stops playing and starts sleeping all day or eating too much, they get bored, realize they didn't really want a pet, and drop their unwanted pet off at a shelter, or worse, thrown it outside, unspayed and unneutered to start the process of breeding unwanted animals all over again)      Why oh WHY does this still happen? Are people just blind?

Before the wheel, he potty-trained himself to pee in this house i got for him, but now, his bathroom is the wheel...So, what do u think? What kinds of toys should I get for him?
20090131144946AATgH0x	Pets;Birds	Death of a lovebird - Why?	I've had what I guess to be a Male love bird for 2years - got him in a local pet store so I'm now sure how old he was at that stage.   He seemed to have "a back end problem" in the beginning as his "output" would sometime not drop but for the past 6 months or so this seems to have cleared up very well, he had a companion but she escaped one day and from then on he seemed to improve both in health and also plumage.   about 2 weeks ago out of the blue one night he began a serious cheerping session - kind of like the sound you'd hear in April when a Blackbird would be startled.  This lasted for about 20mins and during this time he flew iratically around the room.   The bird was tame and this was completely out of character - his normal evening procedure was a quiet snooze baking over the range.   However from then on his health began to deteroate.   He became - only at times - very wobbly on his feet and sometimes was not able to perch on his roost at night - he also had the option of a nest box for sleep in which he did on regular occasions.   also during these periods he seem to lose control of his head which would arch backwards and to one side.   HOWEVER this might only last for an hour or so and he'd be fine again for perhaps a few days.. his eating pattern and "output" were all normal.   In the past week the problem seemed to escalate and the instablility became more frequent.  I also noticed that where he normally used to pick up a seed he now was dragging his beak along - spreading seeds everywhere to pick up one.   Yesterday I brought him to a local vet as he had become really really bad in a matter of a few hours, who suggested two possibilities.. A brain tumur or an inner ear infection.   He did inject him with an antibiotic and also an anti inflamatory  but sadly I lost my love bird late last night.   I'm just curious if anybody can shed any light on if the diagnosis by the vet was accurate or is there something I've missed in minding lovebirds...   Diet was: Grass, grated Carrotts, lovebird specific food, egg food, iodine block, fish shell thingie (can't remember the name) and 100% pure canary grass seed. Fresh water and lots and lots of freedom and heat.

I am concerned because I have some guppies that I'm planning on breeding in the tank and I've never been very good at effectively killing Ich off. My question is, is this really Ich, or could it be something else (I know Velvet has a slightly similar appearance)? Also, I know tetras and snails can be sensitive to some Ich medications, is there anything I can use that won't harm them?    Also what is the most effective way of successfully treating Ich?   Thanks for any answers.

20090226081720AAVFM7G	Pets;Other - Pets	I fostered a lovely dog that was in a dire situation on behalf of a local rescue that promised me full back up?	They have always said that they are fully responsible for all costs involved in the dogs well being and advised me to send any bills straight to them for payment. I had to do a 300 mile round trip to pick the dog up from where he was, he had to go straight to the parlour as he was absolutely filthy and then off to the vets as he has a severe infection, all of which I paid for and sent the receipts on for payment as requested. It took nearly four weeks of love and care to get him fit enough to undergo surgery and it has been about six weeks since.  To date, despite other people donating money to help the cause and people telling me to just be patient and give the rescue the benefit of the doubt, there have been no payments made to either my vet or myself to cover the ￡600 that the treatment has cost so far. Every time I contact the person to ask what is happening with the bills I just get lied to and the old "cheque is in the post" excuse. I now love the dog and could not imagine being without him but the whole situation is embarrassing when I have cause to visit the vets for any treatment on my own pets. I know it is really difficult for everyone nowadays and that rescues are struggling too but I really do not know what else I should try before I consider taking legal action, any ideas?

20090226083832AAsKtub	Pets;Dogs	What blood does my dog have?	So I needed a dog, and I got this intelligent mutt from a shelter. He was different in many ways, but here's the biggest one: I haven't seen any other dog, except on TV as in National Geographic, hunt prey the authentic way!      There are woods close to my house, where jackals, armadillos, wildcats, etc. live. It's illegal to kill any of those, but it's not illegal to kill rabbits or hares... which, um, he did yesterday. I used to wonder why he would sometimes lie on the mud path looking alert, and I got my answer. Prey! First he watches, then he rises a bit, then inches forward very, very slowly. Picks up momentum and begins walking with long steps, rising vertically little by little... and then... wham, he goes for it! What blood might he have? My doc said he's got some terrier in him, which I'd guessed from his feet.      He's about 24 lbs, and less than 1.5 feet high. Photos, hosted on Yahoo Geocities, see below! Many thanks! I'll send you a postcard from here if you'd like!       http://www.geocities.com/the1wolf_com/fr...     http://www.geocities.com/the1wolf_com/fr...     http://www.geocities.com/the1wolf_com/si...

20090131160506AAa0zgN	Pets;Dogs	How to house train when you are not around?	I adopted a 7 year old beagle/cattle dog mix back in May. She is the sweetest dog in the world, loves people, children, & is so gentle. She was kept in a kennel outside her whole life w/ rarely any attention (she was 7 yrs old & didn't even know her name when we got her) so now that she is a lap dog (yes, a 40lb lap dog), she is in heaven. She has her issues (animal aggression, pulling on the leash, constantly licking the carpet, jumps on people) which I'm working on (unsuccessfully hehe). She was not housebroken when we got her & learned very fast.  Here's my concern...if nobody is around to let her out she will just go. If we are around she will alert us & hold it if she needs to. She won't go in her crate either. But if we are not there to let her out, then she's going. She went in my car the other day! I've been crating her which is another issue in itself. She hates it so much & it breaks my heart. We stopped doing that for a while & put her in a room w/ linoleum floors & she chewed the doors & scratched the paint off. I live in a apt, so peeing on the floor & destroying things are not an option & she's been going in her crate. How in the world do you house break a dog when she only goes inside when you aren't around??
20090131153250AAQK6sZ	Pets;Rodents	I need another rat but..?	Okay. So I don't get people hollering at me, I'll explain it.      I have one rat. one. Yes I know, you're suppose to have two, but you CAN have one as long as you spend tons and tons of time with him or her. I do spend plenty of time with her, but I think she may get lonley during the times I can't be with her.She has lots of toys, but there is still a high chance of her getting bored/lonley since whenever I go to open the cage door she runs up to my arm and crawls right onto my shoulder to cuddle and won't let me put her back in her cage.       FIRST OF ALL :    I didn't buy her from a pet store, I adopted her from an animal shelter that I've volounteered at since 2006. {I'm 14 now}.      The people who brought her in said they were moving far away and couldn't bring her. Apperently she's always been alone while in their care.      I've had her for about 3 or 4 months now. She's been doing great but as I stated before, I think she's starting to feel lonley.      I really want to get another rat {female obviously}, to be her cage buddy. The problem is, my mom refuses to buy another cage because we don't have enough extra money right now because I just got braces.   And if we can't get another cage, that would mean just introducing them face to face... which COULD turn out badly.      I know some people say that introducing two female rats are easier because some of them are less territorial but I really don't wanna take a chance of them hating each other, and then one getting hurt really badly or dying.      So first part of my question :       What are the chances that they'd fight if I got another one? 50% 50% ? Or less? More?      Second question :      Does anyone have any other ideas of what I could do?         Okay, and I just thought I should add that she is in a large cage, so she has plenty of space and toys.   Also, I do spend around 3 - 4 hours with her per day. Spred out, of course. For an hour in the morning before school, an hour when I get home, and hour after dinner, and an hour before bed. Usually that's how it works.      Thankyou so much for your help, sorry for this being so long. Feel free to add in any experiences like this that you've had.

When we got there i recognized that her dog had a large lump on her belly. She got spayed a week ago on thursday and the lump is right where the insision is. We convinced my grandma to come back to our house with us (she hasnt had power since monday) with her dog too. I think this is the first dog that my grandmas has had that was fixed so she might have thought this was normal after the surgery so she didnt say anything about it. The dog was spayed up by our house because she was adopted up here and it was free through the shelter. Anyway, she is going to the vet early next week to get looked at but i was wondering if any of your dogs have experience this or what you think it could be? It doesnt seem to bother her at all or tender, and its squishy like its fluid. Any ideas?      Thank you. I'm just curious.      sorry so long

I am thinking when my kids are older I might foster pregnant or nursing dogs but cannot figure out how I will work it.      i took in a pregnant stray almost a year ago and she went balistic if my other dog was even in the house and I know a new mom / mom to be is not going to be in the mood to meet and play with 3 new dogs....so I am curious how you do it.      I was thinking of sectioning off a part of my yard and then building a shed and seeing if i could have heat and air in there so the dog would not have to be around the other dogs but I dont know...This is not for some (4ish) years in the future so I will figure it all out eventually.      I am also concerned about possible diseases and such but I guess I would get over that.      Also, what do you all use as flooring in the welping boxes as not to destroy your floors? I had the pups and mom in my bathroom and from the pups pottying on the papers my tiles peeled off the floor...

20090131184906AAFSaHi	Pets;Dogs	Adopted 1 YO German Shepherd she's very shy-timid is this normal?	Hi, I was given an approximately 1 year old German Shepherd dog 4 days ago who prior to me was kept by a family who found her as a stray while they looked for the owners. During that time they kept her on one of those slide cable things for almost a month.      Aside from needing to gain a little weight she is a great dog, very mellow, doesn't jump on people or bark at other dogs or people, but cats, she can't resist chasing them which I have witnessed one time only.      The problem is she likes to be in her large travel kennel that I set up for her in the garage even though me and my kids will be playing outside. She will come out for a bit then go back in the garage and hide. She won't eat in front of me or take any snacks. She loves my wife and kids and will go to them when they call her but like she is more shy and timid around me almost like she might have been abused by a man before. But still she never tries to snap at me.      Do you think in time she will grow out of this timed nature and open up to not be so shy around me?       Is it normal for a dog to need time to settle in?

I decided none of those were good. so based on the traits i listed earlier what are good male hamster names for a fast, running, orangy tan hamster. thanx. b.t.w if i decided to name him a name on your list you get ten points.

20090131202521AAQab5C	Pets;Fish	My new guppy male swims funny...?	Hello!    I recently ordered 4 guppies. 2 neon blue tux, one male and one female; and 2 blue cobras, one male and one female with three red crystal shrimp.  One shrimp died : (    Anyway, it was from liveaquaria.com who has been fantastic about the shrimps death btw.  So my cobras are swimming fine and so's the female tux.  It's my male blue tux that's swimming often with his nose up and tail down, not a sharp curve but definitely noticeable.  He's freakin HUGE, my God I've never seen a guppy this big before!!  His tail is ridiculous in size.    His scales are smooth, he eats fine, good color, no bloating, full unclamped, clean and clear fins with no tears or nicks.  So he looks the epitome of healthy, except for his swimming quirk.  Good water quality, air flow, 78 degrees, no one else has issues and he's been swimming like this since he arrived and for the last 48 hrs.  He moves fine when feeding, and when darting around with the others.  But sometimes when he's moving slow or resting his tail starts to drop and his front end starts to rise.  Is he sick?  Or is his huge tail that freaking heavy? Anything I can do to make him feel better?  or is he fine right now?  Thanks : )

The crate seems to work nice but we (I have a 5 and 4 year old)  like to play with him too and let him out but he sneaks off and does it so quick and in hard to find spots.

20090131192703AAsIgOl	Pets;Dogs	Should i adopt a dog after my baby cat died of 17 years? am i rebounding?is it unfair to the dog i will adopt?	i tried going to the rescue shelter but i broke down and cried cuz I cant love another cat like my cat. They just dont give me the feeling my cat did nor can they take his place. they cannot make up for the past 17 years i had with him & all the love he gave me growing up. So i thought about getting a labrador retriever because this dog just clinged and hugged me for 5 minutes and i started to cry becuase i really needed a hug/consoling. I went looking for a pet out of desperation-feelings of wanting to commit suicide because i cant be with my beloved cat. No One can take his place and another cat just repulses me & makes me want to throw up cuz they are not him or anything like him. I just went down there taking the stupid advice of others that cant nor understand my specail bond with my cat of 17 years. YOu just cant replace someoene you love inthe same way we cant replce our mom/dad etc. plus i dont want to betray my cat-he was always the jealous type with other cats. So im still worried if i get his dog which is 700.00 from a store that ia m getting him out of loliness and rebound for my beloved cat. is that fair? And none of th eother dogs at the shelter made me feel loved like that lab did at the store. Plus i dont want to go thru the re tape of adopting from a shelter-long drwan out applications, checks, and they woulnt even let me touch any of the dogs-only see them thru a window. It was a really bad expereince and id rather buy a dog knowing we just click. but i dont want my cat to be mad or think im replacing him with a dog alhtough i know he would feel that way if it was a cat. doe sthis make any sense? i know i will never love anyone like my cat-no one can replace 17 years growing up with my cat. but i dont know how to deal with being wothout him and alone and become very depressed and suicidal. i'm scared. and if i were to do anythign to myself i will not see myc at in heaven. im sure my cat will not want that. when i cross the rainbow bridge i will be looking for my cat not any one else pet wise. My cat is my true love. i'm sorry that i feel this way. but just like people in our lives 1 special someone comes in our lives like no one else! I just want do do what is right! and still please my cat an dhelp myself without hurting anyone else emotionally. how can i do this? if it were up to me i would be with my cat 4ever and not even need to go thru adopting a dog.

The other night when he was in the kitchen eating my boyfriend said he heard a loud bang and now Benji is scared of his food dish. He'll eat the food but if you can convince him to get it out of the bowl himself he snags it as fast as he can and eats somewhere else. The bowl is in one of those metal frames that lifts the bowl off the floor a bit. I'm thinking maybe the bowl wasn't settled in right and when he went to eat and it settled it banged and startled him. I've been tossing him food to lead him to the bowl and coaxing him to eat out of it while praising him but the fear seems to be getting worse. Now he will only eat if the food is on the floor. Help!

20090131202932AAqN4h9	Pets;Cats	I am scared for the safety of my cat. We adopted a new cat and he is so mean to her!?	This may be a long question but here it goes...      We recently adopted a new cat (male, one year old). We already had a cat (female, probably 12+ years old, originally a stray) Now this new cat attacks her. Sometimes she will act aggressively towards him, but 9 out of 10 times it is his doing. I'm really concerned about the safety of my female cat. She has maybe five different scab spots under her fur. We try to cut the male's claws as frequently as possible, but she is still getting some scabs. Tonight he chased her under my bed and was still attacking her until I screamed and chased him away. I'm starting to think we should give the male back to the shelter... this would break my heart because as mean as his to her he has grown on me somewhat. I was also wondering about getting his claws removed so he couldn't hurt her anymore, but my parents think it's too inhumane.       What do you think would be best, giving him back to the shelter, getting his claws removed, or is he not really hurting her too badly that it is dangerous for her health?

I have always wanted to bring home specimens for my home aquarium, but i know that the only way to do it legally is to get some sort of permit. Ive been trying to decipher the Canadian laws on this, but i cant seem to find a definite answer. Just wondering if anyone has experience with this. Maybe you can point me in the right direction.    And before anyone goes off on me about reef conservation. I certainly do not intend to damage coals, or deplete the reefs. Im talking tiny frags, that i will care for and hopefully watch flourish in my tank. Once they reach appropriate size, i plan to sell frags from them to local reef aquarists, and LFS. There is literally 2 stores  within 3 hrs drive of here that sell SW live stock, and there stock it quite limited in selection, quality and amount, not to mention grossly overpriced!! Actually my dream is to begin a coral aqua culturing farm. That way there is less pressure on reefs. Of course this is going to take time...

To set the scene I got my cat from the shelter in June of 08 and of course she had the typical respiratory infection that most every cat gets in the shelter.  She finally got over it and went sneeze free for a long time.  Now all of a sudden yesterday she started sneezing a lot and often 3-4 times in a row.  Other than that she seems to be a pretty energetic cat and her eating is good.  Could this be a reactivation of the virus she already had when she is a kitten??? She has not come into contact with any other animals so I highly doubt she caught something from another animal.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Ok, well I have a few guppies already, some male and some female, and today I went to the pet store to get a couple more, and the pet store worker was absolutely no help, he had no idea which fish was what. So I picked out three female fish, and I have no idea if they are mollies or guppies, they look very very similar, but with only a few slight differences. Th new fishs' tails aren't very spread, and they have a little more color than my other female guppies and they're shaped a little rounder. I know for sure they are pregnant. Please help me figure this out?   Any help at all would be good, from tellingif it's a guppy or molly or even guppy or molly pregnancies, anything would be a huge help.   Please

20090131192702AAIz771	Pets;Dogs	How often should you walk a dog?	I live with my girlfriend, and I go to school and she works. Both of our schedules vary, hers week to week, mine month to month.      What I want to know is if I am gone 8 hours a day, sometimes all at once, sometimes spread out in two 4 hour segments, and my girlfriend is gone less than myself, but sometimes for 8 hours a day or more, is it feasible for us to get a dog?      I want to adopt a dog, but I don't want to get one and not be able to walk it as often as it should be walked. Most likely, I would be able to walk the dog at least once in the morning, and once when I get back, but those times are varying. There would be little to no consistency as to when the dog could be walked.      I really miss the companionship of a dog, and I have been fighting with myself to decide whether or not I would have the time to be able to walk it properly, but now I ask the internet for help.       How often should a dog be walked? Minimum? Maximum?

20090131195751AA5B7sH	Pets;Dogs	Big dog and small yard?	Ok, so I have one dog already. She's medium size. There are four kids in the family, two six year olds, an 11 year old, and me(13 years old) We might be getting a dog soon. I have been researching breeds alot but I just want someone's opinion. We have a very small backyard, and an invisible fence. We live by a golfourse(thats why we can't have a real fence we have to have an invisible one) The dog would get one or two walks a day. So we need a kid/dog friendly breed of dog. Boxers are my favorite breed but I just dont think it's fair to have a boxer, because theyre so hyper, and they need a big yard. I love big dogs and really want just a friendly, loyal dog. What breed do you think would be right for us?

20090131202347AA7Giee	Pets;Rodents	Rattie care questions?	I just got 2 rats. Socrates (sock), a standard cream capped male last saturday, and Epicurus (Epie) a double rex on thursday. And I have a ton of questions...I want to keep them healthy and happy, I'm so attached to my little boys already...(in fact, Sock is sitting on my shoulder right now =D )      1. Will they be ok together? They have gotten into scuffles, but I think thats normal... Sock seems to be the dominant one, but the little squeaks from Epie are gonna give me a heart attack. There isn't any blood.   2. Epie seems to have diarrhea. I think thats just from the stress of moving, but how long will it last?    3. He also poops a LOT. He'll get over this after he gets used to me, right?   4. Another Epie question...Hes a bit smelly. I spot clean the cage and just yesterday I gave it a total scrubbing, so I'm so pretty sure its not my fault. Is just because he's a male? And if so, why doesn't Sock smell like that?   4. I want to get them neutered. What are the risks? How do I know that the vet is experienced?   5. How can I tell what age they are? The store I got sock from said he was about 2 months, but the store I got Epie from said he was around a month but he's bigger then Sock.   6. And can someone recommend a cage for them when get older? Maybe something more pleasing to the eye then those martin's cages..   7. What are foods you CAN'T give to your rats? I've read some things online that said no citric stuff, green bananas, soda, etc. And is it true you can give them chocolate?

20090131144036AAwxO9m	Pets;Dogs	Anal Gland and Fishy Smell Question...?	Ok here's the deal. 7 month old female, not spayed (have prepaid appointment in late Feb). Today we were on a walk and two huge dogs came up to say hi (they are friendly) and my dog got extremely scared. She started growling and tried to run away. This was right near my house and when we got inside I noticed the horrid fish smell. I looked on YA and I know it could be anal glands or some sort of infection. I read dogs can express their own anal glands when they are scared and what not. SO my question is, how long should I wait before taking her to the vet? Should I wait until monday to see if the smell goes away? I have no money and it will have to go on a credit card and I'd rather wait to see if it goes away and it was just because she got scared but if you think it needs to be dealt with asap then I'll put it on the credit card.

20090226091625AAZajBc	Pets;Dogs	Is soiling the crate and carpet normal puppy behavior?	I have a 12 1/2 week old yokie. Only had him since valentines day. I thinks he's doing ok with potty training. He goes to puppy pad, sometimes with watching and coaxing and sometimes on his own. However, he pooped in his crate yesterday before I got home to him on lunch break(4 1/2 hours) and today, my boyfriend came hime at 11am to let him out and he had already peed in crate and was laying in it. Came out and went to puppy pad to poop and a few minutes later he peed on the carpet. He knows where the pads are. Is this normal or should we be worried. I thought dogs didn't do that in their crates.
20090226091044AAt1hP6	Pets;Dogs	How can I teach my puppy to walk on a leash?	I got her a week ago and she's a 4 month old pit-bull. The first day she walked perfectly but since then she mostly refuses to walk in my direction, especially if it's away from the apartment. She's used to wearing a collar, but I do take that off when she's inside. She doesn't really bite the leash unless I give it a small tug (I do not pull hard at all), and using treats has absolutely no effect on her. I've tried different treats, different toys, different people walking with us..... she WILL walk with another dog though, but I take her out at least 5 times a day so I can't always have my mother's dog with me. I've read several methods and tried them and nothing is working so far.       Maybe it just takes time? And please don't give me any advice like this: "As long as he knows who's boss, it shouldn't be too hard. Just be assertive in your mind that you're the pack leader, and he will follow. It doesn't really matter how old they are." I can assure you that she is not a mind-reader, lol, and I do realize the power of the pack-leader... Should I try using a harness?

20090131144037AAr23Qq	Pets;Dogs	My uncle's dog is acting sick...?	Her name is Kali. She's a 6 year old chocolate lab and she's a bit obese. She's been spayed for about 5 years now. She loves to eat stuff and when she gets the chance to eat something (edible or not) she will eat it. At the moment she isn't eating a lot. She'll mainly only eat soft foods. My grandpa gave her a bone and she started coughing and gagging a little bit after wards. She's been lying around all day in corners. She didn't even get up when we were eating dinner. My grandpa just tried to feed her something with gravy and she wouldn't eat it. She will even eat tomatoes (if that gives you an idea of how much she likes to eat.)  My uncle is going to take her to the vet Monday morning, but I would like to have some ideas in advance. She was around a dog that was diagnosed with kennel cough a few days after she was around him. That is one of our ideas. If you think that it is kennel cough than can you put some facts about it and symptoms? How is it cured? Will it cost a lot of money? And can a person carry the sickness to another dog? I don't want my dogs getting sick and I don't want my uncle's other dog getting sick. I have a 13 year old dog so it probably wouldn't be good if he got it and my uncle's other dog is 10 years old so it wouldn't be the best if he caught it either. So please, if you can, I would like those questions answered. I know that we can't catch it but I was just wondering if we could transfer the sickness. And if you have any other ideas of why she might be sick could you put information about those too?       Thanks so much, in advance!

20090226091202AAJgham	Pets;Dogs	How to build a no-kill stray dog shelter with only a few resources?	Hi, I'm trying to build a no-kill stray dog shelter in Brazil. I already have the space needed for it, but I'm having trouble trying to find the best cost-benefit ratio for kennels...      Trying to summarize it, my budget is very, very short, but I'm able to bring a few fundraisers if I can bring a good, yet cheap project. Thing is, the materials I'm looking for either are too expensive or not usable. For walls, I'm looking for a sturdy, washable and if possible, soundproof surface. Same for the roofs.      Here in Brazil it's too hot, and I'm trying to find good ways to bring a cool climate to the kennels, and at the same time provide a good soundproof building, but they're like mutually exclusive. I'm thinking of openings at the ceiling to let wind currents flow through the kennels, but i'm kinda septic about it's real effectiveness.      Well, I tried looking into the internet, but there's only projects of yes-kill shelters, which are all good, but are not applied to the amount of dogs i'm planning to give shelter (30 kennel cages for such an expensive project? no thanks).      The most important part are the kennels, that I need a good projecting. I already have a good personnel chambers, infirmary and quarantine places projects.
20090131144344AAys1Tw	Pets;Dogs	What breed of dog is right for me?	Now this may sound strange but I think it's a dog's saliva the stirs up my allergies. So I need a dog good for allergy sufferers that isn't "lick crazy", hairless, or extremely yappy, if at all possible. I also have two cats and another older, easygoing dog, so a dog that gets along well with other pets would be nice, too. And last but not least, a small/toy dog.  I know it's a specific request but if anyone knows a good dog breed that fits this criteria, please share.

20090131144022AA3gQrc	Pets;Dogs	Is it normal for a new puppy to be shy and timid. He clings to me and doesn't eat much! ?	We have just brought him home. He has been in his new home for 3 days now. He is a 6 month old dachshund, but he is not too playful. He clings to me drastically. Every once and a while he will start to venture out and explore the living room, but he is still very timid. He has not eaten alot. I am just concerned that he is not eating enough. I have gotten him to go out to "potty" but he has not yet pooped. I would just like to know if this is normal and if he will get better. Please any input would be great. Have a Great Day!!!!
