zSABr7praa	My husband is a marine, so when I found out that we conceived right away, I went out and bought a little pair of baby shoes, and set them next to his combat boots with a little note that said "make room!"  His reaction was priceless :)  We both cried!|`|AA11305357	To tell our parents we were expecting we got each an "I love Grandma/Grandpa" bibs and presented at a weekly dinner. <br>  These were easily found at baby stores, and then the grandparents each had a bib for their house.<br>  <br>  When it was time to find out "what" was in my belly, I had the ultra-sound technician go in the hallway and call an awaiting bakery that decorated a cake with the correct color of gender.<br>  Then we had a party that nite, and found out the same time as everyone else that we were having a boy!<br>  <br>  This is now everyone's favorite story....|`|1lgKBfTlaa	Well this only works if you don't have a very small family...But when my cousin found out she was with child she went to every ones house in the family when she knew they wouldn't be there and left a little note for example on my note it said you gonna be a big cousin on my parents door it said your gonna be great uncles guess who is pregnant and so on it was so much fun trying to figure out which one of us was pregnant|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	A cute idea is getting people close to you together and giving them shirts, key chains, coffee mugs, etc that say their role to the baby. Get the grandparents something that says world's greatest grandparents or that such and give it all to them together. I have seen this done and it is so cute to see how excited everyone gets!|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	I know someone that gave their mother a baby blanket as a present. That pretty much made it obvious.|`|YfTwfeGIaa	I found out I was pregnant with my first the day before April Fool's Day. We saved the phone call to our parents for that next day, and they thought we were fooling! It was so much fun and none of us will ever forget it.<br>  <br>  I found out I was pregnant with my second child in December, so to announce it I bought our parents both a little ornament that is a tiny board book. On the last page of the little book, there's a slot for the baby's picture. In that slot I put a piece of paper that said, "Picture due August 2004".|`|ApyrV5J9aa	It probably wasn't the craziest way ever but when we told my parents we were pregnant with their first grandchild we found really neat Grandma and Grandpa coffee mugs and wrapped them up. It was New Years Eve so we said we had a late Christmas present. As soon as my mom opened it, it was instant tears. My dad, on the other hand, was so confused, but he took one look at my mom and figured it out. It was and awesome response. They were almost as excited as we were...and after us trying for 2 1/2 years they were just as ready as we were!|`|d7bJIgqlaa	I'm not even preggers yet, but when we get there we are going to invite our parents over for lunch and while we're preparing tell them I want to show them a few things we've done to the house.  So, I'll take them upstairs and maybe take them in our room and show them the color I want to paint it, then maybe have a new picture hung in the hall or another room, then take them in the room that will be the nursery.  That room will have been cleared out and we'll write a note in pink and blue paint on the wall to tell them!  What a fun time!|`|AA11607835	we thought of a few things with telling our parents. for the mothers anyway. we found out a week before valentines day that we are going to have our third. we were going to go to a store and get a bracelet box, or soemthing and put the pregnancy test in it...then we thought about making our parents shirts with something sayin that we were pregnant... like ' we know you love your 2 grandchildren, we hope you love the third!' just silly things like that. we ended up giving them roses with a note tied around them telling that we were pregnant|`|r3jMts26aa	The day i took my test I took a pic of it and sent it to my boyfriend through text messaging. He said he opened it and almost fell out of his chair. But he was excited!! Good luck with telling every one hope it goes well!!|`|ToIGNS1Maa	I will be suprise about it|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I took a pic of the positive test (digital that said "pregnant") and emailed it to some of my girlfriends. I wrote "Look what I just got" in the subject line- they all got a kick out of it!
2Jh7YH9yaa	ooh im so excited for you, congratulations....  the cramps are normal i was always worrying about stuff like that, i had them to if your really worried ask your midwife or call the doctors, i now have a beautiful 4 month baby, good luck :-)))|`|p0prrzf2aa	yes it's normal you'll have cramps here and there every week possibly. it's just your uterus stretching.|`|kj507W26aa	It could be normal, but every women and pregnancy is its own case.  It could be that your uterus contracting  making room, stretching for the baby, thats why you get these cramps. Either way call your OBGYN and ask the office nurse.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	I am 7 weeks pregnant as well and have been having cramps like that. I've been told that they are normal and that they are caused by stretching ligaments due to hormones and pregnancy. Try not to worry about it unless you start bleeding. Trust me, I know it's hard not to freak out, especially when it is your first pregnancy. I'm in the same boat. :-)|`|w17xLr8waa	The same thing is happening to me now, except I don't know if I'm pregnant. Does it happen when you move quickly all of a sudden. I feel a little crampy today, more than the last 2 days when this all started. I just woke up one morning with the most bizarre and painful ab pain. Ah. then the next morning and last night when i turned in bed at 3:30! Also sometimes when i sneeze|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Having cramps like period cramps is normal during pregnancy. It is your uterus stretching. Get yourself the book What to Expect When You're Expecting. It will answer any question you may have and eliminate the confusing answers you are getting from people.|`|DWLfKACYaa	yes, this is normal - it's just your uterus stretching. If they get too severe, contact your hospital/doctor immediately|`|a1x0xqARaa	I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks.  I first started bleeding, then cramping came the next day and got worse and worse as the night progressed.  Eventually, I had to go the ER.  It never subsided.  Your cramps, however, do subside after resting.  The cramping you're feeling is your abdomen stretching to make room for the baby.  It's normal.|`|YfTwfeGIaa	I had that with my first child pretty badly and thought I was miscarrying or something. Upon calling the nurse and answering her questions (was I drinking plenty of fluids, was I bleeding?), she deduced that my problem was likely round ligament pain. This occurs as the uterus expands. If you have extreme pain or just feel uncomfortable or nervous, call your doctor and ask about it. It'll make you feel better.|`|DVHfPdWIaa	It is normal<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnanc...</a>|`|kvCa4xCmaa	its normal it is just your uterus stretching.. when i was pregnant I constantly was crapping

He does not have much room, but his muscle tone is much stronger than ever before.<br>  <br>  He may get sluggish right before labor, but not all babies slow down.<br>  <br>  First babies do engage or 'drop' more than second or third babies. They can 'drop' up to two or three weeks in advance. Second or third babies may not drop until labor has actively started.<br>  <br>  The best sign for you that labor is imminent is your effacement. That means your cervix is getting thinner. Next it will start to open. Contractions that open the cervix are labor.|`|mbGOEZSAaa	My first baby was calm throughout pregancy. Second baby was active everyday, all day until she came out!
1ezYfkX7aa	I am going to say its your period...with each of my kids a month later on the dot i got my period.|`|A9j7ahwsaa	yeah probably your period i wouldn't worry|`|KLUPLlzsaa	Sounds like you period<br>  <br>  I am 3 1/2 weeks postpartum and I am starting to get crampy. Sounds like you are getting it! I did plan on breast feeding but my daughter was 36 weeker and her jaundice was over the top. I had to suppliment with formula. <br>  <br>  so the reason to mention that is ...that becasue i stopped breast feeding, i think my cycle is coming. which sucks. I  just had 2 1/2 weeks of blood...than it stopped for a week...and now....SHEEE's HEEEERRREEEE (the dreaded monthly)
a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Hi there. I was told that I have a tilted uterus too and I am currently pregnant. I had sex in the doggy style position, and this is probably tmi but if I didn't reach the big O during sex I made sure I had one right after wards because it is said that when a female has an orgasm it brings the sperm closer to the cervix, therefore increasing the chances of pregnancy. Then after that I turned over, put the pillow under my hips, and took a nap. Good luck! :-)|`|KLUPLlzsaa	Yes and it worked. <br>  <br>  What I did to concieve my 3 week old daughter back in may was I used a pillow and stayed laying there for about 10-30 minutes<br>  <br>  <br>  why? the gravity actually makes the "boys" swim better..."up there". and you remain relaxed. It takes 10-30 minutes to actually get the chance to swim up there and make their journey. <br>  <br>  It works, trust me<br>  <br>  I have a little one in the crib right now because of that! :) BUT you need to make sure you are actually ovulating or going to be.|`|t4HXotwEaa	I have a tilted uterus.  I also have two children and one on the way.  I didn't even realize that getting pregnant was an issue.  good luck!|`|eya1WDS4aa	I have a tilited uterus to. and i did use the pillow under the hips and thats how i got pregnant. im not sure about the rear entry part but i did get pregnant with a tiltied uterus.
kgE96Nhcaa	Cheese and peanut butter will become your best friend.  I would call the Diabetic Clinic not wait on them to call you, they called me the same day the MD referred me and gave me a counseling over the phone and then set me up for an appointment the following week, they wanted me to come in the next day, you should not have to go long without support.  They told me I could call them anytime with questions and that no question is silly, we are talking about a baby's life!  They gave me how many carbs I was supposed to have with each meal and snack (this varies depending on how far along you are).  Protein is important.  Splenda is the best and safest sweetener if you absolutely have to have sugar and it also comes in packets with added fiber (big help for constipation).  You can't have as many carbs in the morning because that is when you have the most issues with insulin resistance.  I hope this helps!  You need to avoid unneccessary sugar and you will have to start testing your blood sugars (probably four times a day- morning, and after each meal) the clinic will give you a meter.  Find some peanut butter crackers that you like and that aren't recalled they will come in handy!!  Good Luck! Oh, and don't eat FRUIT before dinner- very important!|`|fdalc5Rcaa	i have and im 23 weeks i am pregnant with my 5th baby but only had it on my 4th child and now this one with my last one who is 2yrs old now the doctors had to put me on 80 units of insulin a day because my sugar level was the same as yours is now and this time im back down to see if i need insulin again next week ,my last child was born 2 weeks before her due date and i had to have a c-section and was told i would be the same this time .what i eat in a day every day is as follows ......<br>  breakfast : two wheat a bixs <br>  lunch:fruit and a small salad with no cheese no dressing no egg <br>  dinner:pasta with canned tomatoes and an apple <br>  thats what i was told to eat and i was also  told not to drink milk as it turns into sugar ?? and not to eat sausages <br>  hope this helps|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I had it with my son and i have it again with this pregnancy, keep away from too many carbs, bread/pasta/rice, also sugar intake. If you choose to buy fake sweetener I was told to check the ingredients and avoid No.55 sweetener.<br>  My son was born at 8 pound 7 ounces and no traces of diabetes was found in him or me afterwards. I really watched what I ate though.<br>  Good luck :)|`|87WOSjwgaa	Arent they going to do a 3 part glucose test? I failed my first one as well but they made me do a 3 part one and I passed that one just fine.|`|kj507W26aa	First of all, AVOID all table salt, salty junk foods like, all chips, sunflower seeds, bologna, ham -is high in salt,  wienies, spam, salami, canned vegetables and canned fruit and  Soy Sauce. Limit your bacon and brkfast sausage (high in salt) .Avoid eating creams, sauces, creamy soups, and canned soups -all high in sodium.Drinks lots of water to rid the excessive water retention you holding on to. When you consume large amounts of salt (sodium) your body bloats, retains fluid and raises your blood pressure to dangerous levels. <br>  <br>  Take your prenatal vitamins, Eat more fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, salads, water, 100% juice, Broiled or Baked or Grilled Chicken & Fish.<br>   <br>  Just listen to your dietitian when she meets with you, and please dont be bashful to ask questions, over & over if you dont understand.  Take notes.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I had gestational diabetes.  They should send you to someone who is going to teach you how to use insulin and also a nutritionist.<br>  <br>  I followed the diet to a T  and my babies came out 8 pounds 3 oz and 2 others real close to 9.  That doesn't seem so bad when you start hearing about 10-12 pound babies.<br>  <br>  They wanted to push me into cesareans but i refused and had healthy vaginal births with no complications whatsoever.<br>  <br>  As far as what to eat you should of course skip all sugar.  Potatoes and rice should be very little.  Same for corn and really most grains.  I would get like a sprouted bread that is Ezekial bread around here.  The main thing to limit is starches and sugars of all kinds.  Oh and fruit juice and of course soda.<br>  <br>  With all that said, there is a delicious world of protein and fat out there for you to discover.  Protein and fat won't affect your blood sugar unless you really overdo it.  <br>  <br>  It would be a good idea to look into the Southbeach diet, it is moderate level of carbs and you definitely have to watch them with diabetes.<br>  <br>  Now the really unpleasant part is that I was dg with T2 this past summer and some people think that if you have gestational you are on the fast track to diabetes, you just have to watch your numbers and check your bs prolly monthly after this pregnancy.  I wish I had caught mine quicker but the docs only check for fasting and I have learned that that is the last thing to get out of whack, I'm just telling you this so you can catch it sooner.
KLUPLlzsaa	Okay first of all...deep breath  in and deep breath out.<br>  <br>  Things to remember...<br>  <br>  If you second guess things that your doctor is saying to you...NEVER  be afraid to ask why and for what reason. No one deserves to k now what is going on with your body more than you because you are taking care of yourself AND a developing baby. <br>  <br>  Secondly...don't focus on the discomfort so much. That was my mistake and actually sometimes it made it worse. I am sorry that you are going through bad symptoms...they usually get better around the 3-4th month...for me...it was the opposite. My symptoms didn't come in UNTIL the second trimester!!! I thought i was going to be lucky. But...I had the symptoms until I delivered her 3 weeks ago! <br>  <br>  And yes....I had a prenatal appt on my 8th week (because i was anxious and thought i miscarried  because i had a miscarriage 2 months before conception of my daughter) and then the real one was my 12th week...so yes, some practices believe that the real care doesn't start until the 10th - 12th week where u/s start...<br>  <br>  Meanwhile...take your prenatal and don't worry too much. Worrying does terrible things to your body and emotions. <br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrads! :)|`|AA10125373	You need to look into going to a different doctor, that doctor seems a little shady and she isn't listening to you like she should be. The ultrasound that you'll be taking tomorrow should tell her how far along you are and how retarded she is. Don't stop taking your prenatal vitamins, they're good for you even if you aren't pregnant.
IdWleKAyaa	I get these same symptoms when I am pregnant..soo could be see what a test says<br>  good luck|`|a3da1bda5a289229e8f75cf00c867112aa	Sounds like the symptoms I've had (except for the smell under my arms) before I found out I was pregnant. I kept testing before my period was due and all the tests were negative. Then on the day of my missed period I got my first positive. I kept testing for two more days because I could not believe it.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	The only thing that sounds like an actual symptom for this early on is the cramping (without blood) that happens when your uterus is stretching.  I don't know if the hair growth would start this soon (it didn't for me) or the underarm odor (which I haven't at all).  With that being said hormones can do funny things and every woman is different in pregnancy so you just may be "with child".  Good luck to you :-)
g7wQij2Oaa	sounds like it might be possible! but if your missed period was on 2/15 you'd be fine to test now and the results would be accurate. if you don't wanna waste money on one thinking you will be getting your period, just get one from a dollar store. they really are just as good.<br>  <br>  :)|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Your nerves may have something to do with your period being late as well.  I am on my 7th month ttc, so I know the 2ww sucks!!  When I was pregnant and late for my period, I had AF cramping that made me think I was about to start.  That was a sure sign for me, it was strong cramping too.  You could be, I try not to test until I am 6 days late, but I sometimes give in and test and then with in a few hours AF starts, its almost like it relives you of the stress of "wondering" and lets your period start.<br>  <br>  But since you are late, I would test and see!  It sounds like you could be, and I hope that this is it for you, good luck!

3DI0ZJS5aa	You could well be having difficulties with your periods due to your annorexia. If you tested only 5 days after new years it would not tell you if you were pregnant or not. Do another test to put your mind at ease & get some help with your eating disorder, you are far too young for all this stress.

W1p6LetFaa	If it's centralized in your groin area, then it's not round ligament pain.  It sounds to me like your baby is either sitting on a nerve, or most likely sitting directly on your cervix.  It can be extremely painful, I know!  But it's actually a good thing, the pressure helps you to efface/dilate.  Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do except keep changing positions until you find one that doesn't hurt, or just have that baby!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	The last month of pregnancy, imo, was the worst.  I wasn't throwing up :), but there was pain and misery.<br>  <br>  Your particular symptoms might be because the ligaments in your pelvic area are loosening up a bit to help baby's entrance.  So anywhere bones are held together with muscle or ligament or tendons--in the groin area, there will be pain.<br>  <br>  It was very, very hard rolling over the big mama whale in bed.  I stopped going anywhere because we had bucket seats in the car, and getting out was excruciating for my hips.<br>  <br>  But you should look on the bright side--you're just about done!  You could start labor anytime now, or you could talk your dr. into inducing.  Your baby will be in your arms within the next week or so!!

o9u4H6m6aa	Your menstrual cycle is dependant on whether or not u are exclusively breastfeeding or not. if you supplemement even a little or pump and give a bottle for even just one feed a day, you can get you're cycle back right away. If you are breastfeeding every 2-4 hours, you will not likely get your period until after baby starts solids.

I think is different for everyone.|`|IdWleKAyaa	well it depends if you are breastfeeding or not. I breastfed and got my period 4 mths after my c-sec but it is different for everyone
xzh8r0jIaa	im going to be getting the merena iud (im 39 wks and 4 days)<br>  it last 5 years, it releases low does of progesterone and it will eventually cause light to no periods. <br>  <br>  i wouldn't get on the depo shot- you have that done every 3 months. <br>  it can cause rapid weight gain, with me it deteriorated me teeth, so my teeth are in terrible condition now, (im 24 yrs old) it has been link to osteoporosis and tooth decay. i was on that for 5 years and will never use that method again. <br>  <br>  i think the merena is relatively safe. <br>  <br>  after you have the baby, 6 weeks after you will go back to you obgyn for a check up and that is when my dr said that he could do it then|`|kj507W26aa	We'll  I imagine the doctor is asking if you want your tubes tied, let him know now.  If your still too young and still want kids in the future, there are a wide variety of bc out  there.<br>  Of course, you cant any sex after giving birth until 7 or 8 weeks.   This gives your body time to heal, your floating organs to fall back in to their proper place and your hormones levels to calm down rid you from those pregnancy hormones.   So dont chance it... wait until its time to do so.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	try the nuvaring|`|ui7waO1haa	It makes a big difference on if you are breastfeeding. The doc typically would like to see a woman not have sex for about 6 weeks, but after that, there are many birth control methods to choose. One BC method I learned about in home economics is the depo provera method. It's a shot you get every three months to prevent pregnancy, and it's safe to use while breastfeeding. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.birth-control-comparison.info/bcdepo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.birth-control-comparison.info...</a>|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	You typically can't have sex for 6 weeks after you have the baby, but some people do it sooner... I guess your doc is looking to the future but are you nursing? That makes a difference on what you can take.|`|AA11538461	I think condoms are the best.|`|a1x0xqARaa	I'm on the NuvaRing.  I really like it because it regulated me.  Irregularity is something alot of women experience after giving birth.  But if you're planning on nurcing, you should check with your doctor.  Make sure you get on birth control that wont hurt the baby while nurcing.  Not sure how NuvaRing affects babies.|`|RKI8QOHsaa	hi it depends on you after my son i had the depo injection i put on a lot of weight and the pill made me feel sick im having the rod put in my arm in a few weeks hope that this time ive found the right one for me have you talked to your gp about all the different types there are|`|0mSpQjzCaa	I think birth control pills are the best.  they will help you get regulated after the birth,  but you will have to use something until you start again after having the baby.  I would suggest condoms.|`|ErmGlMKEaa	Remembering the pain of childbirth should be enough. :D|`|XIq3dR3iaa	IUD if you don't want anymore for a while..Stay away from the Depo Shot.
FQFnDkAOaa	Its possible.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i see these dumb questions everyday...<br>  <br>  <br>  possibly NO! but if your terrified take a test|`|ns1F0p8Laa	it's possible but it'll be good to take a test|`|a1x0xqARaa	Ovulation usually occurs 2 weeks before your next bleed.  And during ovulation, I believe there is only a 24 - 48 hour time frame where you can get pregnant.  Regardless of how long sperm can survive in your uterus.  I doubt you're pregnant.  Good luck!|`|LMkj8D8eaa	i just read the pee stick... it said......not pregnant.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	you could be... there's always that change, just in case you should take a pregnancy test.|`|pcpi2g4Iaa	its too early to tell if your pregnant. wait about a month|`|r3jMts26aa	it's to early to tell if your prego if this just happend on valentines day. But there could be a posiblity if he did have the sperm on his hands and it came in contact with eggs. My suggestion would be wait a couple more weeks for it to come if not take a test. Hope this helps!!|`|KLUPLlzsaa	first of all...the chances are....maybe 2%  that you are pregnant...<br>  <br>  Second of all, it would be wayy too early to be having symptoms...<br>  <br>  Third of all...if you don't wish  to become pregnant...be more careful. <br>  <br>  Good luck and be safe.|`|G766dQjtaa	wow really?! Just take a test after 5 days of your missed period and see what it says. It might also be that you are stressing over this.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	hahahahaha! NO your not!

I want to help but im only 15! uhhhh i would call the doc. my aunt had the same thing and she had to go see her doctor...|`|W1p6LetFaa	I'm not sure why everyone else is freaking out.  It sounds like one of two things.  It might be round ligament pain, which is just the stretching of the muscle that supports your very big uterus.  It can be quite painful - I would even describe it as a stabbing pain.  Otherwise, it most likely is the baby on a nerve, like you said.  If the pain is not just in your pelvic area but shoots down your leg as well, then it's definitely the baby sitting on your nerve.  Talk to you doctor if you are still concerned, but it's nothing to worry about!  Take some tylenol and keep changing positions.  I hope that helps!!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	it could just be a pinched  nerve but the best thing would be for you to call your doctor because everyone is different and it could be a sign of early labor. Good luck and congrats!|`|AA12045892	It sounds like round ligament pain to me, too. I had it much earlier in my pregnancy though. You are describing exactly how it felt to a t.

hoX7hoINaa	You may go into pre-term labor if you dont follow your bed rest instructions. However, the contractions should intensify for you to be in serious labor. I've had braxton hicks since 28 weeks, thought I have not dilated or effaced. Just be safe and follow doctors orders. Its too soon to deliver your little one. I've also had the mestrual cramping (in the stomache and back) but no signs of labor yet. Thats just the body preparing so I've been told.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	well, i'd say that your normal... usually when your in labor, your contractions tend to get more sever as they continue, if they're still mild, and you've been having them all night long, there most likely BH's still. But, i'm not doc, if your worried, it wouldn't hurt to just call them. :-)<br>  <br>  and as for the other pregnancys you had.. just remember each one is different.<br>  <br>  contractions don't usually last that long, usually they last a minute or two minutes at a time... 5 minutes is a holy crap!<br>  <br>  good luck hun,|`|o9u4H6m6aa	if it last 5 minutes it is not a labor contraction. it is BH.<br>  <br>  i had a client who had 'preterm contractions' since early pregnancy.<br>  not preterm labor, just strong contractions causing no cervical dilation.<br>  she had a full term baby. <br>  <br>  seeing as how your cervix is not dilating at all, those are BH contractions. you are not in preterm labor.
aXD49Izpaa	well lets see my boy is 10 months old and i don't think ive slept a full night yet im guessing in 17 years and 2 months my insomnia will go away  finally. but yeah teh 1st  month was bad for me everyone goes through a period of no sleep.  his mom and i took shifts to make it easier to nap here and there throughout the day though<br>  <br>  yeah  his mom was the same way she would just be completely tired but could not  fall asleep
nUTkKa1vaa	I totally sympathize with you--I was the SAME way.  I would freak out getting blood drawn, and it was a horrible experience for me.  I psyche myself out even though I know it's not really THAT bad of a pain to have a needle in me.<br>  <br>  However, after having two kids and being poked, prodded, stuck and cut more times that I like to think about, I have a few tips :)<br>  <br>  I would get a lovey for you to hold...a stuffed animal, a squeeze ball...anything.  Then practice breathing in and out, very slowly. I would "zone" out and pretend I was elsewhere, doing something else.  No one could talk to me, because it would screw it up--but I could just hyper focus on whatever I was thinking about, whether it was seeing my baby laugh for the first time, or that awesome vacation I took the past summer.  It's really mind over matter.  (this works for getting through contractions as well!)  Sometimes even counting to ten over and over again helps you to focus.<br>  <br>  After a while, it DOES get easier.  And after you have your baby, you will find your fear of needles will DRASTICALLY diminish :p<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|Xc02z608aa	I'm not quite as bad as having a phobia about needles, but I really, really, really hate them.

For example, the glucose screening test has a high chance of false positives. and the course of treatment is controversial at best. If you are healthy, eat well, and do not have any risk factors, doing the test may not be useful.<br>  <br>  Just a guess, but is your anxiety due to the loss of control over the situation? it doesn't sound good to put yourself through so much anxiety for something that is not even necessary.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i would talk to ur doctor about it. needles freak me out,but you just have to tell your self its only for a second and it dont really hurt. i.v. freaks me out,thats the only part of labor im freaked about. if i even see someone with an i.v. i throw up. i dont know how im going to deal with that.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	i feel your pain i was just in the hospital yesterday and they had to do in i.v. and i was freaking out she told me if you breath calmly it will make your veins stay open and not get too small where it is hard to get a needle in. i was also not watching i told her to tell me when so i wouldn't jump so i just talked to my husband while she did it. the thing i am worried about is the epidural that freaks me out...<br>  <br>  so other than an epidural and just regular needles just try and stay calm and dont watch just know when it is coming

Sitting up will help too.|`|xdIrhRY8aa	You probably shouldn't, go to the pepto web for more details, and ask your doctor.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	yes! you can also take tums and benedryl and sudafed, plus Tylenol|`|G766dQjtaa	I'm not sure, you would have to call your dr and ask.

W1p6LetFaa	First off, the pull-out method does not work... I am pregnant right now because my hubby and I were using that "method."  Secondly, what you are describing sounds like it might be implantation bleeding.  This occurs on average about 5-10 days after conception (if you conceived) when the fertilized egg implants itself into your uterus.  It usually lasts a few hours, up to 2 days, and is either pink or brown in color.  If you don't get any more spotting, then I bet you are experiencing implantation bleeding and may be pregnant.  But if the bleeding picks up and is enough to fill a pad, it is your period.  Take a test in a few days if your normal period does not show up, because you may be pregnant!|`|EOW8DOoNaa	im a young mother to a 4 month old im 19 years old by the way and my early symptoms were always being tired ALOT / eating ALOT! / using the washroom More then normal.. / Moodyness / and hard breast not nipple breasts and it would hurt if i was lying on them..|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	You should take a pregnancy test to be safe. The symptoms before your period can be gas, bloating, and cramping.|`|mFvfkuSyaa	You could be or it might be your period getting ready to start. Wait until your period is late and take a test to see.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	sometimes periods just start out with the brown/red spotting, thats just sometimes your periods way of saying "get ready, cause i'm going to get ya soon!"<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm sure your fine.|`|erKyfwSbaa	It could be your period. Go get a pregnancy test. They have very effective ones at the 99 cent store. But you may need to wait another day or 2 for correct results.|`|AA11635143	OMG, I hope not.  You sound like you are too young to even be having sex.|`|RMUNhjDuaa	it could be implantation bleeding,but get a test if your period doesnt arrive or if it stays "light pink"...<br>  <br>  gd luck|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Everyone's symptoms are different. You can take a test now, but if it is negative, you might still be pregnant. It is more accurate when you test when your period is late.|`|hJWjSWYXaa	Ok so this is a link to a site with the symtoms of PMS Symtoms <a href="http://women.webmd.com/pms/premenstrual-syndrome-pms-symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/pms/premenstrual-...</a><br>  and this a link to a site with Early pregancy symptoms  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/baby/features/pregnancy-symptoms-what-they-never-told-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/baby/features/pregn...</a><br>  so check them both out if you still think your pregnant wait till you comply miss your period till you take a test!
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	There is always a chance that you could get pregnant when you have sex. However, your chances are pretty high that you wont get pregnant this time. Usually a woman ovulates halfway through their cycle. Ovulation time is the only time you can get pregnant. Since Im not familiar with your body you might be different and ovulate earlier or later in your cycle. Chances are pretty slim that you're pregnant this time though.|`|44278221d0b910f7e2de63fcd827b10eaa	Yes.|`|AA11605393	duh...YES|`|1cRANJXNaa	Ok lemme say this again i just said it like 5 seconds ago yes u can get pregnant right before your period on your period an right after your period. I tried to argue my case with a guy who used to be a doctor the other day an he just gave me a weird look an told me i was wrong by saying i couldn't get pregnant right before my period. An people say its very unlikely but i don't think so because it has happened to quite a few people including me.|`|mrYX3kU3aa	yes, there is always a chance you can get pregnant|`|LMkj8D8eaa	eh, not likely....<br>  <br>  <br>            but... theres always a chance for precum.|`|6Szm2sXlaa	Yeah|`|7oPZbdnEaa	Yes, you can get pregnant on you period to!! Precum!!|`|h8NacUyWaa	yup yup yup. <br>  :D|`|RMUNhjDuaa	Yes,their semen in precum-- gd luck to what ever u want!
v3Motq8Iaa	It's "not likely".  But "not likely" doesn't mean "impossible".  It's possible.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	Any kind of sex.<br>  In the water<br>  on the bed<br>  in a hot air balloon...you will get pregnant. Depending on condoms.<br>  It doesn't matter if it was dry,wet,damp,cold,hot, you might get pregnant.<br>  <br>  And anyway I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ohhh i'm a dummy.....ythey had their underwear on.....NO THEY'RE SAFE!|`|hswTS1jVaa	Probably not, but if she missed her period, she should take a test and find out.|`|zHcDt8t7aa	Its impossible to get pregnant like that. She probably is just worried and thinks she has those symptoms. I she is that worried then go to the doctors!|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Not pregnant. Her "symptoms' are in her head. Learn the game before playing it.|`|duinadV4aa	no get a sex ed class|`|n7O2MyT2aa	no u can not get pregnant from dry sex! the penis has to enter the vagin and he has to *** inside of her inorder for her to get pregant she's fine! girls come late on there epriod all the time...dont mean she's pregnant :)|`|OT6vCUU1aa	No it isnt possible. Her stressing about it may be the reason she hasn't gotten her period. Stress causes menstrual cycles to be irregular. Tell her to relax put a heating pad on her back. She will be fine|`|3zxVzPBxaa	impossible... sperm in vagina is only way HELLO.<br>  <br>  she probably has an STD, or someother problem only a doctor could help her with, thats who you need to ask......a doctor.|`|YBqrJsWxaa	If she is pregnant from this 'dry sex' she wouldnt have a bump after around 8 weeks, Are you sure she's not attention seeking? Sounds more like a stomach problem of some kind|`|Dwdbv9LLaa	It's possible. Sperm are quick swimmers, and once fluid mixes there's no telling what can happen. Chances are very slim, but she should definitely take a test.|`|aN7lmNmoaa	Close to impossible, but not impossible at all.|`|dNpW73gdaa	no it has to be 3 or 4 inches inside the vagina
82WfjykRaa	Hi, i actually just asked this question & i read yours out loud to my husband & he asked me if it was me who wrote it...lol<br>  My period was over about a week & a half ago but i had spotting for a few hours 2 days ago then it stopped.<br>  I have had cramps on/off ever since. I took a hpt but it was neg. & it is too early to test anyways.<br>  I am stumped! <br>  Please let me know how it goes for you.<br>  Good luck hun.
ZfRucXTMaa	Yeah it is definitely possible.  You can always get pregnant with unprotected sex which is essentially what "pull out" method is.  It is only as accurate as your husband is.  It would also depend on if you were ovulating. Anything is possible.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	There is no such method as the pull out to prevent pregnancy. The only ones are Condoms and birth control pills. There is a good chance you are pregnant. this could happen to you any time of the month even on your period. You should know that after having a baby.
KTvJmdJgaa	Hi, am due my baby on saturday! this is my second. ive had a few little niggles but nothing unbearable! i got told by my midwife its the baby's head moving down. if u feel it to bad just phone labour ward and they will just ask u to go in for an examination, u might be in early labour... who knows!!!<br>  <br>  good luck with everything, i really hope my baby is on time as i really don't want to go over due!!! x x x|`|72SrLDQ3aa	They're probably contractions.|`|m2aznd8xaa	i went through the same thing too .i didnt experiance it with my first child either. i was told that our uterus is much more relaxed and our pelvic bone too and so they are more flexible so there is much more friction. i remember mine be so painful too. i couldnt even lift my leg to get dressed or to get in the tub.  during my pregnancy i had to pick up my 9 yr old girl from school and id leave like 20 minutes early because id have to inch my way there. i feel your pain hun. good news your are about to have it any day now which will be a great relief.   good luck and congrats|`|JjXFj2EBaa	Sounds like labour is starting, when I was 40 weeks I got this and it was like period pain at first, in the exact same place my lower abdomen, it increased in intensity until it was almost unbearable, go get the gas and air, it's great!|`|YRTNpOO7aa	Sounds like your in labour,if I were you I would ring your doc's asap to make sure.If its not than it could be practise contractions.<br>  If it is real labour then I wish you all the luck in the world,good luck :)|`|irGE84Qdaa	u should call the DR or a nurse it never happen to me u might go into labor or might not so that's why call a DR.|`|GG1TGdHQaa	PHONE YOUR MIDWIFE OR HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!! Basically don't get to alarmed but as a midwife any pain at all isn't good always get checked out n matter what it may be contractions or something else go and see... please.
GZ0bEbPuaa	It is probably discharge hunny.|`|hswTS1jVaa	It is discharge.<br>  <br>  You should take a pregnancy test.
MMj7YcXkaa	I had this same pain.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy!  I laid on my back and put my feet up on the chair or couch or bed.  It looked like I was sitting, but on my back...(i cant describe it any better)  I also laid on my side and always had a pillow wedged in between my legs, as to not put too much pressure on my lower back.  You can also take Tylenol.|`|t4HXotwEaa	k. this ones gunna sound super weird...bear with me.  lie on the floor on your back and have your husband/or whoever put your legs over their shoulders and have them pull your legs up and out.  it helped me sooo much i think it just takes all the pressure off your poor hips.|`|szE6NtO5aa	Sounds like sciatica. Very common in pregnancy. It is exactly a pinched nerve. Try not to over-work your hips/legs. I think stretching helps, but it is not a cure. Also, pregnancy yoga will probably help. Good luck!|`|AA11222790	Sit on a chair with no arms...sit on the chair backwards.  This will give you a nice open hip.  Then have your husband/mate rub you hips.  <br>  <br>  Try some prenatal yoga exercises.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps tylenol.|`|LuYCqs8laa	When i was pregnant, my doctor told me about this wrap that helps supports the stomach,  She said it might take some pressure off your hips,  You can buy the wrap at Babies R Us.|`|2ef40e5c5bbd847237d34322f0dd725faa	YES!! I went to a chiropractor and I can sleep and walk and dress again!! It's worth it, my baby is due 2 days before yours. I almost cried when I felt the relief, I went 3 days in a row 2 weeks ago and I havent had a problem since|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Hello sweety... I had this pain when I was about 25+ weeks..... It was really painful when I tried to walk and when I put pressure on my right hip..... I would just lay down and take a Tylenol to try to ease the pain.... it would work for a while but come back later...<br>  Just relax.....<br>  Good luck =)
5yAsj29Vaa	Take a test.|`|3oanK9hkaa	Next time you're at the store alone, get a test and take it at the store. Then throw it away. No evidence :)
IVNM1O5naa	I would tell the cops for sure..<br>  <br>  sorry about your situation. :(|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I would.    Because there is a chance the rape resulted in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I think you need to let them know.   Whether you keep the baby or not it will make the case stronger against him|`|4cehW3S9aa	I would definitely tell the police.<br>  <br>  Reason being, if he denies it, they can do dna to determine if he is the father.<br>  <br>  Are you a minor? If you are a minor, you couldn't consent to sex with anyone. That is all the more reason to say something.<br>  <br>  Edit:  The girl that said police won't believe you if you keep the child doesn't have a clue what she is talking about.  You can keep the baby and it isn't going to taint an investigation.|`|shKc7lZcaa	I'm sorry for your situation.  I think it would probably be a good idea to tell the police about it....<br>  <br>  Much luck to you|`|usrEJiZSaa	yeah , sure you were . the police will believe you too|`|MbmHripJaa	yes.. that is so sad-- i can't even think of what i would do.. and he should pay for every penny and die for what he did|`|FurcNJdEaa	yes girl,im so sorry for your situation.. make him pay for what he did don't let him off the hook, tell the police ASAP even if you want to keep it or not, if he tries and denies it they can take a dna test and it would be evidence and it will make you have the stronger hand, what a sick man...:[|`|c1paW0bAaa	You can't tell if you're pregnant 2 weeks after sex.<br>  <br>  Is this theoretical?  A joke?<br>  <br>  Joke answer - No, don't tell anyone.  The poor guy has enough to worry about as it is.|`|keMiLz42aa	I hope you are not asking for yourself....I would assume that your pregnancy would be a form of evidence. I would definately, at least, inquire about it with the police.|`|hSbnyr6kaa	most defenitly|`|xubIaiZaaa	Yes you do, he has done this to you, and should be made to pay for it
mIEiQcyMaa	You probably are not, but in the future I'm sure you'll be more careful and if it goes any further you'll use condoms.|`|FXINmF6saa	No absolutely not. There is no way that you could get pregnant after this event. It's not possible. First off there is no way in the world sperm can go through your underwear. Next even if you got "wet" there's no way you could get pregnant yourself. Also there's no way you could even get pregnant just by touching especially if he wasn't inside you. No, there is absolutely no reason to be worried. There is no way you're pregnant and if you're that worried which you honestly shouldn't be get the morning after pill or if it's longer then 24 hrs, try the Plan B pill. That will help you settle your worries. I wouldn't worry. Just be more careful try going on pregnancy pills so you won't have these problems anymore.|`|I8nIewQHaa	Your going to be ok. If he didn't ejaculate then don't worry about it. When people talk about pre ***, that's when it's inside you. If he was not then you really should be fine. When it comes to ovulating it happen on the 14th day of your cycle. Maybe if you are this worried about it then you might want to hold off on the sexual stuff.
MbmHripJaa	with my first son all i did was EATTTT.. it was like my stomach had no end. and then with my second son i just didnt feel like eating that much and at night i would always eat ice chips|`|OG4410bdaa	actually<br>  my husband had a feeling I might be pregnant because I WASN'T eating<br>  food aversions and fatigue were my first symptoms<br>  and my husband noticed both of them before I did...how clueless was I|`|HAIHByGOaa	I was not hungry throughout my entire pregnancy.  But I am 37w4d now, and you would think that someone has starved me.  I can not stop eating.  I am never full.  I just dont get it lol.  GL and Congrats!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Not me.<br>  <br>  I couldn't eat during my first trimester at all.  It improved with second trimester, and now that I am in the third, I am back to not being able to eat too much.|`|G766dQjtaa	During my first pregnancy that's how i was. During this one not so much b/c it was planned. So i knew what to look for.
rSCeB6T6aa	yes.  in the beginning of my pregnancy i would get weird tastes in my mouth when i drank any carbonated drinks.  But I no longer get that taste.  It will stop!  :-)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes and it's completely normal. It happens to a lot of pregnant women|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Its normal in pregnancy to have a "metallic" taste in your mouth.|`|3tVFWlqhaa	it happens in pregnancy
efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Some kids do better with a schedule.  I find that I do better with a schedule, or a rough idea of how the day is going to pan out.  I don't have every minute scheduled, but the kids know on school days what time to get up, get dressed, eat bfast etc....and on the way to school I will remind them what activities they have in the afternoon.  When I pick them up from school we always (almost) go straight home, they get a snack & a little bit of free time while I look thru backpacks.  THEN we start the activities and/or homework, somewhere in there is dinner etc.  We also have scheduled bath nights, Sunday, Tues & Thursday.  It just works best all around for us.  Now on the weekends it's completely different, we all enjoy down time, so weekends have no schedule and I do not put extra curricular activities Fri thru Sun for this very reason.|`|paHbLR9aaa	My daughter will be 2 in June.  She has a schedule, but not a down to the minute schedule.  She has all her meals at basically the same time everyday.  She usually takes a nap between 1 and 2 pm and sleeps for about 2 hours.  She plays before and after her nap, or runs errands with mommy.  After dinner she has a bath, we put her in bed and read her 2 - 3 stories.  But if we get a little off schedule we don't freak out.  Its good for toddlers to have a schedule.  There aren't many suprises in her life, she knows pretty much what happens next.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I have a loose schedule with my 13 month old. There are some things that we try to keep exact so she knows what's coming next.<br>  9:30 wake up, eat breakfast, diaper change, get dressed<br>  1:00 lunch time<br>  1:30 nap time (wake up anytime, but no longer than 2 hours)<br>  dinner varies<br>  bath follows dinner<br>  7:30 bedtime snack followed by quiet play time, reading stories, and toy clean up<br>  8:30 bedtime|`|ij5ivVUWaa	My 4 year old has a small schedule when getting up in the morning. <br>  Eat breakfast<br>  Get ready<br>  Brush hair and teeth<br>  Meet mommy by the door.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I only had the meals and naps and  bath ,bed times planned also. When they were babies I was careful not to overstimulate them but other than that Its hard to plan minute by minute. Our kids are older now and we have incorporated a homework time but other than that and school they have free times in between. We try to have a family dinner and a movie or game night as often as we can.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My kids, two 12 yr. olds and a 10 yr. old, only have the basic structured routing.  School days, up and eat and out the door, come home and play, homework after dinner, bedtime.  Other than that it's usually a free-for-all!  I just make sure that a lot of the play time includes doing things as a family.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I believe in a loosely structured routine. I know we have to do a,b, and c. I don't care what order anything goes in and I build extra time in.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I have a 16 month old and he has a schedule, but definitely not down to the minute.  I get him up at a certain time if he hasn't woken up already, eat breakfast and then either play or run errands.  Mid-morning there is a snack and we have lunch at about the same time every day, followed by a nap.  Wake up, have a snack (or dinner depending on how long he naps), play some more.  Dessert at 7 or so and then he winds down with a bath or cuddle time or story time before bedtime at 8.  Schedules are good for kids b/c it teaches them routine and this gives them security.  Down to the minute though is a little excessive IMO.
smsUZG4Iaa	well its not really my choice but all that matters is that you like it.. the names i like are more ethnic.. lol|`|VHHis05Naa	Yuck.|`|Elxuvon8aa	well I think it says Kendalyn (Lynn) people will always try to say ken de lynn|`|34VXCyvVaa	Kendalyn is lovely and different enough that you won't hear it everywhere.  Kimberlyn is okay, too, but Kendalyn is better.|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	Either make it two names, seperating the Lynn, or don't do it at all. Kendalyn sounds like Gwyendolin or whatever, no offense.|`|bfP8tjPKaa	very cute names...<br>  <br>  Kimberlyn Brooke<br>  Kimberlyn Marie<br>  Kendalyn Grace<br>  Kendalyn Rose<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|lg2RfcrQaa	Sounds like you've just made it up off the top of your head.<br>  Stop trying to be unique, it just ends up sounding stupid.|`|lk7iaxqkaa	no.<br>  WHY do people feel like they have to add on -lyn to every name?  There are names that are meant to have that at the end, but you shouldn't just add it on to make it seem more feminine.  It seems trashy instead.|`|A3w4VvyRaa	well my name is kimber.<br>  <br>  its short and simple,<br>  and people still call me kimberly. which annoys me to death<br>  <br>  <br>  i think kimberlyn would just confuse people more into calling her kimberly,<br>  so i would stay away from it.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	ooh! i really really like kendalyn. i dont think ive ever heard it before, but i love it!<br>  kimberlyn is nice, but not one of my favorites.|`|aD8Xmhdiaa	i like kendalyn, very creative :)|`|AA11940306	I like them both!=)<br>  Any of these should work for a middle name....<br>  Kaye, Kate, Tessa, Paige, Dawn, Rose, Grace, Amber|`|HDS3IGj1aa	kind of cute|`|SlxeK1p6aa	it has a certain ring to it <br>  <br>  if you like it thats all that matters|`|mndpyoV1aa	I don't like it at all it sounds way way to fake. same with the kimberlyn sounds fake and made up. despite that fact every will always pronounce it Kendal- lynn because that is exactly how it is spelled. I like Kendal as a first name but I think you should really rethink both of those names. Kendal Lynn sounds really cute as a first and middle name.|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	I really like them. They sound unique...but in a good way. They flow very nicely and they sound beautiful.<br>  I do like Kendalyn better then Kimberlyn though.|`|34ikhhtMaa	I know a girl named Kirklyn and I always thought it was a cute name but I love Kimberlyn!! It is such a great name!!!|`|zzyTe5LMaa	I like Kendalyn Leigh|`|tnF0zxgqaa	naaaaaaaaaaa|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I'm not really a fan of either. They look a bit made up...but whatever pleases you :) <br>  <br>  I'd go with Kendal Lynn instead.|`|6QmVSwhsaa	I like kimberlyn the best|`|f2801105f13387bb7dc143c4f514a260aa	Kendalyn is a unique name and she will be told that when she gets older...lol
bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I have a knock off of a moby wrap- five yards of knit fabric from the bargain bin at walmart. Cost me $2 total.    It's wonderfully comfortable- it spreads the weight across your back, you can carry your baby in so many positions (and nurse your baby in it) and your baby is so content to be next to your body.    I would definitely recommend a moby.    Here's a link to me wearing my 'moby'- it's just like the brand, only I made it-      http://www.flickr.com/photos/baviqua/321...    http://www.flickr.com/photos/baviqua/300...|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Sorry I dont have any pics but I do like it, but I have some complaints about it, I find that it tends to stretch while I wear it and she slowly moves down while shes in it, and I find that we both get way to hot in it because its summer here now.  I bought mine when she was about 4 or 5 months old but I really wish I had of bought it when she was really little.  It is good and once you get the hang of using it and wrapping it the right way its really comfortable.  People are always commenting on how cute she looks in it and how comfy she looks.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	I would go to the er and they will definitely do an ultrasound.  They should be able to tell if you have placenta previa with no problem|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Placenta previa isn't usually dx until the end of the 2nd trimester, any dx before that isn't worth much.  The way the uterus grows is that if the placenta is low lying, most of the time as the uterus expands it moves up and out of the way.    I had placenta previa as late as 25 weeks, at term I didn't.  The cramping and pulling is normal, lovely aint it, nobody tells you how uncomfortable pregnancy really is.    If you are worried I'd go to the ER.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	have they done U/S to check on the baby? my friend was diagnosed a few weeks ago and shse is now 17 weeks- she is havin twins i don't know if that has anything to do with it. but they told ehr that since she has plenty of time to grow the palcenta can move upwards     if you go to the ER for bleeding, they will tell you more- that's what my friend did|`|vaBVFsY3aa	You can relax, if the ultra sound did not show anything, you are fine.
1IDSGM71aa	Oh honey I'm sorry about your last pregnancy. That must be really rough. ((Hugs)) There really isn't any way to tell if this pregnancy will continue or not, except by waiting. Don't think about it, though. If you are really stressed out worrying about it then the stress could cause one. Just relax and try to tell yourself that if it's meant to be, it will be. I know that sounds so cliche, but I really believe that. I can't imagine what you went through with the miscarriage because I haven't had one (though I thought I had, for a while), but as a mother I know that it must have been hard. Just try to relax and wait for your period to not come and make an appointment to see your doctor. God bless and good luck! Let me know how things go, if you don't mind.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Intensity of the color means nothing. Lots vary in production and can cause differences in color intensity, as well as your urine doesn't have a constant amount of hormone.     A line is a line, and the darkness or faintness is not a predictor that the pregnancy could be in danger.    I'm sure with your past miscarriage you are really nervous, but just relax. One early miscarriage doesn't mean you will have problems with this pregnancy.     Congrats!|`|5DfSfyWfaa	Why don't you take a regular hpt? Those are supposed to be really accurate at picking up the HCG. Get a digital one.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	The intensity of color DOES NOT MATTER. If it says positive, even in the lightest of shades, you're pregnant. Every single strip and HPT has a different sensitivity level. Some will pick up an extremely low amount of HCG others have to have it over 50. You should schedule an appointment with your doctor and get confirmation, that way if you do have problems, you're in their records.
SEzIkGNiaa	Yes, some do.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Good parents still do.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Nope, most just beat and call it spanking.|`|5ieWhvYCaa	Yes, when i was younger I got my butt whooped like that a couple times.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Never have done with my 3 but I don't spank them (they have had the odd wee smack on the backside but not a full on 'pants down, spank til theyre crying' smack).    Some parents do though, yeah. I remember getting a proper spanking when i was young. Different methods work differently for different families.|`|ugy5wjftaa	i dont!!  and i hope others dont either|`|fyrj50Braa	I've never done that but i have spanked the kids didn't they do that in the victorian times?|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i don't really think many do that anymore. Most just stand next to, or behind them and spank them.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I'm pretty sure there are|`|GRyFxwTbaa	I haven't had to in a long time.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	I tried but my 18 year old nearly broke my legs he was so heavy lol!    Obviously just messing about. He had said something quite cheeky and I said "Don't think you are too old to put across my knee for a good spanking!" He then told me to try it so I did.    I have never spanked my children but then it does depend on your definition of spanking. I have hit them but as a painless warning that things should go no further and more to shock than anything else.    Now pulling on an ear that is another subject entirely!|`|joplKMsLaa	I'm not too sure about over the knee. Back in the days they do.  People don't do it public though. It makes them look like horrible parents.|`|rISHTfK3aa	Yes, some people still do this.|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	Yes. It is dangerous to spank a child while they are standing up. You could jar their back and injure it even if you don't spank them hard.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I do
Fsr2Rofzaa	it could be either pregnancy or period symptoms.  Sometimes I get sore breasts for the entire month from my period.  That very rarely happens but it has  so it very well could be period with you too.|`|3cdb0Tmraa	I had this, was not preg. the doc told me to take vit B. all the best to you!!|`|xUxliIJjaa	they're sore because you keep poking them.
EzuYExM4aa	i had mine at the beginning of february and they said "no news is good news"<br>  <br>  it only takes a couple days to get results and i'm sure they would have called if something was wrong.<br>  <br>  *Due May 25th with a baby boy*|`|jcXSNjowaa	they wont call if there isnt anything abnormal|`|YuVSDBkzaa	My lab never calls me. They send the results to my doctor and he goes over them at my next appointment.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	No news is good news. At your next appointment they will tell you everything was fine. If there was a problem they would call you in to do either another 1 hour or a 2, 3 or 5 hour glucose test. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|miPubuDYaa	It takes about a week to 10 days to get the results back.... The doctor probably will not call if everything came out ok. They will diffenitely call if you need to get the 3 hour done.<br>  <br>  I had to get both. My first one came out at 153 and 150 is cut-off.My 3 hour one came out well.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I knew my one hour results at my appointment that day. I took the test, had a ultrasound, and went to my appointment and found our I failed by one point. ERR had to take the 3 hour and passed with flying colors!|`|gYkQc8Lraa	OMG! YOU ARE GONNA BE A TEEN MOM TOO! YOU ARE A WHORE LIKE ME!|`|AGcwdZGmaa	sounds like everything is good then if they didnt ring you then its good news <br>  congrats
w5y4BTjkaa	For a girl I like Raine! And for a boy Tristan sounds perfect! I LOVE those names! And I know Shayla is not made up. An elite gymnasts' name is Shayla Worley. She's kinda my role-model! <br>  The names should either be:<br>  Raine and Tristan<br>  or<br>  Juliana and Tristan|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	Arianna and Julianna is my fav for the girls, and I like Seth out of those two. Good luck on the story.|`|1OpcR7bZaa	I like the boy names and Arianna and Raine are nice but I don't like the others. Julianna sounds too posh and prissy for me and I knew a girl called Alison who was a little bossy ***** so don't like the name now. Shayla is ok, its just not something I would use.|`|Od73sfkxaa	Arianna is very beautiful!<br>  <br>  and for a boy I like the name Seth.<br>  <br>  It's fun to pick out names even if you're not.<br>  <br>  But for me and my husband, we both picked out names separately, and then discussed the names we both found to find the best one!!<br>  we picked out Clarice (he picked it and I do love it) and Cedric (I picked it and he loves it lol) =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|ftvxAS3saa	girls<br>  Arianna   i loveeeee<br>  Julianna i lovee<br>  Allison i luv<br>  Raine i loveeeee<br>  Shayla i loveeee<br>  <br>  boys<br>  Seth    who seth greeen?  nopeee<br>  Tristen  lovvee|`|OHfZFR31aa	I like Julianna, Arianna and Seth|`|3jMsJXjGaa	I like Julianna for the girls<br>  and i like seth for the boys|`|61NKzPzMaa	Arianna - Lovely name but I prefer the proper spelling Ariana.<br>  Julianna - Lovely name but I prefer the proper spelling Juliana.<br>  Allison - Not too keen on this name. Alison is the proper spelling.<br>  Raine - Horrible.<br>  Shayla - Trashy & made-up<br>  <br>  Seth - Gorgeous name<br>  Tristen - Nice name. Nicer when spelled correctly > Tristan<br>  <br>  My favourites are Ariana, Juliana, Seth & Tristan.|`|LjzlgS0Iaa	I love Adrianna. I think it's very cute and definitely original. I can imagine her being an interesting character. Addie for short?<br>  <br>  Shyla is my next favourite. How about Shalha (Sha-la or Shar-la)<br>  <br>  For boys, my fave is Tristan. It goes quite well with Adrianna.<br>  <br>  xXx|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	From your list I like Arianna, Julianna, and Allison. I agree Shayla isn't made up. My daughter's friend in her class is named Shayla. And the boy names are just ok, if I had to pick between the 2 I'd pick Seth.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	If you aren't pregnant, than you really shouldn't be asking. In order to name a child, both parents really should have a say so, not just you the mother. Howeve.r, I like Arianna... and only Arianna|`|xrJqmRFqaa	I like Allison and Seth.  They sound like good names for characters.  I'm not a fan of the others, although Julianna is ok.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I ? Raine and Arianna, but spelled Adrianna|`|1CgCx1E2aa	i don't really like tristen. and its a story, make the names suit the characters|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	I absolutely love Shayla! I used it for a character name a while back and I found it was fun to use with nick-names. In my story, I had Shayla's boyfriend call her Ayla, and one of her friends called her Shay. I think it definitly describes a pretty, and kind, female character.<br>  <br>  I've always thought of the name Seth as being a name for an evil character. But I still like it a lot.<br>  <br>  Tristen (although I spell it Tristan) is a very strong name for a male character. It always reminds me of the movie Tristan & Isolde.|`|lQNGse10aa	Arianna i love it i think this is a brilliant name! very pretty<br>  Julianna it's classy and very feminine<br>  Allison i don't like this name. it sounds like [all is on]<br>  Raine it's cute<br>  Shayla um.. it's ok<br>  I only like Tristan not Tristen.<br>  (i don't like misspelled names)<br>  Seth im not crazy about this name|`|901f6618ea3fa1d1b7c9ed4a27d40a3daa	I love the Boys names and of the Girls i like Allison and Julianna the best.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	The names seem very similar.. I'm not sure if they would work together in a story. Good luck!|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	Those are all pretty, but there are going to be so many Shaylas in the future......that's a really popular name for some reason!|`|NxAj44lFaa	there great names for a story<br>  shayla is very pretty would go nice in a story|`|QS5QnHpbaa	All of the names seem okay but I really like the name -Seth.|`|HdyEDmncaa	those are cute names .  ;]
lkhCeAdJaa	Disrespectful....naaa.  but I hate holes in the knees usually.  The only exception is my teenager's jeans that come with the holes...you now the spending money on jeans with already made holes???(but that's a whole other story)<br>  <br>  <br>  lol@Des|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I don't know about disrespectful but it doesn't show much pride in yourself or where you are.  It looks slovenly (sloppy) and unkept. That may be why your school has a "no hole in jeans" policy.  That and where some of those holes are on some peoples jeans- like the butt or other places that don't need attention brought to them in a school environment.<br>  <br>  The "holes in the jeans" look is also nothing new. It's been around since I was a teenager and that was at least 20 years ago.  It look stupid then and sloppy.  People had a problem with it even when they wore them back then because alot of gang members were doing so.  I just remember all the public schools around me were banning those jeans left and right. I went to a private school so we wouldn't have been allowed to wear it anyways, but that's what I remember.|`|j2mRop0laa	My daughter would be mortified if they made her wear jeans withOUT holes. lol<br>  I have to buy *destroyed* or *destroyed skinny* jeans or they end up in the bottom dresser.<br>  I hope it's not disrespectful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10051_10901_455318_-1_12261_12203" rel="nofollow">http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a><br>  <br>  My husband thinks those are a waste of money. He doesn't understand fashion.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Obviously not if they puposely make jeans that already have holes in them!!!|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I don't think so, jeans that look like they are messed up are actually quite trendy now-a-days. Make sure school doesn't have rules against it though, at the middle school I went to, the dresscode literally said, "clothes with holes or frayed areas are absolutely forbidden" but in high school nobody cared one bit.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	It depends on the school dress code.  When I was in school, holes weren't a big deal.  Hell, a lot of pants CAME with holes.  But now they've changed it so that a hole can't be bigger than the size of a quarter and no holes above the knees.  So long as the school doesn't mind I don't see the big deal, especially with kids who are undoubtedly crawling around on their knees all day rough housing.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I say when there are holes in the jeans for fashion's sake, then it's ok.  Or like you said, little ones that don't scream, "I have a hole in my jeans."  Also a no no, holes on the butt or crotch!|`|AA11828439	Not disrespectful, but definitely not good sense.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	I'm sure these holes show far less than some of the skirts and shorts they are allowed to wear now.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Um no.<br>  <br>  Infact some jeans come with 'tears' or 'holes' in them.  It's the "IN" thing I guess.|`|vKYdV5r2aa	Not weird  at all , Most schools have rules against Holy jeans <br>  at least big holes in them|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Why not compromise, they make patches that are cheap and easy to apply to jeans.  :-D|`|6DiknmIxaa	It seems like every pair of jeans that are over $100 dollars have holes in them or the "destroyed" look. That's what's in right now. My parents always say something about them but that's what the younger crowd wears right now.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	No not really, Im a girl and have never had a hole in my jeans lol<br>  But my 3 brothers on the other hand, they just tell me its a built in air conditioning system|`|z0gdLgQ4aa	It's not disrespectful unless their is a dress code that specifically prohibits it.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Disrespectful to wear them to school?  No way!!<br>  After all, half of the jeans on the racks at the store come that way to start with.  <br>  <br>  The hole thing bothers me when it's cold outside and I can't find a pair without one, lol.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	you're supposed to stop pretending you don't see it when it's both knees?<br>  <br>  <br>  who has that kind of money to replace them as soon as they get holes? maybe it's a bonus, actually.  do you think the teachers give the kids extra attention when they get the idea from the jeans that the kids might be neglected?
rpdJ37Hoaa	There are different ways of thinking up unique names without having to hand out so many to each child...     Maybe if your first boy didnt have so many names, you would have more to choose from!|`|okgr5aPCaa	You and Joanna with the quintuplets (4 babies apparently... not 5) have the same names picked, only McGregor isn;t her surname, its a middle name.  Seriously... Joyanna, McGregor, Joel, McKenzie, Euan, Clayton, Lilian, Grace, Alyssa, Cayden, Deacon, Leon, Violet, Kyle... ALLLL in there. All spelt the same too.    Weird.      Uh, anyway...    ? I love the name Alexa, simply because I think Lexie is an amazing nickname. Ellie is cute, but not Ellie-Marie. Joyanna is horrible in my opinion... I don't like Hope... I don't like any virtue names.    ? Joel is a plain and boring name but there is nothing wrong with it so it's ok :) McKenzie is aweful, it sounds tacky and chavvy and more like a surname or a sports brand that a name. Kyle is again a boring name, but nothing wrong with it.  Clayton is again too much of a surname and doesnt go well as a first name.    ? Emilia is too dressed up for my liking... Emily or Amelie are ok though. Lilian-Grace doesn't sounds nice at all... too out-dated and sickly. Violet is ok I guess but I'm not keen. Alyssa is gorgeous, one of my fave girls' names.    ?Cayden is an ok name, nice and trendy and cute. Deacon - I don't like. Dylan is nice and cute, Leon is a gorgeous name, and Kai is lovely too.    Suggestions for you:  I know your kids are already named, but I'd have cut down on the names... to modify and shorten your names down I'd have:    ? Alexa Ellie McGregor (Or Alexis Ellie - I prefer that) or Alexa Hope McGregor.  ? Joel Kyle McGregor, Or Joel Euan McGregor.  ? Emilia Alyssa McGregor.      Your new addition:  ? Cayden Leon McGrogor. Or Cayden Leon Kai McGregor.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love it!!

You could have  Toby  Charlie  Edward  Alfie?    just a few ideas|`|A2HRe2c4aa	phwooaar. you like names.  i think, scrap the first name, and instead have alfie  or curtis:)|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Holy Guacamole!

Love the names.  Cayden is a gorgeous name. Keep to your idea.|`|Ld0ZgPmjaa	Eeeeck. Hate them all in whatever order. Oh, except Dylan. The rest are silly bloody made up names. Sick of them! (sorry, feeling a little harsh tonight!).  xx|`|TdIbrGYYaa	I think the name you are thinking would work but I don't like the two D names together like that.  Nor do I think he would want to be called Cay for short.  So, lets think of a first name that gives him a good short name start like.... Jayden vs. Cayden then he can be called Jay for short.....    As for the two D's just mix things up a bit.  A couple names I like a whole bunch is Tydus and Broady.  Hey, thats kinda funny.  If you used Broady for the first name he could be called Bro for short... How cute.|`|JkBNU3ymaa	How about just Dylan Leon McGregor|`|uDVMNUlQaa	i almost picked kai for my unborn son but changed it to rhys in the end (due in 2 weeks)|`|JC4Wdmgbaa	Freckle, Speckle, Oorhagin, Hoffman, Irshebabian, Taylor, Matthew, Tulabell, Macbeth, MacDuff, Flayings, Doodle, Johnny Bravo, Scooby, Shaggy, Tinkerbell, Mooishness, Onky.

I like most of them. gud luck!|`|c8CxMWJ4aa	I like the name kai or shaun (sean). xx
miPubuDYaa	Many people are having hard times. You could sell on ebay for a desent price and maybe someone who had a girl could get them. Though i hate buying used stuff on ebay because many people exaggerate. And if the item is not as described than i have to pay for shipping twice. <br>  <br>  I would try a yard sale because shipping clothes is gonna be expensive. My girl friend shipped her suitcase to me on her last visit from Florida its cost her 65 bucks but she didn't wanna wait in line. Someone buying used baby clothes might want to pay that.<br>  <br>  If you can't sell them give them away to you local freecycle|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Use craigslist instead.  You'll get rid of the clothes much sooner and locally so you don't have to deal with shipping anything.<br>  I'd say $50-$100 depending on condition (used can be good or bad) and how much there is.|`|uuHPneEcaa	ebay, or have a yard sale that might work.  how much did u spend on them? not as much maybe a lil less.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Make small "bundles" out of them (say 3 vests, 2 baby gros and 2 pairs of scratch mits) and put them on at a starting bid between 99p and ￡2...the bidding will probably go up quite high if you do it that way..|`|9hggEdf1aa	you wont get much money for it, donate it.  Whenever you go shopping for your son go straight to the clearance rack and bring coupons.  retailmenot.com is a great site to get printable coupons! Buy clothes that are a size larger so that it will last longer.  And you could also buy clothes for next winter now, the clearance prices are low just make sure you get the correct size.|`|zSABr7praa	Hmm..if they're in used condition, and you didn't have purpose for them, I think you should consider donating them!  :)|`|wLG2vjSbaa	Dont go to once upon a child they only give you like 5 dollars depending on how they are. I had 4 totes full all matched up and only got 10.00. I would say put it on Craigslist. I have always had good luck there...Most people will give you what you ask for for it and there is no shipping fees and stuff....!!!! They just come to where you want them to to pick it up!|`|HPRlEWu1aa	u can do ebay or craigslist in ur area, so u can just have the person come pick them up and whatever they dont want then u can sell the rest on ebay<br>  theres also once upon a baby store in my area, and they buy clothes and toys and well anything baby related.|`|8ELfnTODaa	you should also check out craigslist.com<br>  <br>  i buy a lot of my stuff off there and it's more for local stuff so you don't have to pay to post it or worry about shipping and junk.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	You could take them to a consignment store where they sell them for you and they make a small commission on them or advertise them on Kijiji.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	you'd probably get more selling them at a yard sale for a dollar or 50 cents an outfit.  People will pay very little for used clothes sight unseen.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	try craigslist.com. online yard sale basically. that way you can post it so that someone will make an offer to you if you wish...then decide if you'll take that amount or not.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	That's an excellent idea!You could definitely sell them and I would propose you to have the 30% of the price you bought them.Good luck|`|Se2Ko2NKaa	ebay or somethin would work|`|6BcQ438zaa	you could try ebay,<br>  i would have to see them to name a price.<br>  it's hard to say w/out seeing their condition, etc.<br>  <br>  or maybe you have a friend or family member that you could give as "hand me downs"<br>  <br>  if ebay doesn't work, you could have a yard sale<br>  or take them to Goodwill, where you can claim it on your taxes<br>  <br>  or you could give them away for the needy, churches etc.<br>  because there are lots of babies out there that really need clothes<br>  and it would really help out a few mothers/families out there.|`|vw37VHqKaa	Sell them on craigslist. Its free. Just go to craigslist.org and click on your nearest city and place an ad for baby's clothes. Add a picture for more customers.<br>  <br>  I love craigslist. It's better than ebay, which is so saturated with people who have access to manufacturerers of clothes, driving down their cost and thus their price. You might not get a good deal on your items. Craigslist doesnt attract those small businesses like ebay. They are for people connecting with other people.|`|BbfIHWxzaa	1--take them to a consignment shop and let them decide on the value.  they will give you a portion of the sale price.  everybody wins!<br>  <br>  2--call the salvation army, the big brother/big sister program or some homeless organization and have them come pick them up.  get a receipt to claim the deduction on your taxes.<br>  <br>  3--get pregnant again and reuse them|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that's a great idea. Or if you have a Once Upon a Baby in your town you could sell them there. If they are in used condition and it's an average size box then I would start the bid at $10 and see if it goes up any. Good luck!|`|PumDOQC9aa	You can always sell it on ebay. But I don't think it would get much out from it . Try craglist|`|iQUeWhb7aa	Go to 'once upon a baby' and sell them there
Z1e3Cxjoaa	Your stomach will get hard as a rock during a contractin and then go back to normal when it is over.  It is really uncomfortable when they first start but once they start getting closer together you won't be able to talk or walk through them and that is when you go to the hospital
QH6fhKTBaa	Pick Louise! thats my name! but it wouldnt make a huge difference people will just call her Lou or Loulou    x|`|VGij9p0Taa	I like both Louise and Louisa both names share the same meaning famous battle warrior and are both timeless classics that aren't used that often. The names age well but i prefer Louisa as it slightly more unusual and is really pretty. A middle name that goes really well with Louisa and is a very classy name which is Ivy. Louisa Ivy goes well and is very classy and unique.   hope i helped.|`|5c20d0d97944d554addc48e11c13abe3aa	I like Louisa but i prefer it spelt Luisa|`|ddP3klT3aa	For a girl I imagine? Either one if fine. If you name her Louisa most people might call her Louise any ways.|`|oSMNx6L5aa	I'm not to keen on Louise but Louisa is kind of nice, I really like Elois (el-lou-eez) had you considered that?|`|cSOkd7Umaa	louisa is pretty. louise is a bit dated now.|`|czHPPBMqaa	yeah|`|JF343E2Taa	louise cos it's my middle name do u like this name angelica?|`|LrrJ78cvaa	nope.|`|vvAyfBGCaa	I like Louisa, I think it is different and pretty. I have a friend named Louisa, and she loves her name.
1enIWBGnaa	My theory; if they are comfortable and asleep - what's the problem...|`|vwuMTm7Saa	My son was doing the same thing, but he would move his blanket with him and sleep by the door.  I asked my pediatrician and she said that was just fine.  She even said that maybe I should move a mattress or a pad on the floor to make him more comfortable.  If he is not causing any problems, its no big deal.|`|ZDqG0CzWaa	my daughter did the same thing when we moved her to a toddler bed. It lasted a couple of weeks and then she started sleeping in her bed again. occasionally now in the mornings we find her on the floor but most nights she is in her bed. I think its fine to let them sleep there. if thats where they are most comftable leave them there. he will soon learn that his bed is more comftable.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	My daughter does it, too. She takes every blanket and stuffed animal off her bed and puts everything into a corner, almost every time. No harm in it at all. She'll sleep in her bed usually at night. But during nap time I just let her play with her toys with the door closed and tell her it's quiet time. She'll usually fall asleep on the floor within minutes.|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	hahaha, my son did the same thing at that age. I had torn down the crib, and put up the toddler bed for the same reasons. The only difference it seemed to make was he could get out of the toddler bed faster. We'd go back and forth, I'd put him in bed, he'd crawl out and take off giggling, put him back with a stern, "you get in that bed and stay there!", he'd take off again, back, forth, until finally he'd at least stay in his room.<br>  <br>  I'd go to find him the next morning, more often than not, he'd be under the bed with his blanket and pillow. At this point, sometimes it just better to let sleeping babies lie.|`|AA10063059	no thats fine as long as he isnt cold,you can always cover him over with a duvet if needed|`|9hggEdf1aa	just make sure he has a blanket to keep him warm. Try to move him when hes deeper in sleep if possible.  Go to the store with him and let him choose some cool sheets that he would like to sleep on.|`|eifZAKlAaa	I think that it was a little early for him to be taken out of the crib maybe.  Ask him why he does'nt want to sleep in his bed and try to tell him that he his a bid boy and that only little boy's or small boy's sleep in cribs. If he continues to sleep on the floor make up a bed on the floor for him or put out a sleeping bag for him and no it's not bad for him to sleep on the floor but make sure him has something under him and on top of him. Maybe he'll grow out of it. My son always like to sleep in his underwear not his pj's so I stop buying him pj's and now his is 24 years and still sleep in his underwear and a blanket with no sheet.
H9t63i4Kaa	No, your chances will will be the same that as if you wernt ovulating properly. But Clomid users do tend to have a high rate for multiples. Good luck!!!|`|SHBpzAIZaa	i am taking clomid for the same reason and i am in the same situation as you are. i dont know really if our chances of multiples are any greater or not, and honestly, i dont care... i want one so bad... if that one is one, two, or three i will be the happiest person in the world... <br>  <br>  good luck to you!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	no. all its gonna do is ensure you ovulate ,mature follicals every month.. im also taking Clomid.. please keep me up to date with what happens|`|fMilDRgLaa	The chances are very slim to having multiples.

WPI0Z47saa	My baby is now measuring over 3 weeks bigger than my due date. Early on it was only off by a day. Early ultrasounds are very accurate since all babies start out at pretty much the same size and development. Later ultrasounds get less and less accurate with predicting due dates since now the baby is growing at their own rate  My husband is six foot six and his family just produces big babes. My son measured bigger on the later ultrasound and was big but my orginal due date was correct. So no, go by your old due date. They only think about changing it if it is off by more than 2 weeks. In my case because of family history and the size of my fist son. they are leaving it alone. Good luck and I hope that ths helped.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You go by 27w5d.  I measured almost 3 weeks ahead for most of my pregnancy.  Just because you measure a week ahead doesn't mean your baby will be ready to come out a week sooner.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	you need to go by what ur doctor is going by.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	the only way doctors will change your due date is if you are measuring two weeks or more off.  Due dates are estimates  and are to be expected to be off up to two weeks in either direction.  Also after the first trimester, ultrasound dating isn't very accurate because baby starts to grow at different rates.  You may measure ahead this week but then measure right on track next time.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	the ultrasound is more accurate for the due date b/c your body will go into labor when the baby reaches a certain point, not necessarily  40 weeks later. So i would expect my baby when the ultrasound determines it.|`|AA10780655	When I had my ultrasound I was measuring a week ahead too<br>  They didnt change my due date or anything thought because they said it wasnt that big of a difference and all babies grow differently|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	It's not uncommon for baby's growth to fluctuate within a range on ultrasound, compared to the calculated due date. Your menstrual cycle may have varied from the 28-day cycle used to calculate due dates, or the baby may have just gone through a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  The truest law of childbearing is "babies come out". Human women have been giving birth for millenia... long before anyone could calculate due dates. Remember that your calculated 'due date' is a guess, and could vary by ~3 weeks in either direction and still be perfectly normal for you and your baby, and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  (When I was a midwife, I gave all my first-time moms a calculated 'due date' =and= a "social" due date that was 3 weeks past the one I calculated, for them to tell family and friends. Because many 1st time babies are "late" by calculation (because the time the body spends preparing for labor take a little longer in first-time moms), this gave them a date they could tell family and friends, so that people wouldn't start nagging them about being 'past' their due date.<br>  <br>  Relax. Your body knows what it's doing. As long as you're well nourished, getting some healthy exercise and sunshine, and are seeing your practitioner to make sure that something unexpected isn't going on, just believe in the history of women having babies that stretches back through time and know that your body will do what it needs to in the right time.|`|mK1GcbJ2aa	you always go by your orginal weeks..she might just be a big baby so she is measuring  a week ahead..unless you messed up your last period and ovulation date..it just means she might come a week early if she gets too big in there..its no big deal..you have a healthy baby|`|OU9xnW86aa	Unless your doctor changes your due date you go by the original due date and gestation count. It isn't uncommon for babies to measure more or less on ultrasounds, especially in the second half of pregnancy.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	Keep with your original gestational age unless your doctor tells you otherwise. My doctor told me it's completely normal for babies to vary within a week's range of your gestational age.|`|VEi3R0craa	no go by your original its just a guess I was 22 weeks and it showed I was almost 28 weeks and I was like what and the dr was like no its just a big baby and she was 10 lbs 11 oz|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Just means that he is growing quicker than your time is adding up. He's just measuring 1 week ahead of you. No your still 27w5d.
oUcLSDZ6aa	He'll grow out of it. In the mean time resist the urge to yell back. Say very quietly "inside voice" and keep whispering until he takes it down a notch. Get your other kids in on it too. Babies learn better by example than enforcement.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	He will grow out of it, when my son was between 7-13 months he would scream! In the car or in our house.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	My daughter started screeching on the top of her lungs around five months for no reason. She stopped on her own after a few months. However, she got a cold and lost her voice about 2 months ago, and for some reason decided to do it. My husband and I lost it, it sounded so funny, so now she does it all the time again. She's almost 13 months now.   Just don't encourage it, whatever you do. Sometimes ignoring it works the best.|`|2HXq1569aa	I agree with the other answer. Try not to yell, he'll grow out of it, and whisper to him.    I would get down in front of him (eye level) and say in a whisper or very low voice. No yelling. Use your inside voice. Show him by your actions what inside voice is.    Good luck!|`|cdjLVZHraa	You don't say how old Cade is - but if he is old enough - give him a place where he CAN yell all he wants and as loud as he wants.  When he starts yelling - take him to this place (a time out room or chair) and let him yell.  When he is done yelling - bring him back to join the group - and keep reminding him that in all other places he needs to use a more quiet voice (demonstrate and set a good example).    If Cade is just a baby give him something soothing to listen to (soft music, NPR, news station).  Babies will often stay quiet to listen to other things.    Good luck.|`|446edbddd6db88aacfc6cef13d8f3aebaa	Hes a 8 month old baby what do you want him to do?? sit quietly all day? hes just finding his voice and god please dont spank a baby thats just wrong on all levels

Baby girl will be 14 months when the twins arrive.<br>  <br>  Hubby & I wanted to have our children close together because we are in our 30's and wanted them to be close in age.

Hubby has a child that is 7.5yr. <br>  <br>  Yes, it is going to be a difficult task until I get into a system. I figure God wouldn't give me more than he knows I can handle, so I'll be quiting my job when the babies are born and I will try to find something I can earn a supplemental income on, while working at home.<br>  <br>  God Bless you & Baby dust to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|zSABr7praa	I think that's a great age.  I grew up with a brother two years older than me and I LOVED it.  However my husband has 6 brothers and sisters, all within 10 years of each other and they all wish they had more time "to be a kid".  Our plan is to have 3 kids, all five years apart, so they each have time to be "the baby".  Everyone is different, and there's no right answer!  :)|`|8ELfnTODaa	my husband and i conceived when our son was 10 months old because of that reason. we both had huge gaps between siblings and wanted our kids to be closer in age so they could be closer period. now our daughter is due when he's 20 months old and he seems excited to become a big brother (even tho he doesn't fully understand). i also like the idea that he will most likely not be able to remember any jealousy he felt towards his sister and will most likely grow out of it before he's old enough to remember. :D|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I am all about having them close together. I have a 7 year gap (not intentional) between my brother and I, and I wish we had been closer.  My first two are 23 months apart, and we will try for another when our son is 1ish.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I think it is a lot better to have your children closer together than 3-4 years apart. That way they can bond and play together more, than if they were further apart. My sister and I are almost 2 1/2 years apart, and we grew up together the best of friends. My younger sister and I are four years apart, and we don't do anything together really. I can't relate to her at all. Also, my sister in law has a four year old son. They are wishing and hoping to get pregnant soon, because their son is really a handful. He's one of those children that need a little brother or sister just so they aren't the center of attention so much. It helps them to develop responsibility and sharing skills when there is another sibling. But don't wait too much longer...|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i have one set of cousins who are all lined up with about a year in between them. from what I've seen is they get along pretty well. i had 6 years between me and my brother it was nice to have someone older to look up to. My son is 9 months and im 9 weeks pregnant already! im happy im having them close together though! my best friends kids are a year and 9 months apart and they get along great! (older ones 3 and the younger one JUST turned 2)|`|WIUlFoITaa	Well I come from a huge family! I have 5 brothers and 2 sister, none of which are full blooded siblings. One older stepbrother, who is only 3 months older than me, and the rest are half and they range from 10 years younger to 17 years younger! Its hard because I am close with them but I do get the constant "Aw your children are so beautiful!" I don't mind but it does get old. Don't get me wrong I would trade any of them for an older sibling since my step brother and I are very close but it would have been nice to have a close sister!|`|FkTC4Dpkaa	my firs children have 2 yrs 1 mth between them, then betwwen number 2 and 3 i had 2 yrs and 11 mths gap. perfect now they are great ages together. all planned- i wanted the first 2 clioser and i miscarried but with hindsight it may have been too close so the extra 4 months were better. 2-3 yrs gap i feel is perfect for a close family|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	My sister was almost 5 when I was born. We had our "close" moments and also where I was just the annoyance (when she had friends over and such). It worked so far. <br>  <br>   Also, my oldest nephew was 4 when his little bother was born. I think 3-4 years is a good run if you're only having two. If you plan on more, I'd say anywhere from about 18 months to 4 years works. It all depends on what you feel really. These are just my opinions. Good luck!!|`|sXCSVFBaaa	My brother and his wife got pregnant when their son was just over 2 years old. It is hard work, but it all depends on you and your spouse/boyfriend and what you both feel is right. For some people, having kids that close together would kill them, others can handle it. It just depends.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	My brother and I are only 13 months apart. My mom always said she had twins the hard way and that it is hell on your body. Due to fertility issues my kids are going to be 7 1/2 years apart but that has its benefits.|`|DNygQdmVaa	My son is 14 months old and im trying for another.<br>  My siblings are all way younger than me, I actually get mistaken for their mother.<br>  <br>  I want my kids to be closer in age|`|yy0wwNMnaa	my two girls are now 31 and 17 and they get on very well and they told me they really loved that they could learn one from each other a lot and the older sister helps the younger one in dealing with us, her parents, and the younger helps the older one too. they make a good team. so it's not true that wide-apart brothers or sisters don't get along well. actually, they might find more support in a much older/younger sis.|`|z5aQccxoaa	My sister and I are two years apart and we had the best relationship growing up! We were so close, best friends and shared alot of the same friends. I loved it, especially because my family moved around so much it helped to have someone close in age && to always have a friend at school. But I also have a sister who is 4 years younger than me && a brother who is 11 years younger. (I'm 19 right now) I feel like my soon to be 15 year old sister and I are close too though, I don't know every detail of her life like my big sis but I feel more like a BIG sister to her, (I felt like my older sister was more like a friend and not someone I could go to for advice) and my baby bro...I feel like a second momma to him. But I love them all so much! So basically what I'm trying to say is what kind of relationship do you hope to have for your kids?<br>  Friends or do you want them to look after eachother? You can do both! Depending on how many kids you want to have.<br>  <br>  Having someone close in age is good because they understand you at the moment but having someone older is still good because they know what you've been through && how to deal with it...without parenting you and telling you what to do. I have a different relationship with each of my sibs. so no matter what you decide I'm pretty positive it's gonna work out great.|`|8KjPGiH7aa	I agree! The closer in age in your children are, the closer they are. They'll have more interest and concern with each other if they're at relatively close stages in life. :) Good choice!|`|iMULlxdgaa	well I have a brother that 11 years older than me and a sister thats 4 years younger than me...to tell you the truth it doesn't really make a big diff if its like 4 years.  However I did want to try for another when my son was 2 but it wasn't happening. now I'm 39 weeks with no. 2 and my son is 4 and I feel pretty good about it and I actually think that little bit of an age gap can be beneficial becuase they get some one on one time and you enjoy each baby more. one of my firends has like 3 kids all one year apart and she actually regrets it, but another friend of mine had her two boys really close in age and she loved it and said it was easier but now she just had a 3rd that is 5 years apart from the first two...kids are a blessing at no matter what time you have them!
fZCfJWpOaa	Women have had children in their 40s (or higher), though there is a higher risk when carrying children that late.     If I said that yes, you will miss your chance to have children, would that change your feelings about having a child?  It shouldn't, because if you are not ready then rushing into having a child because of a clicking biological clock isn't right.    You still have time.  If now is not your time there is no reason to worry yourself, especially if you don't want a child right now. :)|`|uP08b6K4aa	At 35 you're certainly not over the hill, I had my last at 33!  Women are having children well into their 40's and 50's now, provided you're healthy and fit enough to carry and give birth to a child then there's no reason why you should feel like giving up yet.    Are you with a partner now?  Talk your fears through if you are, it's not an easy decision to make but you sound as though you clearly want to be a parent and in that respect, I feel that you would make a good one!    Try not to stress so much, take your time and forget about that ticking clock for a little while.    Good Luck x|`|AA12123428	If you don't feel ready to have your life turned upside down then don't do it, although no-one is ever truly ready to have a baby.    There are ways to have your eggs frozen until you are ready, you know, although it's not necessarily a good idea.|`|wBpennsMaa	You still have a few healthy years of baby making in you :-) A few years is a while, but remember with some people it takes time to get pregnant and fertility specialists won't see you until you have tried for at least a year. You could always hire a surrogate.|`|aknvXYijaa	There is no age limit. You might not feel ready at the moment because of different reasons i,e economy, work, relationship. Some people do not even know how they are going to feel and cope when they are pregnant.  Ask yourself one question. If you was ever to have children, would it be a big regret?  Most mums panic about how they wil cope. Just go with the flow and do whats best for you and not everybody else.  Hope this helped.|`|cdjLVZHraa	I don't think you have missed your chance.  But I also believe that not everyone should have children.  (Is someone making you feel quilty about not having them?  If they love you, they need to respect your decisions!)    Listen to your heart, and if and when you are ready to have children, then go for it.  If its meant to be then it will happen.      Enjoy your life now!  Don't miss out on good things that you could have now because you are worried about what might or might not happen in five or ten years!|`|rpdJ37Hoaa	I know women to have first babies in their late 30's early 40's. The average age is becoming later and later these days. So no, I dont think you have missed your chance. Children really do change everything and if you know you arent ready now, you will only live to regret it if you do have a baby.     Do what your body tells you, and if you dont have children of your own, there are many other opportunities for you to give something back in the world.     Good luck :)|`|7zVvAzJCaa	I know exactly what you mean.  I am now 40 and have put having children off as it would be a huge disruption to my life.  However, now I would like to have a couple of kids and I know that I'm not too old.  Do want you think is right, if you put it off now - you can always have children later on.
oUcLSDZ6aa	I don't know for sure what your chances would be, but I say not too good, since you'll be fighting their 2 parents who are not together.      Maybe gaining full custody wouldn't be best. Perhaps talking to their mother, and explain how you feel about the children, and suggest drug re-hab to help get her on the right track, so that she can be the mother she should be.     As for your son, I don't think who he sleeps with should be an issue, assuming he doesn't do it in front of the kids.     I hope everything turns out best for the children, if you really want to make a good impression in court, show that you've attempted to get them to be a part of their children's lives, and they just didn't. It'll be your best defense.

They have wonderful dresses in the dress department that are gorgeous. I bought all of my Cotillion dresses there. Go to Nordstrom for accessories.  Pair it with a small clutch, or wrislet. If you have longer hair, Go with dangle earrings, and curl your hair if it is always straight. Or straighten it if it is always curly. Pair with a diamond necklace or something like that. Ask your mom for a nice necklace if you don't already have any.|`|E52lAADMaa	i found a really nice dress i know you will love <br>  it just covers your bum so its pretty short but it isnt slutty.<br>  its low cut and you wear it with fishnets<br>  <br>  it loooks amazinggg<br>  it will suit you|`|b2j5AE1oaa	they have a really cute lime green and other shades of blue it's a summer dress but it will work i say were a white necklace with a black bag and black strap sandal's and by the way the dress is at macy's|`|DLUeP07Vaa	a white button up shirt and a light blue pencil skirt with white cute heel and maybe a braclet or necklace|`|qog0Yd72aa	go to jcpenny or macys. they always have cutee dreseess !

0BC2WTyoaa	YAY!  You'll have to update us all!!  :)<br>  <br>  here is what I did (this is what they told me to do)<br>  <br>  Drink an extra liter of water the day before to increase amniotic fluid.  I also drank extra water the few days before that.<br>  <br>  Eat or drink something 15 minutes before appointment.  I had OJ.<br>  <br>  She was moving around nicely, not too much and had her legs wide open to show us she was a girl.  :)|`|R0RnjdnXaa	I went in last week to find out the gender and the Tech told me on the phone to drink some soda and a bar of chocolate 30 minutes before the ultrasound. It worked!...:) The baby was kicking and jumping so we got to see we were having a baby girl...:)<br>  Good luck...one thing though it sound a bit expensive I only payed $25 dollars for an ultrasound with a private office and they also gave me a video, like 15 pictures. Maybe you should go some where else. I know cause I was going to go to this one other place first and they were charging me way over $100 for the same ultrasound I got where I went instead. So I didn't go and saved a lot.|`|EzuYExM4aa	My baby was not cooperating at all.  The baby was turned away and all curled up.  The tech had me lay left side... no luck.  Then I moved to my right side... no luck. Thank God my ultrasound tech was patient.<br>  <br>  Finally after about 45 minutes I said, "Come on baby, I need to know what you are so I can start buying you stuff" and then BAM... the baby opened it's legs and she said "Well you can buy BLUE stuff!"  My baby had a little man package. :)<br>  <br>  Mostly you just have to hope that your tech is patient and willing to move you around a little bit.  I have also heard it helps to get up and walk around for a couple minutes and then try again.<br>  <br>  We were so excited!!<br>  <br>  *Due May 25th*|`|uuHPneEcaa	when u are doing that one they want you to drink only clear liquid.. So drink lots of water.. My son was very active that and he wouldn't cooperate that whole e ultrasound. so she could do the anatomy thing but when it came time to find out the sex.. HE DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL.. and she told me I was having a lil boy.. So what u can do is eat some chocolate NOT A LOT or something and that will make him move a lil bit..<br>  <br>  That day I had a colospoy and then the ultra sound and I didn't do anything but drink water and he still moved around. I still found out the sex of my son and i was 19 weeks. Tech got mad at my baby because he wouldn't stop moving. she told me she wanted to be there when he was born so she could give him a beatting... then some how is got it to where we was looking at his lil butt and there his lil big package was.. and she said "OMG LOOK AT THOSE BALLS" her words not mine.|`|8ptVvUgsaa	I am not sure about the orange juice but my first ultra sound went great with the news of having a little boy. I drank water 1 hour before it all went really good.|`|utfoP7GWaa	juice or a mountain dew 20 min. before u/s!!!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	There's nothing you can do to "make" the baby cooperate; it's the luck of the draw.  If you do have juice or a snack, make sure it's not too much.  I made the mistake of having too much sugar before my u/s and baby moved way too much to find out.  Lucky for me, Dr. had to order more u/s because my son had a dilated kidney and I did eventually find out!

Fx9nJ6mPaa	I love Axel & Tike, they are very unique and great names, I personally think Blake it to common but it is a very cute name...2 bad you were not having 3, you picked great names...good luck with your new baby!|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	Hi! This reminds of a question I asked today which was asking what people thought of the name Axel Blade. I like Axel and Blake but not Tyke so much. I like how your names are uncommon.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiQHEoo_WSTOdG.w9iUDuZPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219102834AAXDtNZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11103012	Tyke is totally out.  The word tyke refers to a small child, or worse.  Naming a kid tyke would be abusive.

I feel sorry for your kids if that's the names your gonna land them with.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I like Axel and Blake, but Tyke is awful - like calling your child Kid or Anklebiter.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'd ask if you were trying to resurrect an all boy's 1980's rock band.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	i dont like how tyke and blake end in ke but axel doesnt<br>  so maybe a different name<br>  but other than that they are cute!
Fsr2Rofzaa	yes it is normal, and you have a good sleeper which is great!|`|eG5W05Pbaa	y son is 12wks and i take him up to bet at 10 he sleeps all the way through till 4-5 then have a feed and nod off again till 8/ 8.30. try giving him a bath before bed it wipes them out and then give hime a nice warm bottle afther a bath. good luck|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	thats great for a 10 week old baby to sleep for so long.    i dont understand why there are so many questions on here were people are either moaning or asking if their baby sleeps enough, surely everyone with a tiny bit of common sense realise when they have a baby their baby will have them up several times a night for several months. i know some babies sleep through the night from about 8 or 9 weeks old (i mean about 8 hours) but some babies are still waking up when they are 12 months old.    babies are not robots and they cant all be judged the same. some will sleep well and others not very well at all.    its all part of what you agree to when you decide to have a baby.|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	Sounds ok to me hun .. when Jack was 10 weeks he would go bed at about 8pm and wake up at 2am and 5am then 8am sooo .. hes sleeping through now though, going from 7.30pm till 8am and he is 13 weeks .. suddenly made the transistion over one night last week lol I was pleased! :) xxx|`|Z2m8TEFHaa	For the first 6 months after he was born, my son woke up EVERY HOUR to be fed in the night. Genuinely. That was 2 years ago and I still feel tired from it. I think babies tend to sleep if they need it, as long as you're giving them the things they need (which you obviously are) they'll work it out on their own. If you think there's something to worry about, talk to your health visitor. Our boy is now happy and healthy, but at the time we were really worried.|`|DS9NLiaBaa	i don't know if that is normal for a 10 week old but. . . i think you should put him to bed a bit earlier, say about 7 or around then and see how he reacts! i also think he might get to sleep quicker if you stay with him for about 15 mins when you put him to bed!   glad i could help and good luck!|`|iRXraQWyaa	Try putting him to bed earlier.  7 - 8 hours of sleep is a luxury!  Enjoy!!|`|rsdKX1fyaa	you get 7-8 hours of sleep, with 2 breaks?  That sounds good, for a 10 week old baby!    My sons hardly slept at all, for about 6 months|`|deIzFnV8aa	Do try putting him to bed earlier.  At our age our DD was "in bed" from more like 8-7, though she woke twice to eat in that time.  Around 12 months she started sleeping through her first night feeding, and sleeping more like 9-4, then a few hours after eating.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	u need to get ur son in a routine where u will put her to bed at a certain time during the day make sure he's comfortable and maybe even get thick curtains so the room is pitch dark. what i think may help also is give him a bath and u can get some shampoos etc to relax him eg johnsons shampoo with lavender in does work then make him some milk and hopefully he should sleep fine hope this helps good luck xxxx|`|l7RJkc3baa	To me it sounds pretty normal. My daughter is 16 weeks today. It's just your baby's sleeping and eating patterns are changing. You will notice soon he will be down to one feednig. Try  set a routine for him. I always  wash, change her and feed her  by 8-8:30pm and  by 9pm she is sleeping. Before she used to wake up  1 time a night at 1 or 4am...now she sleeps til 6am. It is very normal, don't freak out. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep, we are lucky!
VwMkiLFPaa	We live in FL. My husbands daughter was born in CA and her mother had another man sign the birth certificate. When the child was 2 yrs old, they moved here because the mother wanted child support for her daughter. Paternity had to be proved in order for this to happen. DNA proves its my husbands daughter, however, the child still has this other mans last name and he is still listed on the BC.     Because another mans name was listed on the BC, it has made things very complicated for us. And we have tried so hard to do things properly but again, because there is another man listed, we have to go through the courts in order to just take care of the basics for this little girl. Right now we just found out all that hard work of our court order is null and void. (Long story) But the truth stands right now, if my husband's ex wants to go for child support, she has to change the birth certificate. Because the person they'll seek out is the man listed....not my husband. And think about this for emergency purposes....if something happens, they'll never know who the child's bio father is. What if they need something medically? What if they need his history? They won't get the proper information if the incorrect man is listed....    Let me remind you that on the birth certificate, where you list the father, it states that you are signing your name because you are admitting that the information you are listing is truthful. Obviously having him sign isnt truthful and you do know who the biological father is. I wouldnt recommend having him sign off on the birth certificate.     The name on the BC doesnt make you a Daddy. Being there, being part of their lives, regardless of DNA..that makes you a Daddy. Only because Ive experienced this on the other side, I truly dont recommend you putting this mans name down, unless hes the true biological father to your child.|`|VELnLnIKaa	he would be stupid to sign it   get the child support from the real father dont complicate the other guys life|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Depends on the state. Here you cannot have anyone but the Bio father sign or you lose support.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	In order to get child support from the biological father, the biological father's name has to be on the birth certificate.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you would loose the support you receive from the bio dad.  and you ex may be forced to pay by the state.|`|KHZLPldraa	Actually you can.  There is no law that says he can't.  However if he ever changes his mind it could get really messy.  I think it is great that he treats both children equally, more parents should be as responsible and caring!|`|y1lr564raa	Talk to a lawyer but I wouldn't think you could get child support if another man signs his name on the birth certificate|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Yikes, I'd be careful about this one and talk to a lawyer to get the answer.  I'd hate for your child to lose her child support payment over something like that.    A consultation with a lawyer over this should be very short (I think it's paid by the hour).|`|aSKsDtwLaa	If you are not married to either man and you have done a paternity test,  then the biological father is the only one who can sign the certificate.      That does not mean she has to call him daddy.   And does not effect child support or custody issues, (the biological dad can ask for joint custody or visitation).|`|X6RwSrJjaa	The law really does not give a **** who the biological father is as long as there is a name under the father on the birth certificate. Whoever signs the certificate is considered the legal father of that child. Now, if no one were to sign it.. then by default it would go to the biological father.     So the answer to your question is yes, ANYONE can claim responsibility for the child. That is what the certificate is for. Now, what I find messed up is if you sign the birth certificate thinking your a biological father... and then later you find out your not... you already claimed responsibility, which is messed up.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	why the hell would u want ur EX to sign it|`|6bfc448c8de0de5ed551f6041055f3c9aa	So let me get this straight...    Your ex boyfriends older brother knows a guy name Shawn that you slept with, and his uncle Bill has a mechanic that wants to sign your childs birth certificate?    Or did I mess that up?  Was it the mechanics uncle that has a brother named Bill that knew your cousin?|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Honestly, this is a sticky situation. It depends on the state you live in as I'm sure it varies from state to state.     I would call a law firm and just ask a lawyer who deals with child support and these types of cases.     By the way - your ex sounds like a very good man.|`|prqrQcd1aa	wow, i can see your dilemma here... Your little girl thinks of him as her father, does she even know about her real father?     Here is the thing, it is illegal for him to sign the paternity papers saying he's her dad, if he isn't really her dad... that being said yes, he could still do it, but... then legally she would be his child. But this isn't true adoption, if he wants to adopt her, then he should do it the legal way honestly.    If he does sign the paternity papers then no the real father won't have to pay child support. He won't have to pay because legally he isn't the father, and even if the ex did sign the paternity papers, if her real father wanted to come back into her life and told them what you had done if he could proove that you signed the documents falsely you could actually get into big trouble for it.     I would personally just let the real father sign the papers and then go from there, you should be getting child support from his dead beat butt anywase, even if he doesn't want to have anything to do with the child. All he has to do is show the courts the DNA test and you would be HAD! Think about her future too, how would you explain all of this to her when she finds out about her real father?     It's good to know that the ex has done all of these things for her and even is still acting as her father though u two didn't work out, but for the sake of your kid, i'd say let the real dad sign the papers, and get support for her.|`|LCHnUuS6aa	If he names himself as her father on the birth certificate, knowing this to be untrue, then he is breaking the law.  If you want money from her actual biological father, then why 'muddy the waters' by allowing your ex to lie.  Leave the father's name blank.|`|CA06qy8Laa	Signing the birth certificate does not really mean anything.  It will not stop child support.  They go by the DNA test.  So if you want him to sign it go ahead.|`|OF1FZLw0aa	In Florida, I know for a fact that any man can sign for a child, but then he is liable for all child support, even if he's not the biological one.|`|m53cNF4iaa	Good Luck x xx x|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I would honestly seek legal advice on this. It varies from state to state and you are not going to get a correct answer here on ya necessarily....not unless someone who is a lawyer, practicing family law..from your state gives you an answer.     From my understanding, signing a BC is not the same as a legal adoption. I think it is awesome he wants to be your daughters father! Just make sure you do it the right way so there is no complications down the road. good luck.
SEzIkGNiaa	For the Baby:    *Diapers  *Baby Toys  *Cute sleepers  *Hats and Mitts  *Blankets  *Booties  *Wall hangings  *Picture Frames  *Baby Books  *Baby monitors|`|vue9NOhYaa	Well, you could ask your cousin what she needs.  That would be a good start.    Or... get something very practical -- at 16 she's going to need necessities, not frivilous stuff.  So clothes, or diapers, or a book on breastfeeding.|`|DLl7qEWTaa	Diapers and baby wipes are always a good thing. You can buy different sizes of diapers that way as she grows she will have a few of the bigger sizes.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	parenting/medical book is a great idea.  babies don't come with instructions and its scary and confusing enough when you're an adult having a baby|`|EHY3FnAmaa	She needs the necessities.  Diapers, bottles ( if she id bottle feeding)  wipes, sleepers, onesies. etc.  Ask her what she needs thats your best bet..|`|d0ddKfnCaa	I would get her the necessities.  But you can also do it in a creative way.  Check out www.SamaKiTush.com  They have great baby shower gifts that include things a new mom will need.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	Diapers! You can never have too many of those. Clothing for a little girl something other than newborn size since they grow out of them so fast. Baby toys, blankets, baby soap and shampoo. Some ideas.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Diapers!!!! And I really recommend the Pampers swaddlers..I would get her the size 1's...(my daughter went through the newborn size really fast)    Other than that...a pack of onesies..shoot for the 3-6 month sizes..  ..and bows for a little girl are always a must-have. Babies-r-us has lots of cute bows..but if you look online..youll find alot better selection.|`|1zvEVropaa	well first of all tell her congratulation!! burp clothes, bibs, lotions, baby wash, i know they don't seem cute but in my two pregnancy's getting the practical things help more than the cute plus everyone gets clothes.... good luck hope i was helpful
AA11887900	Babies can shift in a day. Relax, unless she's still there in a week. If she doesn't move on her own, sometimes the doctors can shift a baby's position through manipulation.<br>  <br>  If she's still in that position (called transverse breech) by the time you go into labor you will have to have a caesarian section. <br>  <br>  Also, 40 weeks isn't a magic number, only an average. You might still have several weeks left. I was a "10 month baby," I was born almost four weeks after my due date. If she hasn't dropped by now, there is a good chance you will have one of those long pregnancies.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	That's called transverse breech and may require a c section.  Has your Dr. talked to you about this yet?|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	mine feels sideways but i am not sure at 27 week did you rdr tell ya ? hope she is ready|`|AA10780655	My baby is up high and sideways too, but with his face up<br>  You just answered my question about my baby being in a weird position a little while ago<br>  I might have to have a c-section if labor doesnt progress, but thats just cuz his face is up<br>  I think you should be fine though, once labor starts, she'll probably drop down more and get into a good position to come out|`|AA11784984	High up is ok but transverse not so much. One of my cousins twins was transverse, she had to have a  c section.|`|DNygQdmVaa	It could be another 3-4 weeks before she comes.<br>   if your concerned ask your doctor.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	For sure or from what you feel? If this is the case and the baby doens't turn sounds like a C-Sec is in your future.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	they will try to turn her, (like litteraly, they tryed to push on my bf belly to get the baby to turn but he didnt so she had a c), you may want to start planning, but you still have another week or 3 so maybe she will turn on her own.. good luck|`|aD8Xmhdiaa	she probably has her heart set on staying in that position too, so you will probably have to deliver her c-section.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|d943d3885193abf4e1885268f2764356aa	They sometimes turn the last day/minute but looks like you may have to prepare your self for c-section.|`|ho62nPtraa	go ask the doctor. it will be better|`|UKqJiIlGaa	might need to prepare for a c-section
p2Njf5gBaa	i think I would be tempted to, but I probably wouldn't do it.  I doubt it would do any real harm, but a baby really doesn't need nail polish and it isn't good for adult nails, much less babies.  <br>  <br>  To some answerer's, I don't think calling the mother trash over it is appropriate, nor do I think shes nuts,   I would say she just used poor judgment.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Chances of it being extremely dangers...I'm not sure, but it's ridiculous. I won't be painting my daughter's nails until she asks me. I'll make girl time out of it and we'll have some mommy/daughter fun! I see no reason to paint her nails, pierce her ears, ect ect.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Dangerous and trashy...yuck.<br>  <br>  I have a 13 month old daughter.  I'll probably paint her nails when she can physically come to me and ask "mommy, can you paint my nails"|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	my daughter is 2 and i have been painting her nails with baby nail polish since she was about 4 months old|`|iH2whFkHaa	Yuck! MAYBE toe nails but not fingernails. and even then...bright pink? ewwwww.|`|AA11109728	I know - my daughter is 4 and my mom kinda thinks I'm weird that I don't want her wearing nail polish.  I thought the same as you, when they are younger they've got their hands in their mouth, and I wouldn't want to use nail polish remover on a baby either, or my daughter for that matter even at her age.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	My daughter just turned two yesterday and I painted her nails pink for her big day. She really enjoyed it. We did her hair nice and she wore her plastic necklace lol. I'm taking it off today though. I wouldn't paint my infant's nails. I doubt it would be dangerous, even if a little chipped off and she ate some. It's still probably not smart though.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	No, for exactly the reason you stated, that babies always have their hands in their mouths. I do believe it could be dangerous. You can't exactly eat nail polish. I definitely think that's irrisponsible of them.|`|eytlIKITaa	That's horrible!!!  I would never do that!  I can understand that you can't wait to paint your little girl's nails, but at 3 months!?!?!?!  I probably would have slapped my friend!|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Of course it is, they can get a chip off and eat it.  How ridiculous some Mothers are!  Just goes to show how girls are just having kids to young these days!|`|J1kJb98Maa	that mother is trash and i feel sorry for that baby|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	no dont do that,..it has alot of chemicals...they sell girl's nailpolish..but from 2 years old and up|`|n3IoftMFaa	Um, not sure if it is dangerous - just kinda trashy. My god, what next, lip gloss? Mascara?|`|3rda58OCaa	I think 3 and 4 months old is a little young, but i did paint my daughter's TOEnails before she was one.  I can't remember exactly what age, but i believe she was close to one.  She is 2.5 now, and gets pedicures and manicures with mommy all the time and has been since she was old enough to ask!  She loves it!  It looks cute, and is harmless.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it would be dangerous to chew on after it dries, but the smell CANNOT be good for the baby's little lungs and painting her fingernails is just too close to where she is breathing and there is no way it isn't overwhelming to her poor body.  I would say wait until she is closer to 9 months before you paint her toes or hands.  Good luck and don't listen to these crazy people acting like it is such a big deal!!|`|t0KwT93Paa	Wow, that's crazy ! Who in the right mind would paint their three month old child's nails ? They are just little babies ! I am not sure if the nail polish is necessarily bad for them, but definitely not good for them ! I think you should have a talk with your friend, and tell her you think its a little odd to paint a babies nails... A good time to start painting your daughters nails would be around 4 or 5. any earlier would be crazy, and it should be their decision if they want their nails painted or not.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I did not do finger nails for a year or so, (afraid she would scrape the polish off and eat it) but I painted her toenails when she was 6 wks.  My friend, who is a hair stylist and does nails as well, bought this stuff called Pawlish.  It is nail polish for dogs.  Completely harmless and dries in less than a minute.  She special ordered it through work, but I did see it at a upscale pet store before.|`|pCZPtegeaa	My daughter is 4 months old, and I painted her toe nails about a week ago, just to look at how cute they were lol. But I do think that painting a 3 month old's fingernails (even a 4 month old's) is a little on the dumb side. I don't know what hazard it would pose having it flake off in their mouth, but it just doesn't sound good or logical to me. Mother's intuition, I guess.|`|a9btWYKRaa	I would never paint my daughters nails until she is old enough to understand what it is.<br>  <br>  I think this is very dangerous as like you say baby's put there fingers in their mouths, Nail varnish is toxic and may chip off in their mouth causing them to swallow it. I'm sure it wouldn't make them seriously ill but I'd rather be safe than sorry.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	I can see painting her toe nails at that age but not her fingernails. At that age, they always have their hands in their mouths and I wouldn't want her to ingest the polish. My daughter was closer to 18 months when I painted her nails for the first time. And I only used a pale pink, nothing to bright!|`|5e14c31a3045fe59c0b780a5ca6b7a9daa	well at first i thought it was ok... but then when i seen how old your daughter was i don't think it would be a good idea... infants always have their fingers in their mouths...  but i've seen mothers do it all the time... but the child is a least at a walking age...|`|955YoHvVaa	I think its kind of pointless a baby that small its more hassle then anything to put the polish on then you would get from it you know?..And the same being for the toenails..some babies put their feet in their mouths so that's kinda pointless also.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I never painted my daughter fingernails until she was 2 or so. My sis however painted her daughter toes when she was very young but not her fingers until she was older. I wouldn't recommend iton the hands because they do put them in their mouths so much!|`|ySTDkd5iaa	My daughter is 1 and i wish i could paint her nails. Sorry if that makes me a bad mother! I havent but i do plan on painting her toe nails a soft baby pink. But I doubt this would happen since she cant stay in one place.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Your friend is NUTS!!!<br>  You need to wait, at least, until the girl begins school because then you don't have to worry about the kid eating the polish.|`|S8L983JBaa	Humm..i have a 6month old and i never really though to much about it. I proble wont intill Gracelyn is older but little girls do look cute with it.|`|PumDOQC9aa	At age 3 -months and painting your  daughter's nails is dangerous because like you said. Babies put their hands in their mouth all the time . And the nail polish will come  .|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I personally would not do it because at that age my daughter always had her hands in her mouth.|`|LWmudJYHaa	maybe it might be dangerous coz she might bite her nails <br>  <br>  but you cud paint her toe nails|`|xOwafDqYaa	they make special nail polish for babies so it won't harm them if they chew on them. i would paint them =) it's cute.|`|gmpvLQ3Qaa	if you wait for it to dry it might not harm them but if wet it might harm|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I have a son, but if I had a daughter I certainly would not paint her nails until she was old enough to know not to put her fingers in her mouth.  After 3 I think is an acceptable age to use nail polish, but not bright pink though, I would likely use a very light colored pink or clear so she could be like mommy and have her nails done, but not look like a pageant contestant.
j9KXXd2daa	Like some others have suggested, I do like the potty seats that go on the big potty for girls.  They're cushioned, have handles, and come in a variety of favorite character patterns (Dora, Winnie the Pooh, etc) For boys, they're just a big mess!  :)  Also, you may want to take her out of the Pull-Ups all together.  She can't feel herself being wet in them, and if she's aware of it, she'll train faster.  Yes, it's messy at first.  Yes, you'll go through about 20 pairs of underwear the first day.  With my little boy, I set three days aside and put him in just underwear with no prior potty training or pull-ups at all.  By the end of day two, he was trained.  After two weeks, even occasional accidents ceased altogether, and he always tells me when he has to go.  You just REALLY have to stick with it.  He was afraid of the potty too.  So afraid I thought about giving up literally 10 minutes before he totally got it.  He was screaming while on the potty... I knew he had to go because he'd started and stopped himself, so I kind of gently held him there, trying not to cry with him.  I told myself...after this, no more.  But, I decided I'd make one last ditch effort: to try a timer... and I told him when it beeped, it was time to check potty... after that, there were no more tears, and all of a sudden, he grasped the concept and hasn't looked back since.  So crazy!  :)  This was when he was 20 1/2 months old.  He's almost 22 months now, and doing great.  So, here's some additional advice for your little one:<br>  <br>  Have her come with you to the store and pick out her own potty seat or another potty chair that she's more comfortable with.  We have a Baby Bjorn potty chair with my son (the one with the high back, not the little tiny one... well, actually we have one of those too for another bathroom which he goes on just fine even though it's VERY small).  It makes him feel secure and it seems comfortable to sit on.  They come in a variety of colors, though you may have to shop online to find one in the color you're looking for.  The Baby Bjorn Potty Chairs are a bit pricey, ranging from 22.99 to 27.99, but in my opinion, DEFINITELY worth the money.<br>  <br>  Allow her to sit on her potty to try it out with all of her clothes on.  Put it in front of the TV while she watches a video, invite her to sit on hers while you go to the bathroom on the big potty, or let her sit on it while she reads a book.  This will likely make her feel more comfortable with the idea that it won't "eat her butt." LOL :)  Let her put stickers on her potty to personalize it, and make a sticker chart for her to give her a visual image of her progress.  When she goes, let her pick out a sticker to put on the board (or herself).  :)  And of course, gummy bears or m & m's also make great incentives to try.  There's nothing wrong with a little bribing to help a child find the bravery to conquer something scary and unfamiliar.  ;)  <br>  <br>  You could also have a "Potty Party" complete with balloons and fun treats for the first time she sits on the potty and goes.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry.  She'll get it.  Just hang in there and don't give up! :)|`|IPSWR5w2aa	Do you have a potty ring to go on the adult toilet? and try using an incentive. For example, my daughter LOVED stickers. and every time she sat on the potty for a min, she got one sticker, when she went on the potty, she got a whole sheet of stickers.....Also, we put her on the potty backwards, she seemed to be more comfortable. Good Luck|`|EsGrIscFaa	Use a patterned kiddies toilet seat. We had a Whinnie the Pooh one and it's good as you can take it other places and pop it on the toilet. Then she'll recognise it from home.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	There are trainer seats which you can buy to go on top of the pan - she may cope with that.  A small plastic step stool may help, too.<br>  I put my daughter into little pants which I'd made (with loose legs) when she was 18 months exactly; it took her just 3 days to realise that she didn't like the feel or urine running down her leg and was happy to use her potty from then on.|`|sLkruqYVaa	how about a toddler seat for the "big toilet"
KWJ7ju6qaa	Too much vitamin A can be really dangerous.|`|158e8f51e731e93ad7f2eb5b83dc2c28aa	All vitamins are good for baby!
2ozl4K3Oaa	Your ANWER is 1.    That's all from my side.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PrqCDZ7raa	No, he's in the right category. If you can solve this equation it will give the answer to the most frequent question on Y!A: "Am I pregnant?"|`|RY2VFtw0aa	its very simple.power of any number being zero will result in 1 as the answer.so the answer is 1.|`|3gMytPXhaa	answer zero only|`|FRjZ8lgMaa	the answer is  1.   It means you are pregnant|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No, dear - whoever told you this is a hard problem was making fun of you. Any number to the power 0 is 1. So the answer is 1. It's trivial.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Well, I will answer yours if you can answer the most common one here...    I had sex without a condom. He pulled out, am i pregnant?|`|veO1RXrCaa	Yeah wrong category.  Were pregnant and have bigger issues then math equations.|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	Hmm, I think you may be in the wrong section.|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	7! tut I agree with pp .. We have bigger things to be worrying about in here than that really dont we? lol xx|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I know, I know, the answer is a number! Gosh I'm smart! :)    I think the real answer is 1.|`|FRFryWDfaa	what?|`|OU1lfxeQaa	wrong section ... Einstein !
HCvJ0AGnaa	Well firstly and MOST importantly your 27 weeks pregnant! This is an up and down time with hormones yes, however, you and the baby have to come first, all this stress your under, the worry and concern is no good for both of you!    Sit him down and tell him how you feel, if the 'shoe was on the other foot' how would he react if it was you and a close male friend? I'm sure he'd have said something about it by now.    For me , the meal incident would have pissed me off, and I understand your point of view totally, as for the shopping well HELLO... YOU are pregnant and you are having to get her shopping, in the snow?    This is probably all innocent, however, he has remember that YOU are his partner and YOU are having his child.    Sit him down and tell him how you feel, he'll probably rant a bit or do the man sulk routine, but at this time you need support and a settled atmosphere, something he should understand and deal with.    On a positive note he's not hiding the calls from you and it's all in the open, if it was hidden and you were to find out by accident then i'd be more inclined to be worried.    TSK men lol xx|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Its definetly not just you, you have something to be upset about. Its weird but if you think about it, if the girl was a guy he was talking to you probably wouldnt care, but since it is a girl he is crossing the line. You really need to sit down and talk to him about this and tell him how you feel. tell him you dont mind him having friends but that his new friend is coming between you and him. you really need to talk to him and get this off your chest. you do have every right to be upset though. good luck! :)|`|e0xpYnv1aa	If it wern't for your hormones being out of whack you probably wouldn't care so much. I'm the type who could care less who the person I'm with is talking to. But recently, an ex of my husband added him on facebook. He hates her because she really effed him over, and he admits he never was attracted to her...but I still got upset that she was trying to talk to him.    It's really just the hormones...but if it makes you feel better, remember that he's your man and her life is starting to go to sh*t hah|`|4e67Pdfvaa	sounds like they are waaaay too close!! I would be bothered also! Do you have another car.. do you have a way to see what they are up to when you are not arround.. surprise visit?|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You need to be assertive and stand up for yourself and let him know that his relationship with her is making you uncomfortable and that there needs to be some limits set with their relationship, because it's not appropriate for him to be carrying on with another woman if it's making you even the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's fine for a man to have female friends, but as I said, if you aren't comfortable with it, he should be respecting you, his partner.|`|kprKXEOSaa	With my last pregnancy, I became convinced my husband was having an affair.  I would cry about it sometimes, I was just convinced my marriage was falling apart.  I really knew it was hormones and that he wasn't, it was weird, like I had a split personality.    You do need to tell your partner, "hey, I'm a little wacked out on hormones, what you're doing is freaking me out."  He needs to be more sensitive to you.  Even if you weren't pregnant, what he's doing isn't right.  Just let him know that it's bothering you, and see what he does after that.  Good luck!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	nope. that crap needs to stop!! my husband had an ex who always insisted on calling him with all of her problems. i wasn't ok with it. i put my foot down and told him that he wasn't with that woman anymore, they have no ties to each other, she needs to back off. i told him that he was my husband and it was time for her to get over it (she was the girlfriend right before me! even pulled the "i'm pregnant" card to get him back!!).      its not just you.. you need to talk to your husband about this and let him know that it is not ok!!!|`|627pWyVkaa	Im really sorry to say this But I would have to say hes more then likely cheating and if he isn't yet he is going too. Id love to say trust your man......But thats beyond inappropriate behaviour......I had an ex who I found out later on would be on the phone with her all the time, thats how it started then during my bday she flew down from UK to canada To spend two weeks with him!!! And they both hide it from me (obviously why) trust me talk to him and tell him it needs to stop however I really doubt it would, because it shouldnt take anyone to tell this man what he is doing is disguisting and Hurtful> if he cared about you and his baby he wouldn't do this.|`|rZhaDDu5aa	No its not ur harmones. your partner seems to be cheating on you. you need to talk to him openly about it|`|ddP3klT3aa	Talk to him and ask him whats up.|`|gxlEqdclaa	He sounds like he would make a great friend. But honestly i don't know about this. Sit down and have a honest talk about this and let him know how you feel. If i was you i would not like it either.|`|iyb7YGXHaa	ask him how he would feel if the situation was reversed and it was YOU speaking to a MALE friend 2 or 3 times aday etc.   He wouldn't like it either I'm sure.|`|ejHfqSD1aa	It's not you or your hormones. This would bother me. Have you just calmly talked to him about it and how it makes you feel?|`|CLOtMCwSaa	You need to sit down and have a talk with him, ask him to put the cell phone in a different room, or on silent, or just turn it off, so that way it doesnt ring and he doesnt get distracted, if he refuses, tell him if he doesnt your going to leave. You have to get his attention one way or another, and then just flat out tell him how you are feeling, what you are thinking about. If he cant deal with it, your going to just have to leave. My wife is pregnant, and I had a friend of mine that I met in Germany, I am in Missouri in the states now, I used to talk to her all the time, but because my wife was having issues with that, I now dont really talk to her at all, it has been a few months. Well I dont know what else to say, Hope this helps.|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	Think you may have a problem. Sit him down and talk to him, maybe he is scared about the responsibility of parenthood or feeling left out (some men do).  Or maybe this lady is playing a naughty dangerous game.|`|J9pIrpkBaa	Well I don't usually get jealous but if my fiance started doing that I would be quite annoyed!    To be fair, he might feel as if he is just being a good friend! But I can totally see where you are coming from.|`|AA11167063	Talk to him and let him know wot u r thinking.|`|wxImZRssaa	I'm not pregnant or hormonal, and I'd be annoyed by this. Men have a tendency to turn into inconsiderate a holes when your pregnant.    Its hard though, because your pregnant, you can't argue properly, and all he'll say is its your hormones.    What works with my boyfriend is asking him how he'd feel if it was the other way round. If I was acting like this with an old male friend, seeing him as much and calling him as much. Make him think about it the other way round.    Hopefully he'll start to be more considerate of your feelings.|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	Oh huney I would have took care of that SOON.  You need to sit down and have a talk with your partner.  Tell him how you feel and the fact that they've gotten so close bothers you. Your pregnant! You need his attention most of the time.  Now I'm not saying for him to cut the girl off completley. But they are getting just a "little" bit too cozy. Time for that talk. Or some hair will be coming out....    Just kidding on the hair part! ^_^|`|JjXFj2EBaa	It's not that your fella is doing anything wrong per se, but his behaviour is highly innappropriate at the very least.  He would feel exactly the same if the situation were reversed, so it's not your hormones|`|9vgZNLP8aa	I see WAY too many red flags here!    First off, why is he even talking to her? He is with YOU, not HER. I don't care is she is "just a friend". You don't talk that much to a person of the opposite sex if you plan on being "just friends". Something is not right here.     You need to nip this in the bud now before it goes any further. You are not just being hormonal. If he loves you he shouldn't even want to be that close to another woman. Plus you are having his baby. He should be paying attention to you and his family.    I hope everything works out for you. Hang in there.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Men are odd when they are "expecting".     What you should do, is invite her over for dinner, sit down with them and really see how they interact with each other, then, after she leaves, discuss what you observed with your partner.     Stop driving yourself crazy and tell him how you feel. If nothing changes, then you're going to have some serious issues to overcome, I sense that he'll tone it down for you though, at least a little bit.     My first instinct tells me something is going on between them. But, I'm leaning more towards maybe there's something going on with her. Maybe she's sick, lost a baby, or is being abused. He seems to be more concerned for her than interested in her. Maybe she's pregnant and doesn't know how to handle it, since as you say, her and her partner are always fighting.     Your best bet though, become her friend too, at least then you'll be in the loop, and be honest with your partner about how you're feeling, and remind him that you and your baby are his family.    Best wishes, and congrats on expecting!|`|BVU040nwaa	I think the situation could be completly innocent, but why dont you try talking to him, tell him how you feel about this and ask him how he would feel if it was the other way round and some bloke kept ringing you!  Im 27weeks pregnant today and personally i wouldnt stand for it. I would have to confront him.  Not sure if its your hormones as i am also pregnant lol, so cant help you their.  Im sure her partner wouldnt be happy if he new she was always ringing up another bloke.  It could be just that she has no other friends to talk to.  Try talking to your partner, im sure you will feel better after.  Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy :)|`|6226337919d9467c9501a8d04a1c5d3faa	Well I would definitely have the hump if it was my hubby doing that.  I am 30 weeks pregnant and when he said he was going to lunch the other day I felt all down thinking he might be out having fun with other girls - turns out it was with a couple of guys, and I'm really not the jealous type at all, so I am sure hormones are not helping, however, the amount your partner is talking to this other girl does sound rather excessive.    If it was me I would tell him that I wanted to talk seriously to him about something and then just tell him how it is making you feel, say you dont want to argue about it, you just want him to understand how it is making you feel.  Hopefully you will then be able to judge by his reaction, it may all be pefectly innocent and he just hadn't realised, or maybe she is phoning him a lot and he just feels obliged to be nice to her because she's an old friend.    Either way, better to have it out, it's not fair that you should be feeling this way, it's hard enough when you are pregnant and hormones are all over the place anyway and your body is all messed up, he should be supporting you through this time, not putting all his attention elsewhere.  x|`|uQK6pICraa	Hmm....now, if it were me then I think I'd feel comforted by the fact that he is clearly very open about how often he chats to her and about when he sees her etc, as you would have been there had he have invited her out last Fri...and you were there when he delivered her shopping (that you paid for....cheek) etc........so he's obviously not hiding anything - but yes personally I'd want her to grow up and find a new best friend (or maybe ask her boyfriend to do her shopping for her, or spend time with her on a fri night).  It's tricky becuase by getting wound up with him about it it's as if you are showing you're insecure about your relationship...and hell, why should you be, afterall I'm sure he's lucky to have you so why should you be thinking that ....on the other hand, he needs to stop pussy footing around this friend.  If it was me I would probably ask him if she seems happy with her man and if she has many friends...I think that's how I would approach it, and I'd let him know that I think she kind of needs to get some new friends as he will be tied up with you and his bundle of joy in 13 weeks time.    Very best of luck....everything seems exagerated in pregnancy so try not to worry, you need to relax etc - I'm also nearly 27 wks pregnant - due 10 May - hope all goes well for you and baby!!
uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think your symptoms are going to return for sure as i too didn't had very severe symptoms till i was 10 weeks as they were there but like on & off & very light but after the 10th week i' m having severe nausea which becomes more horrible during the night time...and i feel sick because of that...so i would like to say this thing only that you should not worry ,as all things will be good both if you have or don't have symptoms but its always good that you don't have them severely because they really make you feel sick & tired..!!    hope i have helped you..    would love to know how things are going on your side dear..keep us posted..    well about the question when you have to worry is when you have severe cramping & bleeding then only there's a problem otherwise i don't think there should be any problem..|`|ROJans2Taa	I really didn't have any symptoms with my pregnancies, I did spot/bleed and have some cramps with my second though, I started feeling dizzy around 12 weeks, everyone handles pregnancies different, some adjust well to the hormone changes, others dont. I didn't experience sore boobs till almost the end. and it's common for symptoms to come and go, and to get new ones out of the blue. best luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	That early on usually you don't have much for symptoms because the hormone isn't that strong yet...hell some women don't even test positive yet.|`|RgKNbqLmaa	Iam the exact same way, I just found out I was pregnant yesterday, and My boobs and tiredness are the worse, but I feel like when I drive in a car I get nauseated, and I feel like all the symptoms are there one minute and the next minute I dont even feel pregnant. So dont sweat it Iam sure this is normal!   ?Congratulations!?|`|BVU040nwaa	Im 27weeks pregnant and i found that in the beginning i had good days and bad days as i still do now.  Some days i didnt feel pregnant at all and some i did.    At about 12weeks i had a bleed. I was very worried! -  always best to get it checked out, but turned out to be a small hematoma. Their was no explanation for it, it just happened and i found out it is quite common for a lot of women to bleed in the beginning and everything is usually  fine, but always get any bleed checked out!    I was worried in the beginning as i never suffered from morning sickness and still havent (very lucky!).    Trust me.. the weeing and tiredness will catch up with you later on so take advantage of feeling good now (without over-doing it) and remember that every womans pregnancy is diffrent, we are all diffrent and so are our bodys.    GOOD LUCK :)
xPR7g0wFaa	I had the same thing happen to me. A lady ask me if I was having twins(I was 6 months with my son). I had the last laugh when I said "Excuse me? Im not pregnant". OMG her face was worth a million.|`|oem5yEUDaa	I'm fine dealing with strangers and telling them they are wrong or their comments are unwanted, I'm never going to see them again. It's the people I DO know that I have a hard time with. Especially my MIL she keeps giving me outdated advice and when I tell her my doctor says particular things are not okay anymore she will either get upset and withdraw from me or tell me my doctor doesn't know what she is talking about.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Excellent!  Love your reply.  <br>  <br>  I'm not the nicest person when I get given bad advice, I even once snarled "And how would you know?" to a lady who was insisting my baby was hungry - barely 10 minutes after a feed.  Mind you, it was my turn to eat, I was starving and therefore very irritable.|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Ignore them I'm sure you have a beautiful belly no matter how big or small the belly its a beautiful thing I'm sure u look beautiful tune them out hun|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	just smile and nod, smile and nod...  ;)<br>  <br>  (I am 4'10 and I got a lot of crap also.  Some people even thought that I was a little kid.  I love the whole doc card thing.  I may use that with my next pregnancy)|`|FhEUCrttaa	LOL! Great respond! I was told I didn't look like I was "so many months" pregnant. I am a big but if you knew me before you knew that I was. I would respond and tell them I was right on schedule!|`|4iXL4C6paa	been there done that, I dont think those people really realize what they are doing and saying lol, if I ever decide to have another baby I am definitely using the doctor card trick lol.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I know how you feel. I hear all the time how big my baby bump is, but I just smile and laugh it off. I was tiny when I got pregnant and like you I am only 5'4". So of course I'm going to show more than some women do. A lot of the remarks come from my family though and they do it because they just aren't use to me having the bump, because of how tiny I've always been, I'm still small in my opinion I'm only 123lbs. <br>  <br>  I totally get where you are coming from though, it would offend me if a total stranger came up to me and started talking about how huge I am. Women of all people should know it isn't smart to tell a pregnant woman she looks "huge". I'm sure you look just fine and if your doctor is telling you that you measure perfectly for your stage of pregnancy, then just ignore the comments and keep doing what your doing.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your little one! =]|`|3dKjLPGeaa	ignore|`|35kVNi5oaa	haha i know what you are saying!! same thing happens to me all the time..but i have no idea what to say..|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	funny! good for you-people are so strange. seriously!! who thinks its ok to say something like that???|`|AGcwdZGmaa	just ignore them there !diots <br>  lol great response you got for cocky people<br>  i was massive with my 2nd i looked like i was 37 weeks pregnant when i was 16 weeks lol i just said at lest my baby with be nice and healthy <br>  which i was wrong i had i prem at 32 weeks but he was huge for his age so it help that i was so big : )|`|6L9jJnchaa	You and I have the same due date, lol.  I haven't had that happen because no one can really tell I'm pregnant yet...but I have a feeling I'm going to have to yell at some people later.<br>  <br>  There is this one girl in my math class who knows I'm pregnant, and I came in with a coffee cup (it was hot chocolate) and she started lecturing me...that was annoying.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Roll my eyes and try to ditch them.. Unless my hormones got the better of me. I'd ask to see her degree from medical school if she tries to correct my doctor.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Say "Oh, really and what prestigious medical school did you graduate from exactly?"|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i would have been polite until she said "well your docs wrong" then i would have said "well too bad we cant all be as perfect as you [roll eyes]"
CvESLNnkaa	Unfortunately the most effective will be not giving in but you may have a few sleepless night ahead of you if you want to break him.  He knows when he screams and hyperventilates that you will give in.  He will not kill or permanently hurt him self with a tantrum but he could get bad enough he will vomit.  My son has had one that was that bad.  lol at the time it was horrible but now I just smile.|`|NnWC1lxdaa	can you maybe get him a body pillow? i know my kids more my son will start off in his bed at night and then some point at night time he will come down and sleep on the couch. can you tell him to sleep on the couch or make him a small "bed" on the floor and just keep moving it closer to his bedroom ? good luck|`|1d32c597939f5bfba71ac806fb1f1b91aa	OMG, I'm with you, or was.  I am a stay at home mom so this worked for me, might be harder for those of you who work.  I literally slept on the couch for 3 months before my daughter would sleep through the night so my husband could get some sleep before waking at 4:30 in the morning.  The idea is to put them straight back to bed, stroke hair no more than 3 times and kiss goodnight.  If that didn't work I would tell her that the gate would be put in her doorway if she got out of bed again and then I didn't see her again for the rest of the night.  Does she still have her moments?  Yes!! Not gonna lie, however she is not in my bed anymore and a once in a while thing is fine.  You really have to be consistant, kids need/like that.  Good luck.|`|bRmAUPmkaa	i have had this happen before. what you do is give him one of your shirts that you have worn and your blanket or pillow. then you calmly explain to him that these 'magical' things are a part of mommy and that when you wake up at night, they will help you go back to sleep. and then, if that doesnt work, you should not say a word to him when he starts screaming and calmly pick him up and place him in his bed. then you close his door and hold it shut so he cant open it until he calms down. it might take a couple of nights but, then he'll get it.|`|YOqwT2SHaa	Well, from personal experience, I suggest a nice, warm bath in petroleum to soothe him down.
3OmihLtYaa	chances are it is your current boyfriend's baby but it is hard to say for sure. You can always petition for DNA testing after the baby is born to determine who it is, because a new born is hard to tell characteristics of the parents. My baby was a few months old before he started to resemble me or his father.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	most likely boyfriends, i would stop worrying and enjoy your pregnancy|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Do not have a DNA test done until after the baby is born.  Why put your unborn child at risk to know now.  It's an invasive procedure at this point and a cake walk once the baby is born.  You'll just have to wait it out. <br>  <br>  It's most likely the boyfriend's baby anyway.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	There's no way of telling...-Looks like you're going to have to wait until the baby is Born- so that a DNA test can be performed. Just hope that ONE of the guys in your Life- sticks around to see the Outcome. If you can't wait "that long", then you have some VERY difficult Choices to make...-and Soon!  Good luck.|`|n3IoftMFaa	There is no way to tell, the dates are too close together.<br>  <br>  Do not get DNA done now - they do it through amniocentesis and it can cause miscarriage.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm pretty sure it's your boyfriends but the dates are to close really..<br>  You should do a DNA test.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|6L9jJnchaa	It's too close together, you have to get a DNA test.|`|Yy3zDYW1aa	well it says u had already 3 sex,but for example the father of ur first one would be the one u had sex on December 28,so ur second one would be the one u had sex on the day after new years eve day.so if u have sex for the 4 time and i know it feels good (the sex) that is the one who is the father.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	wait till the baby is born and then you can see who he looks like sorry but it will be really hard to tell, if you want to know now you will have to get a dna test done.. but i suggest you wait.. it doesnt matter who the father is the important thing is that he is yours and that the baby has you..!   and i glad that you are not going with abortion like some heartless women do...!|`|dCLnLlsCaa	Go to www.mymonthlycycle.com and they give a pretty accurate ovulation date so that should give you a better idea.  Those days are so close together so it's hard to say but if you said your ex did not ejaculate inside you then I would put my money on your boyfriend.|`|UvkF2pZraa	well after the baby is born you can take ur ex to court for child support and they automatically take DNA test<br>  this is just what i know from watching law and order<br>  im only 13 so you might no want to listen to me<br>  good luck <br>  i hope everything works out|`|FNs6T9qGaa	Im sorry... <br>  But theres no way to tell other than a DNA test.<br>  -december 28th, and January 1st are wayyy to close together.<br>  <br>  <br>  -good luck.|`|z9ey2Uqkaa	You're going to need to do the DNA test.  That's kinda how it goes being a whore.  Sorry.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I would say it is most likely your boyfriends baby. If you finished with a condom on with your ex, then you would of had to get pregnant from his precum, which is possible, but pretty rare. I wouldn't worry about this too much. Does your boyfriend know there's a possibility he isn't the father? If so and he's willing to stay with you, than I'd say your best bet would be getting a DNA test done after the baby is born. It is probably a little bit cheaper doing it that way, then having it done while you are pregnant. Good Luck, and congrats on the little one.|`|XMm0XR75aa	go to the hopsital nd get  a dna x|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Hard, hard question.  The two dates you had sex are really close together.  Which ultrasound was the earliest and the date you had it???  Earliest ultrasound is probably most accurate of your due date.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that it was your boyfriends child because he actually came inside of you (but that doesn't have to be the case)  Lets say that you started to ovulate around December 29th (too late for ex boyfriend anyways.  Mucus stays for about 5 days.  So you would be fertile from the 29-Jan 2.  I'd give you a 75 percent chance that you will have a boy.  (Just for fun, I like to guess.)<br>  <br>  Judge will order both to pay for the test.  It isn't your problem to pay for it.  However, if you want to be nice or not make a big deal your more then welcome to pay for it.

AA11091233	I think they are beautiful names..but actually...not overly fond of Evelyn (too old fashioned) or Blue. Blue makes me feel depressed.    Hannah Grace  Blue Amelia  Evelyn Rose  Violet Elizabeth    Too many middle names to choose from.....you'll find the right one when you decide on the first name.    Best wishes!|`|VGij9p0Taa	Congrats!  Hannah Raine i think this name is really nice and provides a good mix of old and new.   Blue Louisa i dislike Blue i find it to celebish but i think Louisa is good middle name for this Louisa Blue maybe.  Evelyn Sienna, the name Evelyn goes really well with Sienna meaning earth coloured i think the name is really cute.   Violet Avery this name is very short, simple and cute. Avery i think goes well with Violet meaning modest flower. Simple yet effective.   I would go with either Violet Avery or Evelyn Sienna.

MxhNzW7Oaa	I know exactly how you feel. I was in denial for years that my 4 year old has autism. Back in November I decided to do some research and it smacked me in the face. All the cute & annoying little quirks he did were characteristics of Autism. He recently was evaluated and was confirmed that he has PDD. We're one step closer to getting help so he can live a normal life.    Stop blaming yourself and focus on what you can do NOW for you son. Get him into therapies, pre-school and any extra-curricular activites you can that will help with his disability.     If you need any advice or just want to talk, feel free to e-mail me.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	It is not your fault and i would like to tell you about my partners child who he has to a previous relationship,    We got together when she has just turned 3, instantly i knew she was delayed, i held off on saying anything for a while, but eventually i realised it is difficult for parents to realise there own child is behind and they usually dont know until someone brings it up.  This child is now 6 and she is at the same level as my 3 yr old and only recently has her mother been able to recognise and admit there is a problem.     you are oobviously doing the best you can by getting your child professional help and that is all any mother can do so dont beat yourself up about it cause it is not your fault at all.  Maybe you could speak to a councellor about the way you are feeling    good luck to you and your son|`|26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	If you live in the US then call your local school district and ask to be connected with Parents as Teachers.

But you can stop feeling bad about it so that you can be as functional as you need to be for the future.  A child with learning or physical delays needs the regular encouragement  and love.  Who better than his Mommy.      His delays may be the result of any number of things, and not all are under human control.  Many mothers eat unhealthy foods and drink or smoke and have perfectly healthy babies.  Some mothers do everything they should and have babies with problems.      Get off the "pity pot" and put on your "big girl panties".   It's time to fight for your son's future.|`|4JgSq2rlaa	how is he delayed in what way?|`|i1ldfvmEaa	you and your son could go to family councleing
Ku7HCaJIaa	My answer: Don't worry about it. Infrequent sex without a condom while you are on the pill shouldn't result in a pregnancy for most women. Just make sure to keep taking the pill on time, because pregnancy can happen several days afterward if you miss pills and if the sperm survives in your uterus. Remember, the odds of getting pregnant greatly increase if you do not take your birth control correctly.|`|AA12123428	Minimal; about 1 in 100, so don't worry about it.    Most cases of women falling pregnant while on the Pill are due to an incompatibility.

aL4UoRdTaa	There is hope!!  PCOS is not an uncommon condition in women.  I've had a miscarriage and an infant loss.  So I am part of the loss community and there are women who go on to get pregnant with PCOS.  I was just diagnosed with endometriosis which is in a way similar to PCOS.  So I understand the worry and anxiety and panicky feelings.  It is all so horrible.  That mixed with the grief can be overwhelming.   It helps to get an expert opinion.  When my doctor diagnosed me with endo I started having actual panic attacks.  I gave in and spent literally money I didn't have to go see a specialist.  After that I feel MUCH MUCH better.  If you can find a specialist and find a way to get the money for an initial consultation i think it would help so much.  Also it really really helps to talk to other mothers with a loss who are trying to get pregnant.  If you want more support or want to talk more you can visit this message board I set up for women who have had a pregnancy or infant loss. Right now our membership is small but we are loving, knowledgeable, and we now how to have fun (when appropriate).  http://alovingjourney.freeforums.org/|`|rmse6Mj8aa	your uterine wall being thin can be corrected by giving you progesterone, and if you have pcos they can treat it.  diagnosing what is causing your problems will help you to become a mother. the dep and the ring both secrete hormones. its good you have been off them for a while.  if your periods are regular that's great. they will probably start you on something to stimulate your ovaries and thicken that lining.  dont worry so much this is all great news. if you dont know whats wrong yuo can't fix it. you are a step closer as already said above me. you are on the right road. keep faith and try to relax.  lots  of women with pcos have kids just fine. x|`|hGojk9UGaa	Where do you live?

anmbQv0Saa	Well, there is a chance that the condom splitting doesn't mean that you're pregnant it depends how long into intercourse it split. The sperm will come out of the condom and join with an egg. The chances of you getting pregnant normally are 1in10 without a condom the chances are about 4 in 5. This is because you had no other form of birth control. Okay other people may be saying that mixing the tests up was a dumb idea but I would've probably done the same thing so all you have to do now is...  Tell your friends what happened first before your boyfriend as your friends are more likely to be in this situation themselves. Just ask them to take another test with you and don't mix them up or even if they take the test first on their own and if they are pregnant then you will know that there is no need to take one yourself. If you are pregnant then tell your boyfriend as soon as possible as it will hurt him if you don't    Let me know what happens...    I added you as a contact    xxxx|`|RoTLnFGZaa	you need to take a test, and check it without mixing them up, obviously.  you're going to have to face it sooner than later.  and if you're pregnant, you need medical attention.    theres a chance, cause the condom broke, so yes.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Why would you mix them up? You need to take another test because if you are pregnant you need to see a doctor and start taking prenatal vitamins. And if a condom splits it doesn't mean your pregnant it just means you have a high chance of being pregnant. Start using better condoms too, because there is a difference. Everything will be fine, just take another test and either way try to make the best of it. Let us know, and best of luck!|`|ySKK7lCyaa	If that is what will make you feel more comfortable then ask them to take one with you. But just know that it still might be your friends.    good luck, here if you need to talk.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Okay... mixing them up was dumb, sorry.  That makes no sense.  You have to take a test on your own.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	My baby is also eight weeks old. What I do (and this may not work for you but it's worth a try) After every feeding (spaced out every three to four hours) I keep her awake 30 minutes minimum to 1 hour 30 minutes maximum during the day. It's hard to wake a sleeping baby but sometimes you have to especially when it comes to teaching them when to sleep. Keeping them up after they eat during the day I have found is crucial to this otherwise they will sleep all day and be awake all night. I make sure she gets exposed to sunlight and I keep every lamp on in the house on all day so even when she naps she's not in the dark and I lay her down at night to sleep at about 1 am. She usually wakes for a feeding around 8 am and another around noon. Many books say to put babies down around 11 pm but I have found the hard way that it just doesn't work and if it does you're up at the crack of dawn to feed them again. Consistency with any routine is key and very hard to establish when you're a new mother but it's worth it just keep trying. I hope I've helped, good luck.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	He is still like newborn baby. Looking after newborn babies can be very tiring for parents, the babies need their feeding and nappy changings every 4 hours. its quite common about babies crying for while due to having colic (wind trap). You can try unwind baby then lie him down if he pulls his knees up (bend) means he still has some winds in his belly, If this doesn't help, go see your health visitor about this, they might give you med for baby's winds problems the med can be given before they get their feeding time. don't pick baby up if he is just awoke (not crying) he would go sleep eveneally, leave baby crying for 5 mins not longer than that, don't rush pick baby up once he start to cry. Once your baby getting older and starts eat baby food when 4 months or later he will sleep longer i promise you, I can understand how tiring and stress parents can be with newborn babies as parents don't have much of sleeps|`|H6COtFH4aa	that is bed thing for there helth|`|DtIcDLTcaa	some babies need less sleep - my suggestion would be to vary your routine. he also may be ready for a crib rather than the moses basket.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Does he finish his 4am feed? If so he may be getting a little hungrier and need a larger feed. Or maybe he's getting over-full from the 4am feed and feeling uncomfortable? Babies sleep habits vary so much and it takes a few months for them to settle into a good night-time routine so you may have a few more weeks of him waking at odd hours and not getting back to sleep. Don't worry too much, just make sure that he's comfortable and warm etc, I'm sure he will improve as he gets older, he's doing really well now to sleep to 4am, mine used to wake every two hours! Good luck anyway, I know how hard this stage is!
e8vggLuFaa	Are you breastfeeding?  If so, it is possible that foods from your diet will also affect her.  But, there is no reason to adjust your diet unless you have noticed symptoms.      Do you have allergies (food or otherwise) or a history of allergies and asthma in your family?  For infants not genetically predisposed to having allergies, waiting at least 3-5 days gives time for increased exposure to the food to show common issues.  Sometimes it can take awhile for a tolerance level to be hit, which is why infants that are genetically predisposed to wait at least a week or more.  Eating the food once may not cause any noticeable problem but eating that food many times might.  Foods can take days or weeks to completely leave the body (dairy is especially slow to leave the body - it can take a week or two to see improvement and a month or two for it to completely leave your system, most other foods, a few days to a week may do fine), so if you do see reactions, it is preferable to let the food causing the reaction to completely leave the body before trying a new food.  If your daughter is predisposed, you probably should hold off the more allergenic foods for the proposed timeline - You can look this up - things like peanuts/tree nuts, fish, shellfish and eggs have stamps for not trying them before a year - for the predisposed it can be several years, especially for nuts and shellfish.    The most common allergic symptoms are eczema, hives, anal ring diaper rash (red area focused around the anus), unusual stools (could affect color, texture and smell - fluorescent green, uncharacteristically gassy/smelly, bloody, black (could indicate occult blood meaning bleeding coming from the gastric tract), diarrhea too often).  Trouble breathing is generally a more dangerous symptom.  Sometimes things like asthma, constant congestion/runny nose could be a hint, depending.  Allergy shiners, where the kids have puffy under-eyes, could be a hint.  Refusal to eat certain foods may or not mean anything.  Stomachaches and general crankiness could be a hint or mean other issues.  Some immunologic reactions to foods don't include the rashes or breathing issues, but instead manifest in other ways (celiac, gluten intolerance, gastrointestinal issues, eosinophilic diseases, even behavioral issues)    Anaphylactic reactions are those where more than one body system is affected, i.e. breathing issues in addition to hives.  In these cases, you need to bring the infant to the ER or call 911.  Talk to your doctor and get epinephrine injectors to keep at home in case of emergency.  These will speed up your child's systems to help her process the allergen faster and could save her life.  If you use epinephrine, you need to go to the ER (or call 911) afterwards.    Be aware of changes in your daughter - allergies can even cause behavioral reactions (and nothing else!) or symptoms that develop slowly or worsen over time.  Sometimes kids with less usual symptoms are diagnosed later, because doctors do not identify food allergies as the cause.  Although food allergies are being diagnosed more frequently, sometimes the only indication is reactions, and allergy tests are negative or falsely positive.  Pay attention to reactions.  If you notice issues, you should keep a food diary for what you and your child eat on a daily basis.  It can help to show patterns of reaction that you might not notice otherwise.    In our case, our son was growing fine, and then started to fall off the growth curve.  He tested positive to many foods before he was on solids, and it turns out he was very sensitive to food proteins in my milk.  I went on a strict elimination diet and he improved, slowly but surely.  He is now 4 1/2 and is still off of peanuts/all tree nuts, fish and shellfish, eggs, wheat, dairy, soy and oats.  He has had reactions to many more foods in the past but is able to have those now in moderation.  Myself, I was never able to really go back to eating the foods I had to get off of, so now nursing my daughter (15 months), I am still off more foods than my son.  My daughter has reacted to dairy and spices (as well as potentially other unknowns) via breastmilk also, so I have to be careful with cheating on my diet.  She has never had any of those foods I have trouble with as solid intake, except for oats, which we have also pulled after some reactions.    Hopefully you will see no issues.  There's no need to worry either, just because your doctor gave this precaution.  Just take the foods slowly and go with your gut.  My son wasn't ready for solids until 9 months.    Good luck!  Hope your baby enjoys solids :)  Remember that breast milk and formula are primary caloric intake for the first year and solids are for fun :)|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	My niece was allergic to cow's milk since she was a newborn. My sis discovered that she kept vomiting terribly -- the projectile kind, crying, and just allover sick.  The doctor diagnosed her as milk allergic -- and while my sis was nursing, she couldn't eat any dairy herself, because it was getting into her milk.  So if your baby had any severe allergies as my niece had from the start, you may have noticed it right away through your diet, if you nursed.    As far as watching now for symptoms as you introduce her to foods, look for swollen lips (you'll notice it, believe me), wheezing, difficulty breathing (she'll be fussy most likely as well), rash - itchy hives.  If you're still nervous and unsure, don't hesitate to call the doctor and ask specifically what symptoms to look for and any other questions you might have.|`|Iarvsn7yaa	He will cry and cry and cry. Babies only cry for a reason. If its not the nappy, then its food allergy.    You may need to change the milk|`|l7RJkc3baa	Trust me you will know right away that something is wrong. Rash is the 1st thing.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	most common are skin rashes, breathing difficulties in severe cases swelling of the lips or other parts of the body (go to hospital if that happens).|`|S4dLfbHAaa	Just keep an eye on her skin and her nappies - if she has an allergy, she will develop a rash and probably have diaorreah. If it is really bad, she may start to have difficulty breathing but this is very unlikely if you are only just trying things like fruit and veg rather than peanuts! A new food may take a few days to work through her system, and thats why you should leave a few days between introducing new foods, so that you know if she gets ill what has caused it.|`|7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	Wow, reading some of these responses, I learned a lot--and I have four kids.  Anyway, I noticed a sensitivity to certain foods by their poop.  If it was runny and they developed a diaper rash, then I knew the newest food was the culprit.  My daughters outgrew the allergies after a while, but the milk allergy is still apparent in two of them.

It is your responsiblility to get that kid to 18 unharmed. If you fail to do so, YOU have failed.

You are her parent, and it is your responsibility to keep her safe.  She may hate you for the things that you do now, but she will thank you in the long run.    Threaten her.  If she spends hours texting every day, take away her cell phone.  Don't let her use her computer if she misbehaves.  Be cautious when she goes out with friends; make sure that there is a parent in the house when she goes to a party.  By doing this, you will ensure her safety, and she may be upset, but she will be happy when you keep her from losing her virginity very early.  It is okay if she is boy crazy; teenage girls usually are.  The issue is if they act on their obsessions and become promiscuous.  Talk to her about sex and the dangers, and maker her aware of what her actions could mean.|`|5F224cRzaa	tell her it damages 12 year olds if they have sex thats why you should always be over 16 ... tell her a horror story about someone dying or something lol|`|JF343E2Taa	i don't want to offend u but i would talk to her with your partner take control put her on the pill if u feel that worried seriously i hope everything will be ok for you and her|`|AA12115728	You need to get to the bottom of this.  I disagree with the folks who are saying to punish and control her every move.  I think you need to take her to a child psychologist or counselor.  There may be a really stupid reason - probing curiosity, or maybe just to set you off, for example.  She might be getting this behavior from another source, perhaps older children (or, god forbid, an adult) are exposing her to these ideas inappropriately.  So, she may really need some serious intervention.  You need to get this checked out in a way that does not make matters worse.  Good luck to you.|`|VkvhtD4daa	go to maury
y2I5SZWcaa	i would always get her checked by a doctor if the crying is new it could however be colic i wouldnt change formula straight away asthen you can get confursed about what is causoing the problem make sure you get as much help from friends and family if the crying continues colic is definbed as crying for 3 hours for at least 3 days a week for 3 weeks no one knows what causes it but it is probably due to immature digestive systems it does go away by about 12 weeks so there is light at end of tunnel|`|Cl4AfJPcaa	its not constipation its gas. My son had gas really bad when he was younger and nothing really worked. The best thing to do is lay baby on her back and bicycle her legs and push her knees into her abdomen(not very hard, you dont wanna hurt her) Youll have to do this for about a half hour but its worth it. Makes your little one feel so much better

9bcd0af449bde02dc1f98498d7b11d88aa	If you can't miss the appts, I would bite the bullet and go. Otherwise you'll just have to reschedule.

How far along are you?|`|Gb19X3xVaa	You will know when you are too sick to go out.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	No. I firmly believe that if you're not feeling well, you should stay home and rest up - and if you're pregnant, it's even more important to do so.    Feel better!|`|TOoNHNv9aa	i wouldnt go.. imagine throwing up in the middle of your appointments or not feeling well enough to drive home.  that'd be awful.  stay home and relax.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	How pregnant?

If they aren't too important and you can reschedule them then stay home if you really feel that you cant go out. Good luck!
AA11103493	You try to make it sound like your ex is the difficult one, from reading what you have written above I have to say that it sounds like you that's making things difficult.  Why can't you see the same teachers he does at the same time as him?  After all, you're talking about the same child.  Any other option just causes more work and hassle for everyone else.|`|uP08b6K4aa	The school have an obligation to keep BOTH parents informed of their child/ren's progress at school and if they're not doing so, then it's down to you to make a complaint or enquiry to the Local Education Authority.     Firstly, approach the headmaster/mistress of the school and voice your concerns.  There is no reason whatsoever or excuse NOT to involve you both and to say that they cannot arrange different appointment times, total and utter rubbish!  Schools are aware that a majority of children these days are from estranged families and therefore compensate for that alone, not to mention the parents who perhaps work split shifts and have to attend at different times.    In my opinion, (from what you've said) it almost seems as though the father and his wife are attempting to void you from your childs' life altogether, have you asked your daughter if she wishes you to attend these appointments, or of any other concerns she may have with regard to her upbringing?  Have you asked her if she has any concerns with regard to your health, she may have unanswered questions in that aspect to, and in that respect, there is more reason for you to keep in contact with the school in the event that she too is now feeling anxious with moving to her dads.    Approach that school, TELL them you intend to go to the parents evening and that they make an appointment for you and if for any reason they decline, say that you'll be speaking to the LEA as I mentioned above.    I wish you every luck with everything, let us know how you get on x|`|aIakDSstaa	Your the parent and so is her father, you and the father should go together and bothe partners should stay at home. You cant expect the school to go through everything twice.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Well, the obvious answer would be to go ahead and go, with your partner as your support, but an alternative would be to find out when each teacher's conference period is daily, and slowly plug away at meeting with them during those times.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I am pretty much in the same situation as you.  My son is 8 and his father and I split up when my son was 9 months old.  From the day my son started school I've made the teachers aware that his father and I are not in a position to be able to attend parents evenings together (his father was convicted of violent harrassment towards me when my son was 2 years old) so they arrange for seperate meetings, they send us each a copy of his school reports and also send his father copies of every school letter sent home (not that I don't inform him..he just likes to feel special lol).    As much as me and my ex don't get along we're civil for the sake of our son and I involve him in any major decision with regards to our son.  However my ex has a BIG problem with my partner being involved in anything to do with my sons life (even though we've been together for 3 1/2 years) yet his partner is free do have as much involvement as she likes (even though she's attacked me twice and has previously complained about the amount of time my son spends with them)....    My advice...keep it all official and explain the situation with the school and the fact that you have Parental Responsibility and therefore every right to expect the same time with your daughters teachers as her father has.  Also make sure you bring this up in the next directions hearing...with a 3rd party there you may find it easier to come to an agreement with your ex with regards to future dealings with the school etc and your involvement in all aspects of your daughters life.    Hope this helps =)|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Unfortunately, since he is the custodial parent, your rights in the matter are limited. The appointments are made with their schedules in mind. You can ask to see any papers, or reports after, but that's it.    There really isn't anything to be done here...save support your child the best way you know how.    Good luck.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	this isn't about you, it's about her...go along with what the school suggests|`|xocIN0scaa	ignore the father and his wife..go to see the teachers anyways. your daughter, you have a right. What would they do? Arrest you for going to teachers night? dont think so|`|UHb5GFIIaa	Hi there, i was just going to suggest the things you have tried anyway, ie. by speaking to the school and you have tried speaking to your ex, its a shame because you are just wanting to do good by your daughter, i would have thought that your ex's wife would have taken a back seat and allowed you to go with your daughter's father, after all you are her parents not her. Maybe speak to your solicitor to have a word with your ex to stop his wife from going, i know this can be done because my ex partner had children and her solicitor sent us a letter to ask me not to be present at court or any hearings etc because i had nothing to do with the children, they were th parents, i was only to happy to sit back and let them sort it out because i felt i was stuck in the middle of their arguments all the time. I dont know your situation with his wife but could you not chat with her, or ask your daughter what she wants ? she might not want her step mum there at all ? but i would try and ask your solicitor for advice.    Good luck and i wish you all the best, i do understand, i suffer from anxiety and depression myself.    I just re read your question again, i think you should  leave your partner at home and go with your ex, but since he has already booked the time then maybe this time let them go and next parent evening you go instead and take it turns, you cant expect to go with your partner and let your ex be happy with the situation either, after all your daughter lives with him full time ( although i do understand your reason's why )    but being a depressant myself i have my children living with me, giving them to another relative is not always the answer.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	My father-in-law and husband do this so I understand your Ex's frustration.    If you had just asked, "when and where are the conferences?".  And not one word more.  No questions, create no problems, no explanations about your anxiety, no "special" arrangements, no negotiations.  Nothing.  Your Ex would have figured you would be to afraid to come.  All of the negotiating and explanations are just plain annoying to other people, and your Ex has long ago become fed-up.    If your daughter is enough incentive for you then just show up and follow your Ex around to the teacher appointments.|`|5c9Aj7DEaa	maybe you could ring the school and ask to talk to some/most of your daughters teachers individually. thats what my mum had to do when she couldnt go to my parents evening.
LKIhUMCgaa	when u go to a doctor, u're given 2 due dates, one by LMP, which would make u 3w2d pregnant (which u're really not) and first Ultrasound due date.     LMP due date is given to u ONLY as an estimate bc the doctor doesn't know when exactly the baby was conceived. Ultrasound due date is more accurate bc they actually measure the fetus by its' growth to determine how old it is and how far long u r (it's only accurate if it's done in 1st trimester).    if the LMP and Ultrasound dates r different, then the doctor usually changes the due date to u/s one. the reason they can't really count from the day u had unprotected sex is bc sometimes it's not the actual day the egg was fertilized. the sperm can live in uterus for up to 7 days, so even though, lets say a week ago u had sex, the egg might have not been fertilized till today. but the u/s gives u the most accurate date of the conception.|`|4d8yOK3iaa	Because doctors count the pregnancy weeks, starting with the first day of your last period. Its easier to do it that way, because its almost impossible to know the exact date of conception.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	All sites and doctors count week 1 from the first day of your period.  I am 24 weeks pregnant but technically i am only 22 since the first 2 weeks were before I ovulated...it is really weird.
Bw1h5xAcaa	Take a test.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	The best way to know for sure is to see a doctor. All the best.|`|58bpydRJaa	I would defiantly go to the doctor's office! I think you may have been pregnant! Spotting a little in the very beginning is common, but now that you are bleeding heavier it sounds like it may be a problem! Your doctor will give you a a urine test to check if you are and probably order blood work to see your numbers to see if you are miscarrying! Please, go so that you know! I have been in this situation..... I know that it is difficult if it is a miscarriage. I miscarried my first pregnancy and it is very sad, but I have a beautiful daughter and another one on the way! Good luck!
Bw1h5xAcaa	Take it first thing in the morning with your first morning urine. The hormone would be at the most concentrated (if you're pregnant) and will be more likely to show up.    If you drink a lot of water, it will dilute your urine and make the hormone more difficult to be detected by a test.|`|4d8yOK3iaa	The best time to take a test is in the morning with your first urine. ITs more concentrated then. And I would wait until you are a couple days late for your period as well. Good luck.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It is best to do it first thing after you wake up in the morning and don't drink alot of fluids before going to bed because otherwise you dilute the urine.  The yellower the better|`|8YltlMsjaa	the best time it first thing in the morning|`|gLXzVbm8aa	time: its better in the morning  way: well if you place the test between your legs while trying to pee in the toilet you will be fine try to aim at the test while you pee|`|K542Db29aa	in the morning when your first wake up let it sit for 3mins, and make sure you are a couple weeks late of your period so you can get a clear result:)  good luck    if still is negative and your period still doesnt come  go to the doctors or clinic to do blood work!
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, if her cervix is shortened, she still has one - but might have to have it sewn closed temporarily (cerclage) to prevent it prematurely dilating during pregnancy, but some studies have actually found that this doesn't necessarily help. She could probably still have a vaginal birth, and I don't see why it would matter how she got pregnant.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's possible though they would haev to stitch her cervix and she could still deliver naturally|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well a problem with the cervix is a huge deal since the cervix is what keeps the baby in.  They may need to do a cerclage on her if she does end up pregnant but it looks like it will be a bumpy road for her.  Pregnancy is always possible...keeping the pregnancy is the real question and a why are you asking about a c-section...has nothing to do with a short cervix|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	It's possible to get pregnant - and yes the old fashioned way, but if she has a short cervix from a procedure like a LEEP or cone biopsy then they might do a cerclage to hold it together until late pregnancy to avoid cervical incompetence and miscarriage or preterm delivery. And she could still have a vaginal delivery.
6Fw870GSaa	i am trying to conceive as well , i have been trying for 3 months now and nothing happen , my gp advised me to take the folic acid every day and try to have sex between the 14 and 16 days after the first day of your last period to hit the egg , but you should not get upset or stressful because it doesn't help ,good luck for you and me .|`|gLXzVbm8aa	do it everyday and dont stress about it. i have been trying to get pregnant to and everyone told me i wasnt getting pregnant because i actually wated to be pregnant. btw the people who told me this got pregnant when they didnt wanna be pregnant... just have fun and it will happen when you dont plan it|`|rmse6Mj8aa	every 2 days?   it should be every other day. no more than a 1 day gap unless you are charting and using OPK's to determine your ovulation day?    your diet etc all sounds great but if you are leaving a 2 day gap at the time of ovulation you could miss your egg - it is only viable for 12-24 hours and if there is no sperm waiting for it then it disintegrates.    have a read up about how to track your cycles and how to time intercourse - there are 5 days : the days leading up to ovulation and the days after ovulation where you really can have sex every day in order to maximise the chance of conception.    the only reason to leave a gap in the sex is if your husband has a known problem with his sperm count, and even then it is sex every other day not every 2 days as sperm become lazy in a woman's reproductive tract after enough time goes by.   a healthy mans sperm usually takes about 24 hours to replenish.    i think you might find it very helopful to join fertiltiyfriend and invest in either a fertilitymonitor or some OPK's. they are very inexpensive from amazon you could also start temping - again a basal thermometer is available on amazon.    askdramy.com is very useful as is fertilityfriend.com    it is admirable to stop consuming as much alcohol but more importantly is that you limit caffeine intake to 1 cup a day. your partner can have caffeine but shouldnt have much alcohol, no smoking, healthy diet etc but he also needs a supplement such as wellman. he also needs to take Zinc to aid in his sperm production. this takes 3 months to start helping the sperm.  you can have the odd glass of wine here and there in the 1st half of your cycle, but not after you ovulate in case you have conceived.
AA11471252	I am sorry to hear about the rape of your girlfriend.     On the other hand, if she just had an abortion 2 weeks ago and is certain she is one month or more pregnant,  then she needs to go back to the doctor and have that checked out.     As much as I dislike abortion, the thought of an unsuccessful abortion just doesn't sound healthy in any way. I really don't see there being any chance of a healthy viable baby being left in the womb during/after and abortion.    Also, she would have definitely bled after an abortion. Every birth passes with the loss of blood, no matter how far into the pregnancy, or how the pregnancy ended. It is the bodies way of clearing out the womb from all the life giving blood and water nutrients needed to start and sustain a new life.|`|bPHU2JKaaa	thats gross she even had a abortion. and at 2 months it had a chance at life and she killed it. ever heard if . nevermind. but did you have sex rite after the rape  cuz if so maybe it was your baby that had to die.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	women always bleed after an abortion- she would not be pregnant with your baby- and if she didn't bleed after an abortion then she was lying about getting one or lying about being pregnant period just so you would have unprotected sex with and get her pregnant|`|cfdooGylaa	If she had an abortion then theres no baby inside there, obviously! You are definitely not old enough to have sex.    -EDIT-    You also shouldn't have been having unprotected sex with her if she got RAPED! Don't you know about STDs?|`|GxlkhRfoaa	No there is absolutely no way!|`|fCZKGBjBaa	lmao. no possible way, duh.  you must be like 13|`|zATQaiwIaa	no there is no way she could be pregnant if you havent had sex since the abortion....everything got swept out of her body.  As for not bleeding - you usually bleed when you have the abortion....its like having a period.    If anything she needs to see her doctor|`|buRYD6Qcaa	i hope not because you are too retarded to father a child|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Theres no way. It could take a while for her to get her period. I've never had an abortion but I've had miscarriages and it can take 6-8 weeks to get your period afterwards. Let her know its totally normal and that shes not pregnant! Good luck!|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Abortions aren't 100% successful.... It's a big misconception that they are,  but you can SOMETIMES still be pregnant after an abortion.. So it may have failed and she'll still be pregnant...  You need to get a pregnancy test to find out, they'll often give you one to take a month later after you get an abortion
vue9NOhYaa	If she's spitting it out, she almost certainly  isn't ready.  The fact that she 'can' start at 4 months doesn't mean that she has to, or that it will benefit her.<br>  <br>  She probably still has the tongue thrust reflux, which means that HER body isn't yet ready to eat or digest solid foods.  So just stop for a while. If you're sure she's really ready but just doesn't like rice cereal, you could also try a different food -- there's nothing magic about rice cereal.  You could try jarred fruits or veggies, or oatmeal. It's just for fun anyway, and should be given in only tiny amounts at this age.  If she spits that out too, then wait a few weeks, or a few months. There's really no rush.<br>  <br>  You don't put rice cereal (or any solid food) in the bottle because it's dangerous and unnecessary.  She can choke on it, and if she doesn't choke, she is being force-fed -- which you NEVER do.  In the early months, solids are just about learning a new way of eating, and learning to enjoy different tastes and textures.  Feeding cereal in her bottle doesn't teach her any of these skills, but DOES force her to take a food that her body isn't ready to handle.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Unless your four month old is DESPERATE for more than milk, she doesn't need rice cereal. Forcing it down her early has no positive benefits at all and can do her harm.<br>  <br>  What do you mean "got the okay from the dr"? Why were you even asking him? It doesn't sound as if she is remotely ready for it. Which is great! The absolute ideal for your daughter's digestive development is for her to have nothing except milk until she is at least 6 months old.<br>  <br>  You don't put cereal in a bottle mostly because if your child can only manage it in a bottle, they are not ready for it! But also it's a choking hazard (it makes the milk thick enough to choke on) and if you give solids in a bottle after 6 months, baby doesn't learn the skills of eating and swallowing solids that they'll need as they move onto proper food.|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Introduce it slowly to baby, when baby is ready baby will eat.<br>  There are other products on the market for feeding baby from 4 months, just stick to one food based group at a time. So instead of a mixed veg puree use a carrot puree instead.<br>  Introducing one food taste at time is important as it helped baby to develop tastes and likes and dislike of their own.<br>  I have three children and neither of my two older children would eat the rice cereal, so we used arrowroot biscuits crushed down mixed with their milk into a fine consistency like my mother did for me her mum did for her and so forth.<br>  At this stage its more about the new tastes baby is experiencing, its a different taste and texture than they're used to.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Don't put the cereal in a bottle, it's a choking hazard, and confuses eating and drinking. But do water it down beyond all reason. Her spitting it out is a reflex that babies have to prevent choking. <br>  <br>  Just offer a spoonful or so every day, and if after a few days, she's still not taking it, she's just not ready yet. Wait a week or two, and try again. <br>  <br>  At 4 months, she doesn't need cereal, it's just a little extra for her. She'll show you when she's ready.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Cereal in the bottle is a choking hazard. I got my daughter to take cereal when she was 4 months by mixing baby food into it. I actually mixed carrots and cereals together, sounds weird to us, but she liked it, seeing as she didn't know any better. Have you ever tasted the baby cereal? It's horrible! You can't blame them for spitting it back out.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Its actually much better for your baby to hold off on cereal until 6 months if you can.  That is what most doctors recommend now because starting solids too early can be hard on their digestive systems and create food allergies.  It sounds like she really isn't ready.  I tried to start my daughter on cereal at 5 1/2 months and she still had her tongue-thrust reflex too.  She didn't end up eating from a spoon until almost 7 months and even then she hated purees so we ended up starting "baby lead weaning" which is where the baby gets little tiny pieces of what you are eating.  Its working very well for us.  <br>  And, as others have mentioned, you don't put cereal in the bottle because it is a choking hazard.|`|c73QkZ2haa	If she spits it out shes probably not ready.<br>  Putting cereal in the bottle is a choking hazard. <br>  <br>  Babies dont really need cereal if she is fine with her Breastmilk/Formula than thats all she needs. And when you first start with the cereal make sure that it is runny consistency as they are more likely to take something liquidy than something thats thick.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Cereal in a bottle is a choking hazard, I should know, I did it with my son.  He got choked all the time.  I just stopped doing it after the 3rd or 4th time.  I was too scared it would REALLY choke him.  Just keep offering it to her.  It took my son a couple of days to figure it out!
YkseyT7zaa	You would like to quit, but you really don't want to inside.<br>  You have to dig down to your soul and decide 'I'm quiting". you have the control, no one else does.<br>  Just like the Biggest Loser, you decide the life you want to live|`|1CgCx1E2aa	I don't know about the breastfeeding (I'm just not sure) but any decrease is a good decrease, why do you smoke? not why you started but why do you take out a cigarette? If it is becasue of stress, find something else, maybe a stress ball, or someother activity that you enjoy doing. Then if that is successful, decrease to maybe 1 or none cigarettes a day. Don't stop until you've quit and can live without it. The baby can see its mother smoking and think its allright so the less time it sees you smoking the less time it will think about maybe starting up.|`|paHbLR9aaa	My daughter was in the NICU for 91 days and I pumped until my milk ran dry, about 80 days.  I had a lactation consultant.  She had me pump before I smoked.  If I smoked a cigarette before pumping, I had to wait 45 mins to and hour before I pumped.  Try smoking one less cigarette every day.  If you typically smoke 10 in a day, smoke 9 tomorrow, then 8, 7, and so on until the cravings stop!  This is a very effective way to quit smoking, I know several people who quit smoking with this method!|`|ZCe0DfFTaa	Here:|`|JFbWyKKDaa	Berast milk builds up over time in your breasts and is taken from ingredients in your blood, so your still feeding nicotine to your baby. You could pump and dump it if your that worried about it, but just try and cut down little by little. If you smoke half pack a day, go down by 1 or two cigs every day or so.... and when you run out. Don't go buy more. That's how you don't quit. Try and find other ways of keepin gyour hands busy. Maybe carry a straw around a "smoke" that.  It's not just the cigs you're addicted to- it also keeps your hands busy and is an oral fixation.  I would keep breastfeeding or pumping.  Contact your state department of Community health for help as well. Keep trying- I'm sure it will pay off. That's a hard habit to kick.|`|6E0siHT5aa	Lock yourself in a room where even you dont know where you are.|`|K0gJ7akkaa	Simple, start drinking.|`|MXduE0Zlaa	try a nicatine patch and go to a group that helps stop smoking!!|`|s519vyP5aa	well all i did to quit smoking was be strong and every time i wanted to some i told my self no no more i have to quit i went from 6 a day then 5 then 4 321 and then 0 that is how it works you have to put ur mind to it and DON'T GIVE IN .. best wishes and just think about the baby he needs you as you need him good luck best wishes ..
8XcRFF6Taa	CONGRATULATIONS MAMA!!  I hope you plan on breastfeeding for the first year!  Good luck:)<br>  <br>  Oh my gosh yes!  It is much better for your baby, research has shown that babies who are breastfed have higher IQ's, less susceptible to getting sick, less likely to die from SIDS, lowers risk of high cholesterol and heart disease, less likely to deal with depression as an adult, and many many other benefits.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first 12 months, The World Health Organizations recommends at least the first 2 years.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Breastfeeding is hard work, pumping is even worse but its only for a year(or more) and really is the best start to your growing baby.  Definitely worth it!!! <br>  <br>  **Breastfeeding also burns up to 1,200 calories a day and it tightens your tummy(your uterus contracts after feedings) so it gets you bikini ready with out all the work of exercising and dieting:)<br>  <br>  If you want to read up on it a little more check out www.aap.com & www.webmd.com or just google breastfeeding benifits:)|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	I bet you feel like the happiest woman on the planet. Congrats! Breast is best, but do whatever is right for both of you.|`|SHBpzAIZaa	Congrats! I would be so happy too! I have been ttc for over 3 years now!<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and the little one! God Bless!|`|JfwdDJxGaa	congrats.<br>  your home quickly.<br>  <br>  what a way to rub it in though to ppl who are ttc or like me who are 7 days overdue. <br>  sorry if that sounds harsh. im cranky lol|`|dnG7fhnbaa	:o) Congratulations and good luck! x|`|K7H1zrCbaa	yes
AA11940306	At some point all of us have had an ordeal such as yours,just don't take it too personal as some people on here are just hateful or envious....I enjoy doing baby name games,but obviously some don't ey?Hang in there ....=)|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	People report and delete things on this site for very strange reasons. I asked a question about the average price for a Spaniel puppy and someone deleted it for 'soliciting'! I wasn't even selling anything.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Some people have nothing better to do, don't let it bother you.|`|P5wM4icJaa	i wish i could tell you.  my question got deleted for asking about bluetooth on a cell phone.|`|k6I2qULAaa	yeahh that has  happened to me before . people have nothing else to do . dont take it to heart. its just stupid . (:|`|CMuL7XpKaa	people r rude|`|DHwPgw9iaa	People here think the games are just "spamming". I know because I've posted a few that have been deleted, like you and the posters above me. What they don't understand is that it's a great way to brainstorm names.<br>  <br>  If I make a game and tell you to name your baby girl a first name that starts with an A, and a middle name of a flower, you might come up with Alexis Dahlia and then really like it! (And maybe you never would have considered that name before.)<br>  <br>  People get annoyed and I'm not sure why. The best thing to do is to just ignore it and move on, though it does suck! :]
miPubuDYaa	Yes. Pre-nats are just vitamin supplements.<br>  <br>  Pre-nats where not always availible. and the human kind continued..|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I forgot to take mine a couple of times and my baby is growing well.  As long as you are eating healthy balanced meal with folic acid which is found in bread and cereal, you will be fine.  now I try to take it around the same time at night so I don't forget.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Yes,I forget mine sometimes twice a week. It won't hurt the baby for you to accidentally forget. It's just good to remember them.|`|AA10394452	It will be OK, calm down, but def. do not try and double up on your vitamins to make up for it, OK|`|OU9xnW86aa	You're find. It's ok if you forget. You should either take it now so that you can take your next dose tonight or just skip it all together. It is possible to get sick from "overdosing" on prenatals. If you take it at lunch and then another one tonight that is too soon to take 2.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	The baby will be absolutely fine.  They will take whatever they need from you.   I called my doctor the one time I forgot it, as I was freaking out, and he pretty much laughed and said this will be the first time of many during the nine months.  We're only human!!|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	Yes your baby will be fine. They didnt have these things when our grandparents where having kids. Also look at how many parents cant afford or dont find out their pregnant till they are 3 months and there baby turns out fine.|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	Forgetting one prenatal vitamin is not going to have much effect at all. Women all over the globe go their entire pregnancy with no vitamins at all....take one and chill out.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Yes the doctor even told me that I could stop taking mine up to a week if it was making me too nauseous.|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	Yes, the baby will be fine. But taking them off schedule may make you sick.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's fine. I forget all the time. Just try not to!|`|sLERr3aAaa	Your baby will be fine|`|vw37VHqKaa	Of course your baby will be fine. :) Your baby will take the nutrients it needs from you. The prenatals will replenish the vitamins and minerals you need to function at its optimum. Remind yourself that women have been having babies since antiquity, long before prenatal pills existed. Good luck. I remember I was the same way with my first baby.|`|VHy2VQhHaa	Your baby will be fine, its really good that you are consistent with your vitamins though, your baby will thank you for it. Keep up the good work.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Of course your baby will be ok!  Prenatals are just a bit of extra insurance. Missing one pill will have no harmful effects whatsoever.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Your baby will be just fine.
60cwSqE9aa	It's an attractive name and I like the traditional spelling. I see no need for people to give their children "unique" names that simply sound naff. Let's have more mothers calling their baby girls Sarah and other traditional names.|`|AA11295282	it is a nice enough name but is very popular. I like the names shannon, hannah, kaitlin.|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	its a bit overused -x|`|EsGrIscFaa	My name is Sarah and although in the 80's/90's I was in a class with 3 other Sarah's and actually quite disappointed with the lack of originality of my name, today it is not common for a child and could be seen as a classic.|`|lQNGse10aa	actually it's a bit boring though<br>  i love the name Sarah! it's really cute and very friendly name =)<br>  good luck xx|`|K1b8u8RIaa	Yeah, a lot of people have that name - it's a bit dated now x|`|pz09LoOyaa	Personally.. I don't like it but doesn't mean to say other people have too.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	i think it's pretty but boring.|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	Although Sarah is a classic and pretty name, I do feel like it has been overused. Nowadays, people are using more unique names like Elodie, or Raizel. Those are my cousin's names and I've always envied them :)|`|VcFAjLCNaa	No, it is fine.<br>  <br>  Not a bit as boring and overused as Lucy or Emma, or the horrible American names McKenzie, Cameron and so on.|`|ZW1ohMP3aa	I really like it :) it means princess, which it just what baby girls are!|`|J4qeaBDnaa	Like the name Sarah, alot better than some of the stupid names people come out with nowadays .especially celebrities who give there children some of the most ridiculous names you can or cant imagine .|`|tnF0zxgqaa	yep|`|JqPbyEmIaa	no datzz my name <br>  it's great LOL =]|`|XRX6vKNmaa	I like the name sarah it means princess. You can also spell it different ways such as the following.:<br>  Saarah<br>  Saara<br>  Sahra<br>  sara<br>  sarai (my fav)<br>  sarra<br>  sarrah|`|i7Nb169Taa	i love the name especially  the meaning in Arabic  , means that the girl bring joy and happiness  to all|`|u7o75zipaa	I think it's a gorgeous name.<br>  Yeah it's common, but that just shows how well like it is :) <br>  It's actually my second middle name :) <br>  Nicole Amber Sarah :) x|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	It's kind of lame and old now, but hey its better than Kegan or Kiley or all that other b/s names people are creating now..|`|lYjweuZmaa	i hate it bc my sisters name is sarah and so is everyone elses... ugh. and bc ppl pronounce it wrong sometime and it gets under my skin so i know it has to get under hers bc well it just should ... teehee<br>  <br>  ppl pronounce it sayrah like my g'pa... she hates it and i hate it....<br>  '<br>  way overused and boring as hell|`|ftvxAS3saa	SARAH I LOVE IT!!|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I considered it myself because my deceased grandmother LOVED the name and it's a classic name.  Cute at every age.  However my grandmas dog had the name and the family just had to put Sara to sleep.  So I think it's not a good time for me to use the name yet.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I love the name Sarah. But then again, I love the traditional names. Sarah, Jennifer, Anna, Michelle. I like those types of names.|`|34VXCyvVaa	No, Sarah is a classic name -- feminine and pretty.  It's never been a man's name, it's not derived from a man's name, it's never been a man's surname -- it's a classy name that has always belonged to women.  The boring, overused names are all those modern names with the long A sound in the middle -- Haley, Makayla, Nevaeh, Ava, Brayden, Jayden, Jacob, etc.|`|Od73sfkxaa	I like the name Sarah, BUT there are some things to consider:<br>  <br>  1.) How many Sarah's will they have in their classes over the years? Will they be known as Sarah H? Sarah W? They may wish for a more unique name. <br>  <br>  2.) Will they always have to correct the spelling of their name? There is Sara and Sarah. You never know, it may get old after a while.<br>  <br>  I have a friend named Sara, and a sister named Sarah...it's hard to keep up hehe<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you =)|`|MNja3iwMaa	its a nice name which you don't hear being used for babies anymore. not boring and not overused.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I like the spelling Sara better, and I think that at one point in time it was extremely overused, but it is not only a simple name I believe it is also biblical, I think the name Sara Kate or Sara Grace or Sara Jane are cute, but I wouldn't personally use this name, because it is a little plain.|`|xrJqmRFqaa	There are a fair amount of Sarahs out there.  That being said, a lot of people aren't using it these days for that very reason so chances are, your child wouldn't grow up with a crazy number of friends with the same name.  I do think it is a lovely name.|`|nsSU9N40aa	i like it. but, i prefer Sara, and if i were to name my daughter Sara, her name would be hyphened, like Sara-Jane for example. maybe Sara-Jane isn't the best, but you know what i mean. i hope.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	there are alot of people around my age (16) called sarah, but not many babies<br>  <br>  everyones trying to come up with original and trendy names that no ones really using the classics<br>  <br>  i think its a nice name =]|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Like it but it is overused.|`|JZnRxPUCaa	I think the name is a little outdated, more of a early 90's name, but if you love it- then I think it is great for you!<br>  If you want to find a variation try seeing how Sarah is spelled or said in different languages.<br>  Like I am considering the middle name Christine for my little girl, but I have researched the way different languages use the name Christine, i.e. Christelle is a French variation for Christine.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I think Sarah is a beautiful name. Personally, if I ? a name, I don't care if it's common. What matters to me is that it's feminine and beautiful. For example, I absolutely LOVE LOVE the name Isabella. There's probably one girl named Isabella on every block (lol) but I seriously don't care. I ? it.|`|JmM8xCbLaa	Not at all. Its my name :)<br>  It means princess in hebrew, so you can't go wrong!|`|1jQMkQKfaa	i actually love it. Its my name and in my senior class of 1000 people there were only 2 others. its not as common as say megan and ally ect. im sarah elizabeth and i do like unique names but wouldnt change mine. the meaning in hebrew is princess, im the only girl in my family and it fits me perfectly!!|`|l0ZuV1yaaa	I love the name Sarah; it's on my top 10 list!  I'd avoid the 10 most popular names for each gender (except maybe for 9 or 10 if I REALLY like it), but Sarah was #18 in 2007.  There were 9823 Sarahs compared to 19105 Emilys.  So while common, it was a lot less than the most popular.|`|pCbzhOrkaa	yea, i really dislike it. So many Sarahs...|`|AA11940306	I think its a classic name,beautiful by any means,not boring,not overused either...although the girls in the '50s were named that alot...<br>  It is timeless in my opinion...=)|`|8mchLCQhaa	I do think it is boring and overused. I do not like that name!|`|A2M6sAklaa	not at all it happens to be my girlfriends name.....|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Hmm.. I have a aunt named Sarah but I do think its very boring and overused yes. I prefer it spelt Sara - it makes it look abit different - which is good. lol.|`|pRbx4Y5Waa	It's a common name, but classic.  If you don't mind it being common, it's really pretty for a little girl and great for a woman in the future.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	I love the name Sarah! I think it's beautiful. It's not boring at all, and not overused. Love love love it.|`|claUGpVRaa	It's a good regular name. Don't be put off by people saying it's common. <br>  I think it's  nice, and can be modern as well as an older name too.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I LOVE IT!!! But that is because it is my name! And I actually don't hear it much anymore.  Go ahead and bring it back girl!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Sarah sounds very classic and pretty.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	yes very boring.. n overused.
smsUZG4Iaa	its hard hun.. all you can do is wait.. i know it sucks. try waiting a week and taking a test.. Best of Luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It sounds like you could be pregnant. I know that with me the first symptom I had was the sore nipples. I had never experienced that before with anything. however, i didn't know that it was a pregnancy symptom until after I found out I was pregnant and it really didn't go away. If I were you I would wait another week (i know it's hard) and test again. If it still comes out negative and you still haven't got your period then I would make an appointment with your doctor and see if they can see what's causing you to be late and see if they'll give you a blood test. Or if you can get a blood test now do it! good luck
DRb4Qlypaa	Higher hormone levels may mean multiples. Have you had a ultrasound to rule that out? I am trusting you know what the range is and that is way far out of it, because I don't know what it should be myself.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	wow!  I am lost for words.  What did the doctor say.  Then again it is better high than low.
1S7uXsInaa	Yes, you should go, without a doubt.  We all are nervous when we go out without our kids for the 1st time, but everything will be fine.  You and your hubby need to have time together and reconnect-adult time.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	6 months was the first time my husband and I left our daughter for a few hours so we could go on a date...I was a nervous wreck! It's normal, but you should definitely go anyways. I called three times while we were out (we were only gone two hours!) so call if you need to, but try to enjoy yourself. You deserve it!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	you need to go, think of it as a gift to your husband|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	If it's the first time you've gone out without her since birth it's perfectly normal..   You should definitely go out..<br>  <br>  Go out to dinner somewhere near your in-laws home then go back but only peak in a window to check on your daughter before heading to the movie...  That way you can assure yourself that your daughter is doing alright without disturbing her... <br>  <br>  In future I suggest a weekly couple hours leaving her with someone while you go somewhere...  Leaving your child for short periods of time with a trusted sitter is perfectly acceptable...  It will give you some much needed alone time and will teach your child to not be frightened when you leave....  <br>  <br>  By starting early you will avoid the separation anxiety and all that it entails later...  I started leaving my children for short periods of time very early on (by 2-3 months) we never went through the horror that is separation anxiety as they knew from an early age I would always be back and they were perfectly safe with the sitter...   When it came time for school my children confidently went into class while other children cried and clung to parents having a miserable first few days...<br>  <br>  Confidence is one of the greatest gifts a parent can give a child...  So start now... Teach her to have confidence you will return and she will be ok in the time you are gone...|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	If this is the first time you've left your daughter, it's very normal. And YES, you should go out. It's very important to keep up your relationship with your husband, make that a priority as well. She's well cared for and you know it, it's just a mother's jitters. GO OUT. <br>  <br>  But I hate to tell this... doesn't matter how old you or she gets or how many times you go out... you will never stop worrying. Are you going to stay home "just in case" even when she's three? Go out and have fun. Give mom a cell phone number, or call halfway through dinner to ease your mind, but don't isolate yourself. She and you will be fine. I promise. :)|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My daughter is 13 months and I still have never gone anywhere without her.<br>  BUT<br>  I'm kinda mad at myself for that.  I deserve a break and their would be nothing wrong with my daughter spending time with her Grandparents.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and don't be nervous.....just tell them you'll call every hour to "talk" to her LOL.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its up to you wehther you go or not, bue there's not much point if you are goin gto be miserable.<br>  <br>  I'm usually not ready to be away from my babies until about 8-9 months|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	This is normal for a mother to not wanna leave her child. I am the same way with my daughter Jessica. I have left her with my parents for no more than a hour cause i can't stand being away from her. The first day i left her with my parents i was calling every 5-10 minutes checking on her and I trust my parents and my sisters with my daughter I just didn't like being there where i can see her and care for her myself and she is 2 1/2 months old and I am still that way with her. I leave her with my husband ( her daddy) I am not gone more than 15 minutes cause i go like 2 blocks away to the store if i go anywhere else i take her with me. But i always rush home to my daughter. The other day my husband had me go to Wal-mart and he wouldn't let me take her cause he wanted me to go shopping and have time for me cause he wanted time with Jessica. I called every 5-10 minutes checking on her LOL!!!!! So yes nervous about leaving your child with somebody is completely normal. Its a mom thing!!!!!|`|a9btWYKRaa	This is totally normal! I remember my first time away from my daughter, I really didn't want to go and it took me about half an hour just to say bye!  I phoned within 30 minutes to see how she was getting on and was constantly checking my phone.<br>  <br>  Just go out and enjoy yourself, If your worried or want to know how Gracelyn is then just phone and find out,no-body can fault you for caring about your baby, no matter who's care they are in.<br>  <br>  I really think you should go out and try and enjoy yourself as you'll only regret it if you don't.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|jNHbw3PMaa	my son is 6 months old.i left him when that twilight movie came out me and the hubby went to the midnight premier and i almost took my baby with me lol my mom watched him for me i was texting her a lot to check on him i had never felt so nervous in my life haha i havent left him again. im a stay at home mom and every one says i need time away from him but ive spent everyday since his birth with him, so im fine taking him wherever i go lol. you should leave your baby and see how it goes and if u arent as much as a worry wort as i am then you can go out without her more often lol|`|XOtOMncwaa	Yes you should go! It's always a little nerve racking leaving your baby for the first time... I remember when my fiance and I went out for the first time and I got out of the car and said "Wow, I feel so light!" I wasn't lugging a carrier, or a diaper bag. And we really had a great time, we did call and check on our son ALOT, but we still managed to have a good time. Most of our dinner consisted of talking about our son, but it was good to get out as just us two. And the feeling of returning back to your baby is always great too! You feel so refreshed!|`|rR4q2e9qaa	I've always been that way.  I'm finally over it with my daughter, but now we have a little guy that just turned 1 and I'm that way with him.  I do feel more comfortable if they are at our house watching the kids though.  Yes you should go..it will just get harder the longer you put it off, and you'll have a good time, and it will get easier and easier every time!|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	Yeah - it is SUPER tough (it still is even now for me, and my daughter is 12 months old!), but it will be good for you to get away for a little bit.  It will also be nice for the grandparents to spend some quality time with her.  And, you can always call to check up on her!|`|WirFwirLaa	Go out! Enjoy yourself! My husband and I started going on dates again when our son was a month old! It felt great to get out of the house esp. knowing that my son was in good hands, my parents! She'll be just fine, honey!
PxawVQ7Xaa	What did you think would happen when you lock a child in a room like that, by the sounds of it she didn't do anything wrong to start with. It's wrong to lie but it's ok to hit?<br>  <br>  "Daddy doesn't play non-sense games" so basically he can't be bothered to spend time with her, maybe if he did try to entertain her this situation wouldn't have happened.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Lol, can your husband say ABUSE much?|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	No, he didn't.  He shouldn't have spanked her or ostracized her to the kitchen.   He should've stuck with the time out chair.  If he was consistent and kept her in the time out chair for the set time AND put her back in it when she misbehaved again, the situation would have been resolved AND the child would have learned something. As it is, he took the easy way out by spanking her and relegating her to a room.  He should've stepped up and been a parent rather than a bully.  What he succeeded in doing was exacerbating her separation anxiety (which is why she was having a melt down) and that since he is bigger than her, he can lay his hands on her. Why do you think she bites!?  She's learned to be physical in her interactions because your husband is physical with her.  She thinks it's the correct thing to do.<br>  <br>  And did it occur to him to play with her while you were busy?  Perhaps if she had company or was occupied in some way, the separation anxiety would have been less.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  In reply to your added comments:  If she spends all day with you and no time at all with Dad, then it's no wonder she's having separation anxiety.  Why doesn't your husband play with her?  Games, even nonsense ones, are a way to interact positively with your child -- and in this case, it would have been successful in alleviating the child's anxiety.  It would also reinforce the comfort level and security she feels in the  relationship she has with her father.   She is NOT testing your strength as a parent.  She's simply having anxiety when she can't get to you -- this is natural and normal behavior.  By treating her the way you and your husband are, you're making the situation worse, not better.  Your husband needs to be a more involved parent.  She's four for goodness sake.  Nonsense games with Dad are what she needs sometimes.  And if you ever want a break without the meltdown, Dad is going to have to learn how to interact positively with a four year old.  And as an aside, as frustrating as the "meltdown" can be to parents, when it's due to separation anxiety and a father who won't "play" or interact to help alleviate that anxiety, it isn't exactly great for the child's well-being either.|`|yjbJOk0Iaa	Personally I think lockign up the child in the kitchen was too much.<br>  Your daughter seems to be very attached and dependent on you. This basically implies that she does not spend more tiem with her dad and hence his warnings have no affect on her. <br>  <br>  Tell your husband to spend more tiem with her...doign things she like...one she get attached to him ...then she will listen to what he says...<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|4UIR1YuQaa	Problem these days is that kids get out of hand because they don't get a spanking just a silly time-out which does nothing. Ask anyone that was raised back in the old days, and they'll say they got a *** whooping.|`|6253169b02f2076d996076889f0591d0aa	Assault and deprivation of liberty. What good parents you are!|`|B83DTe78aa	My mum always said "Plenty of no attention"<br>  which means: leave her alone. She needs to learn that you need time to yourself. She will become spoilt if you don't.
UXoTCL98aa	I'm only 8 weeks and 4 days pregnant, but that has been one of my main searches lately. (How many women never got sore boobs when pregnant)<br>  <br>  I'm  a worrier and it really worries me why my boobs are perfectly pain-free and not getting any bigger or fuller yet. I've asked my doctor twice already in person if he's sure its okay that I'm not having sore boobs.lol.<br>  <br>  He swears it's perfectly fine bc like someone else said every women reacts to hormones differently. Good Luck, BABY DUST!!!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I didn't at all.  Sometimes my nipples will get a little sore, but nothing bad..|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i didnt.<br>  mine didnt get bigger at all either.|`|AA11784984	I didn' t with my first one I did with the 2nd and 3rd.|`|rV8bRfEkaa	With both pregnancies I never had sore breasts... everyone is different and reacts different to the pregnancy hormones... GL and baby dust!|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	first 2 pregnancies I had nearly no syptoms except the occasional vomiting. With this one I think I have all of them. Each woman is different|`|W3pZXqgOaa	Mine didnt hurt or get bigger at all.|`|ycvpRM3Oaa	I didn't!!! Got bigger but no pain!|`|s519vyP5aa	with my First 3 pregnancy was the causal vomiting nausea lil sore breast but that was it but know i have really sore breast back pain headaches almost every day and the slight cramping totally different but i think i may be having boys i say that because my 8 yr old  girl  i have 4 yr old boy and girl fraternal twins then my 2 yr old girl was going to be a twin to but one vanished so now since the symptom's are different i think they are boys .. WELL I HOP SO .. but lucky you don't have the sore boobs ..|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't have them.
3WWHWsHOaa	Yes. I had a friend who had a baby with cross eyes and a hair lip. All babies are cute but I swear to god that kid was so ugly it made her cute. Kinda like looking at a pug. They are so ugly they are cute.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	No, I've never seen an ugly baby.  Seriously.  Maybe it's the innocence?  Maybe it's just me?  But all babies are cute.  I've seen some grouchy.  Some with too big of noses or ears, but I know they'll grow up and become beautiful.|`|FkTC4Dpkaa	thats a terrible thing to even think, let alone say. Shame on you. I would never judge a baby on beauty they are all cute and innocent and i could pick up and love any...maybe keep your opinons on that to yourself.|`|9NfLuHo9aa	babies are off-limits...you may just have caused yourself to not have kids or have one boob as a result of karma..stop being retarded|`|VHHis05Naa	What an incredibly cruel question!  I'm sure his/her mom thought the baby was beautiful.  Gee, I hope your kids are always attractive enough for you.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	All mothers think their child is beautiful. You'll understand when and if you have your own some day.|`|RvddYKqjaa	That has to be one of the most shallow questions I have ever read. I wouldn't have believed that anyone would start ripping on babies. <br>  No, I have never seen a baby that was ugly. I have seen adults that I wouldn't want near any baby though. <br>  In the case of some people, honesty is not always the best policy, especially when it's very hurtful and mean.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow, that's truly an awful thing to say... maybe that kid wouldn't want to come anywhere near your ugly boob?! :) I'm sure no one else needs your approval on how cute their kid is.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Awww that's not nice.  I know how you feel though. I've seen babies that are not very cute.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	That's why the phrase "a face only a mother could love" exists.
GxlkhRfoaa	I had horrible morning sickness the first several weeks of my pregnancy. I mean it was like I had the worst flu for a month or more straight.  My dr recommended Vitamin B6 25mg 3x a day.  It takes about 4 days for it to really start working but I'd say it was what saved me.  Also eating 3 steady meals and drinking water.  Good luck.  And please don't take any prescribed medicine unless your baby's health is really in danger otherwise they are not worth the risk.|`|AA11784984	Try taking them with orange juice at night before you go to bed. My doctor told me to do this. It didn't work for me but maybe it will for you.
lqLzULXEaa	There are so many things to do with your lil one how about you can start by telling her if she wants to help out at dinner ( she will love that) then afterwords she can help you wash the dishes or something ( i dont know about your daughter but believe it or not alot of 6 year olds enjoy that lol) then you to can play games and read stories.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can also take her out for ?icecream? too|`|satoCRC6aa	enjoy just being with each other<br>  eating, games, walks, playing with the dog<br>  <br>  children just need undevided attention<br>  <br>   TV in my house is limited|`|4e67Pdfvaa	play a game with her, popcorn, read to her|`|FkTC4Dpkaa	You could have a lovely time with her by just giving her your time and attention Depending on what time she arrives, maybe have a 'tea party' type of tea- let her choose a meal and cook it together, little girls love to cook, then bake fairy cakes for after tea, and let HER ice one by herself for you- then be amazed at how good the cake looks and tastes and tell her she is a great cook etc etc- she will be so happy to hear that!<br>  After the food, you could do some pictures together, remembering to praise her lots about how good she is at whatever she does! <br>  She might enjoy watching a little tv- maybe she has a favourite show she watches in the evening?<br>  Then read together or do a puzzle...spend some time brushing her hair as little girls usually like that...I assume you do want to spend time with her, not have her entertain herself as she is just staying over for one night? You dont need to do anything amazing- just give her time and praise and she will be happy! have a great evening together!|`|mO7FOXNYaa	Do you have games?<br>  <br>  My son (6 years old) loves Battleship, CandyLand, etc.<br>  <br>  Books. Painting (soooo fun!)<br>  Let her play dress up with daddy! haha. It will make great memories. I remember when my step dad let us do that.<br>  <br>  I hope some of these suggestions help.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Edit: Millionaire: Did you read the question? He stated that she's 6 years old.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Try an art project!  You can find TONS of ideas online.<br>  <br>  You can also make a cake or some cookies together and decorate them.<br>  <br>  Be creative and have fun!|`|MG7S22iMaa	You can play cards with her like Go fish etc, play board games with her if you have any. Make cookies and tell funny stories. Play hide and go seek in the house ( my son's love this ). Read her a fairytale book or something that she likes. Make dinner together. <br>  Also ask her what is it that she wants to do cause 6 year old children have tons of ideas. Hope this helps!|`|B5EgyPlpaa	there are lots of things to do. it depends on how she is.<br>  <br>  1. you can play board games with her.<br>  2. you can go to the park. <br>  3. you can read too.<br>  <br>  i do not know how old she is so i can not really tell you anything for sure.|`|yjbJOk0Iaa	1) Maybe you both can got and play in the park..<br>  2) or go swimming.<br>  3) You both can cook her favorite cupcakes (be careful when cooking with kids)<br>  4) Drawing, coloring<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't spend time watching tv.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|c861d0f74c3120fdb6e80e0d25b8afb0aa	Do some home baking, some kind of craft project, a boardgame aimed at kids of this age, dressing up, colouring in books, face painting.<br>  <br>  of course for some of these you will need to have the necessary equipment!|`|wNOSCfTJaa	you could try playing games like hide and seek :) i loved that when i was 6.
8z03BV5Saa	People are mad at her because she did this all and she was being selfish.Just because she didn't get the love she needed when she was younger. Why bring 8 children into the world and have no exact  way to support them? But those kids are are still human and they deserve a chance to live. I think that her kids are in for a real ride, but she seems like she loves her other children already. She isn't 30 yet, she doesn't have a job, and she plans on going to school in the fall. I don't think she is ready for 8 children and it seems like she is planning on dumping them off on her grandparents and I don't think she knows what she is in for.|`|s519vyP5aa	the kids have nothing to do with it its the fact that she already had 6 kids with no father no job and living under the roof of her parents that can barley help her with what she has now i think that she thought that the government was going to support her and give her a house and stuff she just thought it was easier that way and now is asking for hand outs that's crazy ...|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The pregnancy with that many babies should have never happened in the first place. That is what people are mad about.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i'm pissed because she can't take care of the kids she already has. i'm mad because she's a child hoarder who can't afford these kids. i'm mad because she put 8 babies' lives in jeopardy because of her actions. that's why i'm mad. she's a selfish psycho with a child fetish.|`|EsGrIscFaa	It's not that she got pregnant. People are mad because she actively sought to have a high risk multiple pregnancy when she obviously has no need for fertility drugs (see 6 kids for evidence). People are also concerned that she has decided to bring up this many kids solo by relying on handouts.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	They're mad at her for getting pregnant to begin with when she is jobless and has 6 young kids already.|`|DoZQzQXyaa	i'm not mad at her at all she is human like everyone else. abortion is killing and is wrong i would never get abortion. even if i got rape and couldn;t handle the kid i would put it up for adoption or just keep it and try my best. i don't care what people say|`|L7Mjji7kaa	They are mad because she is having kids on purpose for money and handouts.|`|ySTDkd5iaa	Or maybe because she doesnt work...already has 6 kids & just had 8 more? I'm sorry but thats crazy if you ask me!
XL14HwO8aa	At about 13 weeks I was noticeably pregnant.  Before that I just looked kind of chunky.  Good luck to you!|`|pM2EQ4MQaa	My sister was visibly pregnant at about 2 and a half months she was looking like a normal pregnant would at about five months.<br>  <br>  Congrats (:|`|LcOPL8gCaa	CONGRATS! I'm not really sure i'd say 12-14 weeks? There is 2 so your gonna have a bigger tummy and lots faster. Good luck & best wishes!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My sister was totally in maternity clothes and visibly pregnant between 12 and 14 weeks.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	My friend that was pregnant with twins showed as early as 6 weeks. She was very tiny and slim also. By the time she was 3 months along, she looked like she was 5 months. Shortly after they found out she was carrying twins.
miPubuDYaa	I hope youre friend is high when her baby is born and CPS takes the infant from her. Is she crazy? The things she can be doing to her baby!<br>  <br>  Some people don't deserve to be parents.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Who says the babies are really normal? They may be average, when they may have been brilliant without the weed in utero.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Risks are just that.  Increased risk does not guarantee that there will be problems.  So yes, some women who smoke weed (or drink heavily  or smoke tobacco , or eat poor diets) will certainly have healthy babies.  But by making their lifestyle choices, they put their babies at increased risk of  certain health problems.<br>  <br>  There is little research on the effects of heavy marijuana use during pregnancy.  Light use does not appear to cause birth defects, but may cause more subtle damage. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.otispregnancy.org/pdf/marijuana.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.otispregnancy.org/pdf/marijua...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51663" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...</a><br>  <br>  (More to the point for your friend, if she's smoking every day now, she will presumably be smoking every day after baby is born.  And there are many known risks to second-hand smoke exposure for infants -- up to and including death from SIDS.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I am pregnant now.. and my brother told me I should smoke weed becasue it will help with the morning sickness.( clearly my brother doesn't have any children.. but some of his friends do). I told him I am over that stage in my pregnancy.. I would never smoke anything while pregnant.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Not every baby who's mother smokes weed will have problems.  Some get lucky.  I have a friend who has 2 sons with two different women.  One smoked weed while she was pregnant and the boy is autistic.  The other didn't and the boy is perfectly normal.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Yep, my adopted little sister...although the mother was also drinking throughout that pregnancy...my little sister now has FAS, some severe behavior problems, she is very small for her age and she has spinabiffida...|`|5lXmpMBbaa	I have a friend who smoked weed with all 3 of her children & she is pregnant at the moment right now. & STILL smokes weed all her children have asthma & they are all crazy. always fighting with each other. (yes children do fight) but to the point that they're bleeding & all beat up? one bit the others ear & had to be taken to the hospital. im not saying marijuana caused this/ but thats something to think about.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that is just awful. There are wonderful women out there trying to get pregnant that will do everything in their power to be healthy during pregnancy and make sure their baby is healthy and then we have people like your friend that get pregnant and don't give a crap about their child. She shouldn't be having a baby. That is just awful.|`|mhSjwuntaa	Just b/c you smoke anything doesn't mean the baby will have problems...however it is a BIG risk. There have been several...several reoported cases of babies having problems due to the fact their mother smoked during pregnancy. It is just a big risk...and if I was pregnant I don't think I would be willing to take that chance. I am nurse and I recomend that your friend stop smoking ASAP.|`|sLERr3aAaa	THC stays in the baby's system twice as long at the mother doubling the exposure to the baby. It has been proven to cause low birth weight, IUGR, and lowered IQ scores. I don't know about your friend but that don't sound like it's worth smoking weed when she's pregnant.|`|eytlIKITaa	I've known 2 chicks (well, they were adults!) that smoked pot during pregnancy- one smoked everyday and the other like 2 times.  Both babies were perfect!  I DO NOT IN ANYWAY CONDONE THEIR BEHAVIOR!  I think it's beyond wrong!!!
n3IoftMFaa	Well, this is her full time job and it is a young baby. How much are you willing to pay for exclusive care? You obviously would rather this than a day care. Around here, you pay 10 an hour for babysitting but she isn't  a babysitter - she is a nanny. Way different. I doubt many can afford 85 dollars a day. Really great daycares cost 1200 a month or 300 a week so 60 a day is great.<br>  <br>  At least 50 a day. You've got to think - do people do a better job when they are paid well or underpaid?|`|4e67Pdfvaa	it completely depends on your area and state... You should ask a handful of local moms. In my area I pay $8 per hr for my 3 kids, I pay $5 for only 1, I am considered generous to a lot of people in wisconsin.|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	I'd give her 50$ a day|`|k0TDCEFEaa	50 a day...your making out way cheaper then payin her 10 n hour|`|s519vyP5aa	around her in MD we charge 40 a day with the babysitter putting the food and 35 if you bring the food you want the kids to eat. but i still think that is cheap well that is for the parents bring the child to the babysitter but if i had to go over to there house it would be more i would have to think about the gas price driving and me leaving my house to stay at your , but in that case 50 a day a a good price|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I babysit, and I charge a flat rate of 50 dollars (8hours+).  Or 5 dollars per hour for 1 child.
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would take another test because you could be pregnant. Plus, you haven't had a period for a while. Maybe get a blood test to be sure!|`|M5DC8qqnaa	The same thing happened to me when I took a test 14 weeks ago. And I'm now 16 weeks pregnant. I took one of the digital ones the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and it said pregnant. So, the next morning I took another one to be sure and it was negative. I figured that was odd so I ended up taking a total of 6 MORE tests over the Thanksgiving holiday. <br>  <br>  I saw a doctor at the beginning of December and it turns out - I was pregnant. I'm now 16 weeks pregnant with my first baby.|`|Y0bPQjSgaa	well it just depends i mean i took a dollar store pt and it was negative but i havent had a period sine december either so i dont know call your doctor and they will bring you in a check|`|59SM8kFIaa	well i will tell you my story!! on period since dec 30!!!  so on a sunday after missing my monthly went and bought a cheap  ept ,,and got a vary faint line ,!! so i said will will use the other one in the morning so the hcg will be higher, well came back negative,!! so Waite  a few days and went to the doc us i was sick , and that test came back negative too!!  so i was like well i  guess i am not!!  well i a i went to the doc again and i am 8 weeks!! so you could be if you have a hcg levels in you pee your r most likely pg! but go to your doc!! plz having the iud it could hurt the baby!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Go to your doctor and get a blood test.  The line test may actually be the one that is accurate because it takes a slightly higher hormone level to get a positive on some of the digital tests.  The other possibility is that you had a chemical pregnancy, ie a pregnancy that tried to implant but didn't "stick" possibly because of your iud.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I pretty sure if you got 2 positives then you are indeed PREGNANT.
smsUZG4Iaa	well those ages are very different. 12-14 id probably slit my wrist.. 15-18 id have to deal with it..|`|aOCfLAJJaa	I would be very scared, because I'm a boy.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	thats a pretty big age range...  I guess If I was 12-15 I would put it up for adoption, if I was older I would probably try to raise it.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Like the other girls stated its a very big diff in age and maturity. If i was between 12-15 i think i might have to get an abortion....i dont find that no matter what you do that a 12yr old is fit to go through a pregnancy, birth and raise a child. Your still a baby youself. If i was over 15 i think it would be very hard but its been done and i would try to raise it to the best of my ability and finish school and enroll myself into a local community college after high school to get at least an associates degree if anything.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	1st of all i wouldn't be having sex at that age but if i was 12-16 i would get an abortion.<br>  <br>  17-18 try to raise it but if it got to the point where it would interfere with the quality of the child's life i would put it up for adoption.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	1. I wouldn't be stupid enough to do that.<br>  2. I would abort ASAP. I don't want to jeapordise my academic and personal life thanks to a single-celled organism that looks like a sea monkey/premature dinosaur. <br>  3. Having a baby as a teenager is simply abhorrent in my opinion.|`|If2ww2i9aa	I would tell my parents about it and see what they think.<br>  If i was ready, and grown attached to it i would raise it.<br>  But, if i didn't feel anything for it i would have it aborted:(<br>  <br>  <br>  *Smart tip of the day: Use protection!*|`|mMBzpldbaa	i'm 19 now and about six months ago, when i was still 18, i had a pregnancy scare. me and my partner talked it over and we decided that the best course of action would be to abort the baby. i'm a student and regularly gig all around my city, so a pregnancy would be inconvenient and uncomfortable for me, and i don't want a baby, either right now or ever. <br>  <br>  if i got pregnant tomorrow (i'm on the pill) i would definitely abort it. i don't need or want either a child or a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *edit* after reading these answers, i 100% agree with the user "doctor?". i don't consider a child "alive" until it can think conciously.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I don't know what I would of done if I was younger than 16. At that age I would of kept the baby and talked to my parents about it. I would of gotten another job to help pay for things. I would of been scared but dealt with the consequences of my attentions. I had a steady boyfriend from the age of 15 up though, now my husband (I'm 21 now) so I know I could count on him.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Abort it. I am non-religious so I do not think it is a 'sin' or whatever you people call it. Teenagers cannot competently raise another human being. They are not finished being reared themselves. I consider it dangerous to carry the pregnancy to term without the eventual payoff of getting a baby out of it. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't have had this problem though, I wasn't a baby skank.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Cry!<br>  Anything under 18 I would abort.<br>  I am NOT going to be a teenage mom.<br>  That is horrible.<br>  <br>  <br>  *sigh* I bet Im gonna get alot of thumbs down for the abort thing. But I dont care. I would sooo abort if I was 12-17 years old. If I was 18 possibly I would keep it.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Hmmm.<br>  I did get pregnant at 17.<br>  And I didn't get an abortion.<br>  And my beautiful son is sleeping in the next room.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	at 17 or 18. keep it and get a job n handle my responsibilities any age under, i wudnt put myself at risk to have to make tht decsion.|`|ejelObdJaa	if i was 18 i would have it...<br>  <br>  if im less than that i think i would get a permission from my parents to abort it ..|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I got pregnant at 16 and had my daughter at 17. I kept her,graduated from highs school and worked 5 hour nights 5 days a week to support her. I don't think I was the "norm" as far as most of the teenage moms around where I live but I knew that I had to grow up and raise my child. She's now 6 and I have to say I think I've done a damn good job so far! If I was younger than that I think I may have given her up for adoption as hard as it may have been I think at 12,13 and even14  it highly unlikely you could succeed as a parent (not impossible but unlikely) you can't even get a job at that age and your still a child!|`|gklH61Uiaa	There is a huge difference between 12 and 18.<br>  If I was 12 I would probably abort.<br>  I am 18 and pregnant (due 4 days ago!), got pregnant at 17.<br>  I'm in a good spot though, I have my own apartment with my boyfriend (who've I've been living with since I was 15) and we have the money to raise a baby. Alot of teenagers are still living with their parents and that might influence their choice...|`|BnpEoMD4aa	I'm 17, and 35 weeks pregnant. I'm keeping her, but I think if I was 15 or younger I would have put her up for adoption. I mean, I'll be out of high school in May, money isn't an issue at all, and the father and his family is very involved, so... she'll be surrounded by a lot of love and live comfortably. It's unfortunate, but it's just the cards I was dealt and I couldn't be more thrilled.|`|kV0f4IiNaa	Abortion. Thats way to young to be having children. Most teens are definately NOT responsible enough for that kind of responsibility. Plus I have a number of medical things wrong with me that I wouldnt want to pass on to my child, and there are plenty of other unwanted kids that need adopting.|`|MG7S22iMaa	I would most definitely keep the child even if my parents told me to get an abortion or threw me out of the house.  I would never get an abortion no matter what. If you can have sex at that age, then you can take responsibility if you get pregnant.|`|DJpS9GDxaa	Adoption, because I know I wouldn't be able to provide the baby with the future he/she deserves. I'd find a couple that's more qualified. <br>  <br>  Actually, if I was 18, I might keep the baby<br>  <br>  ...hopefully, I won't have to come across this situation|`|QQE58qFQaa	I was 17 when i had my daughter, unplanned of course, but i am very happy with my decision... she is my world : )|`|LzJJn1m7aa	id realize that if i was grown up enough to have sex and get pregnant then i was old enough to have the baby no matter what age.

I graduated pg and she is 9 now and doing great. I had family support.

cYRZpGkqaa	That made my stomach turn. He had to learn that from somewhere. Tell the parents, and if they don't respond, call CPS immediately!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	He probably saw it somewhere, or someone has been touching him and he's figured out other ways to receive sexual pleasure. <br>  <br>  I would suggest telling his parents about this. Write them a letter so they have a chance to think this over without feeling challenged by you.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Gross. I say you tell his parents. This isn't right. Tell his parents asap.
fMilDRgLaa	This happened to me both times I was pregnant.  It was less than a week from the time I ovulated.  I thought I was getting my period early with the bright red blood. When it only lasted less than 48 hours...I did a test a few days later and it was positive....fingers crossed for you!|`|GleiEHfuaa	I would say go to your doctors to figure out what is going on.|`|Xp2De933aa	possibly implantation bleeding? sounds like its what it was to me... as long as there was no cramping along with the bleeding.<br>  implantation isn't always light pink or red spotting. when i got pregnant i bled on cycle day 18, 19 and 20, with red blood but only small amounts, just enough for a pantie liner. unfortunately my pregnancy ended in a m/c at 9 1/2 weeks =/ but my point is, alot of people say if its red or lasts longer than a few hours or so, then its not implantation, and that's not the case. it can be. so keep your head up and test on the day your period is expected. <br>  good luck
Fa130w6Gaa	I can't really give you a definite answer as to what is causing it. Most likely it is just from your skin and muscles tightening up and moving and the scar tissue doesn't move with it so it is pulling against them. As long as it isn't a sharp pain, I wouldn't be too worried but mention it to your doctor the next time you go in. I wouldn't make a special trip unless it was really bothering you. I had a c-section 4 1/2 years ago and still occasionally get a pulling sensation and weird feeling by my scar.|`|wCRC0poAaa	its probably because you havnt worked the muscles for so long that you can feel them tightening up. and with all that scar tissue internally etc. its great that you are getting your tummy back. mine is in a disgraceful state after twin pregnancy, including c-section and separated tummy muscles. dont know where to start!!!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I had a c section 13 mo ago too and it still hurts sometimes. Might be something to do with all the scar tissue. if it contines to hurt, maybe ask your OB what it is, just to make sure that its normal.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	I don't know about the scar, but I was curious to know what you are doing to tighten your tummy??  I need to do the same considering I'm getting married in May!!  Any tips would help, thanks!!!  :-)<br>  <br>  Thanks a lot for the suggestions!  I'll have to check out the Mommy/Baby workout DVDs.  Thanks again!  :-)
xwZKouCIaa	your probably best off waiting, are they gettin any stronger? if u can bear the pain then wait it out but always trust your instincts call your doctor if your really concerned and take it from there.. good luck and congratulations i will pray for you and baby...|`|OKarH9Zsaa	I would say yes, you are in labor.  Since the contractions are 23 - 24 min. apart take care of what you need to do, call your friend and then go to the hospital.  You really don't need to start worrying until they are about 3 mins. apart.  Good Luck.|`|AA10780655	you should wait until they get to about 5 minutes apart<br>  If you really are in labor, its really early labor and they'll probably just send you home at this point|`|vGFBXBOqaa	Just relax a lil wait until they get about 5 min a part. Check ur hospital bag and make sure u have everything u need. Maybe think about getting everything ready for when the baby comes home (lil extra cleaning maybe) Start making ur phone calls when they get about 10 min apart that ur friend has time to get home and get u. They most likely wont allow the child to be in the room with u when u are giving birth. But that is something you could do to keep ur mind off the pain is call the hospital and find out if they will allow it maybe they will allow it if she has some coloring books she could sit where she cant see anything and color. U could be in labor (p.s. maybe u should but a towel under ur butt where u are sitting) Good luck remember to breath during the contractions rub ur belly in a circle motion when ur having them.|`|AA11661793	Call the hospital and see what they say, most don't want you to come in until your contractions are 5 minutes or so apart. Good luck!|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	You could go just to see, I think you are in early labor, but usually you have to be 7-9 mins apart to stay at hospital, it just depends, Id definitely go ahead & call, yes you can take the child with you while your in labor, it happens all the time, I did with my kids, call your friend & tell her it's time...good luck!|`|OzM5P1TIaa	ur labour is better to start in 42 weeks.
iXSoX6Rnaa	No it's not wrong but you also have to remember that these women are OLDER and are more than likely married. They have husbands and stable jobs. I had my daughter at 18 right after high school and her dad is a piece of crap. He's in her life but he won't pay her child support. Now I'm 21 still very young. I'm married to a great man and were expecting. Let me tell you it's so much easier to be married and stable and plan for a baby. My husbands 25 and he makes good money enough money that I dont have to work. Good for you that you have goals.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	No, it isn't wrong.  It's pretty natural and common to do so.  A dream is just want it is...a dream.  It's a fantasy.  It's the "it would be cool if...."<br>  <br>  However, it sounds like you are educational and career oriented.  Since you are young, you have plenty of time to plan for and have a baby.<br>  <br>  While dreams are nice and perfect, it is in reality that you have to deal with the consequences.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	You are 18 and planning your life, of course you are not wrong to want that, even as a young girl you aren't wrong to look forward to that. Keep working toward your goals but also see where life takes you. You may be surprised, I was working toward my first degree and I'm in my 3rd year.. I got married a few months ago and just fell pregnant. I am so excited about that... school will wait for me and I will work slowly toward it now because I now have my dream! I'm a mommy with a great husband :)|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	Nope. It's just that maternal instinct going on. It's common.|`|Cv0bGFiCaa	I dont think its wrong for you to want these things or to dream about having them.  Just realize you are seeing a small part of their life,  You're not there when the baby is screaming at 3 in the morning or sick and cranky.  I think you seem to have your head on straight and know what you want.  A baby will make reaching those goals more difficult though not necessarily impossible.  Just make sure you're ready and know what starting a family is all about before you have one!|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Nope, it's normal!!  I wanted the same thing when I seen my friend have a baby our freshman year, but I KNEW I wasn't ready for that.  Now that I'm pregnant at 19 (out of high school, takin college classes online), I couldn't be happier and I feel it's a great time!!|`|m3qSZelkaa	No it is not wrong for you to think that. In fact that is how I thought, except for I let it engulf me. Now I am a proud parent of a 1 yr old little boy and I am only 20. It is defiantly okay to think about it. Children are great, just wait the right time will come!|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	no not at all, i wish i had got a decent job and a house before i got pregnant, even though it has all worked out now,its been tough....you have a good head on your shoulders hun :) and it will pay off one day when you become a great mom too :) x|`|AA10609634	Nothing wrong with that, but do not let it consume you.  Go to school, and find something elst you can be passionate about in your work.  When you get your career started, you can have both, and it will be wonderful.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	NO! There is NOTHING wrong with dreaming... Think of it as something you can have  after you graduate college as a present to yourself!|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Think of ALL of your dreams.  Often older parents can better provide for their children and themselves.  I would make sure that you reach your personal goals first, then your family goals.  Keep dreaming, but be responsible.  You owe that much to your future child.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	It is not wrong for you to think about babies. It is natural and everyone is programed to want to have babies. You can dream about how you want your family to be.
l46COY9eaa	You said it sister!!! My man and I have been TTC for YEARS!! And up until recently our medical coverage would not cover any fertility treatment.  Then we move to an area where one of the military hospitals does IVF, and wouldn't you know it, he goes to the Iraq for almost a year! Plus, there was a 2 year waiting list for the treatment, so we just went to a civilian. It was always soooo hard overseas, like when we lived on Guam, we lived on base, it was a small community which was like living in a baby factory, all the bazillions of moms every morning either walking their kids to the corner bus stops or pushing their strollers, once, at a bar-b-que, 3 girls were preggo at the same time, I happen to walk in just as they were lifting their shirts and showing off their bellies, and one goes "where's your belly?" Now I knew this girl, she had NO idea me and my DH were trying so hard to have a baby, so I knew she meant nothing by it, but I did have to leave a while to calm down. I had to pee on those stupid sticks  every month to see when I would ovulate, but at another duty station he was always off on what was called a 'tasking', (away for duty) or had to work the days we needed to do the baby dance, or he would be SO exhausted from having to get up at 4am and not coming home until dark that he would just crash the second he sat down. And always, everyone he worked with, seemed like no matter where we were, always already had a kid or two. Sooo not fair!!! But I am trying to not have any anger or jealousy right now (especially hard when that woman made the news for having 8 babies)-trying to be positive and have good vibes so my embies stick, but every now and then, say at a daytime military function, or just out and about in town, and I see soooo many kidlets, I want to screeeeeaaaaammmm!!!|`|mzFUWq8iaa	all we can do is try  like hell when we get them lol|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Yes! Especially since I have to take clomid and work out the timings! Last year, he spent most of his time training, then off to Afghanistan from March until September. We tried Jan, Feb... then June (the timing of his leave worked out perfectly), then started up again in October. Thankfully, he's home now and won't be going anywhere for a while, but does have a two month course in the spring. Hopefully, I'll get my BFP before then! =)|`|8mchLCQhaa	Yeah my husband was in iraq for 13 months and before that was always in the field training. It took 3 years and for him to get out of the army and I am finally pregnant!|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	I'm not a military wife, but my husband was away for 6 weeks for work.  We have been trying to conceive since Feb of 2008.  I am now close to 14 wks pregnant.  According to my doctor, the conceive date was the day he come back from his trip.  Sometimes being apart for a little while helps.  Good luck!|`|AA10894601	YOU'RE TELLING ME!! We're stationed in Okinawa and it's like a baby factory here. It seems like everywhere I turn I'm bumping into baby bellies! We've been ttc since May... which seems like a while (actually, it seems like forever!) but we've really only had four good months of trying because of a deployment!!! He'll be gone for a month in May too so I'm hoping I get my BFP before then!

E7ViD8EWaa	That is very beautiful =]<br>  Did you write it?|`|E6T9DPT9aa	That's amazing. Did you write it? If so well done :D<br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|ZXhSQfvqaa	Very very good.  C'est beaux,  i like this a lot, Im guessing that you wrote it, and it flows very well.|`|0rLeIEp5aa	Beautiful|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	I just love it.
kBp9IzQqaa	Think about all the positive things in your life.  Think about your future.  Imagine you being successful and all your troubles are a thing of the past.  Things will get better.  <br>  <br>  -Tempe|`|AA12127693	Oh dear, there is nothing I can say to make you feel better about being adopted.  Maybe you could talk to someone - you didn't state how old you are so maybe a trusted friend or counselor of some type.  My son also feels different that he is adopted and at times has felt that my other children from a previous marriage are treated better - but has come to realize that this is not the case.  He talks with a therapist weekly to hash out anything that is on his mind (he is only 7) and has been doing quite well.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best and hope that you will at least talk to someone - even your best friend just to get your feelings out on the table instead of bottled up inside.|`|2JIkzC1baa	make sure you are ok with ur self tell ur self u luv ur self evry day do things 4 ur self ....do u accept the way u are? how u been livin. if ur ok but u know that u need to focus in school breath in and out and know ur going to get through evry day and ur special and beutiful the way u r focus , accept. may be u always think about ur real parents and that u may not have much in common with the people taking care of you its really hard maybe to you. how would it be with my real parents accept who u are and where|`|WlslGIyGaa	I know how you feel, even people who weren't adopted, feel they treated them different than their siblings, (happened to me), but think about the good stuff and move on to your things, think you are better of with your adoptive parents, than anywhere else!! :D
MDfleEXWaa	Congratulations , Well the doctors even count the days so your perfectly right of saying 14 weeks 2 days it means your in your 14th week and have completed 2 days and 5 days are left to turn 15 weeks preggy ;)|`|t6OGh0Edaa	Every week you complete is the week you are so right now you would be 14.  That is what my doc told me - I had the same question! Good luck! :)|`|8oAlBL91aa	You know I have no idea how many day's I am I go by weeks and sometimes get very thrown off when someone says how many months are you lol. I'm so used to saying 18 weeks.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I would just say 14 weeks until you are 15, 15+. I'm 24w1d, and I say I'm 24 weeks, and will until next Monday when I hit 25...     It's how the weeks translate into months that gets confusing.. Normal math says I just hit 6 months, but a lot of pregnancy websites and "What to Expect" start counting 6 months at 23 weeks...    Congrats and good luck!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You will be 14 weeks until you have completed your 14th week. You stay that weeks number until you have completed all 7 days.
vigFmfLmaa	8 is barely a week.  You need to wait at least 2 weeks, 14 days, to get a good reliable result.  Sure it could show a positive earlier than that, but it might not.  And seeing negatives over and over and over is quite depressing, trust me!  Besides before 14 days that negative is unreliable because you most likely don't have enough hcg to turn the test positive.<br>  <br>  Oh, and being young and healthy doesn't have a whole lot to do with it.  Sometimes it just takes longer for people.  I've been TTC for almost 7 years now.  I didn't know I was 'unhealthy' fertility-wise until I had been trying for a while.|`|crutXlguaa	Well, I would definately wait for one more week and test again to be sure. When is your period due? Mine is due anywehere from March 1 till March 5 so the earliest I am gonna test is on March 1. I think I just ovulated yesterday cause I had some pinkish-brown discharge two days ago and sharp pains in my left ovary and yesterday I had what I thought to be stretchy cervical mucus, it was very thin though. <br>  <br>  In any case, let's just wait another week and do the test! I hope this is our months!!! BABY DUST!!!|`|GleiEHfuaa	its usually a 14 day wait or a 2ww [2 week wait]; so you'd have to wait 8 more...|`|smsUZG4Iaa	yes at least a week.. just try to be patient..|`|AA11764194	well I was conceived on 18 may and got positive result on 29th may.. that is the shortest time I got to know about the result<br>  <br>  one week is too early.. good luck
AA11863982	i actually searched all over the internet and wasnt able to find one but i did find one that was similar to those colors<a href="http://www.toysandhome.com/scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=356" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysandhome.com/scripts/prodV...</a> sorry i wasnt much help|`|VNQHUIo1aa	take a look on ebay...they may have one..
fFX0Xk9Uaa	When I was first pregnant, I got those white bumps too.  I read that they are lubrication ducts so your nipples don't dry out while breastfeeding...I am no doctor, so you might want to take a pregnancy test or see your doctor to find out!  Good luck to you!|`|8OoqHpbIaa	yes i have these you can get rid of them next time you breast feed its dried milk in your ducts but you cant get them all<br>  <br>  EDIT : i went to the midwife about mine and i know for a fact it correct what i wrote so  the thumbs down?
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Yes, some years the kids are split into obvious groups - high reading w/one teacher, average reading w/another.  Other years, the course work is just differentiated to meet each child's needs/level.  It really depends on the teacher resources available at each grade level & how they decide to work together with the kids on that level.|`|j2mRop0laa	Yes. Both of my kids teachers put them "groups" and most of the time they are working on different projects and assignments.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	When I was in elementary school (like 10 years ago), they split you off into reading groups but that was it.  Some kids just picked it up slower and either the good reader would have been bored, or the slow ones behind and discouraged.  We were never told how the different groups ranked up but I think everyone already knew who was in the high groups and who was in the low ones.<br>  <br>  Otherwise there was extra help groups where you would be pulled from class if you were behind while they were studying that subject, and you'd work in a small group with others at your level and a special ed teacher to help bring you up to speed.  I did that for handwriting in 5th grade. :P  It's a shame they didn't pull me for math, they might have realized I was learning disabled BEFORE I got to college.|`|qR3MYSOIaa	They didn't in elementary school and my son was terribly bored, he got into a lot of trouble because of it.  Now he's in high school and it is split, much better for him.<br>  <br>  They should because it's hard for teachers to spread themselves between the different levels, to assign things to more advanced kids so they're not causing trouble, and to have the time to give the other kids more one-on-one.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I am so unhappy with the school system right now for various reasons (off topic)!  My son is in the 4th grade and he is split up for math.  he tested above average in Math but they placed him in the middle group.  At first I was kind of upset, but he doesn't like to do his classwork, and I guess they figured only the kids who actually liked doing repetitive sheets of work should be in the advanced math group. <br>  <br>  don't get me started! LOL|`|K7H1zrCbaa	yes.  it makes it easier to meet the different needs of the children|`|Gem96NQyaa	They did back when I was in school... but the schools in my district nowadays all have "full inclusion" policies.  They don't separate based on ability until high school, and at that point, high level classes are entirely optional.<br>  <br>  It's a stupid policy.  The high- and middle-level kids are bored and the low-level kids are lost.<br>  <br>  Even my mother (who is a teacher in the district) hates the policy.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no they generally keep them together except those children who have difficulties have special classes away from the majority of the class in a smaller group where they get more attention and support. xx|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Most schools tend to do this. My son's school has a quest class for accelerated kids on Friday's.|`|RgNUsKfxaa	yeah most schools do
smsUZG4Iaa	well normally EWCM means your ovulating.. creamy CM is normally what you have when your preggo.. just watch it.. i had EWCM for the longest time, i went to the doctor and he found a cyst on my ovary..|`|oiJITSNZaa	that's what they make pregnancy tests for!|`|9zD5HFvAaa	Could be, is your period really late? Blessings and Baby Dust to you+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+
KA4dVajlaa	You need to give her some motrin that will bring her fever down you can piggy back it which means you gave her the tylenol already wait atleast one hour and then you can give her the mortin and that should work.  You can also give her a cool bath that she can just sit and relax in and if she won't do that take a cool wet towel and put it on her forhead and then also on her arms and behind her knees and that usually works also.  Hope she feels better|`|6YTSD3pdaa	if the fever is not coming down, you need to take her to the dr. she might have some type of infection.... a fever is always signs of infection.. just call your parents they will know what to do.. good luck. hope she feels better.|`|lW1rCecnaa	You can give Tylenol every 4 hours and motrin every 6 hours and if the fever is bad you can give them both.NOT AT THE SAME TIME. But give Tylenol then two to three hours later if needed give motrin.|`|AA10698792	My parents always put us in a tub of cool water for a few minutes and that always brought our fevers down.|`|hBJM5JmEaa	Chamomile tea is a great idea put a hint of honey in it and give her an ice pack. After 6 hours give her ibuprofen, its a fever reducer. Drink cold water and maybe a popsicle. Cold drinks and foods help cool the body's temperature.|`|yWU57CLYaa	Skyler is correct.  Give her Motrin for her fever, and you can give it to her even though you already gave her Tylenol.  Keep her cool with a cool wash cloth.  I always give my kids warm jello juice to drink when they are ill.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Do not give her more medicine.  Call your parents at work and tell them your sister is sick.  They will come home and, probably, call the doctor.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Put a cold rag on her head and when your parents get home tell them she needs to go to the doctor.

Best of luck!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	id go back to what you were using. i am on ortho lo right now and i got nausea the 1st month but its gone since. i also take the pill at night so if there are any side effects im pretty much asleep. you may want to try that.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I was on Yaz and was sick for months...always nauseous.

xDHbTzshaa	Shes getting up in the middle of the night because she knows that Mommy is going to come get her. I went through this with my daughter and tried to ferber method, and within two nights she was sleeping through the night. Every once in a while she will go through her phase where she wants to get up, but the ferber method works every time! I love it! Heres how it works..<br>  <br>  When she wakes up in the middle of the night, Mom needs to walk calmy and not really say anything and just soother her IN her crib. Don't pick her up out of the crib. Rub her back and "shhh" her. It may take 10 minutes but once she is calm walk away and go back to bed. She will probably cry, but let her do it alone for about 10 minutes. If she is still crying, go back in and do the same thing, then leave and let her cry for 20 min. It could be a long night, but normally around doing this twice with my daughter it works and she is sleeping through the night.<br>  <br>  This is teaching her how to self-soothe, which is very important. Oh, also its very important that they put her to bed when she is very sleepy, but not yet asleep. You need to lay them down so they can fall asleep on there own. This only enstills learning how to self soothe.<br>  <br>  I know it can be hard to hear your baby cry but it is for their own good and this really does work.|`|X3rQJhVMaa	Some babies dont sleep threw the night until 14 months. Does she get any day naps? She may be sleeping to much during the day making her wide awake for sleeping. I dont think shes sleeping enough thru out the night. Its strange that she doesnt go back to sleep for 1 - 2 hours I have never heard of a baby doing that before. Make sure her bottle nipples are fast flow so that she can get enough food to make her full before she falls asleep. Just make sure she is fully comfortable in her crib.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Keep doing what they're doing. Some babies take longer to sleep through the night than others and it doesn't mean anything is wrong with them.<br>  <br>  You cannot force a baby, or anyone, to sleep. So if she wakes then they're going to have to "deal" with it. Are they keeping the lights off and not making too much noise? When they go to feed her advise them to do it as quickly as possible and have as little as possible interaction with her. Don't neglect her, obviously, but it's also not playtime.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Just keep doing what they are doing.  My daughter is 21 months old and still does not sleep through the night.  My son didn't sleep through the night until 26 months old, on a regular basis.  Some babies are more sensitive to things, so it could be she is too hot or too cold, or has an itchy tag, or a scratchy sheet.  Or maybe there is a night light on that bothers her, or maybe there isn't one and she doesn't like the dark.  Maybe there is a noise she hears, or maybe there is no noise, so then when something makes the tiniest noise she hears it.  There are tons of possibilities.  But if she is simply waking up due to hunger or teething, than there is nothing else they can do.  Just wait until your daughter hits teething (other than the first four - eight teeth that aren't as bad as the rest!).  I'm sure she will hit some restless nights too.  Teething I found has a lot to do with it, even if they aren't fussy when they wake up.  My son started sleeping through the very night that his last baby tooth came in.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	Here's what I've been told- I have a 10 month old who still wakes up at midnight (just long enough to eat or be held and is up for the day at 6am!) Introduce a security object, use a  Binky, try the cry it out method (i tried it didn't work for my son worked like a charm for my daughter) give her cereal just before bed (didn't work for me) and feed her on  schedule during the day that is 4 hours between meals so she learns to get full and not snack constantly. I hope something works for her! Your a LUCKY mom!|`|QTSsGbubaa	int he beggining with my daughter i ahd a problem getting her to sleep. a friend of mine said to try at the last feeding and night feedings to make sure she is taking warm milk it helps. also cooing (low) music at night may help. like a mommy lullibye... the other thing i tryed which helped big time was put a shirt or a blanket that "mommy" sleeps with or wears in the crib with the baby. my daughter just needed some warm milk and the scent of mommy and she slept 7p-7a every night<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	our 13 month old was waking up in the middle of the night around 3am..it stopped when we took away her afternoon nap...whats probably happening is that when she goes to sleep at 8 and then gets up at 12 its like taking a long nap...if they kept her up a little later and then put her to sleep she may not wake up at all at night...we don't put our daughter to bed until around 10:30-11pm and since i took away her 8pm nap she sleeps through the night|`|AA11540024	they can try playing with her, making her laugh and put her to bed a little later then usual. Like around 10 pm. Give her a bottle before she goes to bed.
AA11678263	There is no harm in trying.  Sometimes people are told they are completely infertile and still manage to conceive naturally - I know a girl who is pregnant for the third time after being told pregnancies 1 and 2 must have been a "miracle" as she couldn't possibly get pregnant due to some gynaecological problem she has (endometriosis).  Your Dr should be able to tell you the name again if you are unsure, and could perhaps give you some leaflets or some information about support groups/websites you could check out to hear other people's stories.  As for adopting children with behavioural difficulties or teenagers, this is certainly admirable, but I think you would have to be quite a bit older than you are now, as you yourself are still a teen.  In the meantime, keep trying, and enjoy the lovely little girl you already have xXX|`|JjBwydymaa	Hunni...<br>  <br>  Doctors arnt always right. My mum was told at the age of 18 that she wernt able to have children. She never used protection ever in her life and she had fell pregnant 3 times. <br>  <br>  Miracles happen hun... so dont think yourself as infertile. I have a friend who has been told that her chances on conceiving are very slim too. She came off the pill and is just seeing what happens. When its meant to be it will be.<br>  <br>  All I can to you...is to seek another professionals advice and see what they say about it because Im sure ive heard that there is medicatin out there for people with endiometriosis.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck TTC#2 hun x|`|H4USFx3uaa	Its spelt endometriosis, its where the normal lining of blood which usually lines the womb and sheds during your period lines elsewhere in the body, usually around your ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowels and sometimes your lungs. It can cause scarring and alot of pain, but it can be treated. Ask your Dr for a laparoscopy to diagnose and treat the endometriosis. They can cauterise the effected areas whilst you are under a general anaesthetic.<br>  <br>  If you have PCOS, there are hormone treatments available such as Clomid which stimulate the ovaries to release an egg and there is no reason why these treatments should not be available to you. Simply ask your GP about them and ask for a referral to a fertility specialist or nurse led fertility clinic where they can advise, treat and support you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and I hope you find this information helpful.|`|UU3AAlkraa	This is easy Darlin, if you do not conceive again. adotion is an option and since you are willing to accept an older child you should wait until your daughter is nearer that age, So if conception happens great and if it don't great you will be able to benefit a child in need. Good for you.<br>  <br>  P.S. You did not mention if you plan to use birth control anyway, still there is a lot of enjoyment in trying to conceive.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Its Endometriosis, silly people yah I have it as well and early this  month I found out I have it a 2nd time, Im probably going to have to get operated again so yah sh!tty deal I know life's a ***** then you marry one, Ive been trying to get pregnant for years Ive had in all 7 miscarrieges... Good Luck|`|758cDKEFaa	if your chances are slim then you might aswell start trying as it could be a while|`|1LdgTQodaa	hi,i really feel for you.i was 18 when i had my first child,and i cant imagine being told that i couldnt have anymore.i think that once youve had a baby then your body clock makes you want to have another one.its a natural thing .that women want to nurture and bring up their babies.and its a strong urge.<br>  i think that if you do want to try then go ahead.the worst thing is getting older and wishing youde done something that your not able to anymore.so if you really want to then go for it.theres no harm in trying.and the fact that you want to help others just goes to show that your a caring person and any kids you do have will be very lucky to have you.i hope this has helped and good luck.|`|MmQi03oXaa	If endometritis is what you are talking about, then your doctor isn't being fully honest. There are treatments for it. From what you're saying about having a few periods a year, it could be a hormonal imbalance.

AA10624857	During normal digestion, when you consume foods containing carbohydrates such as breads, fruit, milk, and pasta, these foods break down into various sugar molecules, one of which is glucose. Your pancreas secretes insulin which is needed to guide the glucose in to your blood stream.  During pregnancy, hormones are produced by the placenta.  These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin.  In most cases, a pregnant woman's pancreas simply secretes more insulin to get the job done of getting glucose into the blood, but sometimes it just isn't able to keep up with the demand.  This is when Gestational Diabetes develops.  What you eat isn't going to cause Gestational Diabetes, but you can manage it with diet if you do develop Gestational Diabetes.  For instance, eating a lot of sweets isn't going to make you diabetic and it isn't going to prevent Gestational Diabetes if you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.  Being overweight before getting pregnant does put you at an increased risk for Gestational Diabetes as does having a family history of diabetes, being over 25, and being certain races.  For unclear reasons, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes than are other women.  I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th pregnancy.  There are several reliable web sites to research Gestational Diabetes.  Below are several of the ones I am familiar with.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I have no idea but my niece had it really bad and she is not overweight.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My cousin was not overweight at all and she managed to get it.  She put on a lot of weight during her pregnancy (70 lbs).  I'm overweight and I did not get it..I only packed on 14 lbs during my pregnancy. I think some of it has to do with genetics, pregnancy weight gain and what you eat...not necessarily whether you're healthy or overweight.<br>  <br>  I think if that were the case then they wouldn't test all pregnant women for gestational diabetes...just us big girls LOL.|`|0f3d5635f916732a3a43b98496988bcfaa	I think it has to do with genetics, pregnancy, how much weight you gain and what type of foods you are eating...not necessarily whether you're healthy or overweight.
B9KwqnuDaa	Maybe just try the plain ones for now.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	You shouldn't.  They also aren't suppose to have nuts.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Cooking, pasteurizing, and filtering doesn't reliably kill botulism spores.  However the risk is very small.<br>  <br>  Nuts it depends on your history of allergies.<br>  <br>  However cheerios (the actual brand) come in original, as well as honey nut, multigrain, etc.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I could be wrong, but honey is not supposed to be consumed by children under a year because they lack a botulism immunity. I guess raw honey like in the little bear containers is 100% pure honey, and I'm not sure if that is pasteurized to kill off bacteria or not. Honey Nut Cheerios would be baked, and that would kill of that bacteria. <br>  Recently it's also been in the news that if a child is allergic to nuts, giving nut products under 2 years will not make a difference one way or the other, as far as the development of that allergy is concerned. <br>  I gave my daughter Honey Nut Cheerios as an infant and she is fine. But she also doesn't have any food allergies..|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	If the doctor says its fine that I wouldn't worry about. Honestly, I did it too and nothing bad happened to my boys. Besides, it's so little honey on those cheerios anyway...|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	our doctor told us no raw honey, like honey directly from the honey comb. im sure honey nut cheerios would be fine! they taste better than plain, thse taste like cardboard lol|`|cjqKMjWnaa	i wouldn't.  because of all of the food allergies going around these days, i'm a big advocate of giving them the simplest foods for as long as possible, and at least til they're 1 year old.  i'm doing this right now with my 10 month old - i don't even like feeding her those apple cinnamon puffs - and did it with my 4 year old who is completely allergy free.  there's also a coating on the honey nut cheerios which makes it harder to dissolve.  plain cheerios are also nice for that reason - they start dissolving as soon as they put them in their mouth, reducing the chances for choking.  does your baby not like plain cheerios?  if that's the case, i'd try the gerber puffs, they come in all different flavors so there's sure to be something he/she enjoys.|`|9X09kM4oaa	just give your baby plain cheerios just so you don't have to worry- but if the doctor said its ok- you can always ask another doctor or hey call some pharmacies in your area and ask them if that's ok. I call my pharmacy and her pediatrician all the time- better safe than sorry|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i would not risk it there really is no reason to.   cooking/baking does not kill the spores in honey that are considered harmfull so there is a chance the baby could get sick.  i would just do regular cherrios for now, at least until the baby is a year old.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I mix the 2 together.  I have never had a problem.  My major concern with the Honey Nut Cheerios too young was not the honey, or nuts, but having them getting too used to sweet things.  That's why I mixed.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	You are right. But it's actually the honey and the nuts part. They shouldn't have either till they are over 1 year of age.|`|59SM8kFIaa	yea they say don't give them like a spoon full of honey cuz of Algiers reasons!!but it is a cheerios should  be fine!!|`|W6S6WpsNaa	I gave mine both kinds of Cheerios @ that age.|`|DJd0DruQaa	if the doc says its okay i would..but i would get a docts opinion first. so i mean i think its okay|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well plain cheerios would be better less sugar, no nuts, or honey. But they concern with honey was with natural bacteria and with the cheerios I think it would just be flavoring.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Honey nut cherios at any age shouldn't be feed.|`|iSFI6igbaa	I have 5 kids and i feed my kids honey nut cheerios and nothing bad happened to them they are healthy lil guys.|`|028xaZCeaa	if the doctor says its fine then dont worry about it, but why not just buy the plain cheerios?|`|K2AdEJLRaa	no its best to feed then small peas or cubed carrots. but REGULAR cherrios should be ok|`|QZjVvilOaa	My son's doctor said to not give any Honey until after 12 months.

JRXpYW3Naa	I just see him being called 'Weenie' in school.|`|l9tiHyJSaa	I think it's a beautiful idea to name your child something that is special to your culture. However, if your child is going to be growing up outside of that culture I would consider a first name that is more common in that culture...especially if the name (like Weenith) is similar to something in English (like Weiner, Weenie). <br>  <br>  An alternate would definitely be to give the baby the name Weenith as a middle name. Then you can always refer to him as Weenith at home if you are really set on calling the kid that.|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	You may get away with it for a baby girl, but don't do it to a boy, he will get so much name calling at school, and it may get the wrong idea in those adolescent years too, and may end up changing his name, but it would suit a girl much better especially living in england, i would save the name for a little girl and think of a more manly name for a boy like king, prince,lion,ruler in your culture|`|claUGpVRaa	Personally I don't like it but it's your choice and your culture. Depends on where in the world you live I guess, but in the UK it would mean the child got teased endlessly. If it were a middle name it would be okay though??|`|pDrdCRQcaa	first off, baby is how it is spelled and second, Weenith  is a HORRIBLE name and he will be teased even as an adult.|`|K5XDXRK7aa	He'll be called Winnie the Pooh at school !|`|oYmZUO8Caa	It's a nice meaning, but no.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	noo.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	Honestly, no. BUT I don't like it because my culture wouldn't name their kid Weenith in the US.

baQpo0kdaa	you could be pregnant but you wont but a test will not be able to tell for another two weeks. good luck kid|`|pqZAhBLvaa	You could be. It would be aerly for symptoms, but not impossible. You are throwing up bile, and yes, that's what morning sickness is like. You feel like throwing up when your stomach is empty, and when you do, it is just bile. You should be able to do a pregnancy test, and get a positive result on the day you are supposed to get your period. Some women take longer though. Get an early detection test (First Response is great, it told me I was pregnant 6 days before my period was due!) You could just be psyching yourself out because you are worried. The mind can do strange things. Being 15, you need to find out asap so that all of your options remain open if you are pregnant. If an early detection test comes up negative, see a doctor, they can do a blood test that is totally accurate. Good luck!

Got me through 3 pregnancies|`|JOVWBOOCaa	junior mints and exercise have helped me with my daughter and this pregnancy however with my daughter it got so bad I had to wear the bracelets they have for motion sickness, they put pressure on your wrist and it helped a tiny bit but eventually I had to get promethazine from my dr, just be careful, it knocked me out! I could not take it during the day while I was working or driving! Good luck another 8-10 weeks and it should go away!|`|AA11853447	I went to a pregnancy nutrition class and they gave me lots of tips. <br>  <br>  They say that lemon squeezed in water or lemon flavored things. Also, just make sure you EAT. I would get nauseous only when I was hungry, so eat something bland just to fill your tummy and that should help the nausea. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!!|`|ki3XY49daa	I am pregnant with my fifth child and the one and ONLY thing I have depended on was peppermint.  I swear by it.  I kept my pockets full and they never failed me...:)|`|MKnpH4XKaa	This is when my nausea kicked in<br>  I ate saltine crackers and drunk some water.<br>  <br>  it helped me.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It some ritz crackers throughout the day and eat very small meals.  Stay away from grease that aggravates it more.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	juice made me sicker <br>  but carbs helped me not alot just enough to calm down<br>  like bread crakers cheese rice|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Well, even if you throw up the nausea won't stop, so don't feel like you are getting the short end of the stick.<br>  <br>  I really liked Preggie Pops when my nausea was bad, you can get them at BRU. If you can't get them, try sour hard candy, that also worked for me. And don't allow yourself to become hungry, that's when it was the worst for me. Always have a pack of crackers or a small snack handy, just in case.|`|7iMZ91K7aa	I heard about some suckers called "preggie pops" that are suppose to help with nausea!!!|`|hw3OMoeZaa	Find a Motherhood Maternity store and buy some preggo pops.  they are a ginger based sucker with like 7 different flavors and they are great!  If it gets really bad ask your Dr. about phenagren (promethasine)<br>  it works really well and I have taken it from day one for nausea and Im in week 21.  Good Luck|`|UaL28atDaa	here is a great video that gives lots of tips on how to avoid morning sickness all together.

smsUZG4Iaa	Benedryl, Valium, Xanax, A big Bottle of Vodka, some ear plugs and a fly-swatter. oh and any baby materials..|`|aLAmvX5Naa	All a baby NEEDS is food, shelter, and warmth.<br>  <br>  If you are breastfeeding all you'd need in an emergency diaper bag is a couple days worth of diapers and wipes, a couple changes of clothes and a blanket for each baby. Maybe a pacifier if your baby takes one.<br>  <br>  If you are formula feeding you'd need bottled water and formula for a few days.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well must haves are: diapers, lots of clothes 0-6 mos -weather appropriate- blankets, wipes, diaper rash cream,formula and bottles,(if bottle fed and water bottles, pacifiers -if planning on giving it to them-get many. A sling or two in your case ;) I couldnt live without mine! :)<br>  And as for emergency that's basically it. The rest are luxuries that it's great to have such as an exersaucer, or baby swing, or bouncy chair.. etc but if you're talking about what if you need to evacuate with your babies then just the items above are Must Haves. <br>  <br>  Edit** I almost forgot!! Infants Tylenol or Pediatrics Advil -or both... to last you for a while.. babies get a cold or teething and they get a fever or feel crappy.<br>  Somebody mentioned a Pack n Play and I think that's a great idea, if you're on the move. I have a graco one, that folds pretty small and it comes with its own bag with handles to carry. <br>  Good Luck! And hope nothing happens!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Wow, that's really great that you are thinking ahead. I would say some must haves would be:<br>  -- A supply of diapers & formula <br>  -- A fold up playpen (can also be used as a crib)<br>  -- A double stroller<br>  -- Plenty of blankets for swaddling/keeping warm<br>  -- Infant Tylenol & gas relief meds|`|LdzTP5VXaa	1.

I suggest buying Travel Swings, (the aquarium ones by Fisher Price are really nice, my daughter likes this better than her big swing....) one of those Pack & Plays by Graco that are made for twins, and a car bottle warmer. And if you plan on breastfeeding, a pump with extra batteries and storage bags.<br>  These were the big things on my list for her. Its a work in progress, but that what I figure I'll need to bring. <br>  (I'd keep a box of diapers, a couple packs of wipes, and a couple cans of formula and bottles in your trunk, just in case of any emergency, plus a few outfits, I also have a baby first aid kit with basic meds in my trunk)|`|dwt1sidtaa	diapers<br>  wipes<br>  paci's <br>  formula (if not breastfeeding)<br>  extra clothes<br>  their car seats and a stroller<br>  couple of blankets<br>  some toys<br>  baby carrier (baby bjorn, moby wrap or babyhawk)|`|Yko0r0fNaa	You'll need milk, blankets, diapers, tylenol, thermometer, diaper rash cream, a few toys, and a child's carrier.
OWReYgV5aa	No one "asks" for things to happen to them that they do not like...but when life deals you lemons..you have to make lemonade sweetie.  This is not the worse thing that could happen to you.  Just be glad you have your health and the health of your children.  I know you are young, but YOU made your own choices and YOU have to deal with the consequences.  But instead of looking at them like consequences, think of it as blessings.  Because that's really all you can do at this point.  YOu need to make a a life plan and stick with it.  If you don't want your son's name changed...then say "no"...that's all you need to do.  You need to stop thinking about how wrong life has treated you and start thinking on how to make it right for yourself and your children's future.  You have to grow up and make mature decisions and FORGET about what you have lost...now is the time to step up, all is not lost, trust me...you can do it!!|`|723QHuicaa	ok for a start, your waaaaaay too early to know your having a boy - so naming your ''son'' is pointless.    secondly, when you chose to have sex, you chose to deal with consequences. If were unaware of the risk of pregnancy then you were too young to have sex.    You sound really immature - you and the babys father have 7m to grow up - i suggest you use the time wisely.|`|iwYu32N2aa	your 15 and pregnant for a Second time? Seeing that you display name says so. Get a life|`|8oAlBL91aa	Wait what? Okay let me try and figure this out. So your barely even 16 and having 2 kids but yet you didn't ask for this life, maybe you should have thought of that before you took off your pants. And change your current child's name okay I just don't get that. People don't just wake up one morning and decide well I want to change my child's name that's his name that your chose if you or he didn't like it then you shouldn't have named him that. These are the consequences of having sex when your still a child yourself.    You need to realize that people agree with me and other who said you are young rather than sending a message to everyone of them, if you didn't want to hear the truth then why ask the question? Saying your abused only makes you look more like a lier.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I don't understand how you didn't "choose" your life. You very well did,by opening your legs. There is a Plan B emergency contraceptive to prevent pregnancy,but you're a little late for that now. I agree,you don't just wake up one day and change a kids name. Close your legs,and pay more attention in sex ed. I've got no advice for you. Yes,I had my daughter at sixteen,but when my now husband and I thought there was even a chance that I could possibly get pregnant again,we got the Plan B. Grow up!! Stop having unprotected sex,you think you'd learn the first time.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Why are you pregnant again?  Did they not give you protection after the first time?  You baby's daddy cannot change the baby's name. And is that something major? I mean, really...you are not married so you do what you want. Right?  And how do you know what you are having? (as I assume you are not talking about the first child?)  You quote your age and all....like you want sympathy. I have some. For your children.   What the hell is your real question?  You did ask for this. Sex has consequences. I hope you are at least STD free.    I got pregnant young myself....I learned my lesson well. No sex for over two years.... I kept away from men until I met the one I married, after I was an adult.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I thought you said you were having  girl TROLL. you're not pregnant so stop lying about it!     ***if you look at her profile she says she has a 4 month old son and a baby girl on the way too***    to answer your question: STOP HAVING SEX PROBLEM SOLVED.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	What do you mean, "I didn't ask to have this life like this"? You CHOSE this kind of life. You are almost 16 and pregnant with your second baby.    I feel there is no hope for you. If you didn't learn anything from baby number one then you never will. Don't abort this baby and then give up both your children for adoption. You aren't ready to be mother in any way shape or form.|`|kH56qw2Taa	use protection|`|JnLoHaoAaa	What does changing your son's name have to do with being pregnant again? You need to talk to someone you trust and figure out what to do with your life|`|v0aKxF6iaa	maybe you didnt ask for it but you sure as hell didnt prevent it so now you must suffer the consequences and the name of your child should be the least of your worries right now|`|cjqOUq5xaa	Iam sorry but you have thought about all of this before you started having sex. But now its your life and you have to deal with it. and I think that worrying about the "baby daddy" changing names is the least of your worries. I have a hard time feeling sorry for people like you-this day and age there are so many things that you can do to prevent pregnancy-but you didn't so now you need to focus on being the best mother to your children you can be-while you are still a child your self-God bless you and your innocent children.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	It's hard to be a teen mom. I know. I got pregnant when I was 16.  But you did choose this life. No one else can choose to have sex for you. And it is just as much his baby as yours. so compromise. You pick the first name he can pick the middle. I know how frustrating it is not having any one understand what you are going through. Everyone makes mistakes some peoples are just more visible. I wish you the best of luck.|`|QlbaXYeLaa	Sweetie. Just relax. You want this baby so bad. I know you do. And.. I know that its hard to be a teenage mom.. but I believe you will be able to pull it off. No one asks for anything in life. ..Some things are just meant to be. From a recent question of yours.. you said that you and your sons father were no longer together.. so.. since you have custody over your son. ..I would say do what you think is right. If you want to change his name.. go for it. ..But I would say just keep the name you have. ..Its less paperwork. Stick in there hun. Im here for you if you want any more advice. Just take it day by day. Besides.. abortions are wayy expensive. ..and your killing that little baby inside of you. Just hold on. Things will get better sweetie. |`|i9M0U9Meaa	having two kids at 15 is ridiculous, you did ask for this life because you had the sex. so good luck. you have definitely ruined your life. smart choice!|`|mzFUWq8iaa	DONT HAVE UN-PROTECTED SEX. that is the best advice anyone could give you.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	your 15.. this is the kinda **** sex gets little girls into :( your own your own...im 18, and barley making it.    36 weeks and 4 days pregnant:)|`|Hi5h9739aa	You did ask for this life when you made the decision to have unprotected sex.  Maybe you should think about adoption.  It sounds to me like you don't want the child.  What do u want help with exactly?  If you don't want your baby's name changed then just say no.  I would think someone would have realized after the first child at age 15 you would be more careful.|`|fee80ea1112f0f01af4280757ecf8929aa	wow. I think you're freaking out. Calm down, take a deep breathe. Just have a talk with the daddy about the names.

eXsR8Gx5aa	I've recently cut out the ridiculous amount of sweet snacks I was having because the jeans were getting tight lol, but I don't avoid any foods, I eat a varied and not too unhealthy diet and try to include whole milk, yoghurt & cheese, I obviously avoid too much caffiene or alcohol.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I watched what I was eating for my sake, not the babys.<br>  <br>  I was a full time working mommy who was pumping every 2-3 hours.  Up all night, but still had to work the next day.  I ate healthy so I wouldn't lose my mind... of course eating healthy helped my little one, but at that point, I was just trying to get enough energy in myself to keep going.|`|YsnY9LqIaa	I've never found anything that I've eaten has given her a funny tummy or anything.  If I fancy something unhealthy then I don't deny myself but I'd say I eat healthier because I'm breastfeeding, and also because I want her to see me eating healthy foods and eat them too.|`|pDRAciBnaa	i eat anything i fancy,i am also pregnant now so its definatley a choice of what my body will let me eat w/o feeling sick.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I normally eat what I want, but I know that broccoli upsets him so that's what I avoid!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I barely get time to eat,  but I still eat the same sort of foods that I did before breast feeding.

I try to eat like I did before having him (I had crazy heartburn the whole pregnancy); it's helping so far.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I can't eat peanut butter or peanuts :( because my son is allergic to them. Why oh why did it have to be peanut butter...my favorite candy is Reese's peanut butter cups :( :( :(<br>  <br>  I also take care not to drink caffeinated drinks because he reacts very badly to caffeine. <br>  <br>  Oh and I do try to avoid broccoli and beans because they give him gas .|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I like to eat healthy so I eat what ever I want.

It seemed like he got gassy when I ate some cabbage recently.  but other than that there isn't anything that I avoid
zwctZ812aa	You can take tylenol.  Regular strength only, the extra strength is too much.  I had back pain but only in the last few weeks.  I would take a warm bath and relax.  Heating pads also help a bit, just make sure you don't leave it on too long or put it on your belly.  Good luck!
T0gv52CDaa	I think it is way too early to be leaving your child overnight with anyone.  My 2 1/2 year old has only been without at least one of us at home overnight once, and that was when I was in the hospital having our now 3 month old.  He stayed with my brother & sis-in-law for the two nights that I was in the hospital.  My husband and I go out for the evening a lot, and get a baby sitter, but other than when I had to because the hospital wouldn't let older siblings stay have we been gone overnight.<br>  <br>  I do realize that a lot of people disagree with me.  Most of my friends who have kids the same age as mine have let their kids stay with grandparents plenty of times already, but I'm not ready to do that yet.  I don't know at what age I will be, but I know it isn't now.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i dont see a problem with it at all.|`|33h5R8nTaa	My daughter was 4 days old and she even went to my moms for 2 weeks and she lives 9 states away( we were moving) when she was 4 months old|`|LDYAGJCxaa	My son (almost 3) just spent the night at his grandma's for the first time last weekend.  But he's very temperamental about where and how he sleeps.  Until recently, he would only sleep in his bed, he had to have *his* pillow, specific stuffed animals, *his* blanket, and a specific song playing on a cd player.  He simply wouldn't sleep anywhere else, even if my husband or I was with him.  My daughter on the other hand had no problem staying the night with grandma or sleeping somewhere other than her bed.<br>  <br>  I think it really depends on your child.  If your mother is fully willing to deal with a couple of sleepless nights (IF she gets fussy) then I say go for it and have some fun!  Parents need fun too, you know!  :)|`|AA10949064	My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and has already spent one night over at her Grammy's house.  She loved it!!!!<br>  <br>  She is going to be doing two more overnighters in March.<br>  <br>  If you are nervous about it - have her stay at their house one night before the big weekend and see how it goes.  I bet she'll be fine.|`|qStmw7qgaa	My daughter was 2 weeks when she first stayed over at my parents house.  But only because my husband and I hadn't slept in two weeks.  She will stay over with them maybe once a month.  Maybe once every two months.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Why did you have to come home early? Why couldn't your mom handle it? Your mom should be able to take care of her just fine.Go out and get some well deserved time away.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	With being a mom comes worry. I understand where you are coming from. My daughter is three and I'm now pregnant with # 2 (a boy). The first time I let her stay the night away was when she was almost 2. I trust my mom I just always had this crazy anxiety that something would go wrong and what not, but overall I knew I had to let go some. My husband says I'm too protective and often complains because we don't get much time alone for movies and nights out. If you are not comfortable with leaving her because of legit reasons then don't leave her. Relax and enjoy yourself. Your mom probably wouldn't mind having her more often.|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	our daughter has spent several weekends with my parents and so far one weekend with her aunt and uncle and they are going to get her next weekend also...she's 13 months old and she's been staying the night with others since she was about 2 months old...if you keep your daughter at home all the time and never let her go to someone else's house to stay the night now then she's probably going to resist more and more as she grows up...then every time she goes to a sleepover your going to have to go and pick her up because she's not going to want to stay...let her go...it'll be good for her|`|AA12000352	My older son stayed with grandma overnight for the first time when he was 6 months old. My husband and I had a night out and then, a night to just sleep through without any worries. Despite my son being breast-fed, it worked like a charm - we pumped and froze and he had his mommy milk while we had an evening/night to just be a couple again. <br>  <br>  I would go for it if your mom feels up to taking care of a baby who will, at times, be fussy.|`|4JFtco6Vaa	If you are uncomfortable for any reason then its good your thinking twice!!  You should always listen to you instincts.  Try make a pros and cons list.  That works for me!  For example, is your mom a large part of the babies life?  If so then she would more than likely be comfortable with this person away from home? If so...PRO!!  Is your mom gotten better with the baby when she is really fussy?  If so...PRO! This could go on and on based on your personal life.  One thing to remember and the most important...will your daughter be safe and well cared for while on this trip.  If so, all you really need to worry about is if you able to not be extremely anxious the whole time, lol.  I think all parents get baby sick when they are separated from their children.  I hope this helped!!!|`|jnLryjZpaa	oh god yes!! its realy important for your relationship to have alone time! good for baby too to socialise and bond with granny. enjoy!|`|QQhe3NmHaa	Yes, it will be fine !|`|veC6wUy9aa	I think you should.  As long as the caretaker is willing to take care of a baby that will be yelling and screaming.  They should only do that the first night and after being with the caretaker for a while, i don't think the second night would be a problem.<br>  <br>  You deserve a weekend out!
vp8uG8Jbaa	I showed my boyfriend this question, he is NOT circumcised<br>  <br>  he says he has never wanted to be and says sex wouldn't feel as good if he was. tmi but the foreskin glides up and down and he says that's the best part.<br>  <br>  he compared it to getting a toe cut off or something and says he's never considered that so why would he consider circumcision? he feels sorry for guys that are done.<br>  <br>  Im surprised by people saying they are cut and happy, they dont know what they are missing. no I dont think that is a good excuse to do it, even the chance he will learn and regret what he is missing is not cool. <br>  <br>  btw he has no hygiene issues, people who say it's dirty are very ignorant. it makes NO difference to hygiene. it's stupid to say like some ppl have 'there is a possibility of infection under the foreskin' because #1 it is a small possibility and #2 there is a possibility of infection everywhere in the body and no other body parts are removed before anything has gone wrong. vaginal infections are way more common than foreskin infections.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|6jAJ9ncMaa	Despite what some people are saying, circumcision is not brutal or barbaric.  The procedure now causes little to no pain at all and is very quick.  I as well as the rest of the males in my family are circumcised.<br>  <br>  The decision overall is yours.  You will get people answering that are anti-circumcision and will try to sway your decision.  And again, IT IS YOUR DECISION!<br>  <br>  In some countries, circumcision is perfomed on boys when they start their teens as a right of passage.<br>  <br>  There are no factual medical documentation that states that circumcision is bad.  It is actually hygenically better for the male.|`|VNQHUIo1aa	Sorry im not a male either but my son is circumcised and im happy with my decision for him, b/c they wont remember the pain, they will remember if they get it done later in life....plus they use general anesthetist for the procedure|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i know it says males only but i know my husbands answers so i will put them down for him lol<br>  <br>  he is circumsized<br>  he is very happy with that<br>  and yes our male children will be|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	No, I am glad, I am not circumcised.  Because, I was born in Europe, where circumcision is far less common.  It is only in the U.S., that boys get 'chopped', as infants.  Both of my sons are not circumcised.  It wasn't done to me, or my younger brother and, I wouldn't do it to my sons.  My nephew might be.<br>  <br>  When my kids were born, I heard infant boys being circumcised in the hospital and, screaming their lungs out.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is a reprehensible practice of the U.S. medical establishment, that should be abolished!!!!!|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Well, I'm obviously not a boy, but I just had my son, and chose not to get him circumcised while he's little.<br>  It will be his decision, when he's old enough to make it.<br>  His father's circumcised, and he's happy with it, but I don't feel comfortable taking my son's choice away.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	I'm also not a male but my husband and I have had this discussion. Yes he is circumcised, yes he is happy with it, and yes any male children we have will be circumcised also.|`|Xd0jFZhDaa	I'm a girl but my brother( he's 3 now) was circumcised at 1 years old.<br>  Yes my parents are happy with it because it is hygienic and can help prevent some infections in the future.<br>  <br>  yes my sons will be circumcised.|`|mTRnOIodaa	Yes I am circumcised and proud of it and if your son isn't there is a possibility for infection under the foreskin.
Gem96NQyaa	Speaking as someone who DID live at home all through college... I was allowed to do whatever I wanted (provided it was legal) once I was 18, so long as I obeyed house rules when at home.<br>  <br>  But then, my parents were never especially strict.  My sister and I never ad bed times or curfews... by and large, we were responsible enough to go to bed at a decent time on our own, and we both generally came home when our friends' curfews dictated THEY had to be home.|`|9QF6GGyiaa	I'm not a parent but I did live at home after I turned 18 and it all comes down to respect. Yes your kid can technically do whatever they want but if they aren't paying any kind of bills like rent, food or power then there should be some kind of restrictions allowed. There should also be some exceptions. When I knew I was going to be a little later then curfew I would either let my parents know or just sleep over a friends how. If they're understanding and taking everything you ask seriously then you should be understanding as well and let SOME rules such as curfew slide a little. I don't think you should punish them but if they do continue to disobey rules then kinda scare them and tell them you were thinking of charging rent or food money. Your child may threaten to move out but trust me they won't. If they do they'll be back once they find out for themselves how hard it is to care for themselves. Hope this helped.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I don't care how old you are as long as I support you, I make the rules...period.<br>  <br>  AND....it gets better....I don't even care if you're working and paying rent and buying your own groceries there are still some rules you need to obey.  For example, my house is not a cheap motel, do not go out clubbing and bringing trashy chicks home......If you want to be a pig move out and get your own place.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	If your living in my home you will live by my rules. I woulnt make you have a curfew but your not going to be tramping through my house at 3 am from a party or whereever, you will need to stay the night there and call and tell me so.|`|T5X64Mraaa	NO how unfair is that, treat them exactly how you would of liked to of been treated when you were that age. <br>  They are clearly not kids anymore discussions about problems are far better than laying down the law and will result in a happy home life|`|yKS2UI87aa	You betcha my house my rules. Don't like the rules get your own place. I don't mean to be harsh but if you let them stay then they should have enought respect for you that they would abide by the rules set.|`|3xLQnkWqaa	I would defiantly do so! As long as they are not going to live on their own and support themselves like most people their age, they should be treated like an overgrown child.|`|I7QcHkLFaa	Under your roof live by your rules.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	no. just as long as they were doing good in college. But, I would still expect chores to be done.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	To me home is somewhere the door is always open. My son can live with us as long as wants/needs to. Obviously if he turns into Brennan from Step Brothers there is mental incapacity involved so I'm not talking about that kind of extreme. But I hope I always have a place for him. After he is 18 he is an adult and can do what he pleases. I would only ask he have respect for others in the house. Like not waking us up if he came home late etc.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	All of our rules are based on treating each other with respect, keeping safe & being healthy.  If you were behaving unsafely or disrespectfully while living in my house for free, then I would make sure that you understood the consequences of that choice.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Yep.  If my child who still lived under my roof, ate my food, and was using my money to go to college, broke a rule of my home, there would be a punishment.<br>  It doesn't matter to me what every other adult is doing. Just like it didn't matter to me what every other 15 year old was doing when you were 15.  It only maters to me what *I* do or anyone living in my home does.  If my adult child decided he/she didn't want to conform...he/she can move out and make his/her own rules.<br>  <br>  **EDIT  By the way...the phrase "adult teen" is contradictory.  You can' t be both, I'm afraid.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I think if I decide to go to a in state college I'll live with them, and I'm sure they wouldn't make me do much. I'm sure I would still babysit my brother from time to time and I would have to do everything I do now *which I'm not gonna lie isn't a lot* OR I would start paying rent. and I would have to tell them if I'm coming home for the night or not.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I think my rules would change a lot if they were in college. It's better than having to pay additional money for their housing on campus. It really depends on the way the child turns out. if he's got a good head on his shoulders then I'd be really lenient but if he's screwing up and wasting my money...I'd be harsher.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	As long is there is no disruption caused by his actions. He's free to do as he will.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	under my roof under my rules. as long as my son was acting like an adult and calling to let me know "hey mom im going to stay out tonight see you tomorrow love you, i will have my cell on" i wouldnt give him a curfew. I wouldnt let his girlfriend sleep over i dont think, unless they had been dating for a LONG time and i REALLY liked her. i wouldnt have him tramping in the house at 3 am drunk off his ***. if he came home drunk and he drove i would take his car away from him and he would be in some deep shiz. i think that if he is going to drink then he needs to call and tell me "mom im going to stay out tonight, ive had some/going to have some to drink. so n so has my keys and my cell is on. love ya". and of course, if he ended up calling wanting me to come get him at any hour i would be there.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	If they pay some sort of rent, then no. They can do what they like as long as it doesn't disrupt my life - i.e. no parties until 3:00 am, no coming home drink, etc.<br>  <br>  If they don't pay rent, then yes. Either move out or listen to the rules. As for punishment, I don't know what would be appropriate. It would depend on the severity of what just happened. <br>  <br>  If you're really an adult, you can live on campus or in your own apartment.|`|AA12221392	well I will be experience this here very soon, as my daughter will be turning 18 and be starting college and living at home. <br>  <br>  We have already had this discussion, so that she can prepare if this is really what she wants to do. I have told her my house rules for her as a adult child (still my child) .<br>  <br>  I would not give her a curfew, but I have already explained that she has to respect the fact that we still have smaller children home, and that her actions do protray to them as she is the older sister, the role model as big sis. So there is no overnight stays for boyfriends (never unless she is married, will I allow a boy to stay and sleep with her, maybe stay on the couch if it is a need to, but that is it.) I would hope that she has enough respect that she wouldn't come in at 3am.<br>  <br>  I would not punish her for doing adult things, because she would be a adult. But the fact is they would have some kinda of rules in the house just as all members of the family have per say rules that we don't intude on each others privacy, we respect each other, and we all help out each other as a family. Like I said there is other younger children , just below her by a couple of years, so she can still be adult, but knowing that even as a adult that there is just somethings that her brother and sister aren't old enough for and I would not allow for them to be doing so they don't need to be seeing it from her.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	In a nutshell, YES, my house, my rules.  Now let's face it, our 18 year old is responsible and has never given us a reason not to trust him, so there will be allowances for that, but if he wants to do all things adult, then he's going to have to be an adult, and support himself! LOL  THAT is the incentive and motivation to get them independent and OUT of the door and living on their own.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	My parents did...I lived with them till I was about 18 and a half (I had a job and paid rent) and I wasn't allowed out till past 11pm and If I came home having had even one pint of Guinness they'd go crazy...lol.<br>  <br>  I don't know what I'll be like with my teen yet...I suppose so long as they are courteous and don't come in at 3am vomiting in the hallway and waking everyone up I wouldn't mind...|`|G4qP2gATaa	Well if I still lived at my mom's house while going to school after 18 (I don't), I wouldn't have to pay rent or anything, and she would pretty much let me do anything... the only thing is I would still have to tell her where I'm going and such.|`|Qiwkbevsaa	Well i think if they are living under your roof they should<br>  obey your rules, but if they are 18 years an older<br>  they should be able to go out an do what they want<br>  as long as they respect your house an don't mess<br>  ur house up.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	If my kids live with me after they turn 18 they will still have rules and yes there will be a curfew. It's my house and they will need to go by my rules.
EMKuBql8aa	No, you don't need ot have children. Some people are very fullfilled and happy without and that's ok. To each it's own right?<br>  <br>  As for a sin, most religions do not see it as a sin. But the only one I can think of that puts children into the heaven equation is LDS. <br>  <br>  Don't have children if you choose not to, go travel instead, lol.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	Absolutely not.  Having children or not is a choice, not a must.  A lot of couples struggle financially even without kids, how are they going to afford raising children?  Also, some people just couldn't have kids, does that mean they can't get marry?|`|K7H1zrCbaa	No way.<br>  <br>  I want to get married, but i have no desire to have children.  I'm a teacher.  I get to take care of and teach 23 different children everyday.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It depends on your relgion, and how closely you adhere to its tenets.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	Absolutely not.  A man and a woman get married to show their devotion to one another, period.  If children fit that equation, that's great, but if not, that's more than fine, too.  Procreating is a matter of personal choice and nobody, especially some girl on Facebook has the right to tell you otherwise.  That girl has no idea what God wants and if she really believes in "Him", she should know better than to put words in "His" mouth.  It annoys me how people always use "God" as a way to force their own agenda and beliefs onto other people.|`|bS4MyL5raa	I think that God wants you to be happy. He has a purpose for each and every person and he knows what every person can handle. If you will not be happy with children then you shouldn't have them just to have them. That is not fair to you or to them. No one will be happy. God is a loving God. It is NOT a sin if you don't have children. I have never read anything in the bible (Gods word) about it being a sin. Don't listen to this girl and don't worry about it. I hope this helps.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	It's not a sin. While that's a reason many people do get married, a lot of people get married for love. I know a few couples who are in their 50s-60s and have never had children and were just as happy. Some people are meant to have children and some aren't.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	No i don't think you HAVE you have children if you are married. But i think it is selfish to marry someone who wants children, without telling them beforehand that you don't. (Not saying this is your case but i've seen this happen)|`|Yl93lP1laa	It would be more of a sin to have children you don't want and then neglect them.  If you don't want children, then please don't have them.  There is nothing saying that marriage= children.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	I don't think it is a sin I think it would be more sinful to make someone think that god was going to judge them because they did not want children for one reason or the other.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	I always find this line of reasoning suspect:<br>  <br>  If God wants us to get married to have kids, what does he do with infertile couples??? I mean, according to dogma He's the one who made them infertile....<br>  <br>  <br>  Should they get divorced????|`|sAbah6dTaa	no... not everyone are baby people. i wouldn't consider it a sin if you didnt.<br>  <br>  she sounds craazy!|`|I7QcHkLFaa	It is not required that you have kids to be married.<br>  As long as the person you marry agrees that they do not want children either.<br>  It is not a sin to not have children the bible does say to go forth and mullitply but it does not say that if you don't you can't go through the pearly gates.|`|Xu5BtID1aa	You do not have to reproduce! If you don't want kids, then don't! That person is just being stupid!!! I am married and I want kids, but my best friend just got married and isn't really interested in having any of her own, at least no where near in the close future!|`|5rdiZvYEaa	No, It could be for many reasons. Medical,Financial,etc. My sister and her husband cannot have kids due to medical reasons- so they adopted.|`|0f3d5635f916732a3a43b98496988bcfaa	No if you get married it does not mean you have to have children. There are many married couples without children either because they choose it that way or just cant have children.|`|IJnP9oJqaa	No - everyone does what is best for them.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Many Christians believe this because God told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply the earth.  He told this to Adam and Eve, the first humans, it was not a commandment to everyone.  Children are always described as blessings in the Bible.  I think the main thing if you do not desire to have children is to make sure the person you marry also does not want children, and discuss birth control options that are morally sound with your beliefs (do not prevent a fertilized egg from implanting, etc.).|`|gx4s68s8aa	No- Unless you have religious beliefs that are against birth control, then there is no reason you have to have kids if you get married.<br>  <br>  Being married is about finding that one person that you want to be true and faithful to and share your life with forever.  That doesn't necessarily mean that children have to be a part of that equation.  As long as your spouse agrees with your views on not having children, then there shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  I think on of the worst mistakes a person can make is to have children on purpose that they really don't want.  So if you don't want kids that is fine.  Everyone is different.  But don't feel pressure to have children that you really don't want.<br>  <br>  I was married for almost 10 years without children. I eventually changed my mind, but not everyone does and that is O.K.
NFt3h7dHaa	The pink stuff definitely isn't good for pregnant women--call your doctor ASAP.    Hope you feel better and everything is okay!|`|n926icjvaa	I would say you should DEFINITELY call the hospital.  You could be putting your baby's life at risk.  Let's say you have food poisoning...that can affect your baby.  Do you really want to take that chance.  I'm not trying to panic you, but I think it's better to be safe than sorry.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I dont think think the pink stuff is safe when you are pregnant, try taking some medimusal or talk to your doc and see if they can recomend anything.
sjERiFeNaa	i was told by my dr to use extra protection for the first two months of the takng the pill. ur body needs time to adjust to it.|`|AA10186411	I would definitely use a condom for at least a month.  But I'm sure you know its not 100% effective even when taken properly, so I would still suggest using a condom until you are ok with having a baby again should the birth control fail.  And Congrats on the new baby :)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Use a condom....rather safe than pregnant again so soon.  Congratulations on your baby!  :)|`|JaiepxZ2aa	birth control doesnt work  having lots of sex works|`|xde0uuuBaa	Use a condom, definitely. It takes a couple of weeks for birth control hormones to get completely in your system. Hope this helps!|`|LSk1FUCGaa	definitely play it safe for a month, birth control takes 2-3 weeks to get all the hormones through your body anyways. just a little fyi... i dont know what method you are taking but nuva ring is a life saver! good luck and congrats on the new baby!|`|NQuPNHPyaa	Use a condom.. the birth control doesn't kick in for about 2 months.|`|QdiZCKQBaa	BE ON THE SAFE SIDE!! I WOULD BE EXTRA SAFE AND USE IT. IT WONT HURT TO BE SAFE FOR A MONTH.
AA11206135	I know you're fed up and ready but obviously your baby isn't... Don't do anything hasty. If there is a medical reason for induction, leave it up to your doctor... (mom of five)|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Use caution when trying natural methods to begin your labor, particularly herbs and nipple stimulation. The uterus can become hyperstimulated, meaning that it'll get too little rest between contractions. This can cause the baby to receive less oxygen, resulting in fetal heart rate slowing. Before trying any of these techniques, you should discuss them with your practitioner.<br>  <br>  I know I didn't answer your question because you should discuss it with your doctor!|`|jcXSNjowaa	those are dangerous!<br>  <br>  i settled for evening primose oil.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you're already having contractions, I would try sex or nipple stimulation instead. While some have tried black cohosh for labor, it's not really known how safe it is. Especially since there are no indications for usage on the bottle. Because it's an unregulated herb that could probably cross the placenta, I would avoid it, just in case. It's also been reported that it can increase the risk of severe bleeding during labor.
o2YHnKXiaa	Yes right after you have a baby your period is really wacko seriously my periods are still trying to get back to the way they used to be and I had my son 6 months ago. It's normal trust me.|`|D3iXIgeNaa	It could take up to a year for you to get back on a regular schedule. Don't worry about it. Myself it took about 1 1/2 for it to be normal again.|`|dFo0k3zDaa	yes, i just got my first one in January and my son was born last feb. and i had 2  periods in january... i took so many preg test this year...  but never pregnant again... just getting back to normal takes some time|`|dOEnB1AVaa	Its normal it happened to me and I was breast feeding.  I was told  I might have a couple of months without period but it came just a month after I had my daughter and then the next time I was due it was a very late one.  I had a test and it was  positive although a very faint positive line showed.  Then after a while my period came and it was a false positive.  So don't worry even if you have a missed one in between its just your body adjusting but do take a pregnancy test just in case.  Take care|`|YENiEvoJaa	I'm surprised you had a period at all only a month after having a baby. With formula feeding it does happen more often I suppose. Your doctor should have explained to you that your periods would be very irregular for what could be many months even if you're not breastfeeding.
kogsyGAPaa	Considering that you're on the pill (you only missed three days)<br>  and he pulled out, you are unlikely pregnant. Yes, pulling out isn't the most reliable form of bc but I think all the factors combined makes it less likely. My bf and I always pulled out (I was never on birth control) and we never got pregnant...But he was also very good at it, some men might not know as well or have less control than others.<br>  Hope all goes well for you!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Pulling out doesn't prevent pregnancy, and yes you can get pregnant on the pill, especially if you miss your pill.|`|s1utniuvaa	Well there is a chance you are pregnant. You should go buy a test.<br>  <br>  <br>  I few days I took my pill at like 11 at night instead of 9 am like I had been and I missed 1 day and now I have twins on the way.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	it sounds like your not pregnant that light brown discharge happens when you miss pills its not implantation bleeding or anything<br>  <br>  take a test but i doubt it make sure you take your pills on time otherwise you can always get the injection that way you wont have to remember|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's a possibility you are. Skipping pills isn't smart. If you did it on purpose all I can say is were you trying to get pregnant? I've gotten pregnant on the pill before.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I missed 3 days of pills and then doubled up and got pregnant.|`|ckgiPMm4aa	That's how I got pregnant for my daughter.<br>  congratulations your more then likely pregnant,<br>  wait another week or two then go take a test.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	Why even be on the pill if you're not going to take it responsibly?  And then stupidly have unprotected sex on top of that?  And then ask if you might be pregnant....|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	yes, people have become pregnant while on birth control so not using it correctly would increase your chances.|`|BEkHHkataa	i missed 1 day on the pill an now am pregnant
krQiDGCHaa	I operate a home day care, and I had a child in my care who was 4 years old and 62lbs.  He was HUGE, and not even tall for his age.<br>  <br>  The doctors constantly told his mother to stop feeding him so much and try to improve his diet, but she never really did anything about it.  When he was with me, he would get healthy foods and normal toddler portions, however his mother let him eat a LOT.<br>  <br>  It's not necessarily that he ate a lot of junk because he didn't, but she would just feed him more than a 4 year old should be eating.  She'd let him snack whenever he wanted, and instead of fruits and veggies he would have crackers or something -- which is fine, but NOT fine if you're going to let him snack multiple times between meals!  Also, for dinner and stuff he'd eat like a packet of easy mac, and 2 hot dogs.  No fruits, no veggies, and he was allowed as much of the food as he wanted.<br>  <br>  A lot of people don't realize how small a toddler's stomach is!  Good question to ask to help raise some awareness!  Bad eating habits taught at such a young age really stick with children and typically, overweight kids become overweight adults.  Nothing wrong with a couple extra pounds, but obesity is very unhealthy for you and causes numerous health risks!|`|Z1IYG0vlaa	None of my sons are overweight, but my nephew is in the 95th percentile for height and the 125th percentile for weight, or vice versa.  I can't remember which way my sister in law told me it was.<br>  He weighs more than my 5 year old who weighs 34 1/2 lbs and my 2 year old who weighs 27 1/4lbs.  My nephew weighs 37lbs (the last time I knew, which was 2 months ago) and is only 22 months old.  The doctor's assume something is medically wrong with him, because the tested him for ms without telling or asking my sister in law.<br>  <br>  I unfortunately believe he is autistic, but who am I to say.  I just see alot of the tendencies in him of an autistic child.  The tantrums out of no where, no verbal communication, no Speech at all for that matter, alot of grunts, flapping of the hands or arms, hitting, pinching, biting, grabbing really hard and other little things that I find weird.  He has actually grabbed me so hard that he drew blood.  Not only that but he smacked me in my face and left a hand print.<br>  I think that he is autistic or very aggressive.  Either way its not good.<br>  <br>  As far as my sister in law doing anything about it, YEAH RIGHT, when someone can tell me how to get her to listen to anyone, and someone can tell me how to tell her I think she should bring up autisum to her dr., then maybe she will do something about it.  But until then she will keep telling everyone that there is nothing wrong with her son.  Unfortunately for a new mom that is always true, until it is too late.<br>  I just wish I could tell her how I feel and see things about my nephew that make me think he is autistic.  Any advice, you can email me.  Thank you.<br>  <br>  Thank you for posting this question, I have had that on my chest for awhile and needed to clear it.|`|DvrpBX4saa	My child isn't in this situation, but my sister was considered "overweight" by doctors at the age of 4. They guided my mother towards giving her a healthier diet (the girl loved hot dogs!) and with their help, my sister was able to slim down a bit. Unless the doctor becomes alarmed and tells you directly to change the child's diet, the  extra chub might just be ok to deal with for now. <br>  You should always be teachign you child to eat healthy and be active, though.|`|PCK5bJt3aa	Our pediatrician has not told us our daughter is overweight. She has always been off the charts in height and weight.At first it made me feel strange to have such big girl, she is literally a head taller than most kids her age group. She just turned 2 and weighs 36 lbs and measures over 3 ft is height.<br>  <br>  -To the mother who thinks all children who are bigger are fed McDonald's, please don't make assumptions it comes across as very ignorant. Your child being thin is affected by his activity and diet but genes play a HUGE factor in weight regulation, so don't go tapping yourself on the shoulder just yet! Some children are just bigger than others, regardless of their diet and activity level. My daughter is very active and eats healthy and about 60% percent of her diet is strictly organic, the rest we make sure has no additives, nitrates,low sodium etc. Food is expensive anywhere, we spend around $600 for groceries for our family of 3. We can afford to eat healthy but many families can't so yes often times the dollar menu is a more economical solution for those struggling families. I don't blame the families so much as the government, the European Union won't accept our exports of meat and dairy b/c of all the hormones we pump in it. What about the US corn sub-sudies...almost everything contains high fructose corn syrup! Healthy food is just more expensive, and sadly it is a luxury for many!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My children are skinny! My four year old is almost 5 and is 38 pounds, and my son is 2 almost 3 and is 30 pounds. I feed them healthy things. I live in the eastern part of the USA and i spend about 250-350 a week on groceries.
Xi5Jno6haa	Q2 says that no one should walk around deformed and dumb and yet he still walks around dumb and deformed!     Anyway, I have a child with down's...I would be lying if I said that it wasn't difficult. My son was born with down's, we found out with the triple screen that it was a possibility. Quite honestly I was devastated. I thought I did something to cause this. I was offered to do the amino and I opted not to because it would not change my decision to have him. So what then happened was the dr offered to do a more intense sonogram and measure the femure and to check for other soft signs of down's, everything seemed normal, his femure was slightly short but with his father and I not being very tall people, it just didn't seem like anything that unusual. So, I didn't find out for sure until he was born and they did some blood work. Now my son was my first child and to be completely honest I didn't have anything to compare to.  He was perfectly normal to me! The only difference at that time was it took him a little longer to make it to his milestones, which made those moments that much more special. There has never been a dull moment since he's been in my life, and he is always teaching me something new! I later on (4 years later) had another child who was typical developing and I was high risk for a down's baby with both of my kids because of my age. You don't have to get the amnio and I know you want to be prepared but you can read books on down syndrome and talk to other parents of children with down's. How much longer do you have until your due date? Whenever you want to talk about it you can email me. Good luck and God bless.    Your chances being 1 in 102 just means that out of 102 babies born to women the same age as you there will be 1 baby born with down's. There are so many resources for parents of children with special needs. My son receives occupational and speech therapies and used to receive physical therapy but his gross motor skills have improved so much that that is just on a consult basis now. I don't really know if there is an answer on how you cope, you just do. You do whatever you need to do for your child and there are great resources out there for families.|`|QGuxbItCaa	We had a test and aborted. No one needs the life long responsibility of a deformed, dumb child.|`|a7ciEFgvaa	Love your baby and do what you need to do to assure yourself that he/she will have a happy life.      Join clubs, meatings, talk to other parents and doctors but the main thing is always make sure your child knows you live him/her and will always be their shelter should they need it.  But don't baby them or set the bar extremely low, they aren't dumb, they have feelings and they can cry.  Love and knowledge,    Happy future.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	OK first_ dont listen to the jack*** who posted about dumb babies.  People who aren't responsible enough to care for a chanelleged child should not mulitpy in any means.    I had a few tests done and right now it looks as though there might be a chance for downs syndrome.  Yes, everyone wants a normal and healthy child but things cant work out the same for everyone.  I have been trying to think everything will be ok.  but at the same time I am also looking into doctors that specialize in helping children with needs.    Good luck.    What are your chances btw?|`|OWReYgV5aa	What were your indicators...blood test?  Ultrasound?  I just had the same scare...my ultrasound showed up with 2 indicators of DS before xmas...I waited on the amnio due to the slight risk of miscarriage.  I had another ultrasound that still showed one indicator two weeks later, then another ultraound 3 weeks later and everything cleared up.  Just because you have tests come back high risk, doesn't mean you defintiley are going to have a child with DS.  I completely understand the worrying part, though..if you want the amnio, they are pretty safe as long as you have a very trusted Dr. doing the procedure.    I was convinced that if my child had DS...I would be appreciate of him either way.  I did alot of research and so many DS children thrive and go onto live happy lives.  Look up Christopher Burke, he was on the show "life goes on" and has a great life, and there are alot of ds role models out there who are happy and productive.  Good luck to you, hang in there...everything will work out.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	i am high risk too. not for down syndrome but the think it could be turners syndrome or encephalocele. i will get an amniocentesis at the end of the month and if thats negative for turners syndrome they will do an MRI to see my babies brain but they told me i could miscarry at anytime. I'm so nervous because the fluid stuff they are seeing is in my childs central nervous system which is not good at all it will probably be born with so many handicaps and may die after birth. im not sure what to do. i know this sounds bad but id rather miscarry than have my baby possibly die in my arms afterbirth since the condition is so bad its a scary but very possible possibility!|`|C2sZREuAaa	There are human service agencies that help with early supports.  (Example Easter Seals)     -respite care   -social workers to work with & your child   (occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy)    Just give this child your love.  That's all the child needs.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i have worked with handicapped kids for 13 yrs downs are my favorite ! so sweet and smart  i worked with a gals about 7 yrs about that got married to her bf Remember no days they can do stuff we dont put them in hidding anyway . they can work , love and live like we do|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	You do not need to have an amniocentesis which is risky to your baby.  They can tell through blood work and then also the 20 week ultra sound has markers.  Either way, like you said, you will love your baby no matter what.  Unless your doctor gives you a positive from a test than no need to worry and prepare yourself.    What did they base your 1 in 102 chance off of?|`|5EiShLZZaa	I was 8 when my sister was born with Down's Syndrome.  It was not easy, but she is the most loving, compassionate human being on the planet, as most Down's are.  We were fortunate that she was born healthy, no heart defects, etc...she has had chronic ear infection (which many babies do), she had underdeveloped muscles which is pretty typical, so she went through physical therapy as a toddler, speech therapy through grade school, and is now a junior in high school, where she takes occupational lined courses and has a job coach preparing her to get her first job.  My parents found a support group through the hospital, they got the best info on raising a special needs from parents that were doing it.  There are many books that can help you prepare for the chance that you may have a baby with Down's...I would hit your local library and just do some reading.  Did you have the quad screen?  If so, just remember that 97% of positives are FALSE positives!  I didn't do the screen with either pregnancy.  The amnio can give you a more definitive answer, but it is risky.  Also, if you haven't been referred to a genetic counselor by your OB, ask for one, they can give you more info and your real risk in having a child with Down's.  Good luck momma
TWYkVjiJaa	been wondering this myself whens the best time to change,a friend made a passing comment the other day how i should get one of them cups,but myself to thought was a bit soon,as i also enjoy them times my little girl 7 and half months likes playing with my hair while feeding which is cute,and some days as also have 3yr old twins and a 10yr old it can be the only time we get together! lol i also think mine would be useless yet anyway as when give her anything to hold lasts about a min before dropping! . though on the other side i got in a bad position with the twins who were nearly 2 before gave up there bottles! which is bad, think as they never took to dummy's used bottle as comfortor instead? just don't feel pressured do it when you and her and are ready? :-) as you have baby same age, may be able to help me with my question ?|`|f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	OH gosh no, i give mine a bottle until they were 2 years old, its up to you and what you want to do for your bub, there is no harm, people have concern when giving juice in bed and then it sits on their teeth and causes decay but milk in the bottle is fine, just relax you can do what ever you feel comfortable with, never mind what everyone else does, keep having your special time, you will know when she is ready.|`|Gem96NQyaa	As with any habit, the sooner you break it, the easier it will be.  There's nothing wrong with weaning early or with weaning late.  It just tends to be a little easier before they get too accustomed to it.<br>  <br>  Weaning also takes time with many kids.  It can take several months to get them off the bottle completely.|`|qicxk5GMaa	I think probably the younger they are the easier it is... I think if they're older they get more attached to it.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	No.  I'm not...I love spending that time with my son for his bottle feedings.  I too hold him on my lap for them...and high chair for solids.  I have tried to introduce a sippy cup from 7 months(he is almost 9 months now) but I keep that just for supper.  I'm not rushing to wean him.|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's their right to just as it's your right not to. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  My son is 10 and a half months old and has been weaned from bottles onto sippy cups for a few weeks now. He was independent anyway, though, and rarely let me hold him while he had a bottle so it wasn't a big deal to me. We bond in other ways.<br>  <br>  My mom told me that I flat out refused the bottle at around 7 months so she HAD to transition me to sippy cups or else I wouldn't take any formula. So, for some, it's a must and not just because they want to.<br>  <br>  ETA: I'm sorry, how am I coming across as being angry? I didn't think I was... sorry if it appeared that way.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I am not weaning yet and my son is 10 months. I have offered a few sippys of formula to him now and then but he will only drink a few ounces. He does drink water/juice from a sippy with no problem though. I don't think he is ready for the big transition though.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	you wean when you want to! most babies are off the bottle by a year, but i have seen kids on the bottle longer. your the mamma, do it when you and your little one are comfortable :)|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	no harm in wating but it is a good time to iunroduce and start to slowly take away the bottle that way hell be done with it by 13 months|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	most of the people start weaning and aren't fuly weaned until about a year. they offer cups at 6 or so months to they have the hang of it before a year

My baby does the same thing, and it really warms my husband's heart and helps him bond with his baby.|`|9aRvkwLyaa	Same with me!!! Daddy's lil boy!!!<br>  <br>  The doctor/midwife told me, if you told feel the baby, then drink a cold-icy glass of water, within seconds he/she should start kicking..

The reason for this is because everytime my partner spoke, he seemed to stop kicking! My partner got quite paranoid about this, but it doesnt happen anymore. He loves his daddy now and kicks when he hears his voice!<br>  Baby also kicks like crazy when I play the song 'Tuesday's Gone' by Metallica, and also kicks when I'm shouting at the TV when the rugby's on!|`|qicxk5GMaa	usually before bed I have a snack since I've been waking up starving in the middle of the night... the snack tends to be something sweet like frozen waffles or a few cookies... as soon as I lay down she decides to have a party in there!  it's so funny.  or when were laying in bed talking or laughing it's so cute cuz she'll start kicking... it's like she wants to join in on the conversation.  I'm almost 28 wks with my first- a little girl   :-)|`|sessNZ7zaa	When i was expecting my first there were no real patterns or obvious things that set him off kicking... just quite random really!

I had alot of pressure "down south" in the entire last trimester with my son my doc said he was just sitting in  low. He was also a big baby 9lbs so maybe that had something to do with it. I think it's normal, if your having contractions though ask your doc to check you. congrats!|`|PkjZA2o9aa	yes, its completely normal. i hated the feeling felt like my baby was just gonna slide on out, haha i wish it was that easy. its just her head is getting down to get ready to come out.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	It might be the baby putting pressure on your bladder as the baby grows your skin stretches. If it makes you feel any better go see your doctor or talk to her on the phone.
xRZ1PRZwaa	I've gone through both, and if I had a choice, I'd choose natural, no epidural and 100 hours of painful labour before a section again.<br>  <br>  I had an emergency section because my son was wedged and labouring into my hip. So, we had no choice. I found the section to be the most terrifying experience of my life. I was mortally afraid for my baby and for myself. I can't tell you how horrified I was at the thought that I might die, not for fear of dying, but for fear of being away from my children and husband. My son aspirated during the surgery and so had to spend a week in the NICU. Having a sick newborn is something no parent should experience.<br>  <br>  I am still in awe of women who choose this risk for themselves and their babies because they prefer not to have a vaginal birth. I really don't understand this school of thinking. I mean, it's their choice, and I'm not going to judge, but the reality is that a c-section is fraught with REAL risk to mommy and baby, and often (but not always) ends with a baby in the NICU and not in his/her mother's arms.<br>  <br>  I've heard of women opting for c-sections because they don't want their vagina to stretch and ruin sex for their husbands. I've heard of it because they think it will be easier. I've heard of it because they don't want to be embarrassed having a vaginal delivery. I just don't understand how any mom could put themselves AND their baby at risk because of these sorts of fears.<br>  <br>  Trust me, the vagina will be fine with some kegals, recovering from a section is a trillion times more difficult and painful than the pain and recovery from a vaginal delivery, and embarrassment? Try holding your swollen, painful belly up in the air (even if you're skinny girls!) so someone can wash under it because you can't feel your abdomen anymore because the nerves have all been cut. Or, try frequent gas and painful bowel movements because you're just not the same after your major abdominal surgery. Or, having someone help you get out of bed because of the pain.<br>  <br>  Now, these are my experiences. Other women may have had similar ones, or some very differently from me. I understand that, my point is, I suppose, that before opting for an elective section, please consider that it is usually not such a rosy alternative.<br>  <br>  A vaginal birth is painful (for many, but not all), safe pain relievers are available, and you're there to hold and love our baby immediately. It's safer for mom, safer for baby and the recovery is infinitely faster and less painful than that of a section.<br>  <br>  Just my thoughts on the matter! Great question!<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  I agree with Pippin - it should be an informed decision.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Um, c-sections are way more intense than a vaginal birth and a lot more can go wrong. You can hemorrhage out, you get a huge scar, its major surgery. If I was scared of delivery I certainly wouldn't want to complicate it with major surgery.<br>  <br>  Most doctor won't schedule a c-section just for fun.|`|vue9NOhYaa	What do you mean, what do I think of them?  <br>  <br>  Usually a woman who has a c-section has a medical reason to have one. (Few doctors will do c-sections just because mom asks, and no insurance companies will pay for them. So all our friends who 'want' c-sections for their boyfriends will find themselves sadly dissappointed when they mention their request  to their doctors.) <br>  <br>  I think that mothers should be educated about their choices -- but whatever EDUCATED choice a mother makes is right for her.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	i had a c-section with my first (emergency) this time i'm hoping for natural but i don't know about the "no drugs" bit, i know i don't really want to go for an epidural but, i'm not too sure what to expect.<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed i can have a VBAC but will find out on weds when i see my conultant.<br>  <br>  Personally, i believe each to their own really.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	if they have to stay "tight" so they're boyfriends or husbands don't leave them, they are with the wrong dude. <br>  <br>  and like the others have said... you can't just ASK for a ceserean... it has to be medically relevant.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	why does it matter.  your not better than anyone.|`|AA12345219	Though I don't personally agree with it, I don't blame people who are worried about the healing process down there. I'll admit I'm scared! Not necessarily FOR my husband, but just the pain in general. Not that a c-section is a walk in the park, but I've experienced abdominal surgery before and know what to expect, whereas I have no idea for vaginal distress/tearing/cutting. Anyway, though I don't think people should undergo major surgery unnecessarily, I just wanted to point out that I can see where those people are coming from! Childbirth is natural, but that doesn't make it less nerve-wracking!|`|eb9Mptu3aa	Why should it matter what anyone thinks about c-section moms? My first child was born via emergency c-section after a natural birth was planned. Since I had complications, my second child was born by planned c-section. The ONLY reason my doctor would plan a c-section was for MEDICAL reasons. Besides, it's not birth that makes the muscles not as tight, it's the weight of the baby being supported so long. Anyone concerned about becoming "loose" should learn how to do Kegal exercises.|`|7e25ab13e48dd8ca1039f649017bf1d0aa	I've never heard of a doctor scheduling a c section just because. I don't think insurance would cover a just because c section. <br>  I was hoping for a c section. I was not looking forward to all the pain and pushing. I ended up having one because my baby was breech. I'm no less of a mother because of it. Are the mothers that adopt even less than a mother that has a c section?|`|2DM7MaXyaa	people who get csections are actually more of woman if you look at it like that. they risk bleeding out and hemorraging. Csections arent scheduled for the hell of it all though celebrities and some of my wealthy family memebers have done this and its dumb. better to have vaginal. thats what i did. good luck on the no drugs thing haha. and actually this may be TMI but myself and other i know were actually tighter after having a vaginal birth and being sewed back up!|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I had both of my children at home without any medications because that's what is right for me. I don't understand scheduled VANITY <br>  c-sections but what a woman does with her body is not my business so I just keep my mouth shut about it. Everybody has a differently pain threshold. It doesn't make them better or worse then me, just different.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I say more power to you. If you think you can handle it, then go ahead. My sister started out with no meds, and eventually she did take an analgesic to take the edge off a little, when she had fianlly reached 10cm.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	had to have a planned c-section for my baby (preeclampsia) it was only planned about 4 days in advance and they said if i dilated or effaced at all they would consider trying induction but because of his size i would just end a an E c-section. either way i had wanted a 100% natural birth and i didn;t get it i even had a back up for if i needed a c-section that i would 100% have to be awake and that didn;t happen either. I'm just saying don't get to into one plan because you'll be so upset if something goes wrong. now people not wanting to stretch they're vagina is a stupid reason. though i don't see many girls doing it. i can see them deciding on one if they have a big baby (9lbs +) and it made seem like "i don't want to deal with the pain!" but most women i know who've done this it was more of a "i don't want it to get stuck and have problems delivering. honestly if someone wants to elect a c-section to save that part go right ahead! and when you feel the pain form healing well thats your lesson!|`|wxImZRssaa	I fully intended to have a natural vaginal birth. I went in for a check up at 36 weeks. Also to discuss my options during labour. <br>  <br>  Just after I finished telling the midwife how I didn't want any pain relief when I was in labour, and I wanted it all to be completely natural, she examined me.<br>  <br>  She found that my baby was still breech, and that she was unlikely to turn, and that I'd have to have a c-section.<br>  <br>  I was Absolutely devastated. I really felt less of a woman because of it. I've got over that now. Its not giving birth that makes you a mother, its about being a good mother to your baby. You can be that no matter how your baby enters the world.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why anyone would choose a c-section rather than giving birth vaginally. But I wouldn't think someone less of a mother or a woman for opting to have a section.<br>  <br>  A c-section isn't easy, it is major surgery, it takes a long time to recover from.
MQ34YW28aa	yes it's a sign of labor. you probably want to start keeping tract of them. Write down when you start having them and then write down when they stopped, so that way you know if they are getting longer and more of a pattern. Then that's real labor. Right now you might be having braxon hicks. I had the period cramps for about 3 weeks before I had my son and it's awful :( and it will only get worse. I definitely recommend the epidural when you get to the hospital. I don't know what I would of done without mine with all those contractions. OUCH|`|yKZqJsgSaa	they are pre labor cramps there is a term for them but i cant remember ...anyhow its just your body getting ready for your impending birth...if they start coming every 3-5 mins go straight to hospital.  ...ps i have two kids so im pretty sure about this|`|9c2382dc21c9e3bda7ce8d972c920a34aa	It's possible what you are experiencing are Braxton Hicks contractions. They do prepare your body for labor. My first labor started out as irregular menstrual cramps and eventually got steady and worked their way up higher. Good luck!|`|aWkp6AJOaa	make sure you are not dehydrated.  if they start drink a big glass, like 32oz, of water.  this will usually help them go away unless you are in true labor & then you will be unable to function while they are happening.  good luck & it won't be too much longer & you will have a beautiful baby in your arms.
VUKDrd2taa	They say its not good to use, but i wouldnt stress to much if you've stopped now, i was using clean and clear acne control kit which i found out was bad to use during pregnancy, so i stopped and my doctor said everything is fine.<br>  good luck!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	If you are concerned, you can have an alpha feta protein test done, via blood work.. Or you can do an amniocentesis scan. Both of these tests are done for birth defects screening. I have heard to also avoid acne products with accutane in them. Call your doctor and tell him/her your concerns.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Go to your doctors ask about it. bring it with you so they can look at it. I'm sure its fine, nothing like Neutrogena can really harm you. Its suppose to be healthy and stuff.<br>  <br>  Talk to you doctor. I'm sorry for your depression.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes|`|90Pb6eooaa	If you've read that then stop using it until you can contact your doctor to validate it.  I hven't heard that yet, but I'm gonna stop using it now until I find out from my doctor.  Good Luck and God Bless.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	It's fine to do. I have a acne system like that one too for the pregnancy breakouts.|`|AA10458750	The benzoyl peroxide is the safer of the two. They don't recommend salicyic acid bc it is in the aspirin family and can penetrate under the skin. A product containing less than 2% shouldn't do serious damage. Most of the problems with babies are a gene thing and not from wrong doign of the mom.
NFt3h7dHaa	A lawyer would know much better than any of us about your odds, especially in your state.    However, it does sound like you have your son's best interests at heart and can provide a more stable home for him than his mother, which to me sounds like you do have a good shot of getting custody if you want it.    Good luck!|`|QikvnTnqaa	It sounds like it's plausable. The kids are old enough thought that the court will ask them who they want to be with. I would say that 7-8 moves in 5 years is kinda outragous, but there could be a logical explanation (giving her reasonable doubt because I don't know her). I would try if you think it's best for the kids.
oXzHvsBpaa	Well I had a big baby shower. 2 of them so I got a lot of what I needed. But there were so many things that we still needed to get. I think we have spent maybe around 3,000 or so. Including Toys, New Stroller Car Seat combo, Wipes, Diapers, Formula, ect.<br>  <br>  ETA: I should say that our son is almost 4 months old and we have spent that much so far. It will be close to maybe 8,000 at the end of his first year.

i8Ch743Laa	They've found that theres no links in asparatame and stuff wrong with your baby. A lot of stuff has asparatame in it. They've found no links,I drink diet cola.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	There hasn't been extensive research done on effects of aspartame on babies in utero. But it does cross over the placenta, and aspartame is a chemically created sugar, that is harder to metabolize than regular sugar. Sometimes when your body encounters a chemical, it won't digest it... It will store it... And storage of chemical compounds can lead to masses of cell blockages... and that can cause cancer. But all this hasnt been proven. So I would just consume it in moderation. It's hard nowadays, everything you eat is full of chemicals...|`|fHgbL046aa	I went on this site Web MD and they talked about sweeteners. Some say its okay in moderation others have horrible stories on what can happen to your child if you consume to much. I use to use Splenda and because of what I read I bought regular sugar. I can't drink Crystal Light and some gum have aspartame. Must read the label for everything.|`|szE6NtO5aa	All I know is that aspartame IS approved for use in pregnancy. That is not to say the wisdom on the subject won't change in the future. <br>  <br>  Personally, I drank diet soda throughout 2 pregnancies in moderation and my kids are just fine. I would say just don't overdo it.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No it's not bad. Actually it's way better than sugar.|`|VmBT4Tlcaa	I wouldn't drink it.  I did however drink koolaid with stevia (a natural sweetener, no chemicals<name brand is Truvia>) and once in a while I would have a sugar free Jones soda made with splenda.  In the new "what to expect" it says stay away from asfultame potassium (asfultame K) completely (and it is in a LOT of stuff), cut out as much aspartame as possible and that splenda is ok.  The more you drink of aspartame now the more likely that your child will be allergic to it later!|`|psuaYJjAaa	I wonder the same thing: caffeine free diet pop. And what about Sugar-free Kool-Aid? Crystal Light? Anyone have any insight on these?|`|GxlkhRfoaa	My dr's told me absolutely no diet drinks of any kind.
0ksJVQ04aa	It primarily refers to the location.  But the location affects the severity of the spanking.  Woodsheds are typically small and private.  Someone taken to the woodshed will not attract sympathy or attention by crying because he is alone with his/her disciplinarian.  And if the spanking is by switch, the small space prevents running away or avoiding the punishment.|`|AA11046205	Possibly both, but mostly neither. It was literally taken and clearly understood in the past, but now it means not so simply, that someone is in  trouble, the location and severity varies greatly depending on many variables.|`|izJpnOONaa	location i think|`|1enIWBGnaa	It is a location!|`|AA11210211	just the location,which is horrid.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No idea, I don't beat my kids.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	I used to think it referred to the spanking with a shingle or slat of WOOD; but mostly it seems to refer to the location ... the relative privacy and all, whether the spanking is with something wooden, or whether it is with a belt or a razor strop or whatever.<br>  <br>  A trip to the woodshed ... the privacy is desirable but it still HURTS.  In the winter time the trip to the woodshed can be very cool, but well-warmed for the return trip to the house.<br>  .<br>  And if the backside is quite cool before the spanking then it usually seems to hurt more.<br>  .|`|rNvXWMOMaa	a woodshed is a shed for storing wood.<br>  In the olden days when spanking naughty children was the norm,<br>  dad used to take their sons to the wood shed for a fanny whacking.<br>  <br>  Girls were spared the shed.|`|GBAPvCheaa	The wood shed is often refereed to in American english as the place where bad things happen including corporal punishment and the burial of unwanted pregnancies created across ethnic lines.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Just the location.
eU5Eth2aaa	My mom is a pastry chef so I basically grew up in a bakery!  The icing that bakeries use on cakes is mostly composed of crisco and sugar.  The only time milk would be used in the frosting is if it was a Dulche De Leche cake or had a glaze type of icing which contains confectioner's sugar and milk.  Even then, the sugar acts as a preservative.  You have nothing to worry about!  Next time store the cake in the microwave or in the fridge to at least keep it fresh for longer.|`|vTfEYeKQaa	I wouldn't worry if I were you....think of the cakes sitting at the store, not refrigerated. They couldn't sell them if there was any risk of anything going bad by sitting out. More than likely the icing doesn't even have milk in it...mainly sugar and some sort of shortening/oil based product.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	well ur 37 weeks, the babys movement is going to go way down, becasue ur getting closer to ur due date.... its normal dont panic... and I dont think the cake would hurt ur baby, maybe it just gave it a little sugar rush and now hes coming down off of it...lol|`|ffAmoqFTaa	No everything will be alright, relax!  Congrats on your baby.|`|js2TUHFdaa	No, cake's don't generally need to be refrigerated. And any milk in the cake has already been cooked...If it was a storebought cake, the icing is fine. Think of the icing that you buy in tubs, that stuff can sit in your pantry for months and still be ok!|`|5yINCMjZaa	Im not expect on babies ( im only 15)i wouldnt of thought so  but if i was you i would go to the Docs and have it checked out just to be on the safe side,|`|jLLkSWyiaa	lol your jsut paranoid .. your fine .. many cakes sit out and are not refrigerated|`|5f924fded622dc36a19e4717813b7a9caa	umm no al is good|`|GxlkhRfoaa	NO i wouldn't worry about it.  If you are feeling fine then I believe you are fine.  You would be feeling sick if the baby was sick.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I think u are fine and I think ur baby is fine. EVERYTHING IS OKAY.. don't stress urself out too much. I don't think that it could make u sick from eating cake that was left out on the counter. I ate some cake the other day that wasn't in the frig and I am fine. u may just be getting pre baby jitters u have 2 weeks left of ur pregnancy. EVERYTHING is fine..<br>  <br>  and ur baby won't move alot because its so big and healthy that they don't have enough room to move.
vue9NOhYaa	I left my daughter in the car when I went to pay. (When she was a baby, pay-at-the-pump wasn't common.) <br>  <br>   She was always in clear view, (the front wall of the gas station was all glass)  I was gone less than a minute,  and there was NOTHING that could have happened to her that could not have also happened while I was standing outside the car pumping the gas. <br>  <br>  (Laws against leaving children unattended in cars do not apply to situations like this. And since I am not in a messy divorce/custody situation, nobody is going to kidnap my child.  All the hysterical people here -- what exactly do you think could happen if you aren't 'touching your car'?)|`|lGSUToFQaa	my hubby almost always goes out with us, but if i can't touch the car i take my son, it's a pain but it's worth it, so much can happen even leaving your baby in the car with it locked, people could break the glass and get them, never ever leave my son, i only go outside to get the mail with him in the house and the door open where i can see him at all times and the other doors all locked that's it.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If I couldn't physically touch the car I would take my daughter in with me.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I'd take him in with me...even though it probably won't, you never know what could happen.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Actually, I think laws do apply here, though I don't know that they would be enforced.  Last Christmas in our area a mother drove her children to Wal-Mart so they could donate money they had collected to the Salvation Army.  On the way the youngest fell asleep in her carseat, since it was cold out and they were only walking a few feet to the bellringer, the mom locked baby in the car (she parked curbside) and walked over with her other kids to put the money in the bucket and she was ARRESTED.  Pretty ridiculous, if you ask me.  I think it was eventually thrown out, but that was AFTER her kids were taken into protective custody and saw there mother taken away handcuffed and after many, many news appearances and court dates.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	well my babe isnt born yet so i dont know FOR SURE. but i live in a REALLY small town, on a REALLY small army base...the gas station here on base is tiny [like 2 pumps] and the window to pay with cash is RIGHT next to the pumps, like litterally 3 feet away from the car. i would think i would just take the keys out, lock it and walk to the window. in a bigger city or even just a regular sized town i would definatly take my baby with me even if i could see him clearly from the window.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	For going inside... if they're younger then like 12 years old, yup, take them with you. You just never know. The parking brake could go out. Someone could hot-wire the car. Or just plain kidnap your child. never leave them alone in the car when they're too young to fend for themselves. <br>  <br>  But... yes, I've done that too, left them in the car (and take the keys with me) when  I had go all of like three feet. I think that's fine.|`|cjqKMjWnaa	i totally know how you feel because it is a hassle to get them out when you're only going to be gone for 2 mins or less ... but i always think "WHAT IF something happened??"  i know i'd never be able to forgive myself.  not to mention the extreme grief and sadness i'd feel.  so i always decide, "eh, it's just not worth it."  i'd rather exert the extra energy to get them out of the car, than really regret not doing so later if something did happen.|`|AA10628838	You don't want to do that. Anyone walking by and see him in there alone could call the cops, then you would have to explain why you left the baby alone in the car. So not worth it and totally dangerous besides. Car fires can start within seconds or anything other thing that would be dangerous to his well being.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	I always take my son with me.  I've read stories about cars being stolen with children in them when they were just gone for a second.  Not to mention that I've had other cars hit my car while it was parked (twice) and I'd worry about that too.<br>  <br>  It's always better to know that your little ones are safe.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I live in a small town, if i am parked right next to door of a gas station, i will take the keys with, lock the door and run in, on two conditions-1-there is no line and 2-i am paying in cash.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	I go to the gas station in my town that has an attendant pump the gas.  That way I don't even have to get out of the car.  Pure laziness, and it costs more too!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'd have taken him in. I'd be too freaked to leave him in the car alone for any time.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	Always take your child with you. Its hard to trust leaving your child in a car now days with all those sick people out there that could take your child. Also if a police officer saw that or if somebody reported it you could get charged with child abandonment and than most likely child protection would get involved and that's never a good thing. So please take your child with you everywhere you go and never leave him in the car. Now if your paying at the gas pump that's OK cause your right there with your child and with the car. So you can still watch him and everything.|`|Fa130w6Gaa	I think that if you are that close to where you need to pay, leave the baby in the car. If it is a busy gas station and your car will be out of eye sight, I'd take the baby with. I usually just pay at the pump so it isn't a problem for me.  I should also add that I live in a small town so I don't worry about someone taking my kids or hurting them. If I am traveling and have to stop in a town I don't know or a big city, I definately take them out of the car!|`|oZEPi0nuaa	Never, ever, ever, ever, ever leave a baby, or child in a car!!! That's all there is to it. This is your child, why take the chance. I once saw a car parked in a lot in front of a store with 2 kids under 3 in it. I was about to call the police, when the man inside the store saw me standing by his car and came out! Takes 2 seconds for something to go wrong.|`|4t5eGShiaa	I agree with "Pippin"... <br>  <br>  i mean.. you NEVER want to leave your child in a car unattended for long periods or when it's hot outside. <br>  <br>  But there are some cases where it might be okay - <br>  <br>  In your case, if you took the keys with you, locked the door, and could still see Zai from where you were.. and you weren't going to be longer than 1-2 mins. I don't see the problem.|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	i know its a hassle to unstrap a sleeping baby/toddler to run inside somewhere for just a minute then have to struggle to get them back into the seat and calm them down if they start to cry, but i would much rather take the five minutes of inconvenience over leaving my child unattended in a car with the possibility of someone coming along and stealing my car and kid napping my daughter.|`|KWaTVVpGaa	Always take your baby with you. You never know what could happen. I have had a car stolen at a gas  station. It is quick and you wouldn't want something like that to happen and your baby be left in the car.|`|KQU5y20waa	i would have to take him with me. no ?s asked..... this is one of those times you would have to ask the ....what if .....question|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	take the baby with you. better safe then sorry!<br>  <br>  Plus if a cop came up he could arrest you for leaving baby in the car- it's a hassle but worth the time!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I always take my kids in-Both of them, every time, without question. Even if I'm just walking a few feet. It's a risk I'm just not willing to take.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I never have cash so I always have my debit card. Make sure you have your card or take the kid in with ya.|`|8c4sPJ0Uaa	anytime i am more than a foot away from the car i take my son...my fear is someone taking him....or him suffocating...|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	I always take my daughter out of the car. And why is it only moms in your question?|`|3CVfUiiJaa	If I couldn't pay at the pump, I would take my son into the store with me.  This is why I always make sure I have my credit/debit card...we have a 2 door so the least amount of times I have to get in the back, unbuckle him and climb out...then do it again to get him back in...is great.|`|AA11210211	I would take them with me,One day I was going to pay with debit too but the damn thing wouldn't take my card so I had to get both kids out of their car seats and take them inside so I could pay.I won't chance leaving my children in the car even for a second.
wBpennsMaa	You will start showing in a couple weeks.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	i was 18 weeks when i started showing.    you will start to show soon i also think that it can depend on how much water you are carrying as well x|`|Dh19fHj4aa	it will just pop out !!!!!!!!!!!!!  10 points pls|`|3xIpCSRqaa	in my own experience i was young and very skinny (size 6) and i showed after two months which is 8 weeks roughly so i would say your going to start showing in the next few weeks.  you wont look fat as it will be a rounded bump.  i hope everything goes ok for you.|`|Xo8sxD9Baa	Hi, i was a size 16 when i was pregnant with my son and i showed like hell....i couldnt even get behind the wheel of my car by the time i was 34 weeks gone.

miFe45quaa	Yes, I think it's cute. Not too common at all!<br>  I'm curious to know what the last name would be though. Because on it's own, just Delilah Ariel, it feels like it's missing something. I'm not sure, maybe the surname would give it a nice ring.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gPlUDaRoaa	I think it is a very cute name.I also have always liked the names Marissa & Nassreen i always thought they were unique names but i am sure whatever name you do use will be cute.Good luck to you.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	It's not too "unique" but it is definitely different. Delilah reminds me of the song though, haha. I prefer Ariel spelled Arielle.

I'm not big on either parts of the name, but if you like it, go for it.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Delilah reminds me of the song by Plain White T's as well as that talk show host who has a voice like dripping honey.  Nightmarish. :)  I think Liliana is a better option, but similar.<br>  <br>  Ariel will forever remind me of a red-headed mermaid.<br>  <br>  How about Liliana Belle?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|l9tiHyJSaa	Ariel is a very sweet & cute name. But Delilah reminds me of that annoying lady on some national radio stations and she annoys the heck out of me. :-) <br>  <br>  Aside from the negative feelings towards 'Delilah after Dark' I think it's a very pretty name.|`|7JiF5X1Taa	I dont really like either names!

7clS7baaaa	more than likely you are still on track with the date that youve got...so 31 weeks.  it is very normal to measure 1-2 off.  reason for this being babies differ in size, also how the baby is positioned.  when you go back and get measured next time you will be back to usual.  this also happened with me several times and so when you get to those last stages of pregnancy and are either feeling miserable or just simply anxious to have your baby, you may want to believe that higher number.  however your little bundle of joy will be here before you know it.  good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and congratulations!!  children are the richest blessings anyone can add to their lives.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	It is normal to measure 1-2 cm big or small at this point in your pregnancy as babies vary a lot in size right now. Your Dr. will probably stick with your original due date even if you are measuring larger. Next measurement you may be back on track. It could be that the baby is laying funny. :) <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	If your periods were irregular around the time of conception, it is possible that you are further along than you thought. More than likely, you just have a sightly bigger uterus than most others at 31 weeks.  Size does vary.|`|MFsuN8Doaa	Nope, it actually doesn't mean a thing. Doctor's and Midwifes just have an average rule that at a certain stage in pregnancy your measurement will be.<br>  <br>  I've been measuring large for dates since wk 25, so at 37 weeks when I was measuring a massive 44 weeks, they did a scan to see if the baby was a big baby or if I had more aminotic fluid then I should. I had neither, I just have one hell of a big bump.|`|goY0JHzlaa	It could be that you are 31 weeks and your baby is growing. You may want to be prepared to come early just in case. Or, you can ask your doc and see what their opinion is.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	the doctors dont know your EXACT due date in most cases

If you're having sex sneaking and hiding from mommy and daddy, that's God's way of telling you you're too young. Kids shouldn't be doing the one act DESIGNED to make kids.

If you feel comfortable having sex with your parents nearby then I think it should be okay.     But, what makes is disrespectful is if you can be heard.    Sex is natural and should be a comfortable (usually pleasurable) experience. But a parent hearing their child having sex would definitely be an UNcomfortable experience for them.    So hush hush! ;-)|`|wohGR1Nkaa	I've had it while my mom and sister were downstairs. But then again she thought me and the boyfriend were just lying down talking. Its an adrenaline rush I guess..  I dont think its rude or disrespectful.  Just a way of showing your love. Its better than getting knocked up in an alley.|`|H6LxeWZfaa	well, im pretty sure its disrespectful lol.  but i find it Much more exciting and better lol.  doing it with the chance of getting caught builds up alot of ummmm shoot i cant think of the word lol. but it makes it better, like a million times better lol ;)|`|VkvhtD4daa	duh|`|tg9D0tVGaa	that sounds like jokes   u shud make a game of it  that wud b realli funny  just dnt get caught|`|m3rsLUgDaa	depends i have sex in my bedroom at my parents house, but im 21 and been with my fiancee 6years! so thats very different to a teen having sex in the next room with a guy she/he just started dating.|`|1FSyB8twaa	well, it is disrespectful, especially if they dont know your having sex.    just try not to and respect them as im sure they would'nt want to walk in on you having sex!|`|rwUJNJ6saa	I don't see a problem with it..i once had sex in my brothers room while he was sleeping..  just don't be too loud and don't get caught lol|`|AA12115728	If you are in your own home, where you pay the rent/mortgage, and the bills, and your parents are visiting, I would say that it's no big deal, except that it's kind of impolite to be noisy about it, even if the visitors were not your parents.    If you are still living in their house, I would say: disrespectful AND rude.|`|WugKYI4zaa	wait till ur married and ewa thats gross
vTfEYeKQaa	I had this happen to me..bleeding off and on during early pregnancy, and it was because I have a negative blood type and  needed a special shot so that my body would not try to miscarry the baby.  I don't know your blood type, but if it's negative, you need to mention this to your doctor if you haven't already gotten a rhogam shot. Good luck with everything.|`|qM1qoDhCaa	It honestly sounds like everything is fine. Just keep resting and eating healthy. Then share these concerns with your doctor. Be prepared emotionally for the worst of course.
Ldvi6UPOaa	Well Clomid actually delays ovulation a little bit. So getting your period three days after your last pill is highly unlikely a result of Clomid. I think you were about to have your period before you took the Clomid. From what I have read online and from my doctor it is best to have a period before you start on Clomid, just to make sure you are not pregnant and that your uterus shed it's lining and will be prepped for implantation after ovulation.     I would suggest you call your doctor and ask if you still have a chance of getting pregnant this cycle since your period started 3 days after your last Clomid pill. I would also get a second opinion from another doctor, because your doctor is the first person that I have heard suggesting you take Clomid without starting your period first.    Try going on www.fertilityties.com. You can get advice from actual doctors.    Good luck hun!!! Truck loads of baby dust to you!
eg3ImKfHaa	That his children are 8 and 14, you are in for a struggle. Younger children are much more accepting of a new adult in their lives. If you said they were 3 and 6, it would be MUCH different.     I would not press for a commitment at this time, because you may not WANT to stay after you've experienced raising his children. They may resent and irritate you, will definitely test you and you do not have to continue in a life that could be miserable.    Also, be aware: Being 29, you probably want to have children of your own. I know from experience that having a child with someone who already has kids is incredibly frustrating. You see the wonder and excitement in your child's accomplishments, and their dad has already seen that with his other kids. That was my experience.    IF this man is an exceptional person, treats you like a princess and is absolutely everything you think you want, see first how things go with his children and if they will accept you before making a commitment. Get a date from him if you feel you need to, but make it in the future.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	If you're about to be mothering his kids, you're entirely within your rights to ask where your relationship is going. Absolutely no doubt about it.     The very first man with kids that I ever dated is now my husband, we have a 7-month old son along with his 7-year old son. It's hard sometimes. The beginning will be especially rough as you adjust to having to share all of your time with the kids. Once the children live with you full time, you may find yourself disagreeing with your bf's parenting techniques. The kids may come to resent you - they can be great if it's just weekend visits but oftentimes they act up when they're there full time. They'll probably be jealous and do little things to try to irk you, depending on their age.     Don't let them drive a wedge between you and your man. If you have any problems with the kids, talk to your bf in private and always with a nice, respectful, and sympathetic tone. Understand that the kids will need a lot of time to adjust so don't expect to be a 'happy family' for a year or two. Don't let the kids walk all over you - you live there so it's your house and you and your bf have the final say on rules. Watch out for a lot of neediness - often children making huge life adjustments become incredibly needy. If they are constantly hanging on their father and don't let you get near him, be okay with that.     And talk, talk, talk to your bf. Talk constantly. Come up with scenarios and ask how he'd handle them (If your son tells you not to hug me, what you do? and things of that nature). Make sure you emphasize often, before the kids come, that you will need private time with your bf regularly. If that means he gets the kids to bed every night at 8 sharp so you can be alone together, so be it.     And let him know that you're a little worried and maybe even a little scared of the huge changes that are about to occur in your life. It's perfectly okay to be scared, and he absolutely HAS to be willing to reassure you. If he doesn't take your feelings seriously right now, he won't do it when the kids come. Now is your chance to figure out if you want to be with this guy forever. Any signs of failure on his part to be 100% committed to your feelings is a sign that you need to bail out.    Good luck!|`|AkFag8tNaa	I was already a mother when I met my husband (who has a son from a previous marriage). I would never help someone raise their child w/out the commitment of marriage. You absolutely have the right to expect that kind of commitment and I would walk if Ididn't get it.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I think it should be left up to him.  Granted taking on a new role as a mom is a huge thing, but it's bigger for him- they're his kids.     Give it some time after the kiddos move in to adjust to life as a new family.  There will be rough roads ahead, so you need to wait and stick it out for a while.  The truth of the matter is, marriage at times makes things more difficult.  It will be stressful enough in the next coming months, so wait a while before asking for that timeline.  Good luck, and I hope you can become a wonderful mama to those babies!!|`|Ty6vGEj9aa	Well, when I was young, my father was dating a woman, and I learnt a few things from that. One of the rules is to never think of yourself as a "mother" to them, since it will most likely make them a bit annoyed over you. Take care of them, but not too much. That is their father's job. If he has girls it will be harder in a way, but easier in another. It is very easy to bond with girls (I am one, and have a brother), but they might get a bit jealous, since they are "daddy's little girl". At least around 10 years old. The kids will love you for sure though, if you just play your right role. I hope I helped!|`|2fc18cb5f88753ef637567f67fae948caa	My husband have a 8 years old son from another woman. He was 4 years old when I got to know him.  They didn't go to court for custody, they just share it together, whenever.    At first, I was fed up with that. I mean, it was too irregular, and I didn't have the experience or the patience to handle his 4 years old boy( I was just 20 years old then). I even remember fighting because of like.. what seemed to be jealousy (well, i was selfish then, and trying to get the most of our newly wed life, and here was this kid taking up a lot of space and attention!)...."This is what happens when you get married with a man who have a kid", so they told me!  Well times have changed. I was able to accept his son into the mix. I cared for him, and allow him more enjoyable step-mommy time. He grew to respect me and now we are good all together.  Recently, he has been spending a lot more time at my house than his mom's house. Which is fine. I have a baby who is 8 months old. And the eldest helps quite a bit with the baby chores. Entertain him and plays with him.. .watches him over and stuff. It's great.   To think about it now, I was really silly at first for acting up like that. I wouldn't change nothing of my relationship now. I love his son!    You are not saying how old you are, or the children, but yes it will be a big responsability, but you will get used to it. And yes, for sure you are aloud to ask him that. It's your right! Just hang on there, even if it's difficult at first. It will be better! Good luck dear!|`|ftbrRTYUaa	This is a huge commitment on your part. And I can tell you that it won't be easy. But it can be done. How old are the kids? How are they reacting to you? To the idea of living with you?     You have every right to ask for a time line. And I would also ask him what type of responsibilities he excepts from you. Have him lay it all out. It will help you in the end.     Good luck :)
t1fx6kXcaa	If you don't want to wean your son, than don't. The benefits and the nutrients of breast milk don't cease at the age of 12 months. 12 month old babies, 13, 14, 15  month old babies are just that; babies. Most of their nutrition is still from milk at that age which is why, when a baby is weaned at 12 months, the breast milk is replaced with cow's milk. Ideally, you wean when your son is ready, otherwise you wean when you feel you need to. You don't wean your child because your husband has issues and problems with something as natural and positive as a mother feeding her infant son.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	well, they are not your husbands breasts are they? the longer you nurse the less chance for breast cancer. i never gave my fiance a choice because it has NOTHING to do with his body and it's good for my son so there was NO reasons to wean my son abruptly. and i never had to fight with is either. my son is almsot 22 months and doesn't nurse much anymore at all. there was never a fight or struggle and we both have been happy|`|68c6B8dRaa	He's not your warden and this isn't his decision to make...|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Just cut out one or two of those feedings at a time until he's off. I tend to agree with your husband> when the kid can chew a steak, its time to get off the nip! jmo|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Maybe he just isn't aware of the benefits of breastfeeding past a year old? He doesn't have the breasts so...he can b!t$h all he wants but ultimately, it's your decision. So, he wants you to wean to what? Cows milk? Why wean from your breast milk, the most perfect food, to another species, highly inferior, breast milk? I fail to see the point in that. Does he know how bad cows milk is for humans? Did you know there are things like puss, growth hormones, additives and cancer causing agents, just to name a few, in cows milk? Even the "organic" kind isn't much better.    Keep breastfeeding your child. Do it as long as you both agree to it. This decision has little to do with your husband. Tell your husband that this is your decision is between you and your son and it is not up for discussion. If he has such a problem with it I would try to find out why and address it from there. Sounds like a jealously issue though.
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Maybe gas.  Or some type of cramping.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I would say just gas.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	to soon for the baby to move. It's gas.|`|bpqxtkFfaa	Impossible to feel that. I'm 15 weeks and havn't felt my baby yet. You're probably feeling gas. Anywho its not really a baby yet. In a few weeks its considered a baby.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS. :)<br>  <br>  Ps. I'm not showing yet. <br>  You dont have to be showing to feel the baby. But too early for you.|`|2DM7MaXyaa	OMG this just happened to me and i have a son tooo and the only time i felt the little kicks was with him and i may possibley be 5 wks and 1 day pregnant and i was like is it twins or something lol!!! good luck and congrats!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	i dont even think you have legs and feet yet.. sorry hun but just gas..|`|Ip5ngFICaa	it very well could be the baby pinching a nerve. i am 13 weeks with twins and i could feel the same thing you were talking about around the same time it like someone tuging at the inside of you belly button.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	I read on some website that 'twinges' is an early sign of pregnancy.

B6Mfx5fUaa	It's completely normal and common.   I'm 15 weeks and am still experiencing this, and I just checked with my doctor at my appointment yesterday.   It's just your uterus stretching and preparing for baby!  No worries, unless the cramps are severe and accompanied with blood, of course.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yep thats how i felt for a good couple of weeks. maybe till like 7 or 8 weeks. as long as there not sharp pains and there is no bleeding dont worrie to much. its normal|`|S7vNqiOpaa	I'm 6 weeks and 5 days pregnant, and I have the exact same thing. Its completely normal. Its just your uterus stretching. <br>  If you have really severe cramping and/or blood, go see your doctor or go to the ER.<br>  Good luck!|`|DTVJtHYLaa	as long as there is no blood you shouldn't have anything to worry about.God Bless
R0RnjdnXaa	It could be. Since you've been having long lasting periods maybe it gave you an infection that can easily be treated with some safe meds. I would always get long periods when not pregnant because I always have had irregular periods and would get UTI's. I wish you the best...|`|xq7S9H5Raa	Not necessarily.  itchiness can be cause by yeast also and many other medical conditions.  Wait till you go to your doctor, he will tell you.
Z6CJApzJaa	Your daughter is your number one priority. You should be the one raising her. <br>  <br>  Try to remember that your daughter needs you more than anyone else. Your new girlfriend may think she is able to handle coming in to a ready made family. However think about what your daughter needs and not about what is convenient for you. Only you know the real situation so asking people here is kind of irrelevant because we don't know the whole situation. Wish you the best!|`|QOWyUr2taa	Personally I think it is best for the child to be with her parent (s).  But it does all depend on your circumstances.  If it were me I would want my child to be with me at all times and it wouldn't occur to me that it could be any different.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	"it" is YOUR daughter, and you shouldn't be leaving her anywhere.  You should focus on her and not your relationships first!
HXh7u0lEaa	They can check the length of the cervix and make sure it is not shortening as that's a sign of premature labour, you don't usually have any pain but you might have some bleeding and you would loose your mucus plug. If you are at risk they will keep on eye on you. If you have had a miscarriage due to cervical incompetence (weak cervix) then they usually put a stitch in it to hold it closed early on in your next pregnancy. Speak to your Dr if you're worried about it.|`|jZPv153Jaa	i have no clue?|`|4tZwBpP1aa	talk to ur doctor..that's the best way to find out|`|tu7aqUoxaa	research online|`|bpqxtkFfaa	Well theres NO way you can tell by yourself. & i wouldn't be sticking you;re fingers up there and especially if you're pregnant. Anywho when you get a pelvic exam/ pap smear you're doc can tell right away. So yeah. <br>  <br>  Good luck

b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	If he doesn't have any expectations then sure if that's what he wants. Just dont dream of these wonderful reunions because sometimes they dont go that way. Putting his name on that list will be a good thing because then the parent(s) will find him and be ready and wanting to see him. Weather good or bad he has to be ready for either outcome.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	He needs to decide when and how this would happen... If he is asking I feel the best give an adoptive parent can give is to be supportive and help their child become whole. Even if that might mean it feels awkward and uncomfortable if we Truly love someone--we should set them free if they return it was meant to be.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	Its entirely his decision, but i think that it's a good thing to search out ones first parents.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	It is solely his decision.|`|gsW5jVbtaa	yes, it will give him a sense of identity.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Yes.
WPI0Z47saa	You just change your plans a little because your situation has changed. Having a baby is hard but you can still do everything that you want and need to do. All you need is a good support system. Do everything possible to finishing your training because this will be the best thing for you and your child. When things like this happen (it happened to me) it is scary and seems like the end of the world. But guess what, it will work out because it has to and then you won't be able to picture life any way else. If you are training to be a childrens nurse then obviously you love children so it could be a really good thing for you. Good luck and it will work out. I promise.|`|L1EccMeZaa	My friend found out she was pregnant yesterday, and it was also not planned. Even though it was responsible of you to use a condom, sometimes it just happens, condoms are not 100%. My friend is keeping the baby, and I suggest you do too even if it means life changes, because a baby is wonderful. Hopefully the father will agree.<br>  <br>  My friend is actually a year off from graduating for her teacher's degree, so she'll have to make some changes now too. But she understands, and she, like you, is young and has many years ahead to finish what you started, even if you have to take a little break in between. No offence, but if you're planning to be a children's nurse, terminating the pregnancy would be kind of... weird. Obviously you love kids if you chose that profession, so why not have one? It sounds like fate to me. But if you think you're really not ready, there are long lines of people waiting to adopt a newborn. <br>  <br>  Seriously, I have tons of friends who have been where you are. They're scared at first, but then they realize it's not nearly as bad as they thought it would be, and are actually happy it happened because they love being a parent. I really hope to have a baby of my own someday too, but because I have medical conditions, I probably won't be able to, so I'll probably adopt.|`|uuHPneEcaa	Well what do u want to do. Do u want this baby. Yeah u might have to put ur dreams on hold to become a childrens nurse. But u can finish ur 1st year have ur baby and I am sure everything will work out for the best for u and ur partner!|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Talk to your hubby first.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	What do you do?<br>  <br>  You go to a doctor to seek prenatal treatment, and you make a decision.<br>  <br>  You can have your baby killed, you can raise your child yourself, or you can let a childless couple be blessed with a child to raise.<br>  <br>  You should also talk to the dad.  Pregnancy tests aren't wrong when they're positive.  If you're going to keep it he can choose to be involved or not, but he has no choice in the matter of child support.|`|qM1qoDhCaa	I had an abortion recently. I think you should consider it. You are very young and not done with your education yet. I either suggest having an abortion or seriously looking into adoption. Pregnancy is life changing. There is no guarantee you will be able to finish your education with a child. And with the economy your probably won't be able to find a good job. If you keep it, look into food stamps and other public help. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Talk to your boyfriend about your feelings and about your options.  Remember that if having the baby is what feels right to you, it does not mean that you have to give up on your other goals.  Lots of women have children while in school and many colleges and universities have daycare programs for students.  Most importantly, don't make this choice too quickly out of guilt or fear.  Give yourselves a couple of weeks to think and talk about it and do what feels rights for you.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	Everything happens for a reason, this is a blessing in disguise!

You really need to put some serious thought into it and remember that you have to know how the father feels about it too. If you think you can be a good mother and will not resent this child for pushing off your dreams then you should keep it, having a baby can fulfill your life. But keep in mind that if you are not in that mindset at this point in your life then you may want to consider not having it. There are enough children in this world that are unloved and unwanted and adding one more doesn't help anything especially the child. Good luck.|`|AA11531535	You need to go to your doctor and get another test just to be sure. If it is positive as well, you will have to take some time and think about it. But, it will get easier. Condoms do fail from time to time, so you might have got a bad one. Just relax, what is done is done. Just because it wasn't planned, doesn't mean you can't start planning. Plus, you can continue going to school for nursing. You just might have to take a time out when the baby comes if you are in fact pregnant.|`|XTzLq5Cpaa	My sister is the same age as you and is in her first year of college. she got pregnant unplanned and just had the baby a month ago a beautiful little girl. my sister had to put her life on hold for a little while but she said it;s worth it. she wouldn't trade her baby for anything in the world! she will find a babysitter for little reina and planning to go back to college in a few months. consider yourself lucky because a lot of people can't have kids at all. and think about it, you want to be a childrens nurse and you have a kid of your own. you will then have the experience and can relate to the mothers of the kids too.:)|`|MG7S22iMaa	First off just because a test is positive doesn't necessarily mean that you are pregnant. You should take another test and see if that one comes out positive as well and then go see a doctor ASAP to be 100% sure.

My brother Dan and his wife married at 19.  They have 3 kids.  My sister-in-law had her first baby in November and went back to school (baby-in-tow) in the following year.  She had my niece Kira two years later.   The babies stayed with my Mom and some days were in the schools daycare while she was in class.   Kim got her degree as a teacher.  Four years later my nephew was born. <br>  <br>  Kim is a great Mom.  Her kids are well behaved and are all successful BECAUSE of the example set by there Mother.<br>  <br>  Kim now has her Masters in Education, my oldest niece Ashley is now in Med School in Erie PA, Kira is in school to be a PT in Syracuse NY and Danny is a senior in high school. <br>  <br>  Things will all work out in the long run. <br>  <br>  You are strong enough to handle this.

If you are not going to have it you need to get an abortion scheduled ASAP before the egg becomes a fetus.  Good luck!
kjgonYlgaa	He's still really young.  Make sure the person doing the trim is familiar with small kids.  Some hairdressers don't have the patience it takes to cut a 2 yr olds hair.  A good one will simply give him a boyish cut to suit his face shape, instead of trying to give him one of the new & trendy cuts.  Boys get messed up quickly don't work yourself up hoping to get a look that can not  achieve.|`|qmFpYwppaa	When my son got his first hair cut (only three months ago) I had them cut it around the ears and to the nape of his neck.  Sorry I can't find the pictures.  At first, the woman used scissors, but b/c my son was having such a fit, they used a razor to cut it quicker.  I think the razor was set on 2.  I had wanted to let his hair grow out, but it is too fine.  Now he looks like a boy instead of Farrah Fawcett.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Why cut it all, why not just keep trimming ?

Quite frankly, I doubt the guy you are living with would want to have a baby with you anymore if he REALLY knew you. It is horrible to even suggest you would have a baby by someone else and let the other person think it is theirs. The truth always comes out. Second, you are obviously not committed to either one of these men and therefore really have no right bringing another child into this world. If this other guy wouldn't let you live with him, he obviously doesn't want a kid with you! It sounds like you are convenient for him. I think you should settle down with the one who really cares about you and if you really want a child have it with him, he is the one who wants a child! You can't force a child on someone. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you don't stop fooling around then hopefully it comes back to bite you in the a**! If nothing else, be honest with the guy you are living with and let him move on, he deserves to find someone better than you that cares for him and will be faithful and will give him the family he wants with HIS own children.

dnG7fhnbaa	I might let a 13 year old look after my kids depending on how mature she was and how well I knew her and her family...it's probably best to let your mum or dad get to know them first and become friends with them before you start asking to look after their children.

bmi4Xlbfaa	You may have had some very heavy spotting that can often be mistaken for a period. Here are some causes for bleeding:<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding or spotting - Implantation bleeding happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. As the egg burrows into the lining, it sometimes causes some of the lining to shed. A woman might notice light bleeding a week to a few days before her period is due. Implantation bleeding is usually light brown, pink, or red spotting but can be as heavy as a light period. It could conceivably be confused with a light period or an early period.<br>  <br>  Bleeding after birth control - Women sometimes have irregular cycles after taking the pill. If you have recently stopped taking the pill and are pregnant, you may have some spotting off and on due to hormonal changes. Getting pregnant shortly after stopping taking birth control can make it more difficult to differentiate intermittent bleeding from an actual period. You may be unclear when your last period was or you could be pregnant and continue to have some irreg<br>  4 days ago<br>  <br>  Ectopic pregnancy - The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include vaginal bleeding. An ectopic pregnancy may cause vaginal bleeding that is similar to a period. Other symptoms include abdominal pain (usually on one side), rectal pressure, nausea, dizziness and shoulder pain.<br>  <br>  Miscarriage - About 20-30% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting can be an early sign of miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting during pregnancy does not always mean that the woman will not go on to have a healthy pregnancy but it is reason for concern. A miscarriage often starts with light spotting that turns to heavy bleeding. If you are having bleeding and are pregnant you should consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is physically impossible to get your period while pregnant. If you're not positive, take a pregnancy test. Good luck =]|`|dunrFTe4aa	You really need to go see your doctor.you may or may not be pregnant you really should use protection,getting pregnant isnt the only thing you can get from having sex.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Take a home pregnancy test.  You are probably not pregnant, but it will set your mind at rest.|`|AA11764194	wait for few more days to take HPT..|`|mY19PPlIaa	You get spotting when you miss the pill that is totally normal. And I dont think your pregnant at all. I would even miss 4 days in a row. If you miss a pill you know you could always double up. You could take up to 4 missed birth control pills, well thats what my gyno told me. So if you miss a pill one day the next day you could just take 2. No your not pregnant and stop stressing about it cause that could make your period come late. I think you have enough hormones in you , that you will be fine. And you getting randomly sick is really not indicative of a pregnancy, your immune system just may be a little low. Pluse  you said you got a period, so there is NO WAY YOUR PREGNANT.

zqfs7A6Caa	Sometimes a painful bowel movement can make a child scared to poop. This will cause her to hold it until she cannot hold it anymore. Other times, some children will just be bored with sitting on the potty so they will not want to bother. This is most likely the culprit in your daughter's case.<br>  <br>  You need to set up a reward system for pooping on the potty. We gave our son temporary tattoos for pooping and stickers for peeing. The tattoos stated to press on his skin for 30 seconds, so we also used this as a fun opportunity to practice counting to 30.<br>  <br>  We could always tell when he had to poop, although we had to resort to spanking a couple times when he had a very short lived stage of trying to hide it when he went. When we saw him straining, we would make him sit on the potty. Even if he were coerced into going, he would get his tattoo as a reward. Other times a small smear of poop in his undies made it obvious he had to go. We would never punish for that; we only punished for refusing to sit on the toilet when told, and purposely going in his pants. <br>  <br>  Many people try to say never to punish during potty training, but that all started because of the truism that you should never punish for accidents. If our son pooped on the floor on purpose he would end up with a very red, sore bottom. On the other hand, if he couldn't make it to the toilet in time, he would get a verbal "good try" and we would put the poop in the toilet and have him sit on the potty while we rinsed his undies out. Sometimes he would go more, sometimes not.<br>  <br>  Just try making her sit if it seems like she has to go, use positive reinforcement for going poop, never punish accidents, and continue making it unpleasant for her to poop in her pants (spanking, making her clean the mess, ect.)|`|PwmgKx2eaa	maybe she's constipated. try fletcher's laxative. she can take 1 teaspoon. it tastes like root beer.|`|eifZAKlAaa	Maybe you should start a scheduled with star's on it and if she goes to the potty to pee she gets star if she goes poop she gets 2 star and at the end of the week she gets a surprise nothing that big or to expensive something small  or at the end of the month she gets a something a movie rental and she gets to pick out the movies she wants to watch.  Maybe if you ask her want she wants that at the beginning of the week and tell her her gold is ---- that maybe it will works but you have to kept at it,  if she missed a day no surprise at the end of the week and get her to put the star on the scheduled and let her see the progress she is making and say good girl went she goes something good and be happy about it
Fh4B88ZGaa	You would need hormone shots in conjunction with regular pumping to get your milk to come in.

Women of every possible breast size are able to breastfeed. Also, the process of pregnancy and having ones milk 'come in' cause a natural increase in both the fat tissue and glandular tissue that make up the breast. If she wants to breastfeed, she should be able to. One thing you can do to help is to find the local La Leche League and a lactation consultant who can help her sort out the particulars of her own situation and help her get through any rough spots.|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	breast size is NOT an indication of whether you can breastfeed or not. I have very very small breasts and had no problem with making enough milk (your body is amazing and can make enough milk to feed triplets if necessary!)<br>  <br>  However, it is possible for YOU to feed the baby-----use a pump to stimulate the breasts.  Contact the La Leche league for support, they have AMAZING women who can help you through every step of the way!  If you were to adopt a baby you  could still breastfeed too.<br>  <br>  Your sister should consider all the benefits that breastfeeding will give her------health benefits, bonding with her baby, and no painful engorgement period after the baby is born.  Her body will naturally begin to make colustrum and then milk (regardless of her "old age") and she should be able to feed the baby with no problem.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what other women think, being a wet nurse has been around for centuries.|`|8WRnqs08aa	My Dad once dated a woman who had no breasts, just nipples.

I am sure my wife was as "micro breasted" as mommy's fathers girlfriend and your sister. And there were no problem at all nursing ;o)<br>  <br>  You can keep nursing going after you've done your own, but not sure you can induce it from scratch.

Keep trying to figur out his birthday. good luck|`|1enIWBGnaa	Most hospitals automatically file birth certificates with the Bureau of Vital Statistics, however, if you've lost his birth certificate then you can't give the agency the exact date of birth.

C8fBt7Rxaa	You may want to try putting him to sleep on his stomach.  Prior to 1992 over 70% of U.S. babies slept on their stomachs.  You may want to let him sleep on your stomach first though to see how he likes it.<br>  <br>  Infants who sleep on their backs compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs have increased rates of: <br>  - Social skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - Motor skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (Corvaglia, 2007) <br>  - Milestone delays (Davis, Moon, et al., 1998)<br>  - Plagiocephaly, Torticollis, Strabismus, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Plus, stomach sleep tends to prevent hip subluxation and reduce the symptoms of colic.<br>  <br>  Here are my thoughts on back sleep.  If a doctor was presented with a baby that had social skills delays, motor skills delays, and gastroesophageal reflux what would a doctor say if a child had these three things but not too bad. The doctor might tell the parent to be patient and that different kids develop differently. But, what if the case was more severe - what if the kids social skills were worse? The doctor might diagnose him with ADHD. But, what if the kids delays were really far behind - that is the kid had very large delays in social skills and motor skills? The doctor might diagnose him with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I think part (if not all) of the Autism Epidemic is caused by the SIDS Back to Sleep campaign. This is totally unrelated to plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome) only that plagiocephaly could be used as a marker for how well the parents followed the SIDS Back to Sleep advice. This is just my theory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/</a>|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Rock them, cuddle them, walk with them, sing to them. Or buy one of those heartbeat bears and put in their crib, or even a radio. I put a radio in my oldests crib when he was newborn. It soothed him a lot. Or put him in a baby swing until he falls asleep. <br>  <br>  otherwise... get used to it. I'm afraid that's just the way it goes sometimes. For the first three months of my boys lives I got very little sleep and most nights it was spent with one handle on the cradle or the stroller they were in, othertimes crashed out on the couch with them on my chest...mostly I found that my touch is what thye wanted, to be near me. So you might even put a worn t-shirt in their crib with them, use it like a blanket, so they feel wrapped in you. <br>  <br>  Hang in there mom. it doesn't seem like it now, but those days will be gone before you know it.|`|8c4sPJ0Uaa	rock them...walk aroudn with the,...but don't try to put a baby to sleep that isnt' tired...|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	my son just turned 3 yesterday and he got the hang of it..i'll feed him, change his diaper and lay him on his bassinet next to my bed.and i turn off the lights and turn on his little lamp to brighten up the room a little just so he can look around..he stays palying with his hands and eventually fall to sleep..  but when he was smaller it was a pain in the butt|`|0dwVWzLJaa	did no one tell you what to expect?? that's just babies that's what they do! just keep in mind the good times!
iXSoX6Rnaa	Ask her doctor for it.|`|eifZAKlAaa	Ask you doctor about it or ask if he can give you a copy of the immunization record if not ask him or his receptionists were you can get a copy of the record. I know in Canada I carried they're record with me at all time and kept a record with you at all time make a photo copy of it and make sure that you get the doctor to record the immunizations that you have with you and that way you doctor and have the records up to date.
QPtJzfRaaa	I had the same thing happen to me, My last period started the 2nd. I started testing on the 13th, and my tests went back and forth, like showing up really light and then not showing up at all, It was starting to get confusing, on Monday I got a dark one, so I took another one that night and it came back really light..So I thought I ovulated and the surge was going away, The next day, I took another one and It came back positive, So my guess is hang in there and keep testing, maybe just worrying about when you will ovulate , is pushing it back.  Maybe try testing 2 times a day, and hold your liquid intake for a couple of hrs beforehand.   Good Luck!!!

As for the biting I have tried every thing except for using hot sauce I tried lemon juice but the kid likes it...I have bitten him back not hard enough to break skin but hard enough that he knows I mean business..Time outs are a joke they don't do anything but frustrate the parents even more. Let him throw his tantrum let him get all worked up just ignore him until he is done its a hard task but i have found if I ignore the tantrum or the behavior of my children that they display for attention they quickly stop and go about getting my attention in a proper fashion.

OQnRP6xVaa	Hillary,<br>  <br>  You do not have to do anything right this moment. You can take your time. You do not have to decide before you have a chance to hold your baby and give him or her the best gift a mother can -- life! You can hold your baby and bless his or her future with the gift of your own milk. A gift that a mother gives her baby which will last a lifetime.<br>  <br>  There is no reason you need to make this decision before you have the chance to really know what that will mean.<br>  <br>  My mother was 16 -- my life was difficult but, she did her best and had she not I would not be who I am. She made mistakes, and there were times I wanted what the other children with older more stable parents had--but, life is sometimes all about what makes a person stronger.<br>  <br>  There will be a Million people who will still want to adopt your baby at 6-weeks old---or 6 months old...  There is no reason to decide For sure right now!|`|zLoyo24Taa	Yes you can, just do not let anyone push you to make a decision for you. Good Luck and do what is best for you and your baby.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Once you contact an adoption agency they will do their darndest to get you in a position where you feel adoption is the best thing for you.  They're good at that, its their business and they have lots of waiting customers.<br>  <br>  You can research adoption through unbiased soures.   Once an agency get's their claws into you, they won't let go.  <br>  <br>  You can always look into adoption once the baby has arrived.  It's not like there's any shortage of people desperate to adopt so there's no chance of him or her ending up in foster care.  Pre-birth matching is coercive and designed to ensure relinquishment or at least make it very difficult for you to back out.  Once matched you may fall in love with the potential adopters and feel you owe them your baby, and find it very difficult to change your mind.<br>  <br>  Here's a flyer written by women who've been in your position, I hope you find it useful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cubirthparents.org/edd/index.php?id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.cubirthparents.org/edd/index....</a>|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	OK, go to your phone book and look at the adoption agencies.  See if they have websites and do your research.  Have your parents do this with you.  Select an agency.<br>  <br>  Once you select an agency, you will typically be allowed to choose an "open" or "closed" adoption.  Open adoptions are the ones where you pick the parents and you stay in your child's life, but you don't raise the child.  The child knows the birthmother from the beginning and understands that you were young, loved them, and wanted a better life for them.  Closed adoptions are where you can decide whether to choose the parents or not, but once the process is complete, you never see your baby again until the kid grows up and decides to track you down.  You can choose to allow your name to be released or kept secret, depending on whether you want to be found.<br>  <br>  Once you have the baby, there will be a waiting period before it's final.  This is to give you one last chance to change your mind.  This breaks the hearts of a lot of adoptive parents, but it's not uncommon.  <br>  <br>  You can change your mind at any moment until the adoption is final.|`|rKQ9l81kaa	You never "HAVE TO" give up your baby. That is YOUR choice, and YOUR child. Lots of people don't wait to find a family until the later trimesters in pregnancy. I'm almost 6 months along and I still haven't found a family (I've been looking though.) If anyone in your life is telling you that you have to than just don't share your plans with them. Even if it's your parents, the courts would order that it is your choice. And to exactly answer your question, you can go through with meeting and looking for parents even if your not sure. That's why they always refer to it as "considering adoption". I know in some states (I don't know which or how many) you have several days after the birth of the baby to change your mind. But I would advise you to try to make your mind before the baby is born because you don't want the prospective parents to get attached and become heartbroken if you change your mind. Just keep in mind what's best for baby and for you in the long run. Think about the pros and cons for the baby and than for yourself. I great way to help make that decision is to talk to a social worker. They don't try to persuade you in any direction they show you the hardships and the joys on both aspects. Either way, your a very brave young woman who decided not to have an abortion and give this child a life regardless of wheather its you or another family raising it. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You don't "have to" give up your baby.  Period.  You can change your mind up until the waiting period after the paperwork is completed.  You don't have to even go that far though.  Your age is going to make it hard, but if you don't want to give up this baby, you don't have to.  There are people out there who can help you.  There are people out there who you can talk to if you are worried.  If money is a problem, they can help with that too.<br>  <br>  It would be hard, but this baby belongs with their mother.  That is something that no one else in this world can give.  Find someone to talk to about all your options, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Giving up your child doesn't ensure that they are going to have a better life.  It only ensures that you aren't going to be in it.  I know you are young, but this decision is going to effect the rest of your life, so it is worth thinking about as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11987492	Ok, I just want you to know that I kow how you feel, I have been there. I was 19 when I got pregnant and I had my son one month before I turned 20. I am certainly not trying to be rude, but I must wonder, why are you wanting to relinquish you child? Unless there is abuse or neglect, there is no reason for an adoption to occur.<br>  <br>  Is it because you are single? So am I, and let me tell you, it is NOT as bad as people make it out to be. Now, I DO have the support of my family, and that helps a ton, but I am still the one that provides the support for my son, I am the one that raises him, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you are wanting a "Two parent home" for your child? Remember, that the divorce rate is out of control, and more than likely, your child will end up being raised by a single parent anyway. Then what? You loose a child, your child looses his heritage (and YOU, which is all he really wants anyways) all for a situation which is no better than he would have had anyways REMEMBER! You will not always be single! THIS IS TEMPORARY!!!<br>  <br>  Is it because you are young? Honestly, people used to have children at 16 ROUTINELY and did a great job with them. It is an extreamly new development that women wait untill their 30's to have children. I am 21 now, and let me tell you, I am a wonderful mother. I love my son more than anything. Age is only a number, you CHOOSE to be a good or bad parent! REMEMBER! You will not always be young! THIS IS TEMPORARY!!!<br>  <br>  Is it because you are in school? So am I. I am in Nursing School. I go to school at night, so my mom or my aunt can watch Jayden. Going to school while being a mom is not that bad. So you have to move your schedual around a little, so what? I promise, it pays off in the end. Being a mom is SOOOO much more fun than getting drunk every weekend at a frat house. And guess what, you can STILL party sometimes, you just find a babysitter for the night. I have never met a woman that became a mother and COMPLETELY gave up having a little fun every once in a while. REMEMBER! You will not always be in school! THIS IS TEMPORARY!!!<br>  <br>  Is it because you don't think that you will be able to support the child? I thought that too. I had to move back in with my Mom, I got on Medicaid, WIC, and other government programs. You will get AWESOME scholarships and Grants for having a child. I will end up oweing next to nothing for school. You child does't want a fancy nursery, name brand clothes, and a trust fund, he wants YOU! You are ALL that he knows, and ALL that he wants. A baby is accutely aware of who his mother is immediatly after birth. This is the modern world, people will NOT allow you and you child to go without basic necessities. There are second hand stores that have REALLY cute stuff for next to nothing. REMEMBER! You will not always be struggling! THIS IS TEMPORARY!!!<br>  <br>  I really hope you do your research (and that does NOT mean asking adoption agencies what they think, they make money from separting you from your child)<br>  <br>  <br>  I also hope that you do not make a decision untill after your baby is born. There is NO rush, why don't you try to parent him for a while? At least then you will know...|`|Of7KEsnXaa	No you do not have to give up your baby. You can research your options with adoption but no one can make you give your child up should you decide to keep him/her.<br>  <br>  One thing to note, you have been told about open adoptions and they can be a good thing. However you should know that they are not legally enforceable. The Aps can promise you contact, pictures, letters ect. But there is no law that says they have to follow thru with that. Then can break off contact at any time.<br>  <br>  If you decide to place your baby for adoption, be prepared that you might not have contact with him/her again.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope you make the decission thati s best for both you and your child|`|9JYwZq43aa	Yes, you should be in complete control of what you chose to do.  You can met and select the parents.  Meeting someone would not obligate you to chose them.  Make sure you are comfortable and like them, especially if you are looking to do an open adoption.  You want to make sure your baby gets a good home and these are people you will likely have a life long relationship with.  We talked frequently with my sons birth mom and still stay in touch with her and some of her extended family.  It seems to work for all of us.  We are now looking at adopting again and hoping to do the same thing.<br>  <br>  You can contact an agency however they will prescreen people for you. You can also contact people directly who post ads in the news paper and online however you need to be careful and make sure there is a social worker for you involved who is looking after your best interests.  Make sure you don't get pushed into anything you don't want to do.  Adoption is a big decision.  Also, the father will likely need to be on board with your plan   Hopefully it will all work out for you.<br>  <br>  Take care & good luck.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	Yes you can start things and still have time to decide. Make sure you make the right decission for you.
XOtOMncwaa	Yes! People always want what they can't have, babies included. My sons a bit of a push over, and allows other kids to take his toys... but it seems like every time I take my son around another child they are always taking his toys... I think it's just that my sons too young to care at the moment, but I did catch him fighting over a toy the other day. It's like gee your surrounded by toys and you BOTH have to have that one! I think it's funny because my son was fighting over a toy that he NEVER plays with!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	My sister and I were like that. We're 2 years apart lol. She always (and still does some) wanted my stuff.
IFDfpbFJaa	No...I would never let my child smoke. There was something on TV the other day about a family letting their 18 month old and  3 year old smoke weed....it's sad.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	That is awful!  I can't believe I just watched that.  I have no volume, but I assume I didn't miss anything.  That father should be arrested.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	OMG that is seriosuly sick, not as bad as the parents that gave their baby extacy in australia though.. ugh its all sick!<br>  <br>  I smoke, i wish i didnt and i wish it wasnt so hard to quit.. and i worry all the time that my son will smoke when he gets older.   I would never ever allow it or encourage it, until he is old enough to make his own decisions and even then i will discourage it!   My dad smoked, and so did most of his side of the family, also when i was a kid smoking wasnt viewed as bad as it is now and we often munched on candy cigarettes and pretended to smoke!!  BUT if my parents ever saw me with a real cigarette i would have gotten beat lol, i was afraid to let my mom know i smoked, she didnt find out till i was almost 20 and she was soo mad.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	That's disgusting. Makes me want to punch the parents right in the face. I don't know how that kid is even able to light a lighter... they have child safety on them.. i know i couldn't work a light until i was like 14. Horrible, horrible parenting!!!! This kid was trained to do this..|`|sqR0iyuWaa	Only a parent who's not exactly smoking tobacco products would let their 2 year old smoke.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Makes me want to put that cigarette out on the father's face.|`|VqN3xV1uaa	I have 3 daughters and I am a heavy smoker. It is perfectly natural for toddlers to want to smoke, so when they wanted to try it, I let them. They were allowed to have puffs of my cigarette (or their dad's) whenever they asked. When they started inhaling, they were allowed to smoke more and develop a tolerance until they could smoke and inhale whole cigarettes, at which point they became regular smokers.<br>  <br>  Granted, they didn't start smoking at 2, although my youngest did get quite a few puffs at that age. It was more like 4 or 5 years old. Smoking at two is not unusual in my family, though. Kids love to smoke, and they are so cute doing, especially the innocent-looking little girls!<br>  <br>  This is your second post on this topic - I am thinking that, really, you would love to see this in real life. Am I correct?|`|21d8f73abc1967926001a4cbda22bbeeaa	My parents did that to me so I know from experience. Let me tell you, when you start at that age (I was a little past 3) you can't stop no matter what you try to do. I'm in my 20's now and smoke way too much, even waking up at night to smoke. It's wrong to do, even if the child wants to. My parents just gave into my requests and, before I knew it, I was hooked. Yes, even a child of 3 can be addicted to cigarettes.<br>  Because of a decision made when I was far too young to make this a rational decision, I'm a good candidate for all sorts of diseases. My cough is terrible already and I'm not yet 30! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!|`|PumDOQC9aa	I would never let my son smoke cigarttes at age 2 that's just plain stupid. The parent should be a shame od their self.|`|hmdyp6IQaa	If I saw that in person, I would punch the parents in the face.  Immediately.|`|iIJm5JToaa	Obvious it's not good parenting, and I'd bet its fake.|`|fRYQfvNaaa	disgusting.|`|cteyFJxhaa	EW|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i think they are using their child for entertainment, that is sick! x
h03FTbXLaa	jeeze, NO WAY! and even the people who think they're average..really are not lol. everyone is beautiful, or unique in their own way. don't listen to your friends, they're being stupid...and they're probably just saying that cuz maybe you mentioned once or twice how you thought that you werre just average, and maybe they're jealous of you, and tried to make themselves feel better by saying that being average is a bad thing.|`|eA8yShNsaa	Absolutely not.  There are a lot of people out there who would just love to be average.  Besides, I'm sure that even if you consider yourself to be average you probably have several above average skills or interests that you haven't yet discovered.|`|dbeA7Exlaa	no, it cant be that bad, because there are like 538475496 other people who are average as well.|`|3L68leaHaa	as long as you don't mind being like everyone else.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No, why would it be bad?|`|2LpWgU20aa	not at all, just be ur genuine self and u will be unique, which is truly the best thing to be!|`|sC0NvRzEaa	I  don't think is bad, every person is unique even if they tell you you are average, you are unique in a way<br>  Good luck|`|3OP1YIXCaa	not at all. Everybody (even celebrities) is average in their own way. Average is totally normal and I personally think that it is the best.|`|rzc1oLktaa	Don't Listen To Them.They're probably jealous that there are not as great as you and average is just plain normal don't worry About It. :)<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	u asked this twice and i think u know the answer

NbJbZXtGaa	I think people are being too hard on her. While I do not agree whit the fact that she chose IVF to have more kids when she already had six, now that the babies are here, they are to be loved and cared for, which I am sure she will do. They are children of God, and He has a plan for each and every one of them or he would not have brought them into this world. I have seen a lot crazier people on this planet than her, and a lot of children who have it a lot worse off. I'm sorry, but since when does a child get to decide how many siblings they want to have? That argument is just ridiculous. They will not have a perfect life, but nobody is promised a perfect life in this world.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I don’t hate anyone. Hate is a very strong word.<br>  <br>  But did you just say “She made a mistake”? LOL. You’re kidding right?<br>  <br>  Honey, this was NO mistake. She knew exactly what she was doing!! And she will NOT pay for it for the rest of her life but the state of CA will!<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  Wow, she ADMITS her newborn babies were mistakes? She's even a better Mom than I originally thought!|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Why would I hate her?  I don't even know her.<br>  <br>  I feel what she did was disgusting and selfish but I don't waste emotion on anyone I don't know.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Of course I don't hate her. But unfortunately, she's not paying for her mistake - the taxpayers are. It's not so much that people are being mean to her (although yes, they are - issuing death threats to someone is horrible) as much as they can't imagine the immense stupidity and irresponsibility that went into such an undertaking. I don't see how people can say "Don't judge" when someone is not really being held accountable for their actions, yet the California taxpayers are and she's not? I would be pretty upset, too.<br>  <br>  ETA: It says even less about her credibility when she uses disability payments to fund her IVF when her own mother is struggling to keep her own house - her poor mom is tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and yet this woman continues to spend someone else's money. You could argue, however, that her mom is enabling her - but how could she turn her back on her grandkids? Tough call.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I don't hate her.  But I don't think what she did was just a "mistake" to have those treatments to get 8 babies at one time takes many, many, many choices.  So we are not talking about a person who made one bad decision.  And honestly those children are the ones that will likely have to pay the biggest price for her MISTAKES.<br>  <br>  And of that idiot of a doctor is the worst one.  He should have his license taken away.  He should have known better, especially if he is a doctor and he has those lives in his hands.  I mean we are so lucky that everyone lived from this situation.  The odds of the mother, and or one or more of those precious babies dying in that situation is very high.  Not to mention that what he did will cost tax payers MILLIONS and MILLIONS of dollars.<br>  <br>  I don't hate her, but don't think for one minute that she made just one mistake.|`|c2kopbo6aa	i do...what an idiot.....it wanst a mistake since she got pregnant on purpose with 8 kids plus the 6 she already has....and they live in a 3 bedroom home....shes an idiot...i feel bad her her children and hope they grow up with more common sense than she did...which i doubt|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Nah, I don't hate her.  I have better things to do with my time and energy.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Hate is an extremely strong word. I don't hate her, of course not. But she didn't make a mistake, she CHOSE to do that and she knew the risks she was taking when she chose to implant all 6 of those embryos. A responsible IVF doctor would only have done up to three at one time. <br>  <br>  You can see it in her eyes when she's talking. I think it was not only irresponsible of her, but cruel to her other children who ARE going to suffer b/c of those 8 other babies. She doesn't have enough time for the ones she's got now. It wasn't an accident. Unplanned pregnancy (you know, via actual intercourse) is an accident. She **chose** to do this.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I don't hate her but yes I do dislike her.  She chose to use her settlement money to do another round of IVF knowing there was no way she could support any more children.  She has a mental problem and should be treated for it before she is allowed to have her children in her custody.  We will also be paying for her mistakes since there is no way she can support her children on her own.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I don't at all agree with what she did...<br>  <br>  BUT..<br>  <br>  Its really no ones business.<br>  <br>  I think everyone is being a bit too harsh. She is get death threats and blogs bad mouthing her are showing up all over the internet etc. People everywhere are saying she should have all of her kids taken away. I think she knew she would end up with multiples but I don't think she thought she would get eight babies out the deal.<br>  <br>  She is going to have a very rough time raising 14 kids that are so close in age.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I don't hate her.  I don't know her, and I'm certainly not 'mean to her' because she has never met me.<br>  <br>  I DO think she did something very stupid, and by putting herself in the public eye, she leaves herself open for members of that public to express their opinions.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	because our HARD earned tax dollars go to that idiot ! i don't see her dumb a$$ out working 2 jobs to take care of HER family but we are Her and ppl like her are stealers I am sick and tired of them <br>  as for hate no or killing no but have who babies go to someone stable and mix her|`|SkFgDxpEaa	i have no effin clue why the jerks would hate her? maybe cu she got famouse from giving birth but they are no bodies.<br>  <br>  i am very surprised she gave birth and didn't get any comlications during her pregnancy, and if a big family is what she wants then its her choice.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i dont hate her.  but also have no respect for her.  i disagree with the lifestyle that she has brought so many innocent children into.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i dont hate her, people need to mind their own business and leave her alone..|`|Or7wuZpaaa	This woman was an only child and was lonely. Personally I think if this was India or Uganda and not America everyone would be praising her for having so many children. In those countries fat women are praised because they are seen as very fertile. Having large families is the custom. Over here and in Japan (or China) the culturally perferred limit is two which I think is entirely based on financial reasons. People need to realize there are plenty of single moms in this country with more than one kid and a full plate to carry. Maybe what the woman did was irresponsible to people who don't have the cash to satisfy their kids' every desire but that doesn't matter. There are homeless shelters and the point is no matter the living circumstances as long as her kids know she loves them and is doing her best to bond with them and nurture then that is what is important. Forget about the luxuries of life. She'll find a way to make it work the same way teen and college moms all over America find ways to juggle school, work, and parenting when they have babies before hitting their mid-20s. Anyone with the guts to hate this woman obviously has nothing better to with their energy. It's not like she aborted those 8 in vitro kids! She wants a large family to avoid loneliness. That's the point and she has them. People need to focus on their own lives and stop dipping in other people's Kool-Aid because they are bored with their lives or whatever.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Hate is a very strong word.  You have to be emotionally invested in someone to drum up that kind of passion.  But, I do dislike her in every sense of the word.  She has ruined her mother's financial stability and has made every decision based only on her own selfish desires.  what ever happened to thinking about your family and what is best for them.  In what universe would having 14 kids be appropriate when one hasn't worked in 3 years, is unmarried, has 3 children with disabilities already, lives in a 3 bedroom pigsty, and already received government aid to support the 6 she already had.  Instead of putting whatever money she cold into her family, she got plastic surgery and implants.  She continued to have children with one hand constantly begging for hand outs.  She expected a new house to be donated, a bus for transportation, and all the baby supplies to be gifted to her.  how about taking care of your own business?  And, let's make no mistake about it, it is our business.  she made it our business when she CHOSE to get implanted with 14 children she couldn't support in any manner.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I have plenty going on in my life with all the stress of making ends meet without having to dip into my pocket for every irresponsible dope that chooses to end up with 14 kids when she couldn't even support the first few she had.  oh and BTW JOHNATHAN---She has always survived with HER HANDS DIPPING INTO EVERYONE'S ELSES KOOL AID.  Not the other way around.  and there is a very big difference between luxuries and basic needs.  I do not have many luxuries, but I sure have a clean, warm roof over my children's heads, food on their table, and clothes on their backs.  Not name brands, not eating out at the best restaurants, and not living high on the hog.  The hell I'm going to help her live a normal life when we bust our hump to have the liffe we have with no one's help but hard work and long hours.  She should try it some time.|`|AA12262106	I don't hate her at all. I feel sorry for her because she's misguided and has bitten off more than she can chew.<br>    The problem here is that people feel that it's their business because ultimately it's the taxpayer that's going to foot the enormous bills that come with so many children. There is no way that she's going to be able to support all those children, and some people resent the fact that she was so irresponsible as to undertake such commitment without having any resources to meet the demands.|`|ykcgrOBzaa	I don't hate her, but she was really stupid. I mean, she already had 6 kids, she was single, and living with her mom in a 3 bedroom house. The only reason she wanted kids is because she was lonely. Now the kids are going to suffer for her selfishness. She can't take care of them. Now the people in the US have to pay for her house and car and baby supplies. We are already in debt. We don't need some crazy lady having babies.|`|o34YHLiraa	Nope, I don't. I think she made a really dumb decision and that she might have some social or mental difficulties to overcome, but I don't hate her for her decision. She did what she did... other peoples' reproductive tracts are not my business.|`|oV0Lux4Maa	Hate no, but find it ridiculous that an unemployed women can get in vetro to have another kid while not paying for the first six she had. <br>  I feel bad for the kids and my wallet that is going to end up paying for them.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I don't hate her but I think she needs mental help. She had those babies for the fame of it, not out of love. Any mother with 6 kids already knows that having more kids is selfish and not for the best of the kids.|`|PumDOQC9aa	I DON'T KNOW HER TO HATE HER .BUT PEOPLE NEED TO STAY OUTTA HER LIFE .IF SHE'S WANTS MORE THEN 8 KIDS SHE CAN.

I'm sorry, just my opinion!!! you don't want her scratching her face if she moves her arms around as well... (with the bracelet) i don't even think that would fit a newborn?? She isn't going to like it... she just spent 9 months in the fetal position, babies NEED to be swaddled to be content... she won't like it, think of her not you... <br>  <br>  The crib though is pretty! congrats!<br>  <br>  I would also move that space heater at least 12-16 inches away from that crib... NOT SAFE...|`|iwYu32N2aa	I agree with your friend, it seems a little much, but its your baby and your decision. Cute but I wouldnt put it on my little girl|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I really don't like the dress.  It's way too much and doesn't look comfortable. But I love the crib and bracelet a lot.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	You must just be so tremendously excited.<br>  <br>  What you get your baby is of course your preference.  However, I agree with some of the others here...the dress might just be a little much.  Remember that newborns have very sensitive skin, so synthetic fabrics might not be so comfortable for them.  In addition, they like to be bundled up and warm, so the dress might prove a little to chilly for a newborn to wear.<br>  <br>  You still have plenty of time to decide or change your mind.  Good luck to you.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	That dress is absolutely breath-taking, and I don't think it's too much! Where did you find it? The bracelet is very pretty. Is she just wearing it home? Or do you have other plans for it as well? I love the set-up that you have for the crib. It converts, right? My daughter has a very similar one. I love the cherry finish on it. As for the bedding, I think that it's cute, and also very smart, because you can reuse it with other children that you may have regardless of their gender! Good luck and Congrats!|`|AA10458750	Well, it's not your friend's baby. I think the dress is pretty but may be overwhelming for the baby who is already gonna be in shock & awe at the world around her. And, a crib is a crib in my opinion as long as it serves it purpose.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I'm 28 weeks too. Congrats. The crib is super nice! So is the dress, however, it seems a bit too uch for the homecoming. I am getting something warm and comfy to bring the baby home in, also my first, also a girl.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yea i think its very pretty but i would think it would be worn for like baptizing or something ... it def may be too much to be wearing for the way home from the hospital .. but its allll up to u of course.|`|jBIaUfUzaa	aww thats a cute outfit, an the bracelet is gorgeous congratz on the little girl<br>  <br>  im due in october i know its gonna be a boy so i am gonna take him home in a tigger costume =)|`|MDfleEXWaa	everything is so perfect !!! now im beginnning to wonder what i need to get for my baby boy now :) all the best :) ur goin to be an amazing mom:)|`|fHgbL046aa	I love the dress what about some purple booties or socks.  The bracelet is so cute and small. I was wondering about your crib. Is the change table attached to the crib or is it separate, and you pushed it together. I also read that bumper pads can suffocate babies. I used them for my first and everything is fine. However, I was reading about children who suffocate on those and came across a new design that is mesh and breathable. I remember asking a nurse if I can put a dress on my baby for pictures. I know "Duh" My daughter came home is something different because it was February. I'm pregnant with my second and he or she will be born in July I could pull out the dress and put the new baby in it. This dress is from 1993 so its definitely dated.LOL I will probably buy a new outfit. My little girl looked so cute in the dress, sadly she is now 16 years old.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Well it is a lot for a new born. but hey your the mommy and the dress is really cute! Along with the braclet. I think its going to be fine, but she might need a little jacket its kinda not exactly hot out side. well here it isn't.<br>  Good luck & best wishes!|`|VmBT4Tlcaa	I would use the dress for pictures but not for coming home in!!  You want her to be comfortable  AND cute....not just cute!  Love the bracelet and the crib is awesome, but the pic above the crib is a little scary for a baby's room!|`|21LiTNVsaa	that dress is for a new born? i think it is too much bc it does not look comfortable at all, they are not going to a ball or something|`|ce8COixxaa	The crib is BEAUTIFUL!! Hey, it's your sweet baby girl, you dress her however you want ;) I am sure she will look wonderful in it! Congratulations!!|`|afAbSq5gaa	I dont know about the dress but its your preference, im sure she will look cute no matter what. But i must say i love love love love the crib, its absolutely gorgeous!|`|qicxk5GMaa	the dress is beautiful but I plan on dressing my baby in cute comfy cotton one piece outfits.
B1JFBV3jaa	Based on your other questions, you seem to have a lot of drama with your kids and their fathers.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Quite frankly, I think your lying.  I am a little bitter though because one of my questions got deleted, but crap like this doesn't.  Let me guess, 2 different guys raped you in a 3 day period???  Were you walking around naked or what???  I call bull$hit!!!|`|gdaimMuoaa	well when the baby is conceived you might want to get a paternity test on the husband to see if he is the father. And don't listen to people when they say to get a paternity test when your still pregnant because this may cause a miscarriage|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Wow,you poor girl.What a bad time of it you have been having.What,your 1st husband died,then you got pregnant by your live in boyfriend,did you get your 1st girls last name changed to his?Then you went out of town and got raped 2 times in  a matter of 3 days what,were you held prisoner for 3 days or what?Did you know & get the last name of the man/men who raped you?Well it is a good thing that you were with your husband during your conception time.Then you didn't even tell your husband that you were raped??Man,it must suck to be you!|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Well I guess you'll find out when the baby comes. You can request a DNA test.<br>  <br>  If this is a REAL question, you should tell your hubby what happened to you.  You did nothing wrong.|`|4a794be0b10e1654ae311d5a98cb3b2eaa	Im just curious why you didnt go to the police after you were raped not once but twice????|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	paternity test. are you still with your husband? im sorry that happened to you.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	How come if you were raped twice, you never told anyone?  This is a horrible situation for you to be in.  Talk to your doctor, if you can trust him or her, and tell her everything about your concerns.  She might be able to help you pin down the dates.  Try not to worry so much about something you can't change anyway.  You've got to stay healthy for you and the baby.  Hopefully it'll all turn out okay and your husband is the father.  But if he's not, there's always a chance he'll grow suspicious and wonder why you didn't tell him before.  Talk to your doctor, it's part of her job to help you with your emotional state as well as the physical part of it.  If she can't help you, ask her for someone who can...they have experience with these types of problems.|`|wWk1q5vRaa	Something with your story doesn't ring true...you were raped on BOTH the 12 AND the 15th? Uh...A rape is not something that usually happens twice in a three day period--sounds like it was consensual...|`|a30ecb945fa87adba95177ae3c5294a7aa	It depends on how many guys you slept with.  If your still in doubt try asking Maury Povich.  He knows everything.
4eTyCuRSaa	This is a tough predicament.  I'm sure you appreciate that gma and gpa are just tickled to have their new grandchild to love, protect and snuggle up with,  What an joy it must be to cuddle such a joy!<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, for the child's safety I would never recommend an adult sleeping with the child because of the threat of the adult rolling over on the child and smothering them.  This is just basic good parenting.<br>  <br>  As for baths NO.  There is no reason at any age for a child to be in a bath with an adult.  Besides who wants their baby soaking in dirty adult water YUCK.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I can see where it freaks you out if it's not something even you do with your kids. <br>  <br>  I would be more concerned about grandma or grandpa going to sleep and rolling over on my child simply because they're not used to sleeping with an infant/baby. And the bathtime thing - no way.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	the whole adult in the bath with kids is just weird to me.  i've never bathed with my kids - i just don't get it.  but i can see parents doing it - as far as extended family, absolutely not.  as for naps, personally our kids are in our bed all the time so i don't see a problem with it - but every parent has their own rules - just lay down yours with the in laws and it'll be fine.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i think that the not allowing grandma and grandpa to nap with your child is a little bit over board.  but i grew up being very close with my grandparents.  I took naps with my granparents until the day the died.  However, i do agree with the tub thing.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Having grown up in abusive home, the granddad in the bath with the three year old would bother me too. A baby I could see (my babies HATED baby bathtubs and I hated those stupid bath seats), but a three year old is most definitely old enough ot sit by herself. We used to take our boys into the bath with us, but it stopped when they were around 5. But we did it because it was fun for them, they enjoyed it. It was also an easier way to get INTO the bath (my boys... ugh, it was a fight getting them into the tub every night), so it was a kill two birds with one stone sort of thing. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're overreacting at all. It's definitely good to have boundaries and I definitely think that as their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles should respect those boundaries. Boundaries get crossed way too often in this country. It's what molestation is all about. So if you ask me, your husband is wrong. lol|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I'm with you on the bath thing....because really, who wants to be peed on by a kid in the bathtub?  I tried it once or twice when my kids were babies and the whole time I kept thinking, ICK, what if they pee on me?<br>  <br>  As for the snuggling, napping or sleeping together, I don't have an issue with that.  I think it's just personal preference...but an extra snuggle or two is a good thing.  Physical love and affection are good for kids!|`|91sbAzoaaa	ummm i do believe there should be boundaries.... but family napping with your one year old in my eyes isn't bad, now if u think they would do something to your child of course ..thats a big fat NO! but if you trust them and u know they won't do anything then why worry. especially grandparent they spoil their grandbabies....but i think it's to soon for you to think about your 1 year old sleeping with friends later.. and in the end it about how u bring them up and show them whats wrong or right... and even then they still don't listen.<br>  what about if one day your 1 year old sit next to grandma and get sleepy ... is she to get up and leave the baby to nap alone when he/she obviously wanted to be cuddling with grandma... sorry but on that one i think your a bit overboard.<br>  <br>  the batheing i agree with|`|JivuAmfiaa	We have three key rules for my parents and in-laws;<br>  1) You don't let them pig out on sweets and junk food<br>  2) You do not let them kid you that they are allowed to drink alcohol, play darts, use large knives, etc.<br>  3) You DO NOT let my seven year old out of the house with the car keys (previous experience)<br>  <br>  As for the lying in bed with him I agree with you, I think it's okay to lie next to him (on top of the covers) for a few minutes whilst he dozes off but not actually sleep in the bed with him. Maybe if it was in the middle of the night and he wouldn't settle then it would be okay, but in the middle of the day there's no need.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|cteyFJxhaa	My parents have always been very respectful of my rules.  My SIL on the other hand is evil!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm totally with you on the no bathing.  The napping I'm ok with.  My dad likes a nap on Sunday afternoon too so if they both went and laid down for an hour, no biggie, but it would be on top of the blankets.  Like you say, not because anything weird would happen, just because that's what's appropriate. <br>  <br>  My parents have also always called to ask before they buy expensive presents *love that* but my SIL spoils the kids rotten and lets them do things I don't allow and then says.....OMG get this.....don't tell your parents...WTF???  You're teaching them it's ok to sneak around behind our back???  That used to make me crazy!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I tend to agree with your husband.  My mom, who I idolize, slept with my kids when they sleep at her house since they were born.  They grew out of it now that they are "big boys".  But they have a special bond with her that I wouldn't change for anything.  I don't think it sends the message that just because you sleep with grandma it's ok to sleep with anyone.  Grandparents feel a special connection with the grandbabies and if you have in-laws that want that kind of relationship, I'd say you're one of the lucky ones and you should be thankful.  Absolutely nothing wrong with granny napping with her grandbaby!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	I disagree. My son is 23 months and has slept in the same bed as his grandparents (my in-laws). My mother and mother-in-law have showered him. I still sleep in bed with him for our naps (i get tired too during the day, lol). I wouldn't let anyone else other than his grandparents and my sister sleep in the same bed as him or help shower him but at, 23 months, I can't see anything wrong with his grandparents or favourite aunty cuddling him. laying next to him, seeing him naked or bathing him! <br>  But, you need to do what makes you feel comfortable. If you don't feel comfortable having anyone else other than you and your husband bath or share a bed with your toddler than, that's your perogative. If it's something you feel stongly about, I think your husband should respect that.
pT7jrsAgaa	I sympathize with you so much!  My son has tourette's, he's 12, and he plays on our organized soccer league.  My situation is a little different in that my son has been playing since he was 5 so everyone knows him and is used to him "shouting" out.  Also, my son is able to suppress the aggressive tics until he is in his safe place...home.  I'm proud that you want to give your son all the normalcy of being a kid.  I find it truly unfair and sometimes appalling at how little other kids are being taught of acceptance.  I would speak to the coach in your case, though.  If he's a decent human being, he will be patient with your son and expect his teammates to be as well. EVERY child deserves the chance to be child!! Good luck to you!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	kids are impatient and mean..So are coaches<br>  I think its a mistake. They are all bent on scores and being jocks ..not playing a game and camaraderie
RiqNF0l1aa	a contractions is a very very painful feeling all around your belly. not to scare you or anything but mines felt like someone taking a knife and cutting me. But those are the major contractions. The little ones aren't that bad they just feel like cramps but a little worse. All I can tell you is when they offer you the drugs TAKE THEM. They will be your best friend. Get the happy button. That way when the drugs wear off you can get another shot of them instantly. Good luck|`|i8Ch743Laa	if you're that worried,you need to get to a hospital. That way the drs can check you out. They will be able to stop it,if it's labor. Call 911 if you've got no way to the hospital.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	its just feels like the whole thing goes tight and hard for a few seconds they goes away again<br>  <br>  it doesnt hurt so much at first so your kind of unsure<br>  <br>  they get more painfull as it goes on and closer together then you relise!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: i dont know why we are all getting thumbs down what do you want us to do lie!!|`|2DM7MaXyaa	feels like a menstrual period cramp. when you go into real labor they get very strong and painful and unbearable.. but the good thing about that is thats when you get to have medicine lol! good luck and congrats|`|YP3rEESUaa	Your whole stomach will tighten and will feel hard as rock when you touch it, this was how I knew I was having one when I didn't feel the pain.  other wise it feels like really bad menstrual cramps.|`|AA10458750	They say at this time, it is more likely braxton hicks contractions and not preterm labor. My Dr. said to be concerned if after an hour the contractions get normal and stronger. Braxton Hicks will come and go....|`|59SM8kFIaa	it is a squeezing  felling your belly will tight up allover!! and it may or may not hurt so bad!!|`|9aRvkwLyaa	I really want to know as well, i am 36 weeks.. <br>  I don't even know how the BH feel like. Every movement i feel i just think it's the baby.<br>  So god help me if i have contractions and don't realize. <br>  <br>  And this waiting game, gosh... I just want it to go fasssssssssstttt!!!|`|RcKQYqJeaa	My OBGYN tld me it feels like cramps at first... and then she said they start to increase in pain and in severity....<br>  <br>  She said its pretty much your muscles contracting in your stomach getting ready t push the baby out...<br>  <br>  It'll start small then work its way to more intense...|`|ihL0FkJYaa	it is a squeezing felling your belly will tight up allover!! and it may or may not hurt so bad!! it should ease up in a few weeks
JRXpYW3Naa	Its completely normal. My cousin used to make like weekly trips to the doctor.....we gave on the ER, and just went straight to his doctor. I remember one time he managed to jump down the steps and somehow a plug from a toaster got lodged into his foot....the toaster had been plugged in.(Its also normal for girls that age, too, so don't be alarmed)|`|h03FTbXLaa	its completely normal!!<br>  me being a 13 year old girl, i walk into tables and chairs...and pretty much anything you can imagine! i trip over my own feet...and somehow managed to fall up my stairs lol. <br>  pretty much every kid that i know that is my age is very clumsy!<br>  its just cuz we're at an awkward stage, and its hard to get used to our bodies..don't worry, he'll grow out of it.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	wow he is really clumsy poor thing. i dont think thats normal and yes maybe he should get a second opinion about his eyes. one doctor may be able to see what the other cant.|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	now my opinion and im not being stupid here... seizures of some kind...minor or major....they lasts for seconds, a black out ... id have him checked....when a person just falls out.. or ends up with unexplainable marks i would say seizures
OQnRP6xVaa	No you can not adopt anyone yet--you are not an adult and you need to wait until you are able to provide not just attention and care but, a home and security.<br>  <br>  Finish high school--go to college and lay a foundation first... You have a lifetime to put your experience into action.<br>  <br>  ...and it really is most preferred for a child to have both a mother and a father so.... choose your husband well and discuss adopting before your wedding.<br>  <br>  You might enjoy the Big Brother -- Big Sister program. Check your phonebook and apply.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Your not old enough and you are not able to provide for yourself and a child. If you really want to spend time with children, why not consider volunteering someplace where you can do that.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	No-first you have to be able to show a residence thats safe and proof of income. Also you must be of legal age-18 at least. Most of the time they do give preferance to married over single too-|`|2wyDALHgaa	Nope, in spite of any good intentions you may have you would be prohibited from adopting a child until you are old enough (usually over 21 in most areas) and are financial and socially mature enough to adopt.  I don't mean that as any sort of slam, it's just the way things are.|`|IWinNj2saa	Nope, they sure wouldn't. Hopefully no moron would give a baby to a 16 year old.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	BWAHAHAHAHA! Not a chance. If you want a baby go bump uglies like normal teens who want to be parents.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	HA!  NO!  geez.  some people.  most agencies want potential parents to be at least 25.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Being 16, I am sad to see you ask this question. <br>  <br>  If you really had to ask this because you are unsure, you surely shouldnt be caring for your own child, adopted or not. You are surely very uneducated to not understand why you, at your age can not adopt a child, nor understand why not. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	No.  You are not legally an adult.  But there's more to it than that.  There's a very long process, parenting classes, check on how you support yourself, whether or not you're married.  Not to mention you need to fork over $10,000 in fees & court costs.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	No, sorry but no. There are plenty of older, educated and settled families waiting to adopt. Why do you think they would overlook them to give a child to another child?|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	no, they will not let you adopt|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	no your not leagle age for a contract.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	no....thats great that you want to adopt a child but why so soon?? you are so young and have plenty of time for that|`|frpCK0utaa	no. you are not legally an adult.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	Uhhhh, no.|`|hTieELhTaa	HAHAHAHAHA thats too funny!!! Are you really serious?? To have a child you have to be able to support it and raise it. Being 16 I dont know how #1 you would make enough money to buy a house a car and diapers and everything else. You wouldnt be able to adopt and it be yours if you expect your parents to pay for everything, it would be your parents that adopted!!!! But I guess if you can get your own house prove to the state that you are fianacialy stable and can take full responsibility for the child offer it the best possible home enviorment that is stable and good for the babys growth and education and then be able to fork out the tens of thousands of dollars it cost to adopt then they might put you on the list. But reality is there are already 100's of couples on that list that have degrees and make good money that have been waiting for years to adopt. So GROW UP and think really hard about things if you want a baby go have sex and have one. Thats your only option right now|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Um.  NO.  In raising your cousin's kid, I highly doubt that you were the sole caregiver, paying for all medical needs, food, shelter, clothing... etc...<br>  <br>  You have to be much older, usually 21 to adopt.  Then the other list of qualifications come into play.  You have to have a place to live.  You have to have a job.  You have to have a stable life style.  You have to have money.  <br>  <br>  Even if you are able at this age, legally you cannot do it.  You are not emotionally ready to handle this yet, and it would most likely put strain on those around you who would end up supporting the child when you are unable to.  In my state you aren't even able to hold a full time job until you are 18.  You usually have to have a full time job to get medical/dental insurance.  This is something you pretty much HAVE to have when raising a child.<br>  <br>  For the time being, you can go volunteer in places where children are in need.  There are shelters and day care centers for low-income children.  You can ask them if you can come entertain the children for a while, or see if anyone in your area needs a babysitter.  If you are committed to helping children, doing charity work and speaking out on issues you believe are important will prepare you for your future as a caregiver and a mother.  Where there is a will, there is a way...  When you are of age...|`|ODosyM8zaa	I'm sorry to say this but no the government would not give a child to a 16 year old. You have to be 21 to adopt and at least 18 if you are gaining custody of a sibling/relative. <br>  You are young and have tons of time for a baby later on. You should be worried about movies and school and yes, even boys (to a certain extent!). No matter how much money you have, you will struggle. If a married couple with only 1 child can struggle, so will you love. Good luck and think about this thoroughly!|`|ymolgHz5aa	Thats so cool you would wanna do something like that. You probably wouldn't be able to directly, but maybe if your parents adopted a child for then that might work. I bet you would be a great mom, and don't listen to those other rude comments people made. Just if you can get a child through your parents make sure its real what you want to do.|`|6fa0d7a719a9cb603bd2633556bf7fb6aa	I don't think so.  I know you think that you might be ready to parent but you need to mature a little more also most agency aer looking for 2 parent families.  or you could do designated adoption is some one wanted you to adopt their child and you could get a home study done you could go through the courts. but i would not recommend that|`|tz1aVHoUaa	awww that's so sweet, i knwo how you feel as i raised my twin sisters since birth as both my parents work, i don't think they'd let us 16 year olds adopt due to our age and they'd look at us as unfit to handle children and immature, i think the age is 18 for consent. i bet you would make a good mum and i know you will be. good luck<br>  XxxMwahXxx|`|IJnP9oJqaa	Absolutely not - not unless you're legally emancipated and declared an "adult" by the court.  Otherwise, you have to wait until you're either 18 or 21, depending on the state.|`|c07e0f24c3682b117ef0d6b9104269fbaa	No...you can not adopt and take responsibility for another human being when you are not even legally responsible for yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  period.|`|xkCl5tIdaa	u silly silly girl u are still a child and u want to adopt a baby grow up and get to school where u should be|`|Afoabqblaa	Pop out your own cause you are too young to adopt!|`|9hreptv4aa	Nope you have to have your own baby|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Hi, I see that you said you are turning 16.  I was 16 when I had my son.  I had help with my son from my parents.  My parents ended up raising my son for most of his years.  Not because I was a bad parent.  But because I didn't grow.  My parents raised my son because my son became ATTACHED to them.  Don't get me wrong, I was mom and they were the grandparents, but they had stability and I didn't. Also, two families under one roof does not work very well and alot of times ends in bitter words.  Anyways  After having my son, I took care of him.  He was my responsibility.  I got up with him 4 times a night, each and every night.  Then I went to school.  Studied my butt off and when I came home, my son was my responsibility, not my moms.  I took care of him, did my homework, fed him, did my homework, bathed him, did my homework.  Are you understanding where I am coming from?  I did have alot of adults tell me I was very mature for my age.  But, I never really got to go do anything.  I never left my son behind.  If I wanted to hang out with my friends, I took my son.  We would visit at their home with their parents there.  My friends all would go partying, running around the mall.  Sleep overs.  Not me and if you have a child, not you either. My son is now turning 21 in April.  Time flies fast.  I dearly love my son and would only change a couple things if I could do it over again.  I would have worked harder in school to make sure we got further in life. I would not have just jumped on the first man wagon to find a father for my son and would have been picky.  Because of my immature decisions, My son has lived with me for a total of about 6 years now.  He has seen and been through bad things in life that a child of his age at that time, shouldn't have endured.  Like seeing his mom get hit, having not one but two stepfathers who never cared enough to truelly get to know and love him. He is truelly a wonderful young man.  But, I wasn't financially or emotionally capable of taking great care of him. <br>  You may have raised your cousins, but you now need time to be a teen yourself.  Expect more out of life instead of picking up the pieces from that cousin of yours.  You did well taking care of them.  But you will miss out on a HUGE chunk of your life if you don't discover your life as a teen.  Take care and good luck with the rest of your teenage years.

Do you live alone, with a guy, with your parents? all these things makes a difference. I did it solo my whole life, and at time we struggled hard, i busted my *** to get up where we are now and i know women twice my age who couldn't have pulled it off nearly as well as i have, this in itself warms me a heart a little. But ya know looking back, i wouldn't trade it in for anything, what i can tell you is i wish i could have waited. I wish i could have spares her and me a whole lot of heartache and sleepless nights. One thing i guess i did differently was i wasn't a baby anymore, no going out, my friends at the time were told our lives have gone in separate directions, and my parents wrote me off. I couldn't look at the ppl i called friends and tell them i love then and then subject them to that sort of life, have then thinking it was ok and it was cool. Any way best of luck to you, you can be a great Momma, if you stick to it and do it yourself.|`|cnyU6KXzaa	That is way too young, but you are not here to hear that. I would give it up for adoption but you don't want to hear that either. So I suppose as long as you can provide comfortably for your child, be a responsible mother and go to college it would be ok. I am not completely sure why you are asking this question, nor why you would care how other people feel. This is a HUGE question and I would say you shouldn't be looking for sympathy, but should be looking to help your son/daughter instead. From what I understand your question as, this is the best I can come up with.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i think people are just sick and tired of seeing swollen bellies. alot of us don't understand why its SO hard to NOT have sex if you're not prepared for a baby. i agree that some teens can pull it off depending on how their family is and the schedule. but what you have to understand is that while you're going to school, someone has to look out for your baby. if its daycare that's fine, but when its a family member, to me that's just putting the burden on your whole family all because teenagers wouldn't use their heads before jumping into a situation. i just believe that its just a very irresponsible thing to do especially to their parents who have to work extra hard to feed another mouth.<br>  <br>  i also don't understand WHY its so hard for people to wait, you would think that people would want to finish their education, get a good job, have their own home, save alot of money,. be independent, have a SPOUSE that wont run out on you when youre pregnant, and THEN have a baby.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i was too smart to get pregnant when i was a teenager.  and no offense, but the way you speak/spell makes me worried for the future of your child.|`|3OP1YIXCaa	because it makes life harder whether you know it or not. Also, most teen parents are not as dedicated and hard working as you. <br>  <br>  The reason teens hate teen parents is very simple. Because adults see so many teen parents, all teens have been stereotyped and we don't like being labeled as sluts and whores just because some girls became teen moms. <br>  <br>  I don't have anything against teen moms but I don't want to become one either.|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Because they blantantly ignore all the good advice that's been given to them about safe sex and still get pregnant anyways. Teenagers often times are too self-absorbed to think about the risks involved with sex. 15 years old should NOT be having sex. At 15 you don't even have an education, let alone a job or income. Parents should be emotionally and financially capable enough to become parents.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	It is truly a sad commentary on the sad state of education when someone who can't spell (skewl, tru, acually, ur) and who can barely write coherently (like is, repeated use of "like," is one thing) is a "straight A" student.  And since you have all-but-destroyed your chances to get through college and enter a decent career path, you shouldn't be surprised that someone might dare to think you are "dumb."  Most of us who bothered to wait about having children until we were in a position to adequately raise those children KNOW how hard Life can be and, therefore, do everything possible to prevent "children from having children."  But young people like you think they know all they need to know and apparently have never learned the lesson that a person doesn't have to have something simply because they WANT it.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I dunno why so many peeps judge teen parents, i am one, and i can't stand it when peeps judge me.  Even before i became a teen parent i never judged them, i actual commend most teen parents, cuz they step up and take responsiblity for there child, which is the right thing to do.  I am so with u on this, peeps need to leanr to put themselves in our place, and they need to stop judgin us.  I wouldn't change havin my son for anythin, and i'm sure u feel the same way about ur daughter.  <br>  Good luck with ur baby, :D.<br>  If u ever wanna talk feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yea i agree about the whole spelling thing, who cares how we spell and stuff online, it's not like we don't know how it's just easier to type like this vs. typin and spellin everythin right, or usin correct grammar all the time.
VzLkSZ4faa	My dad told me about this place the other night. I haven't been there yet but it's called the crisis pregnancy center. They have them all around the us. They are a nonprofit company and their services are at very little to no charge. Good luck! <br>  I just looked it up 1513 W Thomas rd. The number is 602-393-7501.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Apply for medicaid.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Nope... no such thing as a free u/s.  If you don't have insurance, see about getting on state insurance.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Good luck with that,there's some charge everywhere you go.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	no sorry hope you find somewhere though<br>  <br>   i live in the UK so healthcare is free|`|GE0Qb3iwaa	want 2 pts<br>  srry|`|AzSmZblpaa	Unfortunately, ultrasounds are a) expensive and b) not really medically necessary. So it's unlikely you'll find someplace to give you repeat ultrasounds for free. If you have prenatal care (I hope) there might be one at the beginning to date the pregnancy, especially if you say you don't know when you conceived and aren't sure of the date of your last period.<br>  <br>  I understand what it's like to need reassurance after a miscarriage, though. For ~$20/mo you can rent a fetal doppler that will allow you to hear the heartbeat at home (storkradio.com has one for $20/mo and babybeat.com has one for $24/mo). It's a much cheaper way to check on the kid.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
nhgQKvwEaa	yes it should work, especially since you took it within the time frame. your period should come when it was originally suppose to come. if it doesn't come, take a test. It should though, Plan B is very effective.|`|FpeEJbhaaa	EC is about 89% effective when taken properly.  In other words, the odds are in your favor.  Your period should arrive around its normal time - although if you're stressing out about it don't be surprised if it arrives a few days late.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I have taken it, I guess there is really no way to know if it has worked or not because you take it before there is any way to know if you will become pregnant or not. It is supposed to make it so that a fertilized egg cannot attach anywhere (implantation). It does nothing if this has already taken place. You should get your period when you usually get it.|`|H8c8vt3Yaa	No it doesn't because me and my baby mama took it following sex and now I have Keyshawn and Jerome to prove it.
ZS7MM6Xvaa	Okay, well first of all a lot of "natural" births occur between 39 - 41 weeks, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.<br>  Secondly, I agree with what others have said as far as you will still be recovering when he comes home.  So you need to think about whether you want to have him there for the birth or there after.  Have you asked him what he thinks?  Maybe he wants to be there for the baby to be born?  Since this is your first, I want to remind you that an average recovery time is 6 weeks.  That's not getting you to your pre-labor state, that's getting you to the point where you should be able to be up and around without too much discomfort and bleeding.  Everyone's recovery time is different, but don't expect to be up and perky for your hubby only a short time after giving birth!  And, you will likely get the most sleep of the next few months that first few days to a week, when the baby sleeps the most.  Sleep time for baby = sleep time or hands free time for you...<br>  Finally, I don't think it hurts to talk to your doctor about it.  I don't think it's that big of a deal, honestly, and the worst your doctor can say is no!|`|zwctZ812aa	Why wouldn't you want to wait and see if he could possibly be here for the birth? Induction is no fun no fun no fun.  You really should just wait to go on your own, it won't be too much longer.  I don't really know what you mean by not being able to do anything when he is here.  If you mean sexual, you won't anyways even if you had the baby today.  you need to wait 6 weeks to make sure you're healed.  If you mean like going out and stuff, again, you won't be able to anyways because you will have a newborn.  The best thing for your baby and for your body would be to let the baby come when he is ready.  You don't ahve to worry about your husband not being able to see him...you're almost to your due date and your doctor would probably induce at 41-42 weeks anyways.|`|MqFeJiukaa	I do not think you should try to be induced.  Any good Dr would not induced for convenience in my opinion.  There are risks involved with induction including higher c-section rate.  Not to mention its a harder labor with more interventions.  I have had to be induced (for medical reasons) with 2 of my kids and even though I have been over due when going into labor on my own its worth it.  I guess I just don't understand why people are so quick to ask for induction.  I am as sick of being pregnant as anyone else but when you let the baby come when the baby is ready then you reduced the chance of the baby having any health issues.  I am 39 weeks, 4cm 75% effaced, -1 station and had a membrane strip and I still have not had any labor contractions.  My midwife was surprised when I told her I would not be induced unless my sons health is at risk.  I was surprised she was surprised.  If God wanted us to give birth to babies by being induced He wouldn't have created natural labor.  Just my opinion though.|`|AA11206135	Why wouldn't you want your husband to see his baby be born?????That's bizarre.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	no 39wks isnt even full term <br>  <br>  the babys health is the most important im sure the daddy will understand that|`|szE6NtO5aa	It wouldn't hurt to ask. A lot of people are going to give you grief about your question would be my guess. I am also 39 weeks this sunday and my doc is inducing me on Monday because he is leaving town and will be gone over my due date. He feels perfectly confident that it will be fine, and so do I. Every doc is different, some more willing than others to induce, but there is no harm in asking.<br>  <br>  By the way, to the answer that says 39 weeks isn't full term- yes it is. 38 weeks and beyond is considered full term.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I'm sure they could induce you if you asked.  Wouldn't you like to wait though and maybe he could be here to see his first baby born?  You could even arrange to be induced the day he comes home if you want.. or the day after since you aren't supposed to have sex for like 6wks after giving birth.. and sex could help naturally induce you.  Just a thought.  But if you want to have the baby earlier, just talk to your dr.|`|xwZKouCIaa	Dont do it let nature take its course, but u could try to speed things along u could to stimulate your nipples (yes i kno this is weird) if u have a breast pump already u could try to pump your milk this will cause your uterus to contract and may kick start your labor but believe me u dont want them to induce you with chemicals like pitossin this can cause some seiously painful contractions so its best if you do it the natural way..|`|VmBT4Tlcaa	Yeah, if you WANT to have a c-section!  The chances of a c-section are WAY higher if you are induced.  Also, if you are induced for this pregnancy the chances of you having to be induced for all your other kids is higher as well.  Let G-d do His work.  He knows when it is best for you to have this baby!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	Never hurts to ask although I'm under the understanding that they won't induce you unless your overdue with your first. They may "strip you membranes" though and see if that helps. Good luck!|`|K6Ja5SNbaa	thats not a good idea, i dnt think it is a serious reason. let ur husband see his child be born that would be a real gift to give him.|`|GE0Qb3iwaa	srry i want 2 pts|`|2DM7MaXyaa	not sure. being induced is alot harder on the baby and more painful for the mother. i was induced and next baby i hope i go over. i was induced at 35 wks. but anyways, its not a good idea but it really depends on your dr. even if you have baby earlier the healing process is still a few wks and i dont see you being drastically different healing wise just because you got induced earlier. but it would be nice if you got to have baby while your husband is in town because he loves you and doesnt care what you look like and its a very special moment the moment that baby is born. good luck and congrats.|`|jzl2hxdaaa	absoluley, you deserve to have your husband there and so does your baby. There is no harm in delivering at 39 weeks. Your baby is fully developed and ready to be born. If your dr has a heart at all he/she will deliver while your hubby is here. Ask to be induced i'm certain your dr will understand. I'm a mother of three and one on the way i've had 3 c-sections which are always scheduled a week b4 your due date. Congrats to you and your family. I hope you husband has a safe deployment! God Bless :)|`|AA12345219	While it's always more natural for your body to wait until it's fully ready to give birth, 39 weeks is not "too early" to be induced. Your baby IS full term. I'm being induced next week at 38 weeks + 3 days and though the risk of c-section is higher, the baby is mature enough. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, that even if you have the baby before he gets home, you'll probably still be in some recovery mode and won't be up for doing a lot (not to mention you can't have sex for six weeks), so weigh your choices of your husband missing the baby being born and your recovery.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Eeep, I still wanted to cry myself though =\|`|cen8SIssaa	I'm sure she will be fine, my son is the same age and that sounds like something he would def cry about (taking the cheerio). dont feel bad it was an accident and that is going to happen to the best of us!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	She is probably fine! Your reaction may have scared her more than anything!|`|K7H1zrCbaa	it was an accident.  give yourself a break|`|zjuMrDmGaa	She's fine, it wasn't a cement pylon you dropped on her, it was a cell phone and these days they're teeny.

Kid's heads are pretty hard.  She was probably more mad and scared with you jumping so fast at her to see what was in her mouth.  I know my son gets really upset with me when I do that.|`|AA10949064	Honestly - most of it was probably dramatized.  They know that crying gets attention.  I'm sure it hurt a little, but she'll be just fine.  She has probably already forgotten about it.  It's ok mom - we're not perfect.  As long as you held her and told her its ok, she's going to be fine.|`|T0gv52CDaa	By 15 months, she doesn't even have a soft spot any more.  She is fine.  The screaming was because you took her cheerio out of her mouth.|`|Yko0r0fNaa	No, I don't think you hurted  her. If she stopped crying after a short period of time,and she  did not get any bump or black and blue spot<br>  on her head then I would say don't worry she's fine.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	It happened to me too.  My daughter was like a week or two old and was asleep on the couch.  Well, I leaned over her to get my cell phone so that I could take a picture of her sleeping and I dropped it on her head.  It sounded like it hit pretty hard, but she didn't even budge, much less cry.  It didn't startle her at all.  They are a lot more resilient then we think.  I'm sure your daughter is fine.  Her reaction was probably a combination of you scaring her by rushing over and then scaring her my dropping the phone on her AND you probably hurt her feelings by taking the Cheerio out of her mouth.  I doubt she is hurt at all.  Just make sure she doesn't start acting lethargic.
e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Yes you can get an abortion.  I think you were asking if the army allows it and not everyone's redundant religious opinions on abortion, right?  <br>  <br>  But if you wait until you are ready, it's never going to happen. I waited until I was 35 to start trying and I've been trying for over a year with no luck.<br>  <br>  If you're active duty at least you will be able to afford to have kids.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	He will get used to the idea.  It is always a shock at first.  Please remember this is a life that has already begun (you will be shocked at the detail of the first few ultrasounds).  Please do not end a life that has already begun, and try to think of this as a blessing in disguise.  After the baby comes, you will see how unique he or she is and it will be such a joy to watch his or her personality come to life!|`|VmBT4Tlcaa	Army Soldiers can get abortions, but you cannot transfer to active duty while you are pregnant.  If you get an abortion there is a 90% chance that you will end up divorced.  You will resent the fact that your husband didn't want to have a child with you and that will cause strife in your marriage.  There is actually a better chance of you two staying together if you have the baby.  In addition to that here is what your baby looks like at seven weeks pregnant.  I am pretty sure you must be at least eight weeks to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/abortionimages/fig20baby7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/abortionimages/fig09hands7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/abortionimages/fig12legs7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.priestsforlife.org/resources/...</a><br>  <br>  Is this something that you don't want?

This is really something that you really need to take some time thinking about. If you just found out then you have a good month before you have to make any decisions. Don't let how your husband feels make the decision for you. It's your body and your choice honey. Good luck.|`|CjafsNslaa	Just do what your heart tells you. If you want to keep the baby then keep it. I think that your husband will eventually come around. maybe when you hear the heartbeat.

If you go to the army and ask them if you can have an abortion they'll probably tell you that they aren't your mommy and daddy. It's your decision. The idea of having a baby is awesome but you have to think about what you're putting on hold. Babies are a 18+ year commitment. Personally I'd rather get some stuff accomplished in my life before handing my life over to kids. Good Luck either way.

DCJAMtkHaa	I love the girls name.  It's gorgeous.  Love it.<br>  <br>  But for Haydn I think you should reconsider the speling.  Hayden looks a little more balanced.  The name really flows well with Christopher - another name I really love.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sold on Romeo (especially as your daughter's middle name is Juliet - which could be misconstrued as a little creepy - naming your children after lovers).|`|dPULl5hjaa	Don't like any of the names - that's my opinion!<br>  <br>  If you like them, all the power to you!<br>  <br>  Romeo & Juliet - don't use this combo|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Evangeline Juliet is cute, not really my taste in names, but that's just me, if u like them that's all that really matters.<br>  <br>  I really like Hayden Christopher, it's adorable.<br>  <br>  And Tristan Romeo is ok, never been a fan of the name Tristan, lol or Romeo and not so sure the 2 names flow well, but again if u like them that's all that really matters.<br>  <br>  And no i don't think Romeo and Juliet is too much since they are used as the middle names, now if they were both used as first names then yea they would too much, but as middle names they aren't too much.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, ur gonna need it, lol, :D.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Evangeline Juliet is pretty.<br>  Haydn Christopher, Haydn is meant to be spelled Hayden and I think it's a girls name. I like Christopher.<br>  Tristan Romeo is iffy. Tristan to me is somewhat a girls name. Romeo, no. Juliet and Romeo were lovers not siblings.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Evangeline Juliet - It doesn't really flow. Evangeline & Juliet are lovely names though.<br>  <br>  Haydn Christopher - Haydn is a trashy spelling of Hayden. Hayden Christopher doesn't flow but Christopher Hayden does.<br>  <br>  Tristan Romeo - Love Tristan but not to keen on Romeo.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	I like Evangeline and Hayden (spelled this way). But I don't like Tristan, and Romeo. Romeo and Juliet were lovers.....these babies are siblings, yes it's a little much in my honest opinin.|`|AA11206135	way too much...|`|y1BNwoJyaa	Definitely TOO much.  And having siblings named Romeo and Juliet is just going to lead to teasing along the lines of incest jokes.<br>  <br>  I prefer Aidan to Haydn, personally.  Juliet is pretty, just not Romeo.  Tristan is a cool name.|`|IuDWWYTDaa	Wow... I don't really like Evangeline.<br>  I love the names Hayden and Tristan though. The Middle names are cute for the boys too. But how about Angeline for the girl? Or Sara, that's much better.|`|kQ7aPIcAaa	I dont like the girls name. <br>  I like Hayden Christopher spelled Hayden not Haydn|`|Fmi9oECCaa	evengelins juliet i dont like.<br>  haydn is nice spelt 'hayden or haydan'<br>  tristan romeo not that good either reminds me of  a warrior or summin.<br>  sorry my opinion|`|WIEPISyeaa	What's with Romeo and Juliet?  Yeah...I don't like that.....<br>  <br>  I love Evangeline<br>  I love Haydn but I like it spelled "Hayden"<br>  I love Tristen|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Those are cute :) I like how the boy and the girl have the middle names of Romeo and Juliet haha :P|`|smrCnOITaa	Haydn && Tristan Are Cute .<br>  =D|`|tVzCN5nOaa	very different, quite sweet :)|`|sNjVdS4Kaa	a wee bit too much the first names are ok
Fmi9oECCaa	my town is called brentwood lol :D<br>  kasydie is pretty and the spelling is unusal and cute.<br>  the spelling of rae is alot more girlie that way too.<br>  <br>  brent is ok but brentwood :\<br>  hope i helped x x x|`|heC9aQ18aa	I think it's sad that these days parents seem to think names are more original if they are spelled wrong. I think Cassidy is not bad but Kasydie is just bad. Makes them look like low class, trailer park dwellers who never graduated from grammar school.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	The way people spell their children's names nowadays annoys the hell out of me.  Why do people have to prove how "unique" or "different" they are by giving their kid a ridiculously spelled name?  Please try to talk her down from the annoying spelling ledge.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	One word... EWWW.<br>  <br>  Kassidy/Cassidy is pretty as is and doesn't need foo-foo'd up, they can still call her Sydie from that. My daughter is Madeline and we call her Maddy. As for Brentwood, OMG hidious....That is seriously some trash compacted garbage. Brent peachy, Wood as a last name, peachy....the rest garbage. Your friend sucks at names.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Kassidy spelled this way (you are right) is cute and I like it with Rae. I think calling her Sydie is stupid and she will be ridiculed for "City." Brent is cute but Brentwood sounds like a neighborhood.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I prefer Cassidy Rae. It's adorable. I agree with whoever said Brentwood sounds like a town.|`|AA11273571	A total nightmare with the spelling of Kasydie, and Sydie is even worse.  I agree, Brent yes, Brentwood no.|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	I don't see why they can't call her Sydie even if they spell it Kassidy. It actually makes more sense to spell a name phonetically then to mess it up because people will just get confused. And Brentwood is ok..it kind of sounds like furniture though. I agree with you, they should keep it at Kassidy and Brent.|`|NvfSUwEMaa	i THINK SYDIE is stupid to call your kid. It kinda sounds like spidy I don't know. bUT Really it's your friends choice what she wants to name her kid. All you can do is support her in her weird kid naming descisions.|`|by9KuBizaa	Nightmares for names.  The child will grow up having to explain to EVERYone how to spell and pronounce the name.  What a terrible burden to put on a child
Ba6SSkzBaa	Kiandon, second pronunciation. It's so unique.|`|2qyqIXlRaa	Personally i REALY love the name Carter! as its really unique and different! I also love it as its a surname in my family! but Adore it as a firstname! <br>  I also think brett is okay! <br>  but feel with Kiandon it will always be miss pronouced whatever way you spell it! <br>  xx|`|WTXvmcxcaa	Carter. Definitely Carter. I like the girl name! My sister's name is Marie, and Leighton sounds cool. Like light. Part of my name means light, so I'll go for it all the way!  <br>  <br>  :)|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I like both Carter and Brett. Since you didn't give your last name, i can't tell you which sounds better, but i think i'd go with Carter.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Leighton is so pretty!<br>  <br>  I like Brett the best out of those choices. By any chance do you like Noah or Liam? Just two of my favorites :)|`|kB4EJUKgaa	I kinda like a combo. Key-Anne-Don. <br>  <br>  But I think Kiandon Carter ______ would be cute!|`|tw1uePBbaa	nobody would ever get the pronunciation right on Kiandon, i would use brett or carter|`|j4VqprfCaa	Brett it reminds me of Brett Michaels from Poison.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I like Carter or Brett.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Carter for sure. I like it better than Brett and Kiandon would always be spelled and pronounced wrong.|`|heC9aQ18aa	Carter would be the only name I would choose if it was my baby. Nice. Brett is too dated and Kiandon sounds like it was made up so I don't like it at all. I would choose Carter. Nice name.|`|ZXhSQfvqaa	I don't know about anyone else, but i sorta like Carter, its really cute, and unique.  They are all unique, but Carter is my pick!|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I prefer Carter.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	i like Brett xx
IFHzCyOkaa	middle school doesn't really count.. i mean its good that your getting those grades but what colleges really look at is high school grades. keep up the good work though because you can get in AP and advanced classes in high school which looks really good on your college application|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Of course.  A kid who's flunked out a couple of times and even been to jail can become a doctor.  It just takes hard work, money, high GPA in college for your bachelor's, and a high MCAT.  By the way, you do have to finish college before you can go to medical school.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Who knows.....it's a good start but Middle School's a lonnnnnng way away from Med School.....and it's not just about grades; it's about apptitude and vocation. A lot of keeners aren't cut out to be Drs, even with perfect GPAs.

1YHih8wyaa	I have been pregnant 3 times. 1 was a miscarriage, 1 daughter, and i am currently pregnant again. With all of them the thing I always notice is I start getting really really sleepy. I get really tiered and my body starts aching, almost right after conception I notice nausea. Almost 1 week after conception I dont know if its just because that is when my hormone levels start to go up. Another thing that I notice really early on in pregnancy is that my sleeping patterns change. I start having really vivid dreams and I start getting night time nausea (i assume it is because my stomach is empty) I dont really get soare breast. I will for maybe a week and that is about it. I also start noticing a hightened smell almost 1 week after a positive pregnancy test. With all my pregnancies I've found out I am pregnant at around 4 weeks.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	When I had blood work done because I was in the hospital for a bone graph to my broken wrist.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	I tested everyday starting 5 days before I missed my period  with first response (we had been ttc for 15 months!)  All negative and then finally on the morning of my 6th day with no period I got a bright dark positive......it was so weird it just randomly showed up that morning!  I was in shock and did not believe it so I took 9 more tests that day to make sure, all positive!  I was soooooo sick throwing up for days before my missed period I would literally wake up at 4am every morning for a week and have my head hanging over the toilet for hours.  I was very moody and very sensitive.  I had a weird craving for gummy bears too.  I was really hot all the time, which was weird for me because im usually always cold.  I also just knew I was pregnant that cycle, I can't explain it............I just knew.  Good Luck if you ttc!|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	We'd been sort of "trying for 2 months" so I was on the lookout, but my only early symptom was that I had period type cramps early, and no period, plus I was super emotional.  <br>  <br>  I waited a week after my period was due, because I felt like I was going to start at any moment.  I took my test at 2 a.m because my husband leaves for work at 3:30 and I wanted to make sure he knew before he left (and I couldn't wait any longer).  A really dark second line, showed up immediately, and I was so happy, we'd waited 5 years to have kids.  My husband was very surprised, and still half asleep, but he was also delighted.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	My period was a week late.  I took a pregnancy test and the first one says negative.  I waited 3 or 4 days and took another one and it says pregnant.  It was a sunday and my boyfriend was resting in the bed when I came in and showed him the stick and it was snowing.|`|IWinNj2saa	I got severe heartburn 7 days before my period, and we found out on my husbands birthday, with a home pregnancy test. No other symptoms but the heartburn.|`|n8Db77zbaa	I found out when I was about 7 weeks. How I found out was one day, my husband called me from work and said he was throwing up and feeling sick. I suggested that maybe it was just the breakfast he ate that morning. He said that he had just eaten a power bar and chocolate milk like he always did. <br>  <br>  He suggested i take a pee stick test, so I did. Surprisingly I was pregnant. Almost instantly I began to crave a hamburger (must be a pregnant) anyway, since I was so used to my salad, fruit and water diet, I also instantly threw up the hamburger I ate and became utterly nauseous.Turns out the red onion in the burger made me super sick,For the ramineder of my pregnancy they made me sick to my stomach, couldnt smell or see them. and until this day, Can't stand them.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I found out I was pregnant when I was about six weeks. For two weeks I had been fighting what I thought was the flu. I had the cramping, throwing up, nausea, headache.. everything. Then just when I started feeling better, I got cravings like crazy and my boobs started hurting. This went on for a few days before my husband was like how about you take a test, and sure enough he was right.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	With my daughter I knew I was pregnant before I even missed my period. I was cramping and my breasts were sore. Then I took a pregnancy test and it seemed like almost instantly I began with morning sickness. With my second pregnancy I had no idea! We weren't even trying! My girlfriend and I had a few too many margaritas and I was feeling horrible. Then I stayed sick for 2 days so I went to the doctor and asked them what else I could do because I had been vomiting for 2 days straight. This day just happened to be our 1 year wedding anniversary. The doctor asked me to take a prego test and I did with no reason to believe I was pregnant. However It was positive and I was sooo happy! When we went to dinner for our anniversary I brought in his anniversary gift and at the bottom of the bag I put a couple baby things with a little note saying Round 2. My breasts were sore and I have been very tired. Other than that Pregnancy has been good for us!|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	Just got back from my wonderful honeymoon... and I stopped at CVS to pick up some grey goose so I can mix up some lovely drinks for me and my hubby... <br>  <br>  As I was browsing around the store, my husband called and told me to get a test just in case... So I went home took the test and made my husband a drink (not me)... I showed him the positive test and handed him his glass... CHEERS!!! <br>  <br>  At that time I didn't have a missed period...

oXzHvsBpaa	Have you tried the Dr Browns bottles. They work great with gas and fussiness. Talk to your doctor though because our son was the same way fussing all the time and it turned out that he had Reflux. They put him on Zantac twice a day and since then he has never fussed during or after his feedings. Gentlease is great though. Our son is also on it.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	four weeks is young remember, they are still adjusting to the new world around them, so they feel secure with you, insecure without you bc you are about the only thing in this world that they recognize...i would say the formula is probably fine, she just needs the security....get a sling or carrier...i highly recommend the baby bjorn with back support, my dd is 8 mos old, and still does and has always been comfy in it, she will still sleep in it if she gets sleepy, and as long as i watch my posture, i can carry her like that for hours, the slings just seemed too flimsy and i like having her right up under my head....my dd did not like the avent bottles, we used playtex ventaire advanced...they vent through the bottoms so that no air goes back through the nip and causes bubbles or foam; they worked great....and the angled shape is great; after she started burping herself well around six or seven mos, we switched to the drop ins bc it is less to clean....also, i highly recommend the 'dr brown's formula pitcher'; it is great! less than 20bucks, mixes without shaking, so no bubbles or foam to go in tummy, and you can make a whole 24hrs at once! i would buy it again and again! my dd had reflux really bad, but did well with the ventaire advanced bottles and enfamil lipil; we didn't use the gentle we used the regular, she never really developed a problem with gas....you can also try mylicon drops for babies--generic is cheaper and just as effective and you can give it at every feeding.....there is nothing wrong with holding her as much as you possibly can, it is good for both of you and makes her feel more secure in the big scary place she has been introduced to....even if she's in a carrier, she can hear your heartbeat...when my dd was small, she would curl up with the side of her head over my heart and fall asleep within mins if she was tired...it was so sweet!! she also hears your voice, which she recognizes from the womb and can smell you which she also recognizes....she really needs that; you can also wear the same tshirt or sleep with the same blankie for a few nights to get your scent on it and put it up under her sheet where her head will be, so that at night, she has the swaddler to keep her snug and she can smell mommy too..my dd also loved the 'womb bear', which simulates the heartbeat and blood flow of the womb, and she still loves to hear it for naps..fans are great too, not blowing on baby, but now they say that the air circulation reduces sids and it makes for great white noise..we use one along with womb bear...sorry to ramble, but i hope i helped...all the things i mentioned can be bought at babies r us , probably other places as well|`|YmEGCGtnaa	probably it's just newborn clingyness|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	At that stage, my little boy just wanted to be held all the time (while moving around).  So if she stops crying when you hold her, I'm guessing that's it.  We use Playtex drop ins and my son is rarely gassy.  Also, he was less gassy when we switched to the Target brand version of Enfamil.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Wanting to be held and be close to mom has absolutely nothing to do with her type of formula.  Babies *need* to be close to mom so they feel secure.  We know that they are perfectly safe and cared for when they are in their bouncy or crib, but they don't.  Instinctively they only know they're safe when they're with Mom.  The fact that she is like this shows that she is very aware and very in tune with her needs, which is awesome.<br>  <br>  I prefer drop-in liners because they make it easier to make sure the baby takes in as little air as possible, they require less washing, and they're nice to have if, for some reason, your water supply is limited.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/09a-drugs_and_bf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/09a-drugs...</a><br>  And there are plenty of risks in not breastfeeding, so the question essentially boils down to: Does the addition of a small amount of medication to the mother’s milk make breastfeeding more hazardous than formula feeding?

Whatever formula you're using at the time gets the credit. The fact is that oftentimes baby's fussiness is not due to the formula, but to other unrelated causes. Nevertheless, formula gets the blame, so factories step up with new varieties to keep up with the demand. Hence lactose- free formulas. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/5/T050400.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/5/T050400...</a><br>  10. "CAN'T PUT BABY DOWN"<br>  <br>  High need babies crave touch: skin-to-skin contact in your arms, at your breasts, in your bed. They extract whatever physical contact they can from their caregivers. They also crave motion. Holding is not enough; the holder must keep moving. If the holder wants to sit down, it had better be on something that rocks, glides, or swings. This constant holding may be particularly difficult for new parents who expected to have the magazine model baby, the one who lies quietly in the crib gazing at expensive mobiles. This is not the play profile of the high need baby. Parents' arms and bodies are his crib; mother's breasts are his pacifier, and a bouncing lap is his chair. Most high need babies choose to upgrade their accommodations from the crib or playpen to the baby sling. They like to be worn many hours a day because they like the physical contact and they like to be up where the action is. Smart babies.<br>  <br>  Some high need babies are super cuddly and crave being held, others are slower to warm up and often receive the label "uncuddly." It could be that this behavior is caused by extreme sensitivity, which causes them to perceive handling as unsettling or threatening. It is important for the parent to stay calm and relaxed. Babies like this need careful handling that avoids over- stimulation and gradually desensitize them to touch. Eventually, they will become accustomed to relaxed touching and holding. Some uncuddly babies continue to resist close physical contact, being closely contained in the sling, or spending long periods of time in one person's arms. They also protest being swaddled. These are the babies who need more space and floor time. The uncuddly babies are the most difficult of high need babies because they don't melt and mold rewardingly into the arms of their caregivers. If you have a baby who is initially uncuddly, don't take it personally. These babies are simply slower to warm up to physical contact. Most of them eventually ease into the high-touch style of parenting that their high need colleagues have learned to enjoy.|`|IjkPBYlkaa	its not her formula its just her not wanting to be left alone she wants to feel your warmness try putting a pillow next to her|`|W6S6WpsNaa	It could be that she wants to be held alot.   I wanted to let you know though,  I have 3 children , and I'm pregnant with my 4th.   Anyways,  2 of my babies have had really bad colic.  With my oldest daughter, I started her on Nutramigen formula, and it worked beautiful.  Once I started giving her that, we had no more problems.   With my youngest daughter, she's 15 months now, I used Soy formula, that did not have the DHA & ARA.  I tried that because Nutramigen is expensive.  Anyways, she didn't have any problems, the gas went away.  It's hard to find Soy formula without those 2 ingredients, but I would get the big cans of it @ Target.   Just thought I would share with you.  Good Luck, & Congrats!
Fkl6gV8Qaa	We went on a long trip while I was breastfeeding and i actually had to get up over the top of my sons car seat so that we could make it more than 30 minutes or so before he was upset and wanted out. I also was in a wedding and while decorating me and 2 other friends had to sit on the floor in the middle of the reception hall surrounded by tulle and table runners and nursed. I've also made dinner, shopped in walmart and met somebody in an airport terminal all with a baby strapped to my boob.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	I don't know if it's really all that strange but everytime I nursed my daughter...I FELL ASLEEP!!!  LOL<br>  <br>  I spent the majority of my time nursing in bed/lying down because I'd doze off and was so paranoid I might drop her if I was sitting in a chair LOL.  I don't know...something about nursing her was so comforting and soothing...and I just completely relaxed and let go of the world and zonked out LOL.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I've nursed while I've done almost everything I've done in the past five years!  <br>  <br>  I've given a professional presentation, voted in a presidential election, had my highlights done and gotten a root canal, all while nursing at the same time.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Yes, doesn't it seem idyllic?  But, life is different.  I breastfed my 3 children.  You can't stop every 3-4 hours and do nothing for 1/2 hour every day for a year!  I did everything - read, watched tv, cut coupons, talked on the phone, and yes, sung to the baby.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Wow the first answer is great! My son actually insists on nursing during all baths and showers now. I don't know where it came from but it's tricky at times. Must be a phase. I'd have to say the strangest thing I've done while breast feeding is walk around Target. I had a sling and he was hungry so we positioned things comfortably and he ate and napped while I did my shopping. A close second though, is in the backseat over the side of the car seat. I've done that many times and I have to wonder if other people driving wondered what in the heck I was doing.|`|iH2whFkHaa	The most unexpected thing was that my boobs were so huge I couldn't breastfeed sitting up. My son was born with a stubborn tendency to arch his back so I had to hold him with both arms or he would have fallen off my lap, which I couldn't do because I had to hold up my boob so it didn't suffocate him, plus it hurt my back way too much and because of the back arching it was impossible to use the nursing pillow so I had to always feed him lying down for the first 5 months...just barely a couple weeks ago I got him to start nursing in the cradle position. It was awkward though when I told my husband's family I was exclusively breastfeeding when we brought him over for the first time, and not long after I got out a bottle of breastmilk to feed him --since I could not feed him unless lying down--I could just see the looks on their faces so confused lol they thought it was formula when I had just said I didn't give him formula.|`|IWinNj2saa	I have actually been in the bathtub when the baby wanted to eat, so my husband just brought the baby to me, and I breastfed him in the tub. LoL....I have breastfed in the car, the mall, restaurants, I swear...everywhere. When it takes that much time to feed the baby, anything that needs to be done, can usually be done while feeding. LoL|`|vOomJtbsaa	Breastfeeding while eating, somehow I managed to multi task shoveling food into my mouth while my son was attached to my boob!

4WyUrWaIaa	Sorry, but their both daft.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Leighton, Ashley, Dylan, and Blake are all boys names. All are lovely names for boys. And the made up spellings don't make them feminine.<br>  <br>  At least choose a feminine middle name so people can tell that she's a GIRL.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Neither. They are both horrendeous. Leighton, Dylan, and Blake are masculine boy names. Nothing feminine, girly, or unisex about them. And the horrible, trashy spellings will not change that. Ashley was a male's name. I would assume that both of those were males, if I saw the names on paper.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Awful. Awful. Awful.<br>  <br>  Leighton, Ashley, Dylan & Blake are all MASCULINE BOYS names. There is nothing feminine, girly or unisex about any of them.<br>  <br>  Spelling Dylan & Blake differently doesn't make them feminine, girly or unisex. It just makes you & your child look like you can't spell. Also makes you look gender confused.|`|DacTCJVKaa	Can I mix and match and change some spellings?<br>  <br>  I LOVE Leighton Blake for a girl.  Dylan Blake is okay.|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	I like Dylanne Blayke but spell it Dylan Blayke. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!!
AepJopG1aa	It is normal to have a missed or late period at that age but it is also possible to become pregnant even if you are having safe sex. If you miss 2 periods in a row then I would say that it's time to get a home pregnancy test. You might want to consider taking birth control pills. When taken correctly they are pretty reliable.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Teen of 14 or 15 years should not be having any sex at all.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	the only way to be completely safe against getting pregnant is to not have sex at all.  All methods are pretty good but none except abstinence are 100% safe.|`|n4d7rqr4aa	The only really safe sex is no sex.  Hate to break it to you, but any time you have sex you run the risk - no matter how careful you are.  Condoms are the safest outside of abstinence, but they can rip.  Also, if he gets flaccid before he pulls out, some semen could leak out.  Oral birth control, as well as things like NuvaRing, are less effective, and if you do something incorrectly it lowers the effectiveness even more.  <br>  <br>  Those three types have a 90% plus effectiveness rate, and everything else is around 70% or less.  The pullout method, the sponge, and spermicide all leave a huge amount of risk.|`|i8Ch743Laa	The chances are low,but if you've missed cycles,take a test. It can happen,condoms break or have small unnoticable tears,and the pill is only ok if you take it everyday at the same time,otherwise,you can get pregnant,you can both ways anyways,but it's more likely if those things happen.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Yep, you can get pregnant any time you have sex.  Protected, or unprotected, on the pill, or off the pill, at the beginning of the month, or at the middle or end.  I would suggest taking a pregnancy test.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	why is a 14 or 15 year old having sex? Condoms and birth control are not 100% effective. you don't wnat to get pregnant, don't have sex. simple as that.|`|kT7GVOosaa	i was on birth control for a year and a half and I got pregnant anyway|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	This is the silliest question ever.  If its safe sex, then how could you get pregnant?|`|438747232036cd739fbf5a72a99afc4aaa	..... This is a joke right? First of all, I don't know where your from, but where I from the age of consent is I believe 16 or 18... don't remember.. .BUT anyways, if you had safe sex, there is no possible way to get pregnant, thats why they call it SAFE SEX.... However, I'm not exactly sure by what your term of the definition is, how exactly did you protect yourself, or "this person" protect herself.|`|QvxUDjdGaa	their is no safe sex|`|DRb4Qlypaa	There is no such think as safe sex, only safer sex. You can still get STD's and become pregnant while using protection and while on birth control.<br>  The idea is to not have sex until you would be able to have kids, and with only one partner so you won't get an STD.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Of course it is always possible to get pregnant.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Condoms are about 85% effective so the answer is YES! You can get pregnant. And no, missing that many periods means trouble.|`|r8ST3cFIaa	um birth control isn't 100% protective<br>  the only way to not get pregnant is abstinence, you should try it|`|JttazGgjaa	there is nothing that will protect you 100% except abstinence.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	Condoms burst alot of the time so take a test to be sure!|`|zDVTBa7Taa	you can still get prego even if your safe. You are NEVER truely safe. People claim if your safe your not gunna get prego or catch a disease which is false. all a condom etc does if help prevent. it dont mean your completely safe.<br>  <br>  a 14 - 15 year old shouldnt be having sex any way. way too young. The only way to be 100% safe from prego is staying a virgin and not having sex.|`|0pAczRv2aa	yeah you can deff. still get prego and its not fun<br>  <br>  but if you used a condom it could have broken<br>  if you used the pill u can still get preg. my mom had safe sex and was on the oill and got preg. 3 times still<br>  <br>  and if he is cut then no and if you tubes r tied no<br>  <br>  u should try taken a prg. test befor you freak haha|`|ihL0FkJYaa	no  watever just go take a test|`|4tZwBpP1aa	there's a maybe|`|8bHGjADEaa	No thats not normal, If you 14 or 15 you shouldn't be having sex first of all. But thats your decision. But no, You need to be on birth control. to keep your periods undercontrol and you will be safer and not slip up and miss your period=)|`|jZPv153Jaa	wow have you tooken a test?|`|bgdjtJepaa	sometimes females miss a period for miscellaneous reasons, but if you've missed two that doesn't sound good.  take a pregnancy test.  you're too young to drive, but surely you have a friend old enough to take you to the drug store or walmart.  best wishes!|`|G2OdDlmjaa	yes what ever you used doesnt always work|`|RcKQYqJeaa	Just so you know, there is no such thing as "safe sex".... its called no sex.<br>  <br>  Sounds like your too young to be engaged in sexual activities because you obviously dont know the consequences of your actions if you think here isa "safe sex".|`|KpO4UtElaa	let me tell you, condoms can break and come off. both have happened to my husband and I and we are very careful. you should not be having sex at your age anyways. unless you want to be a tramp.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	You can definitely get prego. The chances are extremely slim if you did everything right, but still possible.|`|1S11bh3eaa	if it hasnt been normal in the first place then it's fine i have that too.<br>  if you're not positive that youre not pregnant buy a test. the last thing the world needs is another teen mother :x|`|1eoDkURyaa	You can get pregnant from any kind of sex, except oral!<br>  Take a health class, you should know how sex works before you have it!|`|NOjcTeT4aa	What does this 14/15 year old call safe sex ? Missing two periods is a BIG sign, but can be caused by other things.|`|TczFL0p0aa	Yes you can, birth control is about 85% affective and condoms are 98% affective but if they are not put together especially if you only use birth control you can still get pregnant, and if you only use condoms it can break, or have a tear or hole in it, hey it only takes one.<br>  But I firmly believe that if you had protected sex and STILL got pregnant then it's an act of god, everything happens for a reason, so if you had 100% protected sex and your preg then maybe your meant to be preg... maybe your meant to have a baby so young. and if you are please don't have an abortion, give it up for adoption to a loving couple or family, or keep it. It will be hard but no one is ever completely ready to have a child, and giving it up after carrying it for 9 months is EXTREMELY hard.<br>  good luck to you.|`|6hoGTssUaa	it depends...<br>  how old was the condom? if there over about 3 weeks stuff leaks through.<br>  did it break? enough said there...<br>  did you make sure the package was brand new and not faltered with? occasionally, there'll be holes in the condom without you even noticing.<br>  <br>  are you on any birth control? that will mess with your period...<br>  did you recently loose your virginity? sometimes you can get your insides all swollen up and you wont have your periods for a while...|`|TrrVqO0haa	u can get pregnant threw safe sex condoms are only 93 to 97% affective|`|rpzHSaI9aa	Although it is considerably less likely to get pregnant if you practice safe sex you still can. Neither condoms or the pill are 100% effective. If you used both it is extremely unlikely you are pregnant but you still could be. The best way to avoid pregnancy is by not having sex.|`|JgOtyKkqaa	There's always a chance for a mistake. wait another week and test yourself.|`|S8pVJ2UDaa	yeah it is. even if its safe there still a chance of getting prednant|`|6qGY4cljaa	At 14 and 15, aren't there other things you could possibly do? If you're not old enough to have a job, you're probably not old enough to have sex. And legally, that's statutory rape.<br>  <br>  No safe sex method is 100% safe. The only "safe" sex is masturbation. I guess that's not the issue here.|`|RLf2tuP3aa	no|`|0eba68295838279e5b5ab51c0a80eda1aa	Yes you can get pregnant if you had safe sex. Condoms can have holes. The pill can fail.<br>  <br>  And yes, it can also be normal for a teen to just miss a period or have unregular ones without having to be pregnant.|`|t39qn6OOaa	OMG!!!! If your are 14 to 15 then you should have learned that the only "safe sex" is "no sex".  Yes you can get pregnant on the pill, using condoms...etc...etc...  Is it normal to miss a period...Yes|`|ZXTOCzw2aa	you can still get pregnant even if you have safe sex. but the chances are very low.|`|u93oneUXaa	If you mean that safe sex is using condoms.. then yes you can get pregnant!

BtxmstTeaa	Well firstly buy a cake specifically for the 1 year old and let them have at it. Secondly try maybe renting out a meeting room at a hotel. We've always done that for our big family get together, simply because we don't have enough room in our house.

When I was at the hospital after having my baby, they made me watch a video about SIDS and Shaken Baby Syndrome and a whole bunch of other stuff.  The video stated that sometimes walking away for a few minutes is best for the baby and the parent.  <br>  <br>  My baby cries whenever she can't see me.  And I mean EVERY TIME she can't see me.  It's frustrating sometimes because I am a single mother.  I have my boyfriend living with me, but sometimes I feel bad for asking him for help because my daughter is not his baby.  When I get out of the shower in the mornings, I always find him holding my daughter, and the first thing he says is " She has been crying since you shut the door"  It makes me feel bad for my daughter and my boyfriend, but I don't know what to do about it.  I can't NOT live my life just because I have a baby now you know?  I have to shower and cook and work and clean house.  I guess what I am trying to say is just because you have to put them down and walk away for a minute or long enough to get something done, does not mean you love your baby any less and it does not make you a bad parent.  This is strictly just my opinion though, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt.|`|nmu6coapaa	My son is exactly the same way! And I agree with you that as a mother it is very difficult to just let him cry! Your husband is right in a way, there is very little you can do to settle a colicky baby! Lie your son on his back and move his legs like he's cycling, turn on a hairdryer or leave some music on in the room, the white noise distracts him! Bath him, the warm water eases them! I hope some of these work for you!

And if he's giving you a headache put some earplugs in your ears but stay with him. Even if you can't do anything to get him to stop crying, you comfort him with your presence and he knows he is not alone. The colic is probably due to some type of discomfort, maybe tummyaches or gas. The good news is babies usually reach their peak of hours-per-day spent crying at around 6 weeks, and then the amount usually slowly starts to decline. Hang in there mama!|`|2ee7c7cc26d963adf4e22da471543493aa	It is far too young.<br>  Speak to your health visitor.|`|PgQ8dR7baa	My daughter suffered from colic exactly the same and was constantly in discomfort or crying.  We tried all the usual remedies and nothing at all worked.  My best advice would be swaddling your baby in a comfy blanket that he likes, maybe with your perfume on it.  This used to comfort my little girl while I was trying to get her in a comfy position to go to sleep.  I found natural gripe water a big help too, and check out the bottles you feed your baby with and change them.  I used Avent bottles and they filled up with air, we switched to Doctor Brown bottles, more expensive but WELL worth the money, it just about stopped the colic in a couple of days, so I would highly recommend them.<br>  <br>  Persevere, and listen to your health visitor.  Please dont leave your little one to cry on his own, he is way too young for that and he will need you there to reassure him.<br>  <br>  Good luck and email me any time, I have lots of tips for a baby with colic, my little girl had it pretty bad in the beginning.|`|7e4349dce38654728dc0f4d3d3692380aa	Would you like to cry yourself to sleep, when the only people in your life who you should be able to trust refuse to show any care and affection.<br>  Put yourself in the baby's place would you be laying there thinking you was being neglected and how good it would feel to lay your head on a caring mother / fathers shoulder.<br>  Some people will say you are spoiling him, I call it caring for him.<br>  Why have a baby if he cannot be cared for?<br>  A warm body for the baby to cuddle up to gives comfort.<br>   At 4 weeks how do you know how his stomach feels?<br>  When a problem arises pretend you are that baby who cannot talk to you to tell his troubles.<br>  Show no anger, or he will be more tense.<br>  At this very young age a happy smiling face cures  many problem it helps to relax.|`|UghJ0XROaa	With him having colic at times you have to let him cry, just to relax yourself. I would not let him cry himself to sleep, but as you are doing the best you can to comfort him and realize you are getting stressed, lay him somewhere safe and go walk away for a few minutes to regain control and go back and start again. Repeat as necessary until his colic episode come to an end. Four weeks is not a good age to leave him to cry himself to sleep. He has no concept of what he is doing, just he knows something hurts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thumbs downs because you think it's not okay for a mommy to walk away for a few min from a colicy baby?|`|NpomCCjUaa	It's too young to leave him on his own. By trying to settle him, you are letting him know you are there for him, and although it doesn't seem like it to you, you are reassuring him. I think that when you've tried everything to settle him, put him in his crib for a while and just let him know you are there. My health visitor also told me that when it gets too much for you, it is ok to leave him safely in a room for 5 minutes or so while you go into another room or outside out of earshot to calm down before going back to your baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Remember this will pass.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I am inclined to agree with your husband on this one.  If nothing else is helping then "messing around" with a baby, jigging them up and down and keeping them on the go is only going to make them more tired.

Throughout the day, I hear my name called many times. Most of these are very “non-urgent” calls, “Hey Dad, I can’t find my shoes”, or “Dad, can you fix the computer”? When I hear these, my fathering instincts tell me that I can finish what I was doing, slowly walk upstairs, and deal with the situation. Sometimes, the call is a little more frantic, “Dad, the dog threw-up!” I rather quickly jog up-stairs to save my new carpet. Then, there have been the bloody murder screams after a slip in the tub – these have me responding in an all-out sprint!<br>  <br>  It is the same with a baby. Some cries are more urgent than others. As your baby gets older, you will learn to “read” her cries, and know how quickly you need to respond. The only thing you don’t want to do is let her cry intensely by herself for extended periods of time (i.e. letting her “cry-it-out”). There is some good scientific evidence that this can be harmful. This evidence is available in our new book, The Baby Sleep Book.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	yes that is way too young if you need a break give the baby to someone else for a lil bit...the baby still really needs someone|`|VNQHUIo1aa	my son was like that but i never let him cry it out cuz he was in pain....just cuddle and rock...that's all u really can do|`|T0gv52CDaa	Yes, I would say that 4 weeks is too young to cry yourself to sleep, however, with a colicky baby, if you find yourself getting too upset, sometimes it is better to put him down and walk away for a few minutes before you end up too frustrated.  I'm fortunate that neither of my babies have been colicky, but when they have been fussy, nursing always settled both of them down.  With my youngest (now 3 months) some days I just spent the whole day with him attached to a breast.  He was happy, and it didn't bother me at all.  What also helped was when we discovered that on the days that he was really fussy, he had gas.  Our pediatrician had us give him Gas-X infant drops with each feeding, and we never had a problem with fussiness again.|`|AA11606975	a child does not know that you are just leaving they're side to go get something or to go to bed, once you are out of they're line of site they either will attempt to look for you or just start crying. They think that you are leaving them FOREVER. They don't know the difference. Try rocking your child to sleep a couple times and slowly work your way into being further and further away from the child when you are putting the child to sleep. They don't know the difference, they just want to be as close to you as possible.|`|C8fBt7Rxaa	You might want to consider letting him sleep on his stomach.  From what I've heard the cry it out method can cause psychological issues later in life.  I only know one parent who did it hard core and their daughter has had a lot of psychological problems so maybe I'm biased against it though.  Anyway, babies sleep better on their stomach and have less colic.  Let him sleep on you first and you might want to check with your pediatrician also.  <br>  <br>  BTW, infants who sleep on their backs compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs have increased rates of: <br>  - Social skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - Motor skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (Corvaglia, 2007) <br>  - Milestone delays (Davis, Moon, et al., 1998)<br>  - Plagiocephaly, Torticollis, Strabismus, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Plus, stomach sleep tends to prevent hip subluxation and reduce the symptoms of colic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fourfactortheory.blogspot.com/</a>|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Don't let that little baby cry himself to sleep, do whatever you can to comfort him.

They just want to be near you.|`|kiM7z5guaa	thats horrible on his part! that is waaaay to young. trust me i know all about colic. my son (now 9 months) had horrible colick at the first 3 months. my bf and i hardly slept! its rough. but it need you to love and sooth him!would you want to be left to scream and cry in pain when u were not able to do for yourself, he dosent know how to comfort himself. atleast as adults we know to curl up in a ball or what medicine helps our tummy aches! he sounds like he just dosent want to get up with him in my opinion. and btw at 9 mos my son dosent sleep through the night and we still dont let him cry and we do what it takes to get him to sleep!|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Oh yes at that age their only way of communicating is crying,he must be suffering some discomfort you need to check he is not windy,hungry to cold to hot needing his nappy changed so many things can be causing this.<br>  Tell your husband he is totally wrong hm if he was my husband or son I would not miss him I am afraid|`|B1JFBV3jaa	I am completely against crying it out.  Comfort him by whatever means necessary.  4 weeks old is still so young.  He is used to being in your tummy where he felt safe and secure.  PLEASE don't leave him in his room to cry it out.  I can't imagine how scared he must feel.  :-(<br>  <br>  My daughter used to fuss in the evenings when she was about that age.  We bought swaddling blankets from Toys R Us and they work wonders!!  Try to swaddle him.  It recreates the womb.  This may be the trick.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	i think 4 weeks is too young, i used the controlled crying when my son was 5 months but at 4 weeks they are still getting used to their surroundings and whats happening, keep in mind the good times! and by 3 months it usually improves, hang in there and remember its all worth it! good luck and hope it improves xxx|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	WAY TOO YOUNG.  She's fresh out of the womb.  She needs to be held and comforted as much as possible.  She's learning to trust you, so if you start leaving her to cry, you'll ruin her trust for you.  She needs to know that you will be there for her whenever she cries, day or night.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I would just hold and comfort the baby. The screams may explode your eardrums, but your baby needs to know that you don't mind him even when he's upset. He wants to be loved. Even if it's 16 hours idea. <br>  <br>  Good job for being so patient with your baby!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Yes its too young to do that, however if you are getting upset and angry you should have someone else come to soothe him or just leave him alone for a little while like 10 minutes.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	No do not do that, talk to your doc about what you can do.  He needs you to comfort him its not his fault he's like this.  It just happens.  Hang in there this to will pass !!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jnLryjZpaa	too young, try teething powder, its homoeopathic and safe, its great for colic. also try cranio-osteopathy. it gets easier i promise!|`|PNZxIFPvaa	Yes, that is too young, you shouldn't really think about that until the baby is about 4 months old.|`|Ns9FrTGSaa	hey hun <br>  <br>  i no it's bad at this point but yes they are have you tried heating a bit of olive oil and rubbing down the baby over your knee it really works learnt it at baby classes and hv showed us.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck <br>  <br>  i also tried gripe water but the have to bee 8weeks <br>  <br>  <br>  I no it dont feel like it but it soon passes little girl now a happy 20week old|`|6169fa372faf693494242ead618d4045aa	But you ARE doing something for him by holding him.  You are showing him that he is not alone in this world and that someone loves him and doesn't want him to be in pain.  :(
eY8b5fBRaa	they all say "MY body MY choice".   But ya know what? It's not THEIR heart that's gonna stop when an abortion takes place!  EVERYTHING happens for a reason.... Even getting pregnant!|`|iwYu32N2aa	well its not illegal so deal with it I guess.<br>  <br>  *Thank You dmads20 I agree Im so fed up with people asking this question, In my opinion they should be asked in the politics&gov. section. Not a section where women are pregnant and having babies not getting rid of them.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Good for you.<br>  <br>  hahaha mommyin May. good answer.<br>  <br>  btw, my sarcastic answer does not mean i believe in abortion. I'm just tired of people's beliefs being bestowed on everyone. free speech doesn't always mean it should be executed.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Too many people are using abortion as a means for birth control. If they don't want to get pregnant, then they should abstain or use contraceptives.<br>  <br>  I do not believe in abortions (for myself), as it is killing an innocent being, whose heart is beating. <br>  <br>  However, in the event that someone takes every precaution, is raped or has an underlying health condition that puts them at risk for death, then this is when abortion should be considered. Even then, the pros & cons should be weighed and an educated decision made.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|EMKuBql8aa	Because of the past statisticsof the undergound abortions when they were illegal. Women were getting them done under the table and they were dying from infections and such. Just because something is illegal, doesn'tmean people wont do it (think drugs) so they might as well be safe doing it was their thought at the time.<br>  <br>  Not saying I agree or disagree, just stating a fact.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I do not believe in abortion to kill a living thing just because you got "knocked up" because your irresponsible. I do believe that if you found out that there was no way you would even be able to deliver the child say it had no brain or serious problem then I believe you have that option.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	there are no children involved in abortions. if abortion is illegal, it will still occur, only women will injure themselves and they might even die. is that what you want? for BOTH woman and fetus to die? abortion is better off safe and legal. don't like abortions? don't have one!<br>  <br>  thanx for the thumbs down! proves that lifers are scared of the truth coming out. pathetic.|`|bgdjtJepaa	it's not as if the child will know.  it's not even fully developed.  it's no different than killing an animal.  and if the parents aren't fit sometimes it's the best decision.  or if it's a rape baby.  besides, it's the mother's choice.  not the government's choice.  however, partial birth abortion is unnecessarily cruel and should not be practiced.  abortion should be done in the most humane way possible.|`|hw3OMoeZaa	I don't think it should be legal because then you have a lot of women and young girls not taking responsibility for their actions.   I do think there are reasons for abortion, whether it be a fatal defect in the child or something life threatening to the mother but if you don't regulate abortion it will become every-ones easy way out.  a lot of younger girls don't understand the emotional part that comes with it or the damage they can cause their bodies.  Big difference between making it legal and regulating it or making it harder for underage girls to have them done.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  HEY LIASON AND THE OTHERS JUST LIKE HER! you can have an abortion up until week 18 of your pregnancy and the baby has a heartbeat at 6 to 8 weeks so at what point do you consider it to be alive?|`|vigFmfLmaa	I don't like abortion nor do I think I would ever get one.  However, I would much rather someone abort a fetus than bring an unwanted, neglected or abused child into this world.  That's not fair for anyone.  Not everyone shares your lovey dovey feelings about children either. Some people just aren't the parenting type.  Would you want an 'innocent child' being born into a world that doesn't want it?|`|DRb4Qlypaa	I feel the same way but I suppose that some people are very selfish so they want to murder their innocent baby. I do not know why anyone would want abortion to be legal. Just because something is in your body does not mean that it is YOUR right to kill it. And it is the biggest slap in the face to god that man could ever think of.<br>  <br>  Chad is right though. Mommy and baby were killed, instead of just baby. You can still die from an abortion though, and many women have. <br>  <a href="http://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mttu.com/abort-pics/</a><br>  This site has alot of info including women who have died from abortions since they have been legal.|`|AA11853447	Because you can't tell me what I should do with my body-- and thank goodness for that. <br>  <br>  A fetus is not a baby. You think it's a baby and that's your problem. A fetus in early stages is just a collection of cells like a cyst or a wart. The fetus cannot survive on its own, therefore is not a baby.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	but it is their life and their bodies.  they have the decision to choose what is right for themselves.  at the time a baby is aborted it isn't a child just yet.  the world is overpopulated and our economy is crap.  we really don't need more people on public assistance then we already do.|`|kT7GVOosaa	I agree but I don't think it will ever truly become illegal. I think it should just be harder to get one. I think that a dr. note should be required and abortions can only happen due to rape or the mother or child's life is in danger.|`|G4qP2gATaa	Because making it illegal wouldn't do anything. It would just make it so more women have back alley abortions, which are completely unsafe.|`|2SEx4zGHaa	If people just used proper birth control abortion would not be an issue. But unfortunately people do not act responsibly and if abortion were made illegal there would be thousands and thousands of people having babies they don't want or can't afford. The government would never get out of debt paying all the additional welfare, not to mention the generation of kids raised by parents who never wanted them growing up to substandard adults, criminals and lifetime welfare recipients. <br>  <br>  Just use birth control.|`|AepJopG1aa	I personally don't think abortion is right but all women deserve the right to choose what's best for them. There have always been abortions and women will continue to have them. However if you make it illegal you're going to have a lot of sick and dead women who got infections from using a wire coat hanger. I'd rather just agree to disagree with them and let them have a safe clean environment to have the procedure done in.|`|qusZuvqoaa	What business is it of yours what another person does with their body?<br>  <br>  You dont want an abortion, do not get one. <br>  <br>  Freedom of Choice- you can choose to not get one and someone else can choose to get one. <br>  <br>  It is sickening to see someone force their views down others throats.<br>  <br>  <br>  You do realize that a huge portion of the population considers it a fetus and not a child right? I dont see them forcing their views on you.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I'm against abortion, but I see why it shouldn't be illegal. If it were illegal, then there would be so many young women dying from going to back alley abortionists, and so many others getting sick with infections.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	i agree, if you research what the baby has developed you wouldnt want to get an abortion....|`|7XBoIgd6aa	If it's illegal people will get black market ones and possibly die from complications.......Well the way I see it. They just killed their child...Let the ******* die
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	If it is positive, then you are pregnant no matter how early you take the test. It only might not be accurate if it says negative, bc it may be too early for your HCG levels to be high enough for a pregnancy test to detect it. When you become pregnant your body starts producing the hormone HCG. You start with an HCG level of 0 and then once you become pregnant, it doubles every 2-3 days. Home pregnancy tests are designed to detect ceratin levels of this hormone. You only produce this when you are pregnant (or are taking hormones or have a rare medical condition) So if the test is saying positive, then it is detecting that hormone in your body. Congratulations..you are definitely pregnant!!! :) Best Wishes!!!!|`|eytlIKITaa	There is really no such thing as a false positive!  So, congrats!  You're pregnant!!!|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It is pretty rare to get a false positive. Make sure you read the test within an hour after taking otherwise evaporation can cause another line to appear and at that point you would get a false positive. Most likely, you really are pregnant! Congratulations!|`|tljc8Axkaa	i would say you were pregnant depending on the test you used you can now get pregnancy tests that can be done before you period is due and ones were they tell you how far along you are.|`|CLdM1OsLaa	no. could be true.|`|sAbah6dTaa	you will never get a false positive on false negatives.<br>  <br>  sounds like you are pregnant to me !!<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|ki3XY49daa	I have taken MANY pregnancy tests and not once did I take a test that was wrong.  If your tests are positive, make the assumption that you are in fact pregnant. Especially if you got positives before you period was even due.  That has always been the case for me.<br>  :)|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	if you arent sure go to the doc and get a blood test
PdaiyUkDaa	congrats to you|`|kT7GVOosaa	blood tests can pick up pregnancy a lot earlier then a urine test so it sound about right that you had a positive blood test and not a urine test. you are probably only 3 to 4 weeks if even that far.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	i actually just found out i was pregnant yesterday from a blood test.. just two weeks before that i took 2 urine tests and they were both negative, i am 6 weeks

Also why is it taking her over a week to decide what to do? Why is she not talking? I think there is more to this story and all the facts is not out yet. If he did that to her why the police did not arrest him for abusing her when he turned himself in.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Chris brown apparently beat her up that is all I know about it.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	well i bet there's a lot more to the story. but they say that chris brown and rihanna were having an argument during midnight somewhere in this sub division in CALI and that the neighbors called the police cuz they were arguin. apparently, chris hit rihanna and that she cheated on him. i also heard that she told him that she might have passed him an STD but that's all i've heard. i think that chris brown if he did all this is gonna get away with it just cuz he's a famous person and that's wrong
UgZq1pXjaa	How old is he? I know my neighbor that is 12 can wear pampers size 7 pretty good. He used to babysit my 4 yr old son that wears pampers size 7 diapers at night and was taking and wearing and wetting my sons disposable diapers. So I do know they will fit him but they are a bit snug. His mom and dad put him in diapers and they are using a youth diaper from www.bambinodiapers.com. I have seen the bambino diapers and they are happy with them.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Your best bet would probably be Depends.
AA10494763	Well my wife is a stay  at home mom and i am a social worker so same money as a teacher.  We are lucky our house is paid for because she inherited it when her dad died.  Honestly if we had rent or a mortgagee could not afford it at all. I also  used to work a second job two or three nights a week and Saturday to help make ends meet.<br>  <br>  At my second job we have some stay at home moms. I work retail and they work like two or three nights and one weekend day. There husband or parents wacth the kids they work no more than 16-20 hours a week. They work for pocket change as they put it.  There husbands make  lots of money, engineers, business men, etc.  They still take trips and cruises and one just built a house so they can afford to stay home.  They work to get out of the house and get adult conversation.  <br>  Honestly unless your husband takes another job i can't see how you can afford to stay home on a teacher salary then he will miss out like used to.  I am thinking of getting a second job again because things are real tight but i am going to miss my weekends and family.  It was nice while it lasted but i think i have to get something soon<br>  <br>  ETA my mom was a teacher and i never felt left out.  I think it was great and i was luckier than most.  She off when i was off from school. We had all summer together and she taught at my highschool so we went into and left from the same school at the same time.   <br>  <br>  Also tips for staying home.  Ebay is great to save money on clothes especially for the little ones.   YOu need to know the price orginally and look at shipping but you can get great deals. Plan meals so that you don't over spend at the grocery store.  get a deep freezer and buy things on sale. Like our grocery store has buy one get one free hole chickens sometimes and we stock up.   clip cupons get books and movies from the library.  we olny have one car that i have to take so she is stuck home all day. I have not bought new clothes in two years because the kids need clothes all the time.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	I stay at home, but I also have a small home daycare.  I started with just a couple kids and I offer part time care (pay per day).  My son loves having playmates!  I watch few children (5 or less is the INdiana rule)) so I do not need a license.  I also work for a company part time, a few hours every other weekend, at the moment.  I help support adults with disabilities.  Here is an article I wrote several months ago that may give you some ideas:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/932255/simple_ways_to_be_a_stay_at_home_parent.html?cat=25" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>   BTW, I have a degree in elementary education, but I just didn't want someone else to raise my child, and I wanted to do something to make it work.  I have no regrets, and one of these days I will probably get back to teaching (well, I never actually started, but I got my degree), or I will open my own store, which is my new fantasy!|`|4gZYucHMaa	It's sacrificing and on how far you're willing to go<br>  <br>  My husbands wage is above min wage but not great. We roughly $40K per annum.  Things we've done to keep me home is, buying a house that is at the bottom of the price range, going 3 yrs without a car until we could pay for one flat out. (We were paying  about $500 a month on car/ins payments so that was the first to go).I never pay full price for something, that includes food--I know when the store I go to has their meats half price, I'm a very smart shopper so I save us money any way I can.  I cut my own hair and I don't do salons and I do the kids hair as well. My clothes go quite a while until theres holes in but I get the stuff all on sale, same as the kids. We make a lot of sacrifices along the way but as long as the kids are fed (may not always be a lunchables or brand name foods) and are clothed we're good. We don't do holidays, it's a day trip out. There are ways to do it if you're willing to do so. However I don't think it's possible making min wage and doing it.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We sacrifice a lot. We don't eat out very much anymore, hubby's been wearing the same 5 work shirts for 8 months now, he trims my hair instead of going to the salon and we were only able to buy some things for the house when our income tax money came in.<br>  <br>  You have to sacrifice. Work out a budget plan, see if you can afford to stay home for now. When you cut the costs of daycare, the money you spend on gas getting to and from work, and work clothes - you might be able to manage. If you have only 20% of your income left over after paying bills for the month, that will suffice. <br>  <br>  My husband is a Usability Analyst for a bank here and makes $75k a year. It's great money, but once you factor in the mortgage and bills we only have about $1000 a month after that. Take out money for the groceries, diapers, formula, necessary expenses and we only have a few hundred to play with for the entire month. It's not much, but we manage.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|kzyEuRroaa	I am currently a SAHM of 4 kids, one in first grade, the others still at home full time.  My husband is a federal armed security guard, we have a moderate to 'low' income, yet we survive (definetly no where near $5k a month, more like around half that)  I am crafty so I make a bit of money on the side by sewing things for people, and that helps me out.  We live frugally- don't go out to eat much, stay at home a lot, don't spend money on stuff we don't really need.  <br>  <br>  I know that it won't be this way for long, as when all the kids are older we will again be a 2 income family, and that is when we'll benefit from having more income- we will have money to travel, the kids will be older and we will be able to pay for more things.  It's doable, but not easy, but I couldn't have it any other way.  I would be working just to pay for daycare, and it would be totally pointless.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i stay at home now and im going to be a SAHM when our babe is here in april. we dont make that much a year, he is in the army, we make about 25,000 a year. that doesnt include housing allowance[we live on base so we pay no extra except for phone/internet]. our medical insurance is also totally paid for through the army, and we all get a good life insurance policy. growing up, my parents were LOADED im not even going to lie...and when my husband and i got married i didnt know HOW we would be able to afford for me to stay at home...but somehow we are doing it lol and we are doing it comfortably. we dont have ANY credit card debt, no cards at all actually except checking cards. we cant just go out and shop shop shop for fun you know, but i think its worth it to be able to stay at home with my baby. my biggest advise is to NOT GET INTO DEBT, if you cant afford something or are scrambling to afford it and you dont NEED it then dont get it. pay for everything with cash/visa/bankcard...dont get into credit card debt. its also good to do the Dave Ramsey classes..alot of churches have them or you can just buy the DVDs offline...they are really great and work AWESOME.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	My husband is a skydiver.

I do a lot of grading for him so that he can keep up with teaching the equivalent of 4 high-school classes and 3 college classes.  He also teaches summer school.<br>  <br>  We waited for 5 years to have kids, so that we could finish our degrees (he has an M.A. I have a B.A.) and pay off debt before having kids.  Even so, it is difficult.  We only have one car, and my husband uses it for work during the day and 3 nights a week, so I walk to the grocery store, Walmart, etc.  Our "date nights" consist of my making a nice healthy dinner, and us watching a show on tv together.  I worry about my husbands work load, and help out wherever I can.<br>  <br>   I buy most of our clothes/baby gear etc. used, and try only to buy necessities.<br>  <br>  Right now, I'm now trying to find ways to save money on groceries because I've been spending too much, and we don't know when we'll be able to have a second child.  <br>  <br>  I know that I am very blessed.|`|84cfaf7c776803300f7af57e51142bb4aa	I am a stay at home Mommy and currently not bringing in any income, what I am doing is going back to school(an online program) and becoming a medical transcriptionist, that way I can still stay home with my 15 mon old girl and bring in some money. My husband is a locksmith and makes about $60,00 plus a year, but does some work on the side like computers and stuff, its a lil tight at times but we get it done some how with money to spare, after all the bills and money put aside for diapers and groceries, gas etc.... its hard but fun, I am sure you will figure something out, good luck and congrats on the lil one!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	My husband is in the military, so he doesn't make hardly anything above what we need to live, ($1600 a month) we live in base housing (no basic bills) and we budget really well. We don't get any government help like WIC or foodstamps, that would help, but I don't like the idea. There aren't too many extras for me and him, (like none for him, he won't spend on himself, but he likes to bring me home surprises) but the baby gets all she could ever possibly want. So, budgeting and no extras, thats how we get by.|`|Yl93lP1laa	My main goal when I started staying home was to focus on savings money.  I do everything I can to reduce what we consume in the way of electricity, toys, clothing, etc.  And I try to stick with needs vs wants.  Use coupons and discounts when available.  Surprisingly, once you get the knack for it is rather easy.  For instance, I know that if I shop end of the season sales for next year I can save hundreds in clothing costs.  When buying online there are always free shipping codes to be found.  <br>  <br>  But I have to say that you are in a good position (being a teacher) to do after school work too such as tutoring or summer school when your DH can be home with the kids.  You can take the hours you need to earn extra money and still keep your foot in the door for the future.  Best wishes!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I would suggest (and this is what my parents do now, as Mom is putting all/most of her checks towards the store we've opened) making a budget for how much you think you spend a month for EVERYTHING. Food, gas, "entertainment" (eating out, movies, all of that), clothing, hair cuts, Wal Mart stuff (toilet paper, dish washing liquid, shampoo, deo, pillows, etc) and so on. <br>  <br>  Make a menu for a week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, however you want to do it (I do 2 weeks as that's how Daddy's paid - I'm/I was in charge of all the shopping before Jamie came) and STICK to the list of items you need. We don't buy anything (except pads or other major important things that just need to be) name brand. Buy the big bag of cheap chips for lunch, or go healthy with 2 lbs of carrots you cut up (instead of prepackaged baby carrots).<br>  <br>  Try second hand for clothes and toys. Nothing wrong with them. I was raised in them and almost like them better! (More for the same price, and I love clothes).<br>  <br>  Daddy's the office manager for the Employment office for the state. Not a lot of money, but we do fine.|`|wpWU0ntoaa	I guess the bottom line is to organize your priorities.  Our household income is below the poverty level since I quit my job to stay home with my child and 2 school age step children.  Gone are the expensive dinners out, we have two older cars, there are no more fun spend-sprees, I no longer have the cool new shoes every couple weeks, and I no longer fly to see my out of state best friend a couple times a year.  But you know, I wouldn't trade those things for the world.  Already my daughter is nearing 2.5 yrs old, saying the funniest things, and amazing me every day.  I know that this part of my life is short--she's already half way to kindergarten, at which point I'll go back to work.  Honestly, I can look over my life and do I really appreciate at this moment all that money I spent on clothes and things etc, before?  No, now I think about how far a $3,000 spending spree weekend with my girlfriends would go--how many diapers and groceries could I buy with that etc. We don't have extra money, but we did not have debit before I stopped working, and we are very careful.  Although we are eligible, we do not accept ANY state or private assistance (no wic, fuel assistance, food stamps, nothing) and frankly, I'm proud of that.  I am proud that we are able to be resourceful and make it on our own--even when society says we shouldn't be able to.  I clip coupons, buy generic foods, plant a garden in the summer, buy second hand clothes and mend the ones we have, participate in my local freecycle, and browse the web for local deals.  If you truly wish to make the sacrifice, it IS possible.  That said, this was MY choice, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to maintain your standard of living and work.  Being a teacher allows you extra early evenings home (as opposed to a 9-5) and summers off which is still a great deal of mommy-baby time.  Either way, I can tell by your question that you are a great and loving mom and want to do the best by your child so I'm sure you will fine no matter what you choose.  Good luck to you.
d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My daughter was 6 months old when she was Christened.  She was too big to be able to use mine or my husband's traditional gowns so I bought her this beautiful white party dress with gold trim.  We did it on Christmas Eve...talk about a memorable moment.  We met with our Pastor and he set everything up.  He went over the readings and traditional way of how things were done and asked if we wanted to add our own stuff to it but we told him we wanted the traditional Christening.  My church even gave us copies on DVD of it!  I totally cried LOL.   We had a little get-together at my in-law's house afterwards with appetizers and my MIL insisted on having a cake (which I don't think is normally a tradition).  <br>  <br>  I would do like we did...check with your Pastor/Church to find out what you need to do to get the Christening set up.  Pick a date and consult your families to find out about any traditions from the past that they may be able to offer.  Hope this helps.|`|oZEPi0nuaa	It's never too late! call your church, and they'll book you into the Christening course. Then they usually give you a few choices of dates for you to pick from. Invite family and friends. Have a small party after, at the church, house, restaurant, etc.|`|5qE3RnEhaa	It's never to late!  Age is no issue, it's your belief as to what Christening means.  Start your own traditions if your family doesn't have its own.  A tradition could be many things-how you celebrate after the ceremony, what your child wears, christening favors, etc.  My family has used the same handpainted china bowl to hold the christening water for the past 110 years.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I don't think it is ever too old if you belong to a denomination that baptizes babies.  (I'm a baptist, and we don't do this because we believe that baptism should be a personal choice for each individual.)  Talk to the priest (if you're Catholic) or minister if you are of another denomination and ask what you should do.|`|PNZxIFPvaa	No, it's not too old. I have been to Christening for 1 and 2 year olds and 30 year olds. I think if you want to have the baby christened at any age, you should go ahead and do so.
T0gv52CDaa	I'm going to give you the opposite of the advice I just gave the mother of a 4 week old.  Let your daughter cry it out.  We had to do that with my oldest son when he was around a year old and suddenly stopped sleeping through the night.  I followed the steps in Dr. Ferber's Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, and it worked like a charm.  It took about a week, and that week was MISERABLE for all of us, but miraculously on day 8 I put him in his crib awake at 8:00, and by 8:15, he was peacefully snoring without a single tear.|`|nT6dNIfBaa	Put a tv in her room.. watching the tv will make her tired.. and will keep her mind off of other things.. (like being scared) throughout the night if you leave the tv on when she wakes up she will notice it.. start to watch it again.. and fall back asleep. hopefully. It is important to get daddy back in the room. I know directv even has an educational channel you can put on for her.. like litlte einstein.. that way it is educational for her as well. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|VpIMA2QDaa	uhm maybe try putting her in again, and then you can read to her or let her watch a television and leave the light on. when ever she gets out of bed just put her back in, yeah you might not feel like it at like 4am lol. but it helps just keep putting her back in and she will learn. hope i helped :)|`|0pAczRv2aa	i think graudually let her more and more be on her own put i tddy bear close by to make it more comforting and dont hold her as much, if she sleeps on her back put her next to things, if she sleep side better for teddy bear and on stomch insted of always picking her up try to rub her back more. trust me its a stage, and it will get easer but your going to miss this time your goign to want it back your going to wish these years hadnt gone by so fast shes little now, make sure you always watch her,<br>  good luck with her.(:
ga22X0Gpaa	whore|`|GfphOIdOaa	take a test. available at the local pharmacy|`|uEs7n7xgaa	are you speaking in secret women code that only women understand?|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Chances are pretty high. You most likely ovulated on cd14 and your symptoms sound very promising. Good luck!|`|atNbl4ataa	it could be pregnancy, or it could be hysteria...your mind is convinced somthing is true, so the body makes it so, not the pregnancy i mean but the symptoms|`|uRuoINt0aa	i would suggest you to take a test on Sunday itself..and by what all you have written here they are all symptoms of early pregnancy...hope you get what you want..    hope this helps you..!!|`|X4FQBmo9aa	There is always a chance when you let him ejaculate in you without a condom being involved.  My ex-husband and I got pregnant when I was on birth control.    If you are really worried you should buy a pregnancy test at the pharmacy.  They aren't that expensive and it will help your stress levels if you knew for certain what was going on.  You could just be getting more intense PMS symptoms than you are used to.  I know that my symptoms were worse between the ages of 17-24.|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	Please consider condoms for all future incursions. andyes, you are pregnant.|`|DvJJu8Dwaa	If you don't get your period.  Go to the doctor in less you want that baby :]  Good Luck if you want it.  Best of luck.  And One more thing I think you might be.    I hope I helped.
tkqGwbtHaa	usually the body will just expel what it does not need, so (this may sound gross) check their urine, do not be alarmed if it is very yellow.     but as a precaution, you need to give your doc a call.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The 5 year old should be alright. The one year old, I would be one the phone to Dr. right now.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	WHY would the vitamins- children's or otherwise- be in a place they could reach them?   Put them up where they can't get to them, preferrably in a locked cabinet. They need to know they aren't candy as well- which is probably what they don't realize is that vitamins are like MEDICINE and aren't something you eat whenever because it can make them sick.    I'd probably lay off the vitamins for about a week before starting up on them again and a phone call to the doctor may not hurt either to see what they say.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Iron is the main mineral to be concerned about. Call the pedi, tell her the amounts and your children's body weight.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	they should be alright, but the iron is something that could be bad. I would call poison control, they will help out:    1-800-222-1222    I have called so many times about my children eating Desitin, anti bacterial soap and other various items...they are very helpful and informative.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Call poison control and they can advise you on if you need to be concerned.|`|dM8EyL6caa	Flintstones??? My 5 year old has done the same thing, only he ate half the bottle. He was fine, no problems at all. They should be okay. Just be thankful it was childrens multivitamins and nothing worse. Hope everthing goes well. Good Luck!!
wzXJOSIeaa	Yes, it could be stress. Most likely it is if you've already taken two home pregnancy test. One time my period was 5 weeks late due to stress.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes it could be.  Wait a week and if still no period, take another test.|`|THZEgP3waa	its very likely stress.  try to relax and wait a few days before you test again.  try using a different brand incase the one you have isnt very sensitive, some women dont show many hormones right away|`|mxixfE3Raa	It's probably stress, have you had unprotected sex?   If you haven't then it's likely stress. Chill out a bit and try not to worry, if you still haven't got your period in a week, take another test with morning urine.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	Stress --of course.  If you re-test use a different brand of test.  The cheaper store brands are fine and actually many of them will give and earlier result than the big name highly advertised ones.    You could have a skipped ovulation or an ectopic pregnancy but a tubal or ectopic pregnancy would give you positive result on the urine test.      There is a blood test for a different hormone than the urine tests for that you can have done.  A pelvic exam can show uterine changes or a tran vaginal ultrasound can show pregnancy this early.    If you have already past your late day for your period the urine test should be accurate.
pqZAhBLvaa	I'd give it a week. That's probably what your doctor would say. If you're pregnant, you should be able to get a positive test in a week for sure.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Wait another week and if still no period, retest.  If you still get a negative, then contact your doctor.|`|AA10377490	I'd go to your doctor in a week or two.
ff3vSUI1aa	There is so much advice online about how to chart fertility. In my opinion, the OPKs and temperature charting can be misleading as the results don't always make sense. The best way to chart fertility - and to give you the maximim window in which your fertility is high or peak - is to use a Clearblue Fertility Monitor.    It does mean you have to pee on a stick 10 days out of each cycle (or up to 20 if you have irregular periods), but the results are absolutely crystal clear and easy to interpret. It tells you on which days your oestrogen is rising (a few days before ovulation) and the day or two when you are actually ovulating, giving you around 5 days of good fertility.     I am nearly 35, was convinced I'd have trouble conceiving as have alwayas had irregular periods, and after three months of using the monitor, am now pregnant. It gives you peace of mind that you are in control of your cycle which helped me to feel less stressed about the whole thing. Good luck!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	when using opk's if u dont get a positive result you are supposed to keep testing. your test being nearly positive means you were prob on your way to a positive opk but you shouldnt stop testing til you see a positive. then you stop using opks.  your bbt thermal shift should be elevated temps for 3 days. it wont show til after you ovulated so its no good for predicting ovulation.    how is your cm? have you had any ewcm? i think you prob o'd 2 days after the opk was + but you have got to use them correctly or they are no help.    good luck    read up on fertilityfriend and askdramy.com could be good to educate yourself to make the most of temping|`|jaP0TANdaa	Yes, most likely you did not ovulate. Now, if you take your temp tomorrow and it's back up (and then stays up)... either the 96.9 was a fluke (something was not right, room was colder than usual, etc.) or you ovulated yesterday. What was your temp this morning? Those weird temps right around ovulation are HORRIBLE and makes it difficult to tell for sure what day you ovulated.
cAtWxJG1aa	that sounds totally normal for my kids.  okay, maybe we can go 8 weeks in the winter when snowpants are on top.<br>  <br>  pat yourself on the back that your son is active, and keep in mind they would have outgrown them soon, anyway.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	Little boys are usually rough, and you can't do much about it. You'd have to find some extra tough denim online if you want to make them last longer.<br>  With the shorts, you probably won't be able to do much about him scraping his knees up. Only if you want him to wear knee pads or wrap cloth something around them, but that's a little extreme.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Normal for some.  My first son was that way.  He would rip the knees out every time. <br>  It got so irritating,  I started putting patches on the inside of the knees as soon as I bought them~  kind of like a reinforced knee.<br>  My other three sons never have the problem, so I DO believe that it is normal for some and not fo others...like everything else|`|oojO4WAraa	There are iron on patches you can iron to the inside of the knee to give them more strength. <br>  <br>  After he skins his knees a few times, he will stop falling on them.  That is part of growing up.  Or you could have him wear knee guards until he is 18.|`|AA11210211	wow he is hard on jeans,I do think it is the brand, try a thicker blend.My son has the same problem with socks,I swear that boy can have a brand new pair on for 2 hrs and they will get a hole where the big toe is.|`|K3XJ4S0Eaa	it sounds like your little boy is skidding on the floor on his knees, tell him not to  :)|`|l2kQZQkwaa	I found that the denim that Old Navey uses isn't very durable and I ended up spending more money on replacements than if I just forked the cash for Levis (I don't know if they still make them but Tough Skins (I think they are a Levi brand too) come with patches already in the knees to give them extra durability.|`|mO7FOXNYaa	All you can do is have some peroxide and band aids ready!<br>  <br>  As a mom to a boy, it is bound to happen. Eventually, the skin on his knee with become tougher.<br>  <br>  I don't remember ever having problems with Old Navy brand jeans - so maybe you have a VERY crazy little one. haha.<br>  <br>  I know that my son's school pants have some patch on the inside right at the knee- maybe you could do something like that with your son's jeans.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FHT6wsUpaa	Every piece of denim I've ever purchased from Old Navy has been on the "thin" side. It could be the brand. Kids are just hard on clothes, though!<br>  <br>  Knee pads for summer? I'm not sure. Questions like these are a reminder of the many things I still have to look forward to!! :)|`|OBuzcIDbaa	He's a typical boy! (-: I think Levis hold up better. But why not go ahead and let him wear them. Isn't that the style?  As far as shorts go---might as well just load up on bandaids. (-:|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Try a different brand.  When it comes time for shorts, I'm not sure what you should do.  Tellhim to be careful, I guess.|`|AA11537580	my daughter always out grows her clothes before they get ripped.<br>  could be too that she has lots of clothes and only has to wear an item 2-3 times a month, so I guess they last longer.|`|JAZqgHpGaa	This is a good sign.  He's playing hard.<br>  I used to go through jeans like that when I was little.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	actually I have never really had that problem with my kids.  With me, it is the stains they get on the clothes|`|hI4m3Pnqaa	It's normal when my nephew was 6 it seemed like his mom was always buyin him jeans because he'd get a hole in them the 2nd time he wore them|`|tREDFurlaa	strap pillows on his knees.....
ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	very normal and after an internal its not uncommon for that to loosen the plug so good signs for you x x x|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Yup, it's normal. I had some spotting last pregnancy after a check and was told it's normal.|`|AVz4JS69aa	are you talking about  babies? lol i dont know|`|MQ34YW28aa	yes, i always did after i had that done.|`|WgyGipBMaa	yupp yupp|`|34YAS4a0aa	yes it is! Congrats!|`|KZMezu7oaa	Yes it is VERY normal. Just like spotting after intercourse during pregnancy.|`|QuKzGOBoaa	Yes, totally normal! Your doc should have told you that :) Nothing to worry about. Now, if there is significant bleeding, definitely let your doctor know. But just spotting is totally OK.  You can always talk to your health provider if worried - just for peace of mind.  Also know that if you are 37 weeks and over, you are really full-term! Baby can be born anytime now and be a full-term healthy baby.|`|Fxp06hBoaa	yes it is i've only had one baby but i remember that i spotted with her and i kinda was freakin out because i was and the doctor reassured me that it sometimes happens after a check up but they had told me that if you keep spotting after a few days to go back so that they can make sure everything is ok|`|h85kkDsbaa	Yes its normal, after i had this i then lost the plug. Congrats X|`|CHCPnvksaa	Yup, I was checked for it too and mild spotting is fairly normal. If it gets heavy, you may want to call your doc to make sure, but a few spots are OK
Fh4B88ZGaa	You might have ovulated late, so it could be implantation.<br>  <br>  If you definitely ovulated 16 days ago, it is unlikely it is implantation.<br>  <br>  If you just implanted this morning, I doubt the blood work will show anything- it usually takes at least a few days for the hormone levels to start increasing. The way you've described it, it was only hours.<br>  <br>  If your blood work says negative and you still don't have your period, I would take an HPT in about a week, if this was implantation it should be accurate by then.
cteyFJxhaa	You know those gel deodorants?  The kind where you twist the little dial on the bottom and the deodorant squishes though the holes in the top.

My husband also has naturally awful smelling feet! It "runs in his family" his mom says. He's tried everything and it doesn't seem to help, we use odor eaters everytime he takes his shoes off and he showers regularly to!|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Try getting him to put peppermint oil in his shoes, or to soak his feet in water with peppermint oil in it-it's meant to stop gross feet smells!<br>  Or, I know you can buy things like foot deoderant, and shoe sprays etc..look around :) <br>  <br>  <br>  I honestly don't understand foot fetishes...feet just make me think "...eugh!". <br>  GL|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Have you tried having him wear foot powder to help with sweating.<br>  <br>  Also check he might have athletes foot or fungus of the nails starting.<br>  <br>  Make sure he doesn't wear socks to bed so his feet can air out.<br>  <br>  Never wear tennis shoes without socks.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	UGHHHHH EWWWWWW CARRiEEEE!!!!<br>  LIKE EWWWW<br>  <br>  NO lol Idk just get him gold bond foot powder for odor or something like that.<br>  <br>  He must be one of those people who just lets the soap from everywhere else "wash" his feet.<br>  Jk Lol|`|F3BRG72iaa	well i think the best thing you can do is take him to a doctor because he might have athletes foot|`|fU3U6FfEaa	have you tried that powder you can put in your shoes?<br>  or spray lysol in them|`|AunZaJOEaa	Thats weird you should probably ask a doctor|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Put baking soda in his shoes or spray them with febreze. My husband has the same problem, since he wears his shoes all day and is on his feet all day. He may grow out of it, but until he does, this is what I do for my husband's shoes, and his feet don't stink nearly as much.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Teen boys always wear their sneakers everywhere. Through the rain and snow and mud. Their sneakers once wet become a breeding ground for bacteria. The powders and stuff just cover up the smell and a washer actually makes it worse unless you use bleach. You have to kill the bacteria to kill the smell. Bake them in the hot sun for a few days. Saturate them in bleach or lysol and let them dry completely. Of course whatever you do will only last until he gets them wet again. Then the little buggers will start allover again.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	15 year old boy hormones...lol. I think most of them have really smelly feet and most grow out of it by the time they're 18...Some girls "suffer" from it too.<br>  <br>  Don't worry and don't make him feel insecure about it! :o) You can get special sprays for feet and shoes...just ask next time your shopping..I think it's "Odour Eaters" or something... x|`|j2mRop0laa	My daughter has clammy feet and we used to have this problem. I got some herbal peppermint essential oil at a health store and when she takes a shower, after scrubbing up, she puts a few drops of the peppermint on her bath scrunchie and scrubs her feet. That's the only thing that has helped.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Ok I have a weird answer, but here it goes. Have him soak his feet in the tub or bucket with vinegar dilute with some water. Good luck & Peace|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Does he ever wear his shoes without socks? That can cause shoe and foot odor.|`|5p7gpj36aa	have him soak his feet in peroxide and spray the inside of his shoes at night with peroxide in a spray bottle -- then wash all his socks separately in a peroxide solution ( with your normal soap) and see if this helps.<br>  <br>  Do the peroxide soak like every day at first and then once a week rill under control....... my brother had the stinkiest feet I have ever smelled in my life.  He would make people gag all the time.  It was horrible - and then someone told me about this and we tried it and it worked........ we also bought new shoes and socks after the first soaks so that we had a "fresh start" lol  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	Get him some 100% cotton socks, then get rid of the leather shoes! I know several people who when they wear leather their feet smell so funky that you could puke! Same with the shoes themselves. The best shoes for this are ones that allow your feet to "breath" I have a pair of these myself, they are kind of pricey, but they can last for about 3 years if you take good care of them.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	My husband had this problem. Have him wear white socks only. Someting in the dye of colored socks makes feet smell worse faster. Same with shoes. Make sure it has a white interior. Im not sure why this works but it does.|`|AA12145826	It sounds like he might need to see a podiatrist. He could have foot fungus. Or maybe he just needs to change socks more often and was his feet several times a day.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	My sister is kinda like that.... Mom got some kind of Goldbond powder that helped some.<br>  <br>  Its just sweaty feet. Have you tried JUST canvas or leather (no man-made materials) shoes?|`|8PmgWto5aa	Well, why do you expect from men? They stink a lot because they do dirtier work.|`|AA11537580	try Geox shoes, they breath more and let the sweat out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geox.com/</a>|`|ZN5bBNevaa	you need to buy him shioes that hasleather thats what mother in law did with my husband when he was at that age
Fh4B88ZGaa	They will not go away, but you should stop getting new ones after the baby is born. You'll have to go to the dermo to have them removed, but don't bother until after the baby comes, or you'll be there constantly.|`|6igjX2cnaa	You will probably have to go to the dr/or dermatologist to get it removed.  They will probably stick around other wise.  Hormones are a crazy thing hun! Best wishes!|`|sMvWJDqsaa	I have yet to try this out...but I know a lady that used castor Oil...can be purchased at any grocery store...and she took a Q-tip and applied the oil directly to her skin tags...said it may take a week or so, but they will fall off...she also said that they never came back after using the oil...try it and see!!
1os95dHZaa	You have it. We were to busy, and its still warm that time of year. (or feels warm with all the drinking to have to deal with family) Then things wind down and we get sloshed and wonder just who it was we slept with on NYE/NY. <br>  We really need to know the last period counting thing to help with the "OMG I hope its my husband or his brothers so maybe it will look like him kinda feeling." And lets not forget "oh sh*t I hope its not his boss's or the mechanic's because they are both black and that will be hard to explain!" I opted to go with the black sheep excuse just in case... "Sometimes they just come out black!"|`|OT8TMTOHaa	Yes everyone was too busy and stressed out. Then they decided to try in the new year for a babby.<br>  Do you know how funny I find that graph?|`|DauMaNUjaa	About a third of the kids in my grade (me included) were born in July 1994. We were trying to figure out if something big had happened 9 months prior...|`|snUDfcfgaa	What are you doing on here so early?  <br>  <br>  I don't know about the rest of the world, but I know I shagged on NY Eve.|`|SPFjXG3Uaa	Is this in raw numbers or is this rate?  Maybe people were too busy with life to come online.  This would coorelate with a dip in posts in general.<br>  Also, there may be more people around to talk to during this time, so you dont ask people online if your pregnant, you ask your cousin or friend.  <br>  With the stress of the holidays, you may not be paying as much attention to your body.  You dont notice any symptoms and forget when your last period began or when your period is supposed to begin.  <br>  <br>  After the new year, life returns to normal and we go back to our ways of asking intangible strangers about our reproductive success.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My guess is that they were too busy right before the holidays, otherwise they would have been asking a lot during the holidays.  Maybe with the economy, people were too stressed to get it on while trying to figure out how they were going to buy gifts.  Then, after they bought all the gifts, they got it on like rabbits.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	They were so sad about the economy but hope sprung eternal with the New Year and Obama coming into office (he's going to save the world of course) that the repressed sexual urges overwhelmed the masses and they got busy.
FRFryWDfaa	yes it wont be long defiantly by the end of the week i would say good luck and congratulations|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	You are not even due. Are they worried the baby is going to have problems. If not they need to let you alone since you are not past your due date. I hear labor is more painful after being induced. Let it happen naturally when the baby is ready. As long as there is no major health risks going on. Best wishes.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You can be dilated and effaced for weeks before delivery. Your body is just doing what it is supposed to, and as long as you and baby are healthy, there's no reason whatsoever to rush it. Tell your doctor to get lost and leave you alone until you're *really* overdue.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	seems like baby is pushing out! baby sounds ready...why isn't mama?|`|IFqY2w1Paa	Wow! It sounds like it could be, but you never know exactly when it's going to happen. It could be tonight, it could be a week from now. Good luck and congrats. =)|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Congrats on being dilated and effaced already!     Unfortunately it really doesn't mean anything. You could come today or in 3 weeks. Your labor could be short or fast or average. Every woman is different and so is every labor/delivery.     I'm not trying to let you down, just keep things real for you. I know how hard those last few weeks are so hang in there and remember that it's almost over!|`|vue9NOhYaa	Probably you will go into labor sometime in the next 2-3 weeks. (And this would also be true if you weren't dilated/effaced.)      It's pretty  late, but have you considered switching doctors?  Sounds like you have tech-happy docs who are not going to stop pressuring you for  unnecessary interventions once you DO go into labor.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I was 85% and 2 CM for 2 weeks. I hope it is soon for you though.|`|aEmdURPTaa	It could mean that.  It could also not mean anything.  Each woman, each pregnancy is different.  Some women only start to efface and dilate at the very last minute, others a few weeks before delivery.    Why is your doctor pressing you for induction before your due date?  Is this your first baby?  If so, it is even possible that you don't deliver before your 42th week, and it is absolutely normal and fine.      Good luck standing up for yourself and your baby! :-)
KozoNqpsaa	And what does this teach our youth today? That it's perfectly fine to be irresponsible and selfish as long as you get yourself noticed by the media where people might feel sorry for you and give you a handout. <br>  <br>  Great life lesson!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I don't think that's fair at all but life's not fair. I really hope it's not the taxpayers who are giving it to her and I'd be really ashamed of myself if I were the one who was so desperate someone had to buy me a house......the whole situation is sad and disgusting but not much you can do about it now.......is she really happy? She's never going to be able to take her children on vacations or anything big like that without the help of handouts. I guess in today's society everyone wants something for free, and she got it......|`|AA10819407	If she is going to be getting help, she needs to have someone<br>    monitor what she is buying, all aspects of buying. vehicles, furniture, etc..($ 1.2 mil home not needed) this only shows more of her narcissistic personality..<br>   I have more of a concern for the children than for the mother at this point.The babes did not ask to be born into the circus this has turned into...( I also feel for the grandparents that are about to lose their home)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://strangeoc.freedomblogging.com/2009/02/19/octo-mom-about-to-foreclose-on-home/7465/" rel="nofollow">http://strangeoc.freedomblogging.com/200...</a>|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	Crazy world, isn't it?|`|AA11109728	It's a hard situation.  No, *she* doesn't deserve it, and it's not fair that she had so many kids on purpose knowing she can't support them.  On the other hand, the babies themselves deserve it.  I don't want to see any of the children suffer because their mom is an idiot.  They didn't ask to be put here, they deserve a decent home and people looking after them.  I caught one celebrity on tv last night making a comment that she would like to donate baby items (diapers and formula, etc.) but she would not donate money, because the mom doesn't know how to be responsible with it.  I'm sure many people feel the same way.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There's no evidence that this is true, its just a rumor.<br>  <br>  She was temporarily (for 2-3 days) moved into a safe house that was apparently quite nice because of death threats.  She has since gone back home to the 1500 square foot house that belongs to her parents.<br>  <br>  Where I live mom's of twins get public health nurses for some time each week, I believe its 20hours a week.  So obviously a mom of octuplets would get more.  From a monetary standpoint home care with nurses is often far cheaper than hospitalized care, and its safer.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Ok, this doesn't make sense to me. I saw the same thing on the news, but they said it was only a 4 bedroom house.....missing a few bedrooms don't you think??<br>  <br>  As for it being fair or not, if you take out the crazy lady (mom) who had them, there is 16 kids that need a home that is large enough for them.

Does she deserve an extravagant home, no, but do her children deserve a proper home, yes. <br>  <br>  I think the only way those babies would get taken care of correctly would be with help, and I am sure a nurse would be a perfect candidate to care for those preemies. <br>  <br>  Is it fair that she gets preferential treatmeant, no, but I like to think these things are provided to help the babiese, not her crazy ***.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	we have this one and LOVE it http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    plus we can bring it other places as it is portable. The pad comes off and goes in the wash (even though you don't want to do that...put it could be wiped too) and this can be used from high chair to booster seat. It folds flat for easy portability.     Plus it takes up no extra space as you attach it to a chair you already have! And no worries about the crotch area... it's just straps.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Once we got one of those blue portable plastic chairs - they come with a tray, you just put them on a regular chair, for our older son, we got another for our younger.      They were totally easier than high chairs. Both to strap in, and to clean. And 5 bucks at rummage sale.
ZusC87WBaa	You just need to remind yourself that you are married to a man.  The way he is acting is very normal.  I know we all hear about the husbands that are as excited as their wives, but trust me, that's not the norm.  He's not a woman and he's not going to act like a woman.  The only baby outfits he's going to care about are maybe the ones that have his favorite sports team on them.  His behavior in no way indicates the kind of dad he will be, so don't even worry about that.  Until the baby is actually there in your house, it may just be too abstract of a thought for him to really wrap his brain around.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	You can't make him excited and you can't make him pumped.  Some men actually require there to be a baby in the belly before they get outright stoked lol.  I've known a few of those types in my time.  I know one in particular who had to actually wait to hold his child before he was happy, thrilled, cried, etc.  <br>  <br>  Tell him that while you want kids and that you'll be caring for them, it'll also be on his plate to help out and to be there when you can't.  If he's not ready to do it, give him another year or so.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	A lot of time men are not going to be oh so happy. Its very stressful from a mans point. Another mouth to feed and provide for. Big deal!! Big one! Its hard and stressful. Even if he wants kids not all men show it like women want. Try to relax and enjoy the baby making part go get something sexy to help make him excited to make a baby|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Not sure you should have any, both people need to want them and sounds to me like he clearly doesnt. <br>  Talk to him like you have on here and see what he says, tell him how upset you are etc and how you feel he has changed.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I wish I knew the answer, me and my husband have four and he has never been overly excited, when I told him I was pregnant it was like "O Ok", he would do whatever I asked him to do during the pregnancy but he couldn't think of things on his own I would have to tell him what I needed done, but now they we have are children he is a GREAT father..he is very involved with the children..they are 6,3,2, and 5 months...so if he is saying that he wants kids then I am sure he does maybe he just doesn't know how to react.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	From a guys perspective, let me tell you that getting excited about having kids is not something that we typically do.  Since we can't do a blasted thing about it - it's pretty much entirely the woman's decision - it does no good to be excited until it's actually on the way.<br>  <br>  What's the point of getting excited when she can change her mind about it?  Then we just get to be disappointed.<br>  <br>  If you REALLY want him to be excited, take him to the first ultrasound.  That's the point that I became thrilled and wanted to tell everyone.  Prior to that, I was playing the wait and see game too.  Well, that and the whole 'trying to conceive' thing is also pretty exciting too :-)|`|LXja60cyaa	Well speaking from a mans point of view (actually im 16 :D) he's probably not really doing good at the moment, im sure when you have the baby he will be psyched about it. I remember my dad was the same way, but then when i was born he was really cool about it.|`|gClDDlgjaa	Well just focus on the baby for now and once he sees that bundle of joy he'll be a very proud father.
MQ34YW28aa	i did. i found out i had pre eclampsia at 33 weeks and ended up on bed rest and was induced at 37 weeks and didn't work and then i had to come in at 38 weeks to get induced again. i also had bad headaches and vision spots and did alot of those 24 hour urines to see if my protein levels got higher they did but not much.
uhj76Fkpaa	This is something that you should discuss with your parents.If they have no problem letting you move in with him then I guess that you can.But be careful : show your parents that you love and care for them,explain that it's a moving that has to do with extending your relationship not that you don't want to be in the same house with them cause you can never know how things may turn out to be.If you break up in the future(which I hope that you won't) make sure that their door will always be open to your return.<br>  <br>  I wish you best of luck.Take care|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Please think long and hard before you do something like this...even if you can !!! You're only 16. Chances are, you probably won't be with this guy forever, then where will you go. Are your parents really that terrible? If you ask me, I would highly question why your boyfriend's parents are encouraging you to move in with them instead of encouraging you to respect your own parents. Is there something going on at home that you didn't mention other than perhaps your parents are strict? Moving in with a grandparent or Aunt and Uncle is one thing. Moving into your boyfriends home could cause more problems than you have already.|`|zFZ2EAsmaa	..im not sure if you could move out legally. Im not from Washington but im from Kansas and the age is 18. Unless your parents will let you. but other then that it's still a long ways togo. Your parents would prolly have to agree with it since if your under the legal age then they can keep you if they choose to.|`|6zuoRhFvaa	if your parents give permission then you can. if they don't you have to get emancipated. which, in less you can prove that you can provide for yourself financially, or that your parents are hindering you're development, your chances are pretty slim. <br>  <br>  my advice is to get over it. why would you want to move out in the first place?|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	Not legally unless you become an emancipated minor.

How are you going to get a job and go to school at the same time to pay for the things you need?|`|cwZ2Q8kYaa	I know that here in Canada you can legally move out when you're 16, not sure about the States. I think you've got to be 18 in the U.S.A. though, sorry!
bHAlwhTBaa	My immediate response is no.  You should give him at least 6 oz per feeding.  But it may depend on how old he is.  I started supplementing with formula at 6 months because I couldnt pump enough.  At that point, the doctor wanted him to take 8 oz bottles, so that is what my baby sitter gives him:  2-8 oz bottles between 7 and 3, plus fruit and cereal.      The bottom line:  consult your doctor.|`|zwctZ812aa	I'm not trying to change your mind because I know how hard it is pumping at work and at home to try to get enough bottles to give your baby during the day whilke you're at work, but your employer is legally required to provide you with time and a place to pump at work.  I can give you the sections in the labor code if you want.  Anyways, start out giving him 2 ounce bottles of formula when you are home if he has never taken it before.  He may refuse it, and you don't want to waste the whole 4 ounces, or put him in a place where you aren't there to feed him if he won't take it.  We have been trying for 2 months to get my son to take formula and he hates the taste and won't drink it.  He is 3 months old.  If he has no problem with it, try the 4 ounces.  youwill find out pretty quickly what size bottle you need to be giving him.  good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That's hard to say.  Babies tend to take more formula because it sits in their stomach longer, on the other hand some breastfed babies take less because they don't like it.    As long as you allow your baby to nurse on demand when you are home they will get enough breastmilk, so they don't actually need formula if they don't want it.    Also if all you need is 4oz per day you should be able to get it pumping first thing in the morning (or even just the other breast while your son nurses in the morning), once in the evening, and just before bed.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/17feed_ba...  3. Babies need to drink milk when the mother is not at home.    Not true. Three or four good nursings during a 24 hour period plus a variety of solid foods gives the baby all he needs nutritionally, and thus he does not need any other type of milk when you are at your outside job. Of course, solid foods can be mixed with expressed milk or other milk, but this is not necessary.  4. If the baby is to get milk other than breastmilk, it needs to be artificial baby milk (infant formula) until the baby is at least 9 months of age.    Not true. If the baby is breastfeeding a few times a day and getting fair quantities of a variety of solid foods, infant formula is neither necessary nor desirable. Indeed, babies who have not had infant formula before 5 or 6 months of age often refuse to drink it because it tastes pretty bad. (If you want to convince yourself of how little we know about breastmilk, ask yourself why it is that, although breastmilk and infant formulas have the same amount of sugar, breastmilk is so much sweeter). If you want to give the baby some other sort of milk, homogenized milk is acceptable at 6 months of age, as long as it is not the babys only food. In fact, if the baby is taking good quantities of a wide variety of foods, breastfeeding 3 or 4 times a day, and growing well, homogenized milk or 2% milk is good enough, but also not necessary.  5. Babies need to drink milk to get calcium.    Not true. If you are worried about the babys intake of calcium, he can eat cheese or yogurt. There is no need to drink the calcium. Besides, if the baby is also breastfeeding, breastmilk still contains calcium.      http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...  When a mother is having trouble pumping enough to satisfy her baby while they are separated, is it acceptable to give the baby mashed banana instead of formula to satisfy his hunger?    The addition of solid foods between four and six months is appropriate, but it is important to distinguish between adding solids because the baby is developmentally ready and adding solids because the baby is not getting enough breast milk. Formula is the usual replacement for inadequate breast milk in infancy, especially for a baby who is not gaining well. However, in that situation the mother needs to consult her doctor to determine what would be best to give her baby.    In the case you mentioned, it was appropriate to offer the mother tips on improving her pumping techniques. Sometimes, too, the caregiver needs to be reminded that a breastfed baby does not need to consume the same amount of human milk as a formula-fed baby needs. The caregiver may be interpreting the baby's need to be held and comforted as hunger. A mother who is having trouble pumping may also need to be reminded to nurse often when she and the baby are together to keep baby well nourished and to improve her milk supply.    If baby is growing well and nursing often when he and his mother are together, the suggestion given in THE WOMANLY ART, to offer a small amount of mashed banana, could tide baby over until the mother returns without introducing the potential allergy risk of giving infant formula. The baby is not likely to take enough mashed banana to interfere with his willingness to nurse, whereas after several ounces of formula, the baby may not be interested in nursing when his mother is available.    Thank you again, Celeste and Joanne. Your questions have helped us all look at this topic and gain added insight into starting solids and providing documentation for those who might question the reasoning behind LLL's information.
AA10976951	I don't think I would to school but I pretty much let my daughter wear what ever she wants around the house.      One day she said that our neighbor had asked her if she was dressed for Halloween and she told him no.  I said "Well, what did you have on that he would ask that?"  She said "Giraffe pants, a shirt, and a blanket tied like a cape!"  She said this like it was the most normal outfit in the world!    It was hilarious and that's life at our house.  She runs around dressed how she wants.  Whether it's an outfit like above or frilly dresses and high heels.  We don't think there is anything wrong in letting her express herself in her way.  I do however draw the line on crazy outfits in public lol.|`|NuBGDBtWaa	My son. The revolutionary! Yup! Sounds about right.        I'd think about that one for sec. Then I'd think about the other children suddenly wanting to where there's and how this random expression would irk the teachers in to some weird mode. But, I don't see any wrong in it. I mean, if the kids beating children, smacking teachers on the cheeks, cursing and failing to obey any rules, then I would definitely rearrange that craving in to a collard shirt. Oh and I would hold off on the ballerina because people hate for no reason..     The end..|`|fXzed3fLaa	No, only because it would be disruptive to the classroom.  If we were going to the grocery, then yes.|`|Z0GIwoP6aa	Yes definitely! I am a nanny for a little boy (who is home schooled) and I let him wear a costume to the mall yesterday. Yea, we got looks, but they were mostly smiles and a lot of nice comments. Kids are only little once, let them live.  And it doesnt matter if he wants to be the hulk or a ballerina...men dance ballet too!|`|tudie6lvaa	nope|`|k0JrIl1Oaa	No i wouldn't.  At the beginning of the year the school sends home a parent handbook, which clearly states what your child can wear and cannot wear.  My child's school has special weeks ( a few times a year) where  they can wear certain things (hat day, pajama day, crazy hair day, etc. ) but the costume is only to be worn during the day when they have their halloween party, and even then they cannot wear masks, anything really scary or with blood, fake weapons, etc.  More than likely, they will call the parents and have them bring a change of clothes and may also give detention or another form of punishment due to they are told what they can wear and not.|`|Qz3sii2caa	No, he gets to run around in costume plenty at home. At school, it's time to focus on his studies. I think it's a fair trade. You don't want your child to be a distraction and if the other kids see it, they'll want to wear costumes to school too. Total chaos!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	No, I wouldn't. Unless it is planned to where all the students would be doing this, it would just take away from the other students education. One big distraction...the kid would probably be sent home with the parent to change.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no they'd get sent home|`|rNvXWMOMaa	no way|`|AA11537580	how old?  5-6 (kindergarten or grade one) yes  older -no|`|AA11755924	no - my son's school has a strict dress code.  They have to be in uniform every day...but even if it wasn't uniform, most schools still have a dress code policy so they probably wouldn't be able to get away with it anyway.

Jacob is ok. I don't care for Sam either.)<br>  <br>  Austin Conley Brown ~ 9 (Great pair! I love it almost as much as Tristan Riley.)<br>  <br>  Lillian Taylor Brown (Lilly) ~ 7 (I like Lillian. While I'm not a fan of Taylor personally, the flow is good.)<br>  <br>  Bailey Marie Brown ~ 2 (I don't care for Bailey. I dislike Marie personally, but if I'm remembering correctly, it has a specail meaning to you, doesn't it? Isn't it after someone? If so, I'm all for the use of it.)<br>  <br>  Alaina Tatum Brown (Lanie)  ~ 8.5 (I love Alaina. Tatum is growing on me. I don't love it or even really "like" it, but I dont' hate it anymore. It fits very well here as a middle name for Alaina.)<br>  <br>  Lillian Emily Brown (Lilly)  ~ 7 (I like Lillian. Emily is ok. I don't think they go together very well though.)<br>  <br>  I remember you saying your first boy would probably be Tristan Riley, is that still accurate? How about the first girl, what are you thinking for that? :)|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Taylor, Tatum, and Bailey are all masculine boy names.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	Sebastian Jacob and Lillian Taylor are both gorgeous names!|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	I only liked the first one, sorry. Th others were to boring

I've always loved the short form Tay myself.    I know a Hayley Brinn.  That sounds good together too.    Good luck!    EDIT:  Another way to get the short form Tay or Tae is to call her Taylen or Taylin.  I discovered that name while I was pregnant last year and loved it but ended up with a boy.  Taylen is a lot more unique than Taylor.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Samantha Brynn  Molly Brynn  Nikki Brynn  Arianna Brynn  Tasha Brynn|`|8c0da8297c21a0dca0adfbd8634cf81eaa	We named our daughter Brynna, but we often call her Bryn for short.

TQW5E6olaa	See I ran into this problem early on...It sucks! So I bought a handful of candybars, chocolates and put them in the freezer. When I see my supply getting low, I buy more. I haven't run out of chocolate since!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	that happenes to me all the time, it might have something to do with the fact that i live 15 miles fromthe nearest grocery store and im too lazy to go lol....i usually have to tough it out,,,or if hubbys home he goes for me. (gotta love him lol)|`|prqrQcd1aa	Oh god, i've been through this so many times... I keep a bag of chocolate chips in my house just for this case...at all times. It's not the same as my favorite, but it helps with the cravings that i'll get for chocolate at times..|`|01vMpHkWaa	i wonder what i will do because i will be home alone also<br>  <br>  hmm....for future reference...*keep chocolate stash in nightstand*|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I had my ex get it for me.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I beg hubby to get it for me!|`|RKTNDLDKaa	You get yourself up, get dressed and go and get it.  <br>  <br>  If you don't get it, you'll be obsessing about it ALL day long.   You will be irritable.   You will be distracted.   You won't be a good mom and you'll feel guilty about it later.  <br>  <br>  You will also feel better if you get in the shower, get clothes on, see some sunshine, go to the store and just browse around for a bit.   <br>  <br>  Go home, eat your chocolate in peace.    Take a nap or lay down when the baby takes a nap.     <br>  <br>  Your feelings are natural.    Don't let them get the best of you.     Keep them under control.      If you don't they will just snowball.|`|AA12145826	That's usually the point where I start researching possible delivery options. Like: <br>  -Can I order a pizza & chocolate cake from Dominoes but ask them not to cook the pizza, which I'll save in the refrigerator for dinner while I a piece of cake now?<br>  -Who keeps telling me to let them know when would be a 'convenient' time to visit? Would they be willing to stop at the store on the way here?<br>  -What time does hubby get off of work today? What time is it? Can I wait?<br>  <br>  If that fails to yield any fruitful answers I'll start raiding every hiding place I can think of.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	I would stay the way you are and just go and get it if you can't find somebody else to do it for you.. If you want it bad enough but if not find something around the house you can substitute it with .. ?!|`|tsRhqi0Daa	its not good for you or your baby to go outs his to little and you just had a baby the air will make your breast hurt; have someone bring it to you.|`|EMKuBql8aa	My wife has me go and get it for her. She will also normally tell me to take the kids while I'm at it, lol.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I send daddy to the store, same as I did when I was pregnant.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Local cab companies will deliver and usually just add on a fee for going to the store.

Thats if the cravings were that bad though, otherwise I would just wait till my husband was on his way home and have him pick it up!! Congrats and good luck!|`|AA10128553	call some one to bring it to you!
EmjEwfQRaa	Oh this is a hard one...lol...I have five kids ages 10, 8, 7, 2, and ten months....I would have to say the most relaxing part of my day is when the oldest three are at school, and my babies are taking a nap. That is also the only time however that I have available to clean the house!!! SOOO I have to relax while I am cleaning..lol...the most chaotic time is between dinner and bedtime, when I have to cook, help with homework, chase babies, get children bathed, clean up etc...I look forward to just collapsing onto the couch after the kids go to sleep.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	I'm a single mom.  Mornings are the worst!  I have to leave home 45 minutes before the kids do, so I try to have them up and ready before I go.  The theory is that they'll be all ready, so they can just watch tv for a little bit before it's time for them to leave as well.  Needless to say, this NEVER happens!  Mornings tend to be a chaotic scramble to make sure that at least the basics (teeth brushed, medicine taken, hair combed) are covered.  I can only hope that after I leave, they manage to eat the good breakfast I've left out and remember to grab their homework on the way out!<br>  <br>  Evenings, after dinner are usually the most relaxed.  We work on homework, talk, play a game or watch a little TV.  7 - 9 p.m. is the best part of the day!|`|X6as2nOAaa	Crazy time would be about 6 or 7 the baby is tired and wants to sleep but I cannot let her sleep because she needs to go to bed soon and the best time would be in the morning when we first get up and right before bed after dinner and she is ready to go to sleep. Im a single mom so we are not waiting for my husband to come home and she is only 6 1/2 months old so she is not too crazy yet.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'd have to say around the time the oldest comes home from school. She comes home around 3:30, usually has homework to do and i've got 2 other small children that always need something, then dinner to get for everyone and it's just usually semi hectic between 3:30 and say about 6:30, just doing everything that needs to be done. <br>  <br>  Easiest time is usually during the morning when we get her up to go to school. The other kids usually sleep in a little bit so i get about 1/2-1 hour to myself after she leaves to wake up and start on chores around the house before the other kids wake up!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Worse time for me is also 3 - 6 because my husband doesn't get home until 6 and I am trying to help my 10 year old with home work while keeping my 2 year old from ripping his paper.  I am also 16 weeks pregnant and trying to cook while having nausea.  It gets pretty ugly.  Mornings are not that great either due to the nausea but that will soon pass....I hope.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	mine sound very similar to yours.  The morning is the best time.  My almost 10 month old is refreshed, has energy, and is in a very chill mood.  He'll hang out, eat some breakfast, doesn't have a tantrum over every little thing.  Then he plays with his toys, maybe watches a baby einstein movie until mommy is fully energized and awake.  <br>  <br>  The most chaotic time is definitely between 5 and 7.  He gets so tired and protests sleep.  Doesn't want to play, doesn't want to be held. Doesn't want his bottle. Doesn't want anything.  He tries to get into things that he can't play with (like a pop can, soap bottles, etc.) and when I take it away he has a fit.  Then when I FINALLy get him calmed down and asleep, my day goes back to being relaxed =)
qitXGd0qaa	Alexander!     William, Christopher and Alexander.     Will, Chris & Alex.    They sound like brothers. Just my opinion she should go with a longer name that can have a short nickname because it seems to fit with William and Christopher.    Other ideas:  Benjamin (Ben)  Lucas (Luke)  Jackson (Jack)    If she's looking for a girls name:    Elizabeth (Elle, Liz, Beth, Libby)  Alexandria (Allie, Lexi)  Kathryn (Kate, Katie)|`|omegLbOAaa	Tommy Merle|`|NrlQsShWaa	Hi, I am Alessandra from South America.

6PhSENcXaa	Went through it with 8 kids, you just do it!  Not bad after the second kid.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Driving is a huge responsibility, and no matter how or where they get the formal instruction, most of it comes down to the parent teaching the child by driving together.  If kids and their parents aren't willing to commit to all the work that goes with it, then maybe they're not ready for the child to be driving.
d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	He is simply showing a learned response. You said the first time it happend she was upset... well she was upset with him so now when she crawls over he thinks she is upset. <br>  <br>  You are right, it has a LOT to do with not being around other kids as much. The more he is around other children the better he will be.
HBgnkltfaa	Lachlann is fabulous, and it goes well with your other boys' names.  While it's a name that would appeal to modern tastes, it doesn't feel trendy.  Just a note on the spelling -- judging from Behind the Name, Lachlan and Lochlann seem to be the two most standard forms.<br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with Lachlann Tatum Greer -- it's a pleasing combo.  However, I think Tatum sounds bad with your boyfriend's surname no matter where in the name it occurs.  Lachlann Tatum Greer Padgham has an annoying sing-songy quality.  Unless you are using Tatum to honor someone, I'd get rid of it and find a different middle.|`|0hxK0khKaa	I love Lachlann, I don't like Tatum or Greer. Tatum sounds like tater tots to me, and Greer sounds like something the lunch lady would put on your tray, and it's lumpy and gray, and nobody knows what it is. Sorry. Maybe Lachlann Callum Bleu?|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I like Lachlann but i agree with most others, the one 'n' looks better.<br>  <br>  I don't like Tatum or Greer and i don't think they flow well with Lachlan at all.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	He's going to get teased a lot. Both first and middle names sound very feminine, as well as the nickname Loki. Boys with feminine names tend to be bullied and insecure. Sorry!|`|ValLVBcYaa	Ohhh, that's rather awesome! <br>  <br>  But why give your kid a name while planning for them to go by something else?<br>  I don't get it.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I LOOOVE Tatum, but for the first name.|`|hR1LlS2Haa	I don't really like it|`|Q6usQV1zaa	OMG! DON'T DO THAT TO YOUR BABY.................................|`|qov5T21Daa	it works and keeps the Scottish heritage within the name. But i personally dont like the nick name Loki. What about calling him Lane for short?<br>  <br>  Lochlainn means "Of the lake" / "from the land of lakes", a reference to Norway which was called Lochlann in Scotland. Thus, it used to refer to a Viking ancestor. As well as referring specifically to Norway, Lochlainn was also the name of a remote place in Irish fairy tales.<br>  <br>  The word Laochail was also used in Gaelic to mean Warlike. In this sense, Lachlan may mean "bellicose" or "belligerent".<br>  <br>  The MacLachlan clan takes its name from Lachlan Mor (Big Lachlan) a chief who lived near Loch Fryne in the 13th century.|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I don't like that combo. Sorry. I don't like that spelling of Lachlann. One 'n' would be better. I like Tatum, but not with Lachlann. They both have similar ending sounds. Greer I though was the last name and lastly, I had a dog named Loki- don't like it for a nickname. I think you should still use Lachlann, just use a better spelling, but the middle names in my opinion could use some adjustments.|`|ZpnSka8Baa	I think it's really cute, though it seems a little trendy.<br>  I'm not one for Loki though, it makes me think of Mickey Rourkes dog.<br>  It's kind of nice when nicknames stem from random affection or peers, rather then being pre-chosen, but whatever works for you.|`|xidMaVCqaa	I actually like the name Asher because it means happy!|`|k8sukeTbaa	Lachlann Greer Tatum would flow better I think.|`|FAGI8owFaa	I like it and its diffrent.good luck|`|AA12221820	ITS PRETTY WEIRD!!!! Y NOT SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS?|`|VHHis05Naa	I wouldn't use Tatum at all since it's so close to your SO's surname.  I'd strike that one.  Lachlann is a great name.|`|RjpGomsyaa	Sorry but that is grim I think he would have the micky taken out of him|`|miFe45quaa	I love Lachlan (spelled with one N).<br>  I don't care for Tatum, reminds me of the word "tantrum". <br>  Greer is nice. <br>  <br>  Lachlan Greer =)<br>  <br>  I prefer the nickname Lach (lock).|`|fboC1N7gaa	It;s pretty awesome.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Not a fan. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Edit-Wow I gave my opinion and I got a lot of thumbs down. Sorry.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I hate it. My friends dog's name is Loki
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I think you have reason to be hesitant. Trust your instincts and don't leave the baby in his care. This is something that you need to talk to him about if at all possible.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Since he has been known to hit your dog...an innocent animal that can't voice their opinions or tell you what is wrong...  Who's to say that he won't hit your baby...who is also innocent and can't voice their opinions or tell you what is wrong.        Honestly, I think your husband needs to take an anger management class.  Have you talked to him about this at all?  I would be very worried if I was in your shoes, and I wouldn't leave them alone either.  Definitely talk to your husband...suggest anger management or counseling.|`|4VFEkqJiaa	Animal cruelty is not acceptable behaviour.  I too would be concerned that he may hurt the baby.    Instead of looking out for bad behaviour around the baby you can encourage him when he is being kind to her.    I would also think about parenting classes that you both go to.     No man is worth the risk of your baby being harmed in any way.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i would definitely have a talk with your husband and ask if he has any resentment towards you or the baby. that some of the stuff he does makes you worry that he doesn't love the baby as much as he should be.|`|MoLQsZeXaa	what nasty piece of work.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	That is a bad sign. I am sorry but if I was you I would never leave him alone with your child.  If he is capable of hitting an innocent dog, he is capable of anything.  If you are tired and need a break, leave your baby with a trusted family member or a good friend that you can trust. We all need breaks.  Not everyone is cut out to be a parent and not everyone wants to be one.  Seems that your husband may have fallen in either category, so it is up to you to keep your child safe from danger.|`|HZbSbZIraa	this is a red flag especially since he has a past of hitting your dog. However, having a child is very stressful and men do not get the same motherly instincts we get so naturally. Some men just pick up naturally on being a dad and others can struggle with it. Was this a planned pregnancy? If it was unplanned maybe he is just really not ready to deal with all that comes with such a precious and mysterious gift. I think what you need to do is one night when the baby is asleep sit down together and in a non  aggressive manner talk about how you are feeling. Tell your concerns and that you what to work on it with him. If you single him out and come at him in an "attack" mode he is not going to take it well and not going to listen he will feel that your accusing him of being a bad parent so in a very calm setting and a calm voice just tell him exactly how you feel. He will hopefully warm up eventually. Maybe even teach him some of your motherly tricks that help her when shes fussy and what not. I know how hard it is to not get upset or frustrated in the moment but just try !!! :) Good luck !!
Ela3o96Raa	In my life with my husband, my MIL has done everything in her power to make our lives awful. I cant explain the things my MIL has done to us over the years and I cant explain your situation either. But, I will tell you this - mother-in-laws are INSANE. Some are nice, normal people who will explain why they do certain things. But some are not. If your MIL cant even explain to you why she doesnt want grandchildren then its not even worth listening to. Now, you might have a problem if your DH wants to abide by your MIL's wishes and not have any children. But if he wants a child and so you do then GO FOR IT! Dont let ANYONE make plans of that importance in your life - no matter who they are. If a child is what will make you both happy and complete your "vision" of a perfect life with your hubby - then by all means do it. Babies are something to be celebrated and your MIL needs to understand that and accept the fact that you and her son want children. If she cant grasp reality, then screw her!|`|G7uEd6JRaa	Without knowing more about her, it sounds like she is pretty controlling. She might not like the thought of her sons having sex (I can't imagine any mom really does) but that doesn't really explain her asking you to not have children.    Some MILs don't stop mothering even after their sons grow up and get married. I have a good MIL but she can be overbearing and coddling to my husband (which is pretty gross to me) even after 2 years of marriage.     How does your boyfriend feel about it? Is he compelled to not have kids as a result or are you two on the same page?    You can deal with it one of two ways......ignore her and move forward with your own plans for family and baby (this is probably best as the second option might not elicit a favorable response) or sit down with her and speak frankly about letting you two make your own decisions without additional input.     Even though it was a short post, the other poster who said MILs are crazy was pretty much right. Even the good ones are usually a little crazy. Best to ignore them when you can.     Good luck!|`|NI8D46J0aa	That does seem pretty strange, I have never heard anyone say that to their kids before. I am on my 5th, and my parents are just like, "another one?" But it's really none of their business. This will be their 7th grandchild. My SIL is due 2 days after me, and those 2 babies will be my MIL's 17th and 18th grandchildren.     So, I really hope you are going to have as many kids as you want. Does your fiance want kids? or his other siblings?|`|7bfKnKJRaa	Yes, it does seem odd. It probably does have something to do with the sex phobia or maybe shes has some sort of control issues, I guess it could be anything but I'm not a shrink...Either way just make sure you live your life the way you want to and don't worry what anyone else thinks. Have you ever asked her straight out what it is about grandchildren she doesn't find appealing?|`|iAuvoQeHaa	Probably doesn't like the idea of being a grandmother (getting more mature) and also doesn't like the idea of her sons growing up. I think you'll find that she'll change about it when the grandkids do come and will fall in love with them. I mean how'd she have her own kids? It wasn't the stork!|`|wusrt4q2aa	Mothers in law aren't inexplicably crazy. They have absolute reason to their upsets.    Your mother in law is upset because grandchildren mean that everything she's put into creating a family will be complete. She is used to her son being a part of HER life. She was married, she had children, she raised children, and she's probably afraid that if her sons have grandchildren, it will be the end of her family life as she knows it.    You need to convince her that her son will stay around, even when you do have children, and that grandchildren WON'T be the end of her immediate family.     Visit often, and believe that she loves her kids as much as you will love yours.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I think it is very strange that she would come out and say it.   Next time she does, ask her why- maybe she found mothering a bad experience?  I wonder how she will react to her grandchild when one is born.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	that is very strange that she would ever consider saying that to her daughter in laws. i know i didnt have children to please my mil. unless she is trying to use reverse psychology but it doesnt seem like it. weird that she would think she even has a say in it.|`|AA10628838	Maybe she is afraid she will not bond with a grandchild and cannot be a loving grandparent.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	That's is odd  My husband and I were married for ten years before our child were born  Both family were always asking when    At least you do not get that from one    IF you want children, go for it  She can choice not to be a grandma  Yes, it's odd    I have met people who never wanted children  Asking your children not to have children is odd|`|cj7sSPZEaa	That is a little strange.  If you want a baby, have one.  Don't let her stop you.  She will most likely change her mind once a grandchild arrives.  You watch.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, unless you agree with her, I'd say you're going to have to tell her to get over herself and realize it's not her decision. How selfish. Perhaps she's afraid of being labeled a 'grandma' because in her mind, grandmas are old and frail and dowdy. Whatever. If my MIL told me that, I'd just look at her and laugh and ask when I can make an appointment for her with a psychiatrist! I'd say your MIL needs one!    What does your boyfriend say? Or her other children? Please tell me they're not going along with her demented plan just to please her. She sounds like she needs serious help.|`|s6qgkfLxaa	It sounds a little strange but she sounds like she is either..  1. Afraid of getting old and having to be "grandma"  2. Doesn't want to think about her sons having sex.    I'd just ignore it. Have sex and make lots of babies. My grandmother used to tell me the same thing, but she loves her grandbabies now. :)|`|uW4npxzFaa	Weird, but also completely none of her business! Tough for her, if you both want kids, that is your decision. Maybe she feels that this world is too horrible to bring children into it, but still, have some faith in you and her son.|`|6zVISNTZaa	Perhaps its because she doesn't like the thought of her "little boys" having grown up and having sex, as you say she pretends not to be aware of sex. And her grandchildren would be living proof that her sons have had intercourse. I think she has a few issues, but she can't stop you if it's what you want and she's being a little hypocritical herself.|`|nrQijvMuaa	Just like you said she loves kids and works with them and her own kids were planned but what if she hates the Idea of getting Older and the kids having to call her Granny? It's going to make her feel old. Don't you think? Many times people refuse to accept the fact that there aging and like the fact that if they have no grandchildren there still young in there point of view.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	hahaha... I'm sorry, but what a silly woman!!!  Please please please tell me you will utterly disregard her comments.  How dare someone try to control her grown son and his future wife!  If she wants to be like that, just let her stay the heck away from your happy home!|`|7bTOY5vHaa	That is strange. I wouldn't let her opinions or her beliefs effect your life, if you want children then have them. Have as many as you want, and if if she doesn't want anything to do with them than its her lose. Have you asked her why? And maybe you should tell her its your life your body and if having a child is important to you than you are going to do it.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i would tell her to get over it.  sex is to reproduce - and fun! lol    this is a strange request from a MIL though    have children if you want. dont let her stop you|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	My mother-in-law had no interest in grandchildren and made this clear to us. However she never tried to tell us not to have any. She is very much a recluse and was in her mid sixties when we had our first.    She had 5 kids spaced far apart (last one born when she was 38). She felt she was done with kids, babysitting, trying to deal with the mess and emotional stress. She had no desire to do any of those things with grandchildren and would have been perfectly happy if we never had any.    With that said, she does love her grandchildren (2 from her daughter, 2 from her son - my hubby) and sends them gifts and wishes on occasions. However, if we lived close, forget babysitting or the kind of grandma who takes the child out to spoil it. We lived with her for a while just after our second was born. She held him maybe 4 times - all at my request when I needed an extra hand quickly.    Now that I'm pregnant with the 3rd and have been joking about a 4th she commented that we need to stop having babies (we now live far away in a different State). Her reasons... they're too expensive to raise and she feels the end times are coming and there will be extreme hardship for us.    Sigh, what can you do. She won't effect any of our decisions anyway and heck, she's more of a grandmother to my kids than my own parents are, so we have no complaints.     If you have very caring parents who adore your children and take joy in loving and spoiling them, you are blessed indeed (speaking to all moms out there). Whether they try to interfere or not, your kids have that extra portion of love piled on them. There is something very special about someone else loving your kids almost as much as you do. Enjoy it!|`|79eRDIbXaa	That is strange - maybe she doesnt want to feel old!|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	I'm not sure if anyone told you, but MIL's are all different and absolutely PSYCHO!!!  There is NO justified explanation for the things they say and do, it's just the way it is.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	It's not up to her whether you and your future husband have children. If you want a baby, go for it. She had kids, and I'm sure you should be "allowed" to as well.    Maybe she connects grandchildren with old grandparents, and doesn't want to feel old herself?|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Yes, very|`|ocwIcfzPaa	Don't let her stop you. She sounds a little odd and controlling.     It's your life - she's had hers!|`|VnRECJJxaa	that is very weird, my MIL is always asking when we're having one, good thing its not her decision...maybe it is the sex thing, maybe she likes to pretend her kids dont do it|`|4DoXomHZaa	What is strange is that this woman would feel entitled to open her mouth and spout off about something to her adult children that is NONE of her business.    Ignore her. It's between you and hubby.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	A friend of mine had a MIL like that.  She was in denial about becoming a "Grandmother".  She said she was disappointed when they got pregnant, but after the baby was born she totally accepted it and my friend now has the most spoiled child!    But honestly, it's really none of her business.  Nor does she even have the right to say anything like that to persuade you.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Screw her.  She has no say over your reproduction.  And her aversion to grandchildren does seem odd.  It also seems odd to tell the daughter in laws not to have kids.  Who is she to dictate?|`|SGeo7cqYaa	Wow... that is really weird. Well, I don't know what else to tell you besides the fact that you're grown, so screw what she thinks. Good luck! Wish me the same, I'm on baby number 2 due in October (probably September!!!!)|`|OT6vCUU1aa	Sounds absolutely selfish and I would take her feelings into consideration but not base me decision on them. She's kind of rude for even suggesting that. Once you got pregnant and had your baby Im sure she would be the grandma inside her lol spoiling and all. Good luck and dont let it deter or upset you|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    well i 'm not too sure but i think there is some big reason behind this...as not having any grand-children is something which nobody will want...i think there is some medical reason for sure or something else which you all are not knowing...i think you should ask her out by making her trust you completely as this can a big question..    hope she tells you the truth..!    hope i have helped..!!|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	So weird.  Usually, as mentioned, it is the opposite, that parents want their kids to have babies.    I say her kids should have babies if they want, it would be unfair to miss out on being a parent (if that's what someone wants) because their parent doesn't wanna be a grandparent.
ddP3klT3aa	That happened to me. Even after I had the baby it lasted for a short period. My mom was in the room at the hospital when I was sleeping and she said she heard me quit breathing a few times. Try elevating your head. I don't think there is much you can do. The doctor might recommend Benadryl, but don't take it until you talk to your doctor. You might have to try to sleep on your back with your head elevated because that will open the airway. Maybe get a humidifier in the room?|`|627pWyVkaa	they recommend sleeping on your left side during pregnancy, maybe try that see if it isnt as bad on your left. and just try to prop pillows around you! and youll find youll have a stuffy nose (its a symptom) of pregnancy! Thats probably why you are not feeling any relief.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	Try one of those pregnancy pillows they have them at babys r us and sometimes at target. I had one and I think that is the only thing that got me through my last month.|`|0aVHTRAEaa	Ok, I dont know what to tell  you about the breathing problems, but as far as the other things.  Since you are already having problems sleeping can you sleep in another room and leave your husband and cat int he same room?  My last 4 weeks of pregnancy were sleep-deprived as well....I would wake up in the middle of the night almost in a panic, for some reason and plus I had the sciatica too.  Talk to your doctor and maybe they will be able to suggest something for the breathing and maybe induce labor for you.  I feel for you, its sounds like you are miserable.|`|e90a8e2ee095e648a3f92f15f7959eb6aa	First, don't sleep on your back. That's not good for you or the baby.    I've been having problems like this too.  I think mine's a combo of pregnancy and the weather.  Try the saline nose spray and Breathe Right Strips at night.  Those help open your nose up without medicine.      Good luck!  And yes, it's sucks.  I sleep with a body pillow for my hip pain, but then I get extra hot and rolling over is even more of a pain (and even with the pillow I still have to roll over every hour because my hips still hurt, not to mention peeing every two hours and then trying to find kleenex under my pillow because I always have to blow my nose...ok, here ends my rant...haha.).
130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	There is no way I'd let a 4 week old cry it out. Babies at that age aren't crying to be difficult, they're crying because they need something. I have a 7 week old, so I know it can be frustrating when you can't figure out what your baby wants- but, it's probably just as frustrating for them! So, I think you're right about not wanting to let her cry it out.     Tell your husband that babies don't know that mommy and daddy have things they need to get done, they just know that they like being cuddled and loved. She could be crying because her tummy hurts, she's scared, bored, cold, hot, whatever.     My pediatrician told me to not let my baby cry for more than 15 minutes before picking her up and trying to comfort her. But 15 minutes seems like an eternity when she sounds so pitiful, so I usually don't make it past 5 minutes. I have seen her fuss herself to sleep, so I do give her a few minutes to see if she's just crying while falling asleep.     You're right- she is a little thing, so she needs lots of love. I try to remind myself when I have a frustating day with my children that they are growing up extremely fast. When they're teenagers and I'm the biggest idiot that ever lived, I'll be wishing they were still needing me to do everything for them.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's too young!  I think that some forms of cry it out are effective but you need to wait for a few more months at the minimum.    It will not work at this age, and it will be very traumatic for you.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	She is WAY too young to be doing this. Go and hold her and ignore your husband - she is a newborn and obviously needs and wants affection and touch.     If you're going to attempt CIO, I wouldn't bother for at least six months if not more, depending on the child. At around 5 months my son "knew" how to get our attention by crying and then, when we'd pick him up at night, he wanted to play. But at 4 weeks old, this is not the case and your baby's basic human needs should be meant, which include the obvious (diapers, feeding) and human touch. They thrive on that - give it to them.     It doesn't mean you have to run to them every time they make a peep, but when it's obvious that they need something. You will re-learn how to distinguish these noises and cries just as you did with your older kids.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  your husband is wrong.  You can't spoil an infant.  They need to be held and feel secure.  When she is older - like 12 months - she will be secure and will be able to calm herself.  For now, hold her.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	A 4 weeks old baby is too young to let her cry it out. She should be attended to and held if crying because she needs comfort. It is an important part of her bonding and security needs.     A 6 month old can be left to cry it ouf for a little awhile, but not a newborn.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	DO NOT let a 4 week old CIO     crying releases cortisol on the brain and too much cortisol can eeffect brain growth and development . your husband has no maternal instict but he should at least have some paternal ones- don't listen to him. you can't harm your baby holding them too much but you can by not holding them enough|`|nAOlBmzDaa	I'm sorry but a 4week old does not cry because she wants to be held - they're too little to be spoiled. She's in pain. Have you considered that she may be colic? i would consult your doc on this tho. she's in pain, NOT spoiled!|`|aSjdL4heaa	She is MUCH too young to let cry out.  You can not spoil a child at this age.      When she wants attention, pick her up.  It doesn't stop your life to hold a baby.  This is an important time for bonding and mental and emotional development.  They discovered that the children in the Romanian orphanages that were left to 'cry out'  had developmental and emotional problems.|`|f27ac1251735cd69b33683d739d56466aa	If the baby is crying you try to feed her or check her diaper.  If she has been fed, burped and is clean, let her cry.  Not to say that you will never pick your baby up and hold her but you need to let her cry also otherwise you will find yourself training a control freak and once they get older and they see t hat they can cry to get their way, oh, boy you will be in for a fight.|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	I agree with everyone else on here. It's way too young and your husband's thinking sounds kind of selfish. "You can't stop your life for long periods of time to hold a crying baby." When you have a child, this is what you sign up for. It's time for him to put his own needs on hold in order to meet the needs of your baby. Good luck to you!|`|TajdONO7aa	no! your going to totally jack up your bond with that baby. trust me, this was my train of thought with our 3rd.and now i really dont have the bond that i should with her. please respond to your baby when she cries!!!! i have a 4th now and let me tell you, i never let him just sit and cry- and he's a much more content baby for it.|`|GmTMVmASaa	i honestly don't think you can spoil a baby at that age, so what if she wants to be held. she is new to this world, and it's a big world in comparison to where she was for 9 months,and holding gives her comfort. but no she can't hurt herself by crying, she could get gas though and that can be painful for a tiny baby. by the way,don't you think she's too young to be learning life lessons right now? such as, you can't be there every second. because if you aren't actually busy, then why not hold her and let her know you love her?|`|RqcLxDesaa	It's about this age that babies do the "colic" thing. Their little insides are still learning how to digest food and they're uncomfortable. Best thing is to walk them around. I think the movement soothes and distracts them. It lasted about 2 weeks and then it was over. Letting them "cry it out" comes later when it's a separation issue.|`|hieQHR0daa	For nine months this baby was inside you, listening to your breathing and your heartbeat. She has only had a mere 4 weeks in the world and has not yet learned that if she cries for you you will come. When you put a baby down as far as that baby is concerned you have gone, vanished and are never coming back. Baby has to learn that it is ok to be alone and that you will return. It takes about 3-4 months for baby to learn this.  You should not use controlled crying to settle your child if they are less than 18 months to 2 years old. To do so makes for a very insecure child.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	In my opinion, 4 weeks old are very young. They need to be held & loved. If she cries, she cries for a reason. My baby used to nap so little up until 6 month old. When she wakes up, she needed to be held & burped due to her spit up many time. People say let her cry but it didn't work. I knew that she wasn't comfortable. Now she naps so well because she does not spit up so much like before.     Go with your instinct. She's your baby & you'll sense it when you are spoiling her. Of course you can try different things but don't just do it because people are telling you to. Babies are all different.|`|DVqZ8oHjaa	my son is 6 weeks and he crys when he wants held...he also cries for bottles and diapers but yeah....We hold him, but sometimes you always can't so just let em cry...he/she wont hurt themselves I often though Oh god hes gonna scream himself dry but i never happens..but we always hold him and he only crys no longer then 2-4 minutes without one of us there to grab him|`|h85kkDsbaa	i wouldn't let her cry for longer than a few seconds shes way to young, she may just want to be held but that's what young babies want and if you leave her to cry she will learn not to trust you. My son was exactly the same i held him pretty much all day when he was tiny and as he got older he just learnt to spend time on his own and now at 6 months he even goes to sleep my himself. Good luck X|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	You can't spoil a baby. Having a baby means that you will need to spend a lot of time holding and comforting them. the reason why her cries bother you are because they are SUPPOSED TO! You are biologically wired to want to take care of your baby when she cries. You need to listen to mother nature and hold her. I found that a sling was really helpful for the first few months. The more you hold her, the mroe she will feel connected and secure with you.|`|yMOGeKZfaa	Pick the baby up when she is quiet and happy and give her lots of attention, she learns that if she is quiet she will get attention.  if you pick her up when she cries she learns that if she cries shes gonna be picked up, making her cry more!  If she is fed, changed and winded, she should be content.|`|stUzx5VVaa	Babies that age do not have object permanence, meaning when they can't see something, they think it doesn't exist anymore.      Can you imagine how scary that is for a baby, being all alone, totally dependent, and thinking that no one is ever going to come for them.      Babies are dependent.  They'll gain independence when they're older, but at this age, they're not independent and it's not going to work to make them so.  They might stop crying, but that's out of desperation, not independence.|`|6hA0O06xaa	She is too young to be spoiled by being held all the time.  That is why they make slings and front carriers...so the baby can feel the closeness/security of being held but you can still have your hands free to get stuff done.  I think babies aren't smart enough to learn anything from crying it out until more like 6 months.  And even then, they still need to be held sometimes to let them know you love them.      Remember, human babies are essentially born 3 months before their nervous system is ready to deal with the outside world...just so their huge heads can fit out the birth canal.  So for the first three months, babies need/want to feel like they are still inside the womb by being held, rocked, swaddled, and shhhhed.
0nb1rQhnaa	If you have an episiotomy you will not be healed 6 weeks later. I didn't even want to try then. I think we tried at 8 weeks and it still hurt. I can't even remember when we tried again now, it doesn't matter at this point anyway when we tried. He can wait.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my poor hubby iisnt allowed near me for months!!!  all normal vaginal births but after i am sore tired breast feeding and just not in the mood!!  hes fine im sure ur partner will be ok you do it when u feel ready and not a second sooner   you may even find its HIM thats to tired or scared of hurting u x x|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my fiance wanted to have sex but had not problem waiting- i waited 5 weeks- it hurt because i ahd stitched and i was dry- once i started using alube it was much better|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	For me it was uncomfortable plus very dry because of hormones related to breastfeeding.  My husband was totally ok with waiting as long as I wanted to.  We tried a few months pp and it was still uncomfortable for me.  Just recently at 10 months past has it started to feel good again.  I tore quite bad and I don't know if it was mostly psychological but I was really afraid to have sex!    Also, when baby gets here your boyfriend will way too busy with you and the baby to be thinking much about sex...|`|AA11226842	Frankly I couldn't wait. I was healed and more than ready a few weeks after. If you aren't ready for vaginal sex try other things. It might be fun trying something different.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I think its all about how you feel. I had a pretty easy birth and only had 2 stitches and had sex about 4 weeks after. But, its all about how YOU feel. if you aren't up to it, he will have to wait. He isn't the one who went through the labor and is up every 2 hours breastfeeding. Everyone heals at a different rate and you might be surprised that you are ready after a few weeks or not be in the mood at all for 2-3 months! Keep the lines of communication open with him and good luck|`|YfTk9f56aa	Medical recommendations are to wait 6 weeks to prevent the risk of infection and in case you have any scars/stitches toheal etc?    Personally I did it at 8 days and I had a section.     It's all about how you feel.  You may not want it ever again but you may miss the emotional and physical contact with your partner.    I had a quite emotional and eventful birth as a result of complications and I felt that the physical intimacy was something that I personally needed as it made me feel protected by my partner at a time I needed it.    It certainly depends on how you feel, not about your partner and you have to remember that it is not just about sex, it is an intimacy between the two of you.|`|YENiEvoJaa	I actually had the best case scenario, no tearing, no episiotomy. Or so I thought! I had uterine pains/cramps worse than labour for two weeks after i had my baby, then i thought well okay let's try to have sex, oh my it was horrible. just very painful on the inside. so i thought well i'm not healed. tried at six weeks, same thing. tried at eight weeks, tried at four months, still very painful. My skin on the inside there is just very very thin still and obviously sensitive because of the hormone levels in a postpartum woman. If you plan on breastfeeding you may be in for a surprise. sex can be painful for the whole first year. Now  some people don't have this problem, but many do. good luck. honestly your husband is going to have  to put his ridiculous needs on the backburner and HELP you.|`|EYSl68csaa	I know with my first I was probably healed but I was very scared how the heck everything could go back to normal after that so I waited the 6 weeks and it was fine just scary waiting for it to be painful, with the second one it was 4 weeks the third I think we barely made it 2 weeks and with this last one 1/29/09 I came home from the hospital wanting to jump my husband (I blame hormones) but I'm behaving and gonna try to wait at least 2 weeks, it's all really what you feel up to, if your still sore then don't do it if you feel good let it go from there and always start slow, as for hubby waiting he helped put you into the position of no sex for awhile tell him to go take care of his problem himself, works for me! (I will admit mainly when I am being a B though:)|`|NC1yS0H5aa	we did wait probably a little less than 6 weeks. it was uncomfortable even though i didi not get any stitches i did have some labial tears. the main reason it hurt was probably dryness which was often a problem while i was breastfeeding due to different hormones being produced than normal. the first few times there was the added discomfort of the whole area being a bit more sensitive as a lot of things get pulled and stretched during the birth. you will know what is right for you only after your birth and you have assessed your damage or non damage if you are lucky. not to mention emotional state caring for a newborn.|`|wTeJulT5aa	well, maybe you should get him to watch the birth.  Maybe that will keep him away for a while.      There's no reason to worry about this issue right now.  You're not even half way through your pregnancy yet.  Just relax and enjoy your pregnancy.    I felt fine after a week, but I didn't tear at all or have an episiotomy.  but, of course I was still bleeding, so I didn't sleep with my hubby until after that was done.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, it's not up to him.    Six weeks is the recommended time to wait. Most women are still bleeding up until this point and having sex then can introduce infections because your cervix isn't yet closed.    We waited the six weeks and even then took it slow. It was a bit uncomfortable but not painful. Maybe this was because I had a C-section, I don't know, but I still dilated before I had to get one. It was also a bit dryer and sometimes is even now(our son will be 10 months old tomorrow).    Give yourself the time to heal. Your partner can wait and there are always other things you can do aside from actual sex. Oral and manual are other options, if you're into those, as long as nothing is being inserted into you.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My husband certainly wanted to have sex soon after I gave birth.  But because he's an adult, who understands that I was healing, he was patient and did not press me until I decided I was ready.    I had a c-section and although it healed well, it is extremely uncomfortable when it feels like the stitches are "pulling".
hIzQyflqaa	i am the same, im 28 and measuring 24, they did not offer me a scan but i think i will be demanding one (cant get thru to MW though!) they measure you at every appointment to check the growth, this is normal!<br>  <br>  Just back from hospital and everything is ok, she is breech tho! hope your scan went well!
hA8XL17Uaa	Im exactly the same with thinking i need to buy stuff as i go alone if i want to be able to offord everytihng i feel i need or want.<br>  No its not to early to get the moses basket if you want it! What you do need to think about is space for storing stuff where you are at the moment and having extra things to move when you do! The cot and pushchair i would leave in the store untill i need them that way they are not getting in your way but say if you move into your new place and want to get everything set up and ready then get them a little earlier than planned! <br>  <br>  Its all about you hun and at the end of the day what you think is best!!<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  x|`|h85kkDsbaa	I had to buy everything as i went along, i think i got my buggy/pram at about 15 weeks so its never to early hun. Go for it and buy your little girl everything shes needs.<br>  <br>  Congrats X|`|5ZvALiclaa	to be honest, if you are tight financially don't bother with a moses basket. they get used for maybe 2-3 months and then they are too big for it so its a waste of money. (sounds like the money could be better spent on more useful things) Put the cot in your room or get a travel cot instead of the basket and that way you have something portable you can use for sleeping anywhere until she is 2-3 years old. Maybe your aunt can put in for that or another item like a electric swing, carrier, change table or car seat? Its not too early to buy anything as the longer you spread it out the easier the costs become. I had nearly everything big i needed for all my babies by this stage. I had my pram at home but just left it in the box until bubs was born and keep all your receipts!!!!<br>  I used to buy 1 bottle of baby wash or a pack of nappies or wipes each week when i did my shopping and as i saw things on special and that way it spread out the costs. <br>  <br>  If money is tight then try asking on freecycle for baby items(freecycle.org) its an organisation that people give away their unwanted items rather than dump them. There are always tons of baby items for free! Also, look on ebay and at garage sales. Its amazing what some people will sell perfectly good stuff for just to get rid of it. I've seen $150 brand new baby bjorn carriers sell for $20 at a garage sale as well as highchairs and cots.<br>  Plus you can buy bulk lots of clothes from ebay for as little as $20 or less for a huge bag full of stuff that is hardly used! I bought a huge bag of newborn boy stuff for $13.50 and it had about 40 items in it and all but a couple of things were like new! you can't even buy 1 outfit at a store for that! <br>  <br>  Anyway, its never too early to be organised. Have fun buying all the stuff for your lil girl and don't forget to treat yourself too!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|JDw1RDcaaa	i only brought my moses basket and cot in the last few weeks and i am now 38 weeks and as for your pram i would go and get it before your bump is to big because you will not know how it feels if you can only just reach the handles but it is bad look if you keep it in your own house so mine is at my mums and ive only get my car seat at home. I would get your cot at home at about 30-35 weeks so you can still help put it up.<br>  <br>  Me and my boyfriend have had to buy things as we go along cuz we only earn a little more than that but we have a house to keep as well and we can't get the grant because you have to be on job seekers allowance or income support. It's hard unless you have family to help with buying things<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|KqloS80maa	i have no clue what a pram is , but yes its never to early to prepare shoot i was buyin stuff b4 i found out the gender.......the more u get now the better here im 34 weeks and im freakin cause i have no crib barely got the stroller no binkies nothing so were rushin around|`|ZHkhNY0Saa	i would only buy basics and save the rest of the money until your little girl comes  most people buy everything then dont use it <br>  i would get while your pregnant...<br>  moses basket/cot <br>  pram<br>  car seat <br>  bottles and steriliser<br>  changing mat/table <br>  bouncy chair thing!<br>  about two weeks worth of clothes <br>  <br>  i wouldnt buy any more until after the baby is born <br>  obviously formula and nappies too but they are small things<br>  wait till closer to the end of the pregnancy and the drs can guess the babies weight which is usually correct so then buy clothes when you find out this according to the weight they say i would buy also...<br>  baby monitor if you would like one <br>  <br>  until you see how quickly the baby develops i wouldnt buy any more after a week at home which is advised you can take the baby girl shopping for new clothes etc you will be happy for the trip most new moms love this time also take your parents if possible they will buy stuff too they cant help themselves!
AA10491203	take off the diaper.<br>  give a drink of juice or water.<br>  watch child.<br>  when child starts to pee, pick up and put on potty quickly.<br>  <br>  you can do this in the bathroom. play in there until she starts to pee (you will figure out how long it takes the juice to 'run through'' her).<br>  now that you know how long it takes you can put her on the potty (so long) after giving juice.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I thought that was old for potty training.  I started getting my little guy used to it at 17 months he isn't even 22 months yet and only pees his pants when we are out in town and at night.  I just throw him on the toilet after juice and read to him till he goes.  Then he would just start pointing to the bathroom and grunting till we took him after the first month.|`|P8VoBR0saa	my daughter was around that age and a friend of mine told me to put her on the toilet and get a cup of warm water and run it over her belly into the toilet and it'll force her to pee so she feels what it's like to pee in the toilet instead of a diaper and after about a week of that she was potty trained completely, night and all|`|fzog1gdVaa	A friend of mine who is a pediatrician, said too many parents push early potty training, but children are not going to potty train until they are ready, which is generally around the age of 3. My daughter did potty train earlier though, but she wanted to....because "mommy was wearing big girl underwear" and the fact that she was more advanced for her age might have a little to do with it. My sons were a little more stubborn. So all in all, if she isn't ready I wouldn't be pushing the issue right now, especially since she is not even 3 yet.
764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	According to the definition of and context used for the word, yes I own my underage children. I say that because my children are mine. They don't belong to my mother. They don't belong to the state. They don't belong to the government. I didn't pay for them and I don't possess them but they came from me therefore, they are a product of me. I am responsible for what they do and what they don't do. I make the decisions regarding them and enforce whatever rules I have relating to them. That gives me ownership. If I had a pet, I would have the same rights and I would be considered its owner. It doesn't change the definition just because I'm talking about a person rather than a pet.|`|KHZLPldraa	Uhm no.|`|14JQ11AUaa	They do not OWN them, they are not a piece of property....crazy how you worded that! You make it seem like under age children are like family cars.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	No one owns any one.  that is just silly.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Of course not.  Children have rights, including material support, emotional support, safety and security, and respect for them as persons deserving the same dignity and consideration as adults.  Ownership of humans went out with slavery.     But of course children do not have the same experience, judgment, and mental capability as adults, and it is sometimes necessary for parents to make decisions for them.  That is the right of the parent.  That's even true for teens, but parents should give teens the chance to make their own decisions as far as they can responsibly do so.|`|yOLeRiTZaa	.        ~_~.    OWN? not by any means, but Yes, you are responsible for them of course. Not just morally but legally. Just as you would care for property, you do with children yet more so. Fascinating question by the way.    The only time anyone owns our children is when we don't "own up" to them. That's when they will become property or wards of the state.    The military can own it's soldiers too, from what I understand, but yeah,, they'ree not under age.     That's all I got!    Have a Great Day!!!    _______________________ ~_~.      .|`|mggll8dRaa	I have 'Secured Loans' on them, but that really doesn't help....!!|`|LPCfOtiKaa	No, parents don't own their under-aged children. But they are responsible for them and can and should have some control of what they do and what they're involved in.  BraxOwl,  if it's common sence why did you have to research it?|`|Hzf3QK9faa	No. They're on loan from God. :) Have a great day.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I don't think anyone OWNS anybody. That's ridiculous!|`|UGY3i7BWaa	Yes and if you dont shut up IMMA SLAP YO ***.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	No, they do not OWN them.  It is illegal to own a person.    They do, however, have complete responsibility and control over them, much to most teenager's chagrin.|`|Lor20kXcaa	Of course not.   All humans deserve a basic amount of respect and individuality, and the ability to express themselves.     Until they are of age however, the parents are responsible for their children's actions, to a certain degree.|`|P4LBygv2aa	own is a strong word but its a good one , parents "own " the kids until they are 18 , they own the damages the kids cause, the trouble they get into etc.  by law if a child 17 or under  does something wrong its the parents who get sued and or even thrown in jail (underage parties when they are away) so they  own the mistakes, own the responsibilities, guess they should own the children.  like I said strong word but very close.|`|ACCIArkDaa	Children are not objects like property.  People OWN property.  Parents didn't pay for them but pay others for SERVICES in bringing them in this world.  Therefore, parents don't OWN their children but they are RESPONSIBLE for their welfare.|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	yes, you pay the bills, food, and everything else, they ought to respect your values and rules.|`|6253169b02f2076d996076889f0591d0aa	That's the impression that I got of most Americans. You believe you OWE your children. But you don't. And this whole "I have the complete control over them" **** sounds like you are rather talking about the army than about a family.|`|77WkLOwPaa	As long as they have the deed they do. XD|`|cAtWxJG1aa	no.  a parent is more like a trustee, not an "owner" but having all the decision-making ability until the child comes of age.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Well that's what my dad always told me, lol, but I know what he means is he is responsible for me and he has complete control over me until I'm an adult.    I don't own my kids, but I do have complete control over their lives and final say in all things until they are 18 years old.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Own, no. Have the right to control until they are of age, absolutely.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Interesting but no, I dont feel I OWN my son. Not in the slightest. But I am 100% responsible for him. So I have to protect him, I have to make decision for him, I have to because if something happens to him, Im responsible.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Why of course we own them. Otherwise we would be arrested for assault(spanking)
deIzFnV8aa	Yeah, we have a very similar problem. I think it is totally up to you if you want one godparent or just two.  I don't think the church has any actual policy on it, so it is totally a matter of how you feel. It is true everyone gives us weird looks when we say we aren't planning to have a godfather, but I think it is silly to pick someone I don't know well or a cousin I haven't seen in 10 years.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	in my country godfather is an important person in childs' live and should be picked carefully|`|mfpix8xkaa	Its not compulsory, your brother alone will be fine.|`|nQkH90n6aa	I've got three. I think it depends on the sex of the baby. Since you have a girl, I would think 2 godmothers and 1 godfather, for a boy however it would be 2 men and 1 woman. You can always ask your priest if you're unsure, I just know what my mother told me.    I don't know what I would have done without my godparents, I think it's wonderful you're searching for the best people for your daughter. Bbest of luck with the christening!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think it depends on what religion you are getting her baptized in. In the Catholic Church you only "need" one godparent, but that person must be a practicing Catholic.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Godparents are supposed to play an important role in the religious upbringing of the child.  However things happen, lets face it even babies that start out with two loving parents, and two godparents are not guaranteed to have them forever.  Things happen, people change, divorce, and even die.    Godparents don't have to be related to you though, they can be close friends, or even just someone that you look up to spiritually.  Or you can just have one godparent.    The best thing to do is discuss your feelings with your priest/pastor/minister and let them help you.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	None of that is "necessary". It's more of a religious ritual than anything.|`|fL6jNee5aa	My godfather doesn't live in the same country as me, let alone the same continent, my godmother lives in the same city, so the location isnt really that big of a deal.  I wouldn't pick someone you were not close with because the whole idea of a godparent is that they will raise your child the way you would want them to be raised if something happened to you.
1G3XPiq3aa	I didn't feel ready at all! My pregnancy wasn't planned, and I hadn't wanted kids, but didn't feel an abortion was right for me. I'd sit on the edge of my bed and fold up her new baby clothes when I was still pregnant and try to imagine a baby in them and just couldn't. The very first thing I thought when they handed her to me was "Why on earth are they handing me a baby?!"<br>  <br>  About 5 minutes later though, I was quite convinced it was the best thing I'd ever done, and my mind hasn't changed since. =)|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I thought I was ready until I got a harsh dose of reality and found out how hard pregnancy was lol (even though it was a planned pregnancy). I was not scared or anxious about having him. I was never scared I was going to 'break' him or anything like that. Being his mother came completely natural to me|`|uP08b6K4aa	I don't know about 'ready' but I do know I was incredibly anxious and excited at the same time.  I suppose I was anxious as to what giving birth would be like and the intensity of any pain involved, but overwhelmed at the prospect of seeing my baby for the first time.<br>  <br>  The scary part came when I left the hospital realising that my husband and I were now solely responsible for this little bundle, but so very very happy.|`|3qLIRorjaa	I did feel ready as i'd already got my career, been with my partner for 8 years, got the home, travelled the world etc.<br>  <br>  I wasn't prepared for my husband to fall ill and die when our son was 3 years old but that's life and i've had to adjust my life to accomodate that.<br>  <br>  I've done ok as a single. working mum but my god it's hard and i'm not going to sugar coat that.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes, my children were planned so I was ready.<br>  No, I was not scared or anxious because I was a happily married woman in my 20's and looked forward to the events.|`|c2kopbo6aa	no...no one feels "ready" and yes i felt anxious and scared. those who didn't aren't normal.|`|GKVZyHCHaa	I felt "ready" when my husband and I decided to try for a baby but as those 9 months passed I felt less and less ready!  Yes, I did feel scared and anxious.  It's such a huge responsibility to bring up a child and it means changing your life so that is hugely daunting for anyone!  It's well worth it though!!|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I think it's normal to feel some anxiety before having a child.  I was really nervous...because I didn't know what to expect.  I have a 3 year old and a 19 month old.  Everyday is a new experience...and you learn something new.  I don't think anyone is ever 100percent ready to be a parent.  Its a whole new life and different because every decision you make affects your child.|`|LmgDTXTlaa	I was no where NEAR ready to have a baby when i found out i was pregnant. I was 19, engaged but not married, living at home, a job but not well paid and well...i was awful with children. However, realiy soon sank in and we found a house, my fiance found a better paid job and well things looked up. I was nervous a little around 26 weeks but i soon came round to the idea of a baby and by the end was VERY excited. I am now loving motherhood. My daughter is 8 months old, i just turned 21 and i get married in August. I have my health and my family's health and that is all that matters. Material possessions and money are not the end of everything as well, my fiance and I both recently lost our jobs and our house dues to economic downturn. Though, we are a living with my mum and well, currently not earning, we still have each other and that is what matters.|`|sLkruqYVaa	i didn t feel ready when i got pregnant but i figured thats why you have 9 months to get ready<br>  and i did feel anxious about becoming a mum but it didn t last long, once i realised i wouldn t break the baby lol|`|KWaTVVpGaa	No matter how many children you have, you feel a little scared and anxious about delivering. Just like every child is different, every pregnancy is different too.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	I don't think anyone can be ready,But yeah i knew i wanted him,I felt so many different emotions including scared and anxious...and now all i feel is pure love!!! x|`|3w7VztEWaa	I didn't feel ready and yes very anxious....|`|77tcUSoUaa	yes &yes|`|Mwhclezaaa	a) at 5 months, totally ready.  At 9 months, not at all!<br>  b) Yes, of course!
h5OYD8TIaa	The over the counter prenatal vitamins will have between    800-925MCCG of folic acid (Walgreen's brand have the higher amount     of folic acid) vs. the prescription vitamin has 1000mg of folic acid.  I     was told I could just purchase folic acid separately and take it along     with the over the counter prenatal vitamins.  Its way cheaper that way.    *****Prescription vitamins are harder tolerate, and are not so easy on     the stomach.  The OTC are a lot gentler on the stomach.  Also, if you     are constipated, a lot of these Prescription vitamins include a stool     softener.  But again, if you need a stool softener you can purchase it     separately, like colace........BUT do not take anything without     consulting with a physician first.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	My doctor said they were just as good but some people might have to take a prescription one. I couldn't stomach any of the OTC prenatals so I had to have a prescription.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Most of the time, the OTC brands are just fine. There are some prescription brands with more B vitamins in them that are *supposed* to help alleviate morning sickness. I took some samples of these and honestly am not sure if they worked that well. That's the only difference, though.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Over the counters are fine.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	haha, prescription drugs are a joke anyway. You can get so many good prenatal supplements available off the counter :)|`|8oAlBL91aa	I found that the over the counter ones didn't make me as sick as the one my doctor prescribed. At my last appointment I let her know that they were making me sick and that I wanted to try these (which I had been) and she took a look at them and said these are pretty much the very same as what you are taking now without that ingredient that had been making me sick so for 10.00 I got like 700 pills which she thinks would be enough to last my pregnancy, I think it's to much though.     Spring Vally Prenatal multi vitamin|`|AA10894601	OTC are just as great. I've been taking Spring Valley brand (WalMart) for a long time now. I bought WAY too many when I was pregnant and it ended in m/c so I had a lot left over. When we decided to try again, I immediately started taking them.    I also take an additional folic acid supplement.|`|627pWyVkaa	they are the exact same thing! I asked the pharmasist this. You know what they do, They open the bottle (over the counter) and put it in a pill bottle in the amount your doctor ordered. Its the same thing, but youll pay more because they are dispensing it!|`|79eRDIbXaa	I thought you could only get over the counter ones to be honest|`|QoenvlFuaa	My doctor told me OTC vitamins are just as good as prescription.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I personally have both however I take the over the counter ones because they are smaller and easier to swallow and they don't make me ill.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	over the counter prenatals are just as good as brand name  no prescription needed    EDIT:  if they make you sick...take them at night before bed with a glass of milk...If you can keep milk down    good luck!|`|98WKYtfwaa	the ones you'd get by prescription are the same as over the counter.    they're just the same, if not just as good. they all have the same amount of vitamins and minerals in them if they're specialised for pregnancy.|`|qpABQjPGaa	i took flinstones vitamins when i was pregnant and the doctor said that worked just as well....|`|90zcKChJaa	I tried 2 different prescription prenatals with my first pregnany, and they ALL made me sick. I bought a cheaper brand and have been taking them for my last pregnancy and also this one. They work just as good and only one time a day!!|`|zATQaiwIaa	OTC is just as good, I take nature made and my doctor said they were just fine.  The only difference usually is that the prescribed kind may have a bit more folic acid in it - but the OTC give you what you need.    Not to mention there are a lot of things that have folic acid in it - OJ is a huge source!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	My prenatal vitamins made me sick so my doctor told me I could take 2 Flintstones gummies.  They taste like candy and have every thing I need in them.
sAbah6dTaa	definately not lessen (how many drunk people end up pregnant) but i still don't think it's a good idea you want your body in the best shape possible to conceive a healthy baby!|`|oHNrktxTaa	If you are TTC, it is a good idea to stay away from alcohol. <br>  It doesn't lessen your chances, it just isn't healthy.<br>  <br>  If you aren't pregnant & the first month ttc, it won't hurt you to have a glass of wine or a drink.<br>  But, I reccomend not too.<br>  <br>  Good luck:)|`|yLEeFohqaa	YES!!! Drinking is a very bad idea when you are trying to conceive. If you want your baby to be born without Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome or any other crazy distortion then you should not drink right now and definitely not during you pregnancy. Here is a fact to show you something. When a baby is in the womb it re-drinks the fluid that it is in over and over and over again because it is sterile. However, if you drink and get drunk or just have alcohol period your baby will be drinking alcohol basically again and again and again. In fact, one drink for you is equal to 5 drinks for you baby. So, my advice: Don't drink with your baby or while you are trying to conceive.
vue9NOhYaa	Sure, it's fine.  It's a good idea to not let him go more than 3-4 hours during the day, (if only to help him go longer at night!)  but at night, there's NO reasonto wake a healthy 3 month  old at night. If he's hungry, he WILL let you know.     Demand feeding is the best way to feed a baby. He knows what he needs, when he needs it.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	DO NOT WAKE HIM!! if hes sleeping hes not hungry and u will only teach him its ok to wake through the night|`|aWPQXoIAaa	Don't wake the baby up. He will wake up on his own if he is hungry. Sleep is important.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	I am a father of 4 children I learn that mom always right|`|FcHplZtQaa	I'd increase his intake during the day to cover the milk he's missing, then let him sleep through!    So give him 6/7oz every 3/4hrs during the day, then it won't matter that he's missing a feed at night because his milk intake will be the same!    I fed all my kids on demand, and they're all fine!|`|1df275facdab3bf8f20a968ba4673b17aa	Let your baby sleep. He is getting plenty of feeding. rule of thumb is "never wake a sleeping baby".|`|PYSMK0JBaa	if his weight is on target, let him wake up when hungry. Some babies are sleeping through the night at that age. If he is low on his weight, then I would wake him up to feed.|`|z74wSbQoaa	I would let him sleep through the night.  At 12 weeks he'll be totally fine until morning.|`|AA11903503	Let him sleep, its natural for a baby to cut out night time feedings. As long as he is eating regularly throughout the day and gaining weight let him sleep.|`|QsIco3Fxaa	If you are breastfeeding, it's supposed to be on a demand basis.    But if you are on formula, you better go check with the pedia, but I assume some formulas can do the demand basis feeding too.|`|TBNaPkl6aa	My pediatrician told me that you should only wake a baby at night for a feeding during the first couple weeks.  By 12 weeks, your son's system should be mature enough that he doesn't need to eat as much anyway.  Let him get his much needed rest.  So in short, you're right, and your husband's wrong.  :)|`|CoSdW7xQaa	I say let him sleep, he's getting to that stage where he's starting to sleep through the night. As long as he's gaining weight, then there's no need to wake him. Enjoy it and sleep some more too!|`|0aVHTRAEaa	When my son first came home from the hosptial he lost weight as all babies do, but becuase he had lost almost a pound she told me to feed him every 3 hours and wake him up to do it.  He weight 7lbs 14 oz at birth, but he gained it back plus some and that was at 3 weeks old and she told me to feed on demand.  He is 8 weeks now and weight 11lbs.  I would let him sleep, but if you are concerned certainly have the conversation with your pediatrician to put your mind at ease.|`|vSLHaTFHaa	Wake him and feed him.  You should be breast feeding.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	At 12 weeks, if he has no weight gain issues, I'd just feed him when he wakes up and let everyone get their sleep.
0cQAB27eaa	You are pregnant.|`|EfBMzCjaaa	um my name is whitney but i think u have the wrong girl lol|`|AA10894601	Hopefully it means your pregnant!!!   I know that if you are quite far along that she line shows up rather quickly and dark.  So I'm assuming that the opposite is true if you aren't very far along (it takes longer to show up and it's faint).  It could be an evaporation line though, but let's hope that it's not!    Best of luck and lots of sticky baby dust to you!!     BTW, I'm with you. I can never wait until I'm supposed to actually test to test. I always do it early which drives dh crazy b/c I'm wasting money because I turn around and do it a few days later. I'm just so anxious for my BFP to come!!!|`|5NhartQ3aa	Sounds inconclusive, I would call the phone number on the box to let them know what you are seeing and maybe they can help.  You may have a bad tester.  That happened to me once and they sent me another one.|`|0aVHTRAEaa	The test seems inconclusive to me.  But look find one of those tests that you can take a few days before you period is supposed to start.  Also find one that actually spells it out for you, pregnant or Not pregnant........Those lines are hard to read in my opinion, or maybe Im a dork.....;-)  So, funny story for me....when I took a pregnancy test, I had a basic one with the lines on it, the test indicated that it would take 3 minutes, I did my think on the stick and 20 seconds later I was looking at it and from what the instructions said I was pregnant...but I wasnt convinced because I had never taken a home pregnancy test, it was the first ime I was trying to get pregnant, so I told my husband I was going to go get a pregnancy test for dummies ;-) so I went and got one that has the words on it and again, it said 3 minutes and 20 seconds later I was looking at the word pregnant.....I was overjoyed and scared at the same time!  I took the test 1 day after my missed period date.  Since you are hoping to get pregnant, then I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.  Be sure to add a comment in the addtional details when you take another test....Good Luck!|`|varvdxtqaa	Hey!  Unfortuantely I am at a complete lost as to what is going on!  I had a BFP on Sunday afternoon, then a lighter positive on Monday morning.  Today I tested and it was pretty much nothing!  I still feel like I'm pregnant...but then again you never know!  My AF hasn't started, so I am going to wait it out.  I hope my HCG levels just aren't high enough yet.  I am going to test again Thur. am and then go to the doctors if my AF hasn't showed!  Wish me luck!!
67082a9c920bb435db63ebbdfd15a43baa	I'm 27 and my husband and I are trying for our first now....I will probably be 28 by the time our first is born.  I understand your fiance wanting to wait for financial reasons, that is one of the reasons we have waited until now ourselves.  Still, you can never be truly financially ready, I think at some point you just gotta jump!|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I was nineteen. I had two more before I was thirty. I'm glad I had them when I was younger. The first one made me grow-up and become responsible.|`|s247INgBaa	I will be 16 when my baby is born.  I wish I had waited like 6 more years.|`|6cscDBBsaa	I was 24, I originally didn't plan to have my first til i was about 28 but here I am aged 26 doing it all again! :)|`|lOpRyffzaa	I had my daughter when I was 22. I don't wish I had her earlier or later, I am happy of when she came along, even though she was a bit of a surprise!|`|z7EdBFEMaa	I was 18 when I had my daughter, and at 21 I'm pregnant with my second,  I love being a young mother and wouldn't have it any other way.
cYRZpGkqaa	Sleep is the best medicine. Babies are still too young to fight it. Enjoy the quite time and extra cuddles. Every child gets sick. It's ok.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yes it is normal especially when they are sick sometimes they will wake up only to eat and that takes about 15 mins and then they just go back and sleep let him that makes him feel better.|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Yeah, nothing cures a cold better than lots and lots of rest.  When he wakes up, make sure you give him some water or a bottle.

Congrats!|`|L8XP51rdaa	Very unique.|`|MOeToR1Xaa	That is a beautiful name but i like the unque names saffy (short for Saffron) and the name Caddy (short for Cadmium) hope i help|`|WoxHi03eaa	That's so sweet! But maybe as Isis is such an unusual name, you could have another middle name that's more common for her to go by if she wants to.    Isis Rae is beautiful though.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	That is very nice.|`|0Nfr3leOaa	i love it|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I like Isis.  It is very unique.  I like some with 4 syllables better for a middle name.    How about:  Isis Elizabeth or Isis Victoria?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	A goddess' name is always good!
fZGcufB7aa	I like it a lot! But SummerS is kinda right that the A in Madison clashes with the A in Alice. Maybe you could try Maddison Anne or Madison Elizabeth. It's still a very cute name though!|`|VHHis05Naa	Hate Madison.  Alice!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	sure, it's cute|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Madison is so common and overused! (and masculine). <br>  <br>  Alice is gorgeous, I love it! I'd prefer to see that as a first name. <br>  <br>  I think Madison Alice Dent flows well, though. Alice kind of cancels out the trendiness of Madison.<br>  <br>  Maybe consider Madeleine/Madeline Alice or Alice Madeleine/Madeline? Or even Alice Madelina / Madelina Alice? <br>  <br>  Madelina is pronounced Mad-uh-lee-nuh and there is also Madalena, which is pronounced mad-uh-lay-nuh.<br>  <br>   I think Madel (pron. muh-DELL) or Lena would be better nicknames than Maddie, which is so common!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you decide to go with Madison, please, please, please do NOT spell it Madisyn, Maddyson or any other weird way!|`|n3IoftMFaa	Mmmm, it is passe.<br>  <br>  Madison is dated and kinda just hip in the trailer park now.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think it is cute|`|hR1LlS2Haa	I don't think that Madison is a pretty name at all. Though I do prefer Alice as a first name. Alice Madison Dent is much prettier. Plus if you name your daughter Alice you could call her Allie|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Almost, but not quite. The 'a' in Madison and 'a' in Alice are clashing a bit. What about Madison Elise or Madison Alyssa?|`|IvkNTqDMaa	No...the name Madison is soooooooooo overused...and Alice reminds me of the housekeeper from The Brady Bunch.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Alice Madison flows better.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Try Madisyn Alice. :)<br>  <br>  Cute!|`|Q6usQV1zaa	ALICE MADISON DENT SOUNDS BETTER!|`|eL3jebRzaa	What about Madison Alicia? It rolls of the tongue pretty good.|`|8JzimdBDaa	I like it|`|GSRY5TxJaa	yeah but dont let ur kid go by maddy. i like madison
s4LWmcTjaa	It's not.  Anyone who has spanking and abuse confused has a very misconstrued view or an experience with abuse rather than a corrective spanking.<br>  <br>  My father spanked all of us when we were children.  When we were defiant, we were spanked (for certain things).  It really bothers me that people make assumptions that parents who spank are abusers.  My parents couldn't be further from the truth!  They are some of the most loving, caring people I know.  I have a deep love and respect for them.   I don't have a criminal record, I am not a violent person, and I am not a traumatized soul :-)<br>  <br>  Now I personally don't spank my kids, but I am not at all against responsible spanking used in the proper context.  My husband on the other hand will spank our children if the situation merits it.  I am ok with that because I trust him as a responsible disciplinarian.<br>  <br>  There are many ways to correct a child and carry out discipline.  It just depends on what works for your child, what is effective for your child and what you can do in good conscience.  Spanking is just one tool of many and there's nothing wrong with it.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Spanking is not considered abuse as of yet. All the research that's come out in the last 40 years simply states that it's not an effective discipline tool. The people for, say its how I was raised and it didn't mess me up. The people against cry out its abuse to try to get as much attention for they cause as possible or were abused and think everyone got the same as them. I chose not to spank my son before he was born because my temper scared me. While raising him I found other ways to teach and discipline and found them very affective. By the time my daughter was born I had come to the conclusion that there is no need for physical punishment. I don't know if it's abuse or not but I know there are other ways to do it.|`|1s3nddaYaa	spanking and beaten are two different things. people just don't know that. if you get spanked on the butt with a belt like 3 strike. that's spanking but 10 or so in different spots leaving bruises pushing you around, that is abuse. people are son dramatic these days it isn't even funny/ suing people for having fun with there friends. people getting offended over stupid ****. drives me nuts. i used to get spankings and i turned out fine and surely i dont think it was abuse.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	The left wing loonies said it is and they got there own way. <br>  <br>  I grew up in the 1990's (19 now) and I was spanked and all it did was made me better behaved.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Because I think a lot of parents are busy trying to be their kids' friends rather than a parental figure. Or they have children who don't need to be spanked - it depends on the kid and his/her personality, the parent and their techniques and methods, and the situation. It's more than just one factor - it's a whole set of factors, I think. <br>  <br>  I have a 5-year-old who is spanked if needed. The neighbor down the street has a 6-year-old who is never spanked. Good for them, but that would not work with us: simply because our boys have two VASTLY different personalities. <br>  <br>  Some parents also have trouble saying no to their child - I know lots of parents like this, too. Rather than stand your ground and risk a confrontation, which could lead to a spanking, they just give in to their children and therefore avoid the conflict. <br>  <br>  And there is a definite difference between a beating and a spanking - both in physical attributes as well as semantics. A beating implies using a closed fist or other object to strike the child. A spanking implies an open hand that doesn't, or at least shouldn't, cross the line into excess where bruises are left, etc. I would say that most "normal" parents know the difference and when to stop. When it becomes excessive then it crosses the line into a beating/abuse, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  ETA: While the situations that some people who answered this question went through are horrible, this is not a classic example of 'spanking.' There is a huge difference, and really I'm not sure you can see it objectively when you've come from a dysfunctional home where spanking wasn't done effectively, or where parenting wasn't really done with love. Beating your kids with a belt is not showing them love; but neither is no discipline at all. There is a big difference between the two.|`|ew3Wl6hKaa	My parent's used to hit us (2 brothers 1 sister + me) with a belt or with shoes, sticks etc.. I always thought it was ok and that we were better for it but now that my 20yr old brother has a 4 yr old son, my other brother doesn't even like being in the same room as my father and my sister and I moved out the first chance we got i'm starting to feel differently, I remember always being afraid of doing something wrong because I would get beat and have bruised on my legs, arms and back, we all have anger issues and will constantly have outburst and hit each other!! we're all in our 20s and still remember the day the beatings stopped......my brother grabbed the belt from my mom's hands and just stood their and stared her down all 4 of us sat in that room for hours amazed that he was still alive because we were sure he was a gonner!!!!! when I have kids I'm def. NOT gonna hit......it messes u up psychologically, we just don't want to admit it!!!|`|BHeBSGemaa	My parents didn't lay a hand on me and my 3 brothers growing up. We all grew up and became wild teenagers and never listened to my parents. I think that maybe if we were spanked, or if maybe we were more disciplined, we would have grown up to be more respectful and well behaved. My parents were permissive hippies and they didn't believe in spanking, but you better believe that when I am a mother and my kid misbehaves and won't listen, they will get a spanking.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I don't think a simple swat on the but was ever considered child abuse.  I don't know why people would think that.  <br>  <br>  As for effective discipline, i do not agree.  But I guess it depends on the child and how well (or not) other methods work. <br>  <br>  Lots of parents raise well-behaved children without spanking, there are productive members of society out there who have been spanked and some who have not.  There is not one method of discipline that works for all children.  Nor can you generalize and say that all bad kids were not spanked or all good kids were spanked or vice versa.  I was never spanked and I never did anything illegal or got in major trouble of any kind, nor did my sister.<br>  <br>  Just because people don't spank does not mean they don't discipline.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Because it's hitting, I suppose you also agree with people hitting their wives, there were rules you weren't allowed to leave bruises or use an object so it wasn't really abusive we did it back in the day and women weren't so disrespectful and committing crime back then.<br>  <br>  It is a fear you tactic you only do what they say because you don't want to get hit, you may not be scared of your parents but you'd do your best to avoid being hit by them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Spanking is not abuse... a couple of swats on the rear.<br>  However, when you get hit to the point that you have bruises or you are slapped in the mouth, or thrown through a wall, or grabbed up by your hair or arms.... Then yeah, that's abuse. <br>  <br>  What has changed is society in some cases states saying that you can't hit your child at all. I've heard that some states have actually passed laws saying this, my state hasn't. You are allowed to spank your child but once you leave marks, it's abuse.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Spanking is not considered abuse by most normal thinking people. Spanking is not evil and is effective. Some people may not like the idea of spanking a child but that does not make it abuse. I can pretty much claim any parenting tactic is abuse if I don't like it. That doesn't make it abuse.|`|CrZxYK5raa	no not really I was spanked and I don't think it was abuse at all.<br>  if I do something bad enough for them to get that angry then I did deserve it. even if  your spanked with a belt and you deserved it it's not abuse. if you get hit a  lot and you become depressed then it can be abuse.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	i know,<br>  <br>  what I got was abuse.<br>  <br>  <br>  getting spanked isn't even that bad.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Well I was spanked from 7-14 years old by my 19 year old sister's father.  The detective and CPS both considered it discipline, not child abuse.  Of course they also thought I was making up the emotional and sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of my 19 year old sister's father as well.  Anyway the spanking caused me to be afraid of my stepfather and other men as well.  I remember getting backed up into the washer because my stepfather was convinced I had washed his paycheck in the washer at 9 years old. I remember being smacked open handed across the face after arriving home from a camping trip at 9 or 10 years old because I got D's and F's on my interim report. Even now sometimes when my husband raises his hand to brush my hair out of my eyes or tries to hold me, I jerk away from him, even though I know he'd never harm me.  I remember when my sister's father punched my mother in the eye and left a bruise above her left eye before shoving her down the stairs when she tried to say goodbye to me when she divorced my stepfather.  So yes spanking can cause fear in children and can screw them up for life (as in my case).   Some kids who were spanked go on killing sprees as adults or run away.  Girls who are spanked might run away and become prostitutes in order to survive on the streets. They might grow up thinking that all men will abuse them and be more likely to pick an abusive man to date/marry and will be more likely to STAY in an abusive relationship because that is all they know.  If you've never been backed up against the wall or backed up into a washer as a child then you have no idea what it's like to fear the person you consider a father. You have no idea how much I was afraid of my stepfather.  I knew the punishment for daring to tell anyone about my abuse I suffered. I knew the fear in my voice as a child was real and I know what it's like to beg someone you consider a parent, an important figure in your life, to stop hurting you.|`|816ecf10732a98e612062d8dfded0d7aaa	well when at a young age i dont think its wrong for a child to get an "spanking " cause if your 4yo is lashing out at home and being bad i think that he would do it in public and also if you look at it from a bible point of view there is many verse that say if a child is being bad u can spanking him or her. proverbs 15:22 say"Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy; the rod of discipline is what will remove it far from him" so if a child is acting up i think you should tear hs but up and in some states u can whoop your child whitout going to court for it like in my state when i was younger i got in trouble at school and the police told my mom that she can spank me. so foget the law cause i would rather spank my child then let him or her run me. YOU ARE THE PARENT NOT THEM.|`|AA12245468	In my fam's case, spanking became abuse when someone got hurt.<br>  AND it wasn't even from the spanking.<br>  My youngest daughter got knocked down and got a bruise on her forehead when I went to grab my now 10 year old daughter to discipline her.<br>  Additionally, because we spanked prior to that incident we were looked upon as abusive parents by the judge and the gaurdian ad leitem and foster mom.<br>  <br>  even though we had two psychiatrists and a couple of social workers stating we were not abusing our kids, the judge in our case would not hear it.<br>  <br>  what's considered abuse when disciplining isn't always the parents decision.<br>  <br>  common sense tells most of us leaving marks that don't go away right away  when spanking is abuse.<br>  <br>  It's even more aggrevating to hear about and witness a lot worse forms of abuse than my fam ever encountered, and these fams get to keep their kids...|`|UnA531DNaa	spanking isn't child abuse, beating your child is, though.  <br>  <br>  The problem is, people who spank their child when it doesn't work for them means that the spanking goes on and on and the child doesn't care, or even laughs.  Different children react differently.  It really depends on how your child reacts to spanking.  If saying, "If you don't stop that tantrum, we're going to the bathroom for a lil 'visit'," and they know they'll get a spanking, and it stops them from throwing a tantrum in the restaurant, I think that's ok.  But if they continue their behavior, then spanking isn't working for them.  <br>  <br>  What REALLY can happen there, is to explain to the child before even going into the store, that if they cry or whine, you are leaving immediately.  Trust me, I did this with my daughter when she was 3.  We were on our way to her BIRTHDAY party, and had to pick up the cake I'd ordered.  On the way into the store, she threw a fit about something or another, and I'd told her already, if you throw a fit, we're leaving.  What did I do?  I walked her right on back to the car - she didn't get the cake.  I did call my sister and asked her to pick up the cake for me, but that short half an hour that my daughter thought she wasn't going to get her cake, it really changed the way she thought about fits.  I didn't spank her or beat her, the punishment of the thought that she wouldn't get her cake was enough for her.<br>  <br>  That's not to say I haven't spanked her.. but I reserve it for extremely bad behavior, in private, and never do it when I'm mad.  For example, when she tried to teach ME how to swear (yep, she tried to show me how to stomp my feet and say "D---IT!", even said look mommy, this is how you're supposed to do it!  LOL it was kinda funny), I told her that was not words we use, they were not acceptable, and if she did it again, she would get a spanking.  She did it, so she got a spanking.  I wasn't mad, I was trying so hard not to giggle, but I did it, because I knew since I almost never spank her, it would hit home... and it did.  To this day (she's 7 now), she's never said another swear word in my presence.  <br>  <br>  But, there are kids that don't get taken out of a store when they're throwing a fit... when I did it with Kimmie, I got knowing smiles from everyone I saw, because they knew there wasn't anything I could have done to prevent the fit, but I was taking her out of the store so no one else had to put up with it. <br>  <br>  I can say, though, that I was in a Wal-Mart one day (years ago) when someone called the cops on a mother that was spanking her child.  But the spanking she was doing was clearly beating her child, not just spanking them... she was hitting them sooooo hard it was digusting!!!  The child was visibly hurt - not their feelings, they were physically hurt.  Spanking should be more of a shameful thing in public for kids, not like a beat-down, you know?|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I think your question is very pertinent. I don't know what has changed. Perhaps there is in today's society a general abhorrence of anything that concerns the body rather than the mind - although the mind is so much more sensitive to abuse (verbal or other) than a child's bottom. Most people that I know who have been spanked as children not only are fairly "normal" adults but also don't regard the spankings they received as such a "big deal". And that is how I view the fact that my mom spanked me - unpleasant yes, impressive yes, but certainly not abusive. There are clear forms of abuse of course, such as hitting a child against the wall or using a cane on him or her. But that is not what we are talking about. So, I am as puzzled as you are.
1M6lF31Yaa	As parent's we tread a very fine line when it comes to how we influence our children's attitude towards money. Although we don't want our children to grow up with a spoilt attitiude where they expect everything to be handed to them on a silver platter, we also don't want them thinking that they come from a poor family that can never afford anything.<br>  <br>  I believe that we must instill in our children in terms of not "I can't afford it." but in terms of "How can I afford That?" We need to adjust their mindset in relation to money.<br>  <br>  It is very important that our children grow up with a very healthy attitude towards money and must learn how to save and spend money wisely. I feel if we do not guide them in the right direction they will grow up with what is called a "poverty mindset" and will always struggle. We need to break that mold and help them to understand that money is a concept, and if they put their mind to it they can start thinking creatively and think of ways of making money.<br>  <br>  In addition, a child that grows up believing that they can never afford anything, will inevitable grow up believing that they are not worth very much. In that I mean when they get a job they will hold themselves back because they will not believe that they are worth any more that they are paid.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes, I taught mine early on the value of money, saying things like Daddy has to work very hard to make the money we spend.  They now do very well for themselves and are careful with how they spend their money.  I'm proud of them.<br>  Now I see kids in the stores pitching fits because they can't have everything they want.  It's better to learn it when you're young than have to confront it as a big surprise when you grow up.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Well, I would tell her how it was for you growing up. That you grew up to get an education and to work hard so you wouldn't have to worry about money as much. Tell her that while we can afford the things we need - we still have to watch our money carefully (regardless of if it is true or not) so we can continue to make ends meet.<br>  Say, you are lucky but Mommy and Daddy work hard for this. Teach her to respect money. Don't let her have change lay about. Get her a piggy bank and let her save up for something she really wants. My parents were comfortable and they let my oldest sister have whatever she wanted - as a teen she had 20's scattered around her room - she just didn't care. That was a big mistake. They learned their lesson and the rest of us had to earn our allowance and make our own car payments. <br>  I am glad that happened - it got me ready for the real world - you can't rely on mom and dad forever.

I really liked the hypnosis program www.hypbirth.com, It really helped with the scary stuff. <br>  3. Some sort of craft that takes a lot of attention,  cross stitch knitting or something you really have to focus on to get your mind out of that yucky place.<br>  4. If you don't have it already consider a birth plan  try www.birthplan.com<br>  <br>  Really human birth when left to it's own devices has only a 2% error so if you and your baby are healthy you shouldn't have any problems.

NO, it actually increases the risk of something stress related happening to your body which in turn will affect your baby.  Don't worry honey, all will be okay.  If you have reason to believe otherwise, speak to your doctor or maybe see a therapist - venting and getting an outside opinion or advice might be just what you need.  Most importnantly - take care of yourself, otherwise you can't take care of your two little boys!

I kissed at 8    I made out ay 11    I hooked up at 12    I lost my virginity at 13
KVBTtF9faa	When you have contractions that are consistent, meaning they come every 4-5 minutes apart, and each one lasts about 45 seconds - 60 seconds, and that happens for an hour - then you are safe in considering it "active" labor.|`|8KjPGiH7aa	I'm 39 weeks today too! :)<br>  I've had some on and off serious cramping too, my doctor says it's normal. Just be on the lookout for contractions that last 30-45 sec. long every 5 minutes.... if your water breaks you're in labor.... I'm sure you've heard it all before. :)  <br>  <br>  (By the way, I'm just curious, how old are you?)|`|sv4guUQNaa	I'm a week behind you and I've been having the same thing happen to me.  It was to the point on Wednesday when I thought for sure I was going into labor (I had intermittent cramps for 2 1/2 hours).  I know this doesn't answer your question but I just feel happy that someone else is going through a similar experience.|`|5npjXFKOaa	There is a big difference between cramps and contractions. when you are in labor (active) you will have the "cant breathe-move or talk" while contracting pain. You can feel it in your back, legs and pelvis. The cramping is most likely just your body preparing - you will know when you are in labor- there wont be a question about it. When you hit the stage of having contractions reg. (every 3-7 min) for an hour then it will be time to go to the hospital. Plus there will be bloody show most likely and the baby will drop into your pelvis.|`|z0JIf6qqaa	I wasnt sure when I was in labour too. I thought I was just having alot of braxton hicks contractions and soft back aches. it can come on slow but once your water breaks it all gets stronger and faster. Id go to the hosp one more time anyway. the nurses should be nice and not snooty. youre  so close and nervous and you know what? Its normal. A doctor once told me Id rather have someone here just incase than some out there in having to push. Good Luck Mom :)|`|rnTNu6MTaa	I am due this monday and honestly i have no idea how it will be. I have this cramps too, but they are not so bad to make me think it might be labor. I do have the pelvic pressure and i feel like my bones, down there ,are going to spread at any time...lol. Hope i can deliver on time as my baby is getting bigger and i don't want complications... :( like a C-section. Good luck and hope u have an easy delivery :)|`|QTWGaT6gaa	You will know a real contraction when you feel one. Time them. If they are in a steady pattern it is real labor. When they get to 10 minutes apart call the doctor. At 5 mintues apart it's time to leave.
AA11721605	Yes, totally safe to eat canned foods, enjoy them and may God, whomever you think He is, bless you and your baby :-) !|`|VUFoOTYEaa	I don't see why not. I am pregnant with my second, and I had no problems with my first one, and I ate sweet corn quite a bit. But if your still not reassured, ask your doctor.|`|Iks1qdElaa	Ok stop being so paranoid, you can eat anything you want, they just warn you not to eat high amounts of fish that contain mercury and of course don't eat lots of fast food and junk, but even if you did that would still be fine. If you want a healthy baby eat healthy.|`|PHgd0pcwaa	I say eat whatever doesn't make you sick. That was my way of thinking.   My doctor told me to eat anything and everything I wanted, just lots of water everyday. and careful on the sugar filled juices because your teeth are being sucked  of their calcium and are more susceptible to rotting or plaque.|`|jlrfkXj2aa	yes,     but let me recommend something way better..... Birds Eye steamfresh vegis... I think it tastes like it was picked today! here at wal-mart they are $1.25 a bag. They are all natural and have no preservatives. I have their super sweet corn every day almost lol. they take like 5 min in the microwave... there SO yummy!   (((( I should be a paid sponsor lol ))))    and they have no salt, which my Dr. told me to avoid salt so they work great for me.    ...now I want some and I just checked and were all out. lol|`|MFBJDnOUaa	I ate sweet corn out of the can and my baby girls fine but i think its okay i dont know about pumpkin seeds though lol never had any kind of pumpkin|`|ED1Tjgz7aa	no it might kill your baby... DONT DO IT!!!!!!!!!! im dr.nelson of the baby instute|`|0uhRgfcsaa	yep yummy :) pumpkin seeds are also fine.
EmfQUQDDaa	im having a boy... i found out last Wednesday and its the best thing ever (:    i have been out and bought clothes and also ordered pram and everything.    Some people say that if you wait till you have your baby you will have a nice suprise.. thing is if you cant wait then find out because trust me love it makes you smile (:|`|NWEJdpocaa	I'd want to know what I was having because I'm impatient...also I wouldn't care what I was having. I would just hope for a healthy baby and be thankful for either sex.|`|bpyx92GZaa	I have 2 girls and 1 boy. I would like another girl. My son makes up for all the boys I wanted...lol but I love him dearly :o)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I would like another girl.  And i would want to know what i was having.  If i did have a boy i'd love him just as much.|`|U1juqahIaa	I'd prefer a girl, but I'd love the baby no matter what gender it is.  A healthy baby is more important than its gender.     I like to keep it a surprise.|`|q82cqg3raa	I would like to know! So I could buy clothes and stuff in advance! I don't really like surprises.  I don't have any siblings so I definitely want at least 2 kids, maybe 3. I'd like the first one to be a boy! Maybe two boys and a girl.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	I have 3 boys and 1 girl,so I would want another girl:) What's wrong with baby boys????|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I want 2 girls and then a boy. In that order.    I plan to adopt, so i'll definitely get my own way :)    I'll leave my 4th child (which will be biological), up to fate :)|`|DNygQdmVaa	Ia lready have a boy so id want a girl.|`|578pyGrhaa	I like girls better because I would like to do girly things with them but if I had a boy I think I wouldn't be as understanding.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	The most important part to me is that the baby is healthy. After that being said, I would like for my next child to be a boy, because we already have a girl.|`|T7uFoSUQaa	I really want three kids. I'd prefer to have at least one of each sex. However, if the first two are girls, I would seriously reconsider having three children. Girls are tough! I think I would want to know because I hate surprises, but yet I don't know if I'd want to ruin that surprise.|`|VPOaunmvaa	I would be delighted for either but i've always wanted a little boy    :)|`|fRAuMrrWaa	That is aweful haha!  Baby boys are amazing and I would love to have a baby boy.  I will love having someone to watch play football and baseball :).  I also want a little girl though.  To shop with and do all of the girly stuff ha.  If you are a good parent then you shouldn't worry about having a mean little boy because that is under your control.  And no, I don't want to know.  If God wanted us to know he would have put a window on our belly :).  Plus, I like surprises.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	...have a baby die shortly after birth and you'll never ask a question like this again.    The ONLY answer to what do you want is HEALTHY!|`|sC0NvRzEaa	That doesn't sound right....  I think it doesn't matter as long is a healthy baby, I just found our we are having a girl and im happy, i would be also happy if it was a boy.|`|UmA4TbDGaa	totally would want to know. praying it would be a boy.|`|5duNSD9Caa	id want a boy first so that the boy can take care of her younger   sisters then. =]
PLK1p8cUaa	You can't.  If you don't know the date of you last period then you have to have an ultrasound to confirm gestational age and conception date.  It is important if you want to prevent a pregnancy to make sure to keep track of your cycle.  A little red mark on a calender is always a good idea.  Make a doctors appointment and good luck.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Are you pregnant?  The doctor can do an ultrasound to figure out how far along you are.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	you will have to wait til your scan and they will measure your baby and tell you as babies develop at the same rate until about 12 weeks, so they measure by weeks and days, then tell you your due date|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Just tell your dr that. he will do an ultrasound and they can tell approx how far along you are depending on how developed the baby is. Early ultrasounds are surprisingly accurate on estimating a due date.|`|627pWyVkaa	Your doctor will ask you and just be honest and tell him you can't remember And he will go by whatever the ultra sound shows him :)
F6lZHRkVaa	It was hard for me to give up my job - at first. I spent the first month after the baby missing my coworkers and just grabbing a coffee and gabbing with my boss before work started. I missed getting lunch at the cafeteria and I missed taking a walk on my breaks.    It was HARD. Your baby is pretty unresponsive for the first few weeks, so it can feel like you just give, give, give and get nothing in return. But one day your baby is going to smile at you and one day your baby will coo at you. And on that day, you'll find yourself being so happy to be home that you never want to leave.    Just give it some time, and if you decide after 3 months that staying home isn't for you, go back to work! You don't have to commit to anything either way right now, just promise yourself 3 months and see how you feel.    Good luck!|`|GnXfEdegaa	I think it's a "transition thing".  If it is something that both you and your dh wants for your life then go for it!  You are probably just feeling like you will be missing so much that your job gives you, not just money (friends, adult companionship).  You will have to find it in different ways, that's all.  You don't mention how old your child or children are?  Good luck from one SAHM to "maybe? another?!

prqrQcd1aa	My own personal take on allowances is this.. she should not get paid for what she is expected to do. My oldest is 7 years old. I DO however ask her to do extra things around the house that i wouldn't normally expect her to do, in order to get an allowance.  She is expected to clean her room up. For her allowance, she can scoop out the litter box, help bring groceries up from the car, vacuum the living room and hall way, feed the cats (we have 4 of them), do a few dishes, or else dust stuff off around the house. As she gets older and is responsible for more things then the things she does to earn money will also change.   I think that it is good to teach children a sense of responsibility when it comes to money, at an early age. When she really wants a toy, i make her earn the money for it, or i will go half on it with her if it is expensive. This will teach her that money doesn't grow on tree's and that she has to work for the things that she gets.  What you are doing is good too, I think that being responsible for laundry at 10 years old (doing all things with it) would be something that she should earn money for, and cleaning up the dog poo in the yard. I think we are basically on the same wave length here with allowance and yes what you give her a week is fair. Her behavior being good is fair, and if things aren't done then no, she shouldn't get it.|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	if we have to remind him to do his work we pay less  if he doesnt do it we dont pay at all  you wouldnt be paid if you didnt do what you were hired for for very long  besides we dont pay people just to breathe|`|yp8NtB0faa	Yes i do.  If teaches them you don't just get money haned to you, you have to work for it.  Also it teaches them not to be lazy!  If she does her chores everyweek and does have good behavior for a couple weeks, double her allowance.  Let her know if she does do a good job, she'll get even more.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I wouldn't give any money at all of the jobs aren't accomplished.    In my house allowance helped teach us to manage our money and to save for things we wanted rather than demanding them immediately.  Short of clothes any maybe books growing up, we were never given anything but christmas presents, birthday presence, and allowance.  So anything I wanted that wasn't in December or July, I had to save up and get it myself.  Much less whining than if she'd just given me things I wanted herself or never let me have anything at all. :P|`|G2auAv1Saa	I feel it takes a whole family to run a household and it is every ones responsibility and no one ever got paid for a responsibility. My 4 year old cleans her own room and bathroom (I do the big cleaning in there once a month she does more of the tidy up), she brings her laundry to the laundry room and tosses them into the washer she puts her clothes into her drawers, she puts sodas and water into the fridge and sprays the lysol into the trash can when dad changes the bag.  My daughter has been in big business with the tooth fairy lately, got Christmas money and we have started a little money budgetting from that. When she gets older we plan to do an allowance that isn't tied to chores but include her lunch money in the allowance.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We don't tie allowance and chores together. In our house they are two different things. Mom and Dad don't get paid for cleaning the house, and neither do the kids.     If the kids want money for doing something, it has to be above and beyond their regular chores. Otherwise they get a regular allowance and that allowance goes straight to their savings if they exhibit bad behavior.|`|AA12324049	Our allowance arrangement with our kids was different than yours. They had chores they were expected to do but it wasn't tied to their allowance because we explained to them that they have to help out because they are part of the family, not because they were getting paid.  We gave them $1 a week x their age and they could do whatever they wanted with it - spend it or save it.  It was a godsend because I never had to be the bad guy when we were out shopping and they wanted something, I would just ask them if they had enough money to buy it with their allowance.  Sometimes they would pool their money together to buy something they both wanted but couldn't afford alone - like a computer or video game.  Now, they are 22 and 17 and they both have savings in the thousands because they saved a lot of their allowance as well as checks they got for their birthday, etc.  In your case, maybe you could assign a figure to each chore and if they aren't done then deduct that amount.|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	That's alot of chores for $4, but she is young so I dont reccommend giving her more money. Maybe tell her that each week you will put X amount of dollars in an envelope, or in the bank, and when she is 16 or 18 she can have it.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	My five children all have certain jobs/chores that they are told to do.  They do them, our house runs smoothly and life continues.  We don't give our children any set allowance.  We don't pay them any set dollar amount to complete their jobs....it's just all part of living in a house.    Anyone who is alive has certain responsibilities that we may not be paid in cash for.  We don't necessarily think we should have to pay our children to work in their own home.    However, we do give them the $10 it costs to go to the movies with their friends, or buy them the $15 toy here and there.  They do get money, it just isn't for "doing the chores".  Its because we love them and want them to have the things they want.  If my child gets good grades, doesn't get in trouble and finishes things he/she is supposed to finish and then later  he/she asks me for $10 to buy something, I will usually give it to him/her.    I am not really AGAINST allowances, I just don't want to pay my children to contribute to the running of our household.
EtCRnDJMaa	because they don't READ the whole question or statement before they post their comment.  They assume something then get all bent out of shape and are pissed off then go post what they have to say.  <br>  <br>  people are funny!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	what is the problem here?? Do you let her pet your kitties?? is she in the pen with them? No? Then its no one elses business....they would think nothing of you owning a 140 lb dog and yet there would be significantly more danger in keeping a big dog in the house with a child than keeping wild cats outside away form her.<br>  People are odd though. when I had my first child lots of people asked me if I would get rid of my horses??? WHY?? lol.<br>  Keep your cats and educate your daughter .|`|KDNWFuZWaa	Had you only left the question then waited for answers, then edited it you would have got a lot more reactions, as was you put it all in so no-one would jump to conclusions.<br>  What you have also got think of is that everyone is different, some jump to conclusions others try to understand first, others really do not give two hoots.<br>  Why did you automatically think everyone was going to jump to conclusions, that is a bit small minded wouldn't you say.|`|9EMR6BHFaa	Don't know about parnets, but parents are concerned with safety of children.<br>  <br>  Please don't take this as criticism but, what is the point of having these wild animals if they are not in their natural and free habitat?|`|AA11795652	I've never called anyone a bad "parnet."|`|zIMoBfuvaa	lol!! Some people call good parents "bad" if they disagree with something that the parent did, but didn't do to deliberately harm their child at all. (such as giving the child formula instead of breastfeeding!) These Moms were probably called a bad parent at one point so they call other Moms bad parents if they disagree with them.  Basically they are insecure and this is how they make themselves feel better about themselves. There are bad parents out there, but most of the time here on Y!A, its good parents on here asking questions and just being put down for something that another parent disagrees with. Its immature.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Here's proof that home prenatal heart dopplers DO work no matter what people say.  Here is a woman with her own home prenatal heart doppler at 15 weeks.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEyQ5oZ4S...    Get one that's 3mhz.  You can hear the heartbeat as early as 8 weeks.  I've only heard impressive reviews from prenatal heart dopplers.  =)  Definitely get one dear!  I wish I could get one!!!|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Not worth it, and often times only produces unnecessary stress in mothers who are unable to find the baby's heartbeat.    Almost all of the retail / commercially sold ones are not high quality like the ones at the doctor's office, making it less likely to find a heart beat, and even with the decent ones, a woman who is not trained in finding fetal heat tones often has a great deal of difficulty locating the heart beat.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	don't work until like the 9th month lol the ones you can rent "really expensive" they work pretty well :) none from wa lmart. "waste waste waste"     36 weeks and 4 days!|`|psnaJcvpaa	You can hire one here for 9.99 a month, but you have to be quick, cos stocks are low>>>http://www.dopplerhire.co.uk/    I can't comment if they are any good or not, because I didn't have one when I was expecting any of my 3..its a really good idea tho..|`|7HzfgRmwaa	I bought a really good one from ebay. I also used a rented one from baby beats for awhile. I miscarried very early my last pregnancy and it was a missed miscarriage so I had no idea anything was wrong. Therefore - I loved being able to assure myself daily that my son was doing okay inside my womb by hearing his heartbeat. I used it every day or every other day and it took away a lot of stress for me! When I started to feel him move I used it less often - only on days I couldn't feel him much. It definitely helped get me through this pregnancy without going crazy with worrying!! I will probably always get one with my future pregnancies. I think it is a good investment! I bought mine for 120$ and intend on selling it on craigslist.com when I am threw so really I won't be out a lot of money. I heard his heartbeat at the doctor's at 9 weeks and got my doppler about 10 weeks and could hear it with my own whenever I tried after that.     Good Luck!|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I rented one from babybeats.com i love it! works great and i hear the baby perfectly everytime|`|KK3RkRjxaa	My mil bought me one when I was like 5 months, still haven't been able to hear the baby's heartbeat. I am due March 12, but dr said baby will come any day now. Don't bother buying one!!|`|TzWkvyctaa	I bought one and was happy for about a week,,,heard a noise that i though was a HB. Then one day i couldn't find it any more so i was S**ting myself, i as convinced the baby was dead. so i went to the midwife and she found it straightaway on her professional one and it sounded completely different! I am sure that the noise i was hearing was not the HB (dunno what it was though).  Now i am 23 weeks and feel her kick every 5 mins. There is no mistaking that!!!  If you do get one, get one of the ore costly ones and don't worry if you cant find the heartbeat, that is what the professionals are for!|`|AA10075521	don't u think doppler's effect comes under physics?!|`|dd2vz570aa	Angel Sounds Doppler is really good.  I started using mine at 17 weeks pregnant and can honestly say I have always been able to find a heartbeat.  The baby is small at 17 week and constantly moving around so you have to find the heartbeat and follow it.  If your going to use a Doppler to early in your pregnancy then you may not hear a heartbeat and end up worrying your self.  Mine was 30 and its one of the best 30 Ive spent.  It gives me such piece of mind between check ups and even now at 33 weeks.  if she is having a sleep I can check she is OK and when she has the hiccups I can hear them more clearly.  I would never go through a pregnancy with out one.|`|3krIFZEOaa	i would say a well worth buy i have one to put my mind at ease throught my pregnancy after m/c i found it really good i have the angel sounds one it took me a while to find heartbeat at first but can find it right away now at 33 weeks i bought mine when i was 16 weeks i would say yes they are good
oHNrktxTaa	Usually after you TTC, you can still have left over sperm a day or two after. It has happened to me. <br>  <br>  I suggest you try the OPK sticks. I think they would be good for you, since your cycle is a little off now, since being off birth control pills. They are great & will help determine your LH (lutenizing hormone) surge prior to ovulation. I am not sure if it would be late for you to start using the sticks now. It all depends on how long your menstrual cycle is. <br>  The Clear Blue Easy OPK digital sticks are easy to read & you don't have to compare lines & colors. It is either a O or a smiley:)<br>  <br>  I suggest to BD every other day prior to ovulation...which is your fertile week. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck & lots of Baby Dust!<br>  Have fun ttc:)|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	If you think you are ovulating or will be ovulating in the next few days, go ahead and use an OPK today and keep testing until you get a positive, if you think you ovulated already tho, you may have missed the chance to get a positive, they will only be positive when your hormones surge 1-2 days BEFORE ovulation. But it wont hurt to test now, just in case. Next cycle tho, assuming you didnt concieve this month, start testing the week you are supposed to ovulate, that way you wont miss it if you ovulated a little early. Good luck and tons of baby dust!
ZbnxGIsnaa	It would have to be a pretty bad fall to cause a miscarriage, but I mean it's possible.  Try to take it easy dear.  =)|`|14VY9VQCaa	gosh ain't you a happy soul???????    no i doubt it the only thing that will cause a miscarriage is nature.|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	Oh thats very sad that u fell... hope u didn't hurt urself. And also that u didn't fall on ur tummy. I don't think  it should be much of a problem since u fell on ice. But when u take a test and its positive, and when u visit the dr, make a mention of this fall...
1z3C0R2Vaa	Go for it i think that is ovulation pain good luck.|`|scdOdaTKaa	It very well could be ovulation, you should get your LH surge, but I recently learned that we may miss that surge when using OPK's as it is short. So I would being having intercourse evey other day, that should put adequate semen to fertilize the egg. THat's how my husband and I plan on doing it this month. Best of luck and lots of baby dust!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	it could be, yes having sex every other day is good and you will hit ovulation
VHHis05Naa	My husband gained weight with both pregnancies and during this one has mood swings worse than I do.  It's obnoxious!  He passes out on the couch, saying he's soooo tired and I've had a toddler all day and I'm almost 27 weeks pregnant!|`|DutTBV3caa	mine gets crankier then normal too. i think its just the stress of becoming a father. is this his first child?|`|AA10976951	My husband seems more stressed and nervous this time than he was with our first child.  There is going to be a 7 year age difference though so I think he just feels out of practice or something.  But the economy sucks so maybe that is contributing to your husband's stress.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	most likely stress
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you think something is wrong, maybe you should ask for one. I have the same problem - I'm 35 weeks and have been measuring fine the entire time until now. The doctor wants me to have one next week. If I were four weeks (what is that, 4 cm?) I probably would be a little concerned. However, I've read that sometimes the measurements can be off if the baby has dropped. I'm not sure if mine has but maybe yours has. <br>  <br>  If your midwife never answers the phone, or never calls you back, maybe you should switch practices.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Do you mean 14? There is No physically possible way that your baby would fit into a uterus measuring 4 weeks at 28 weeks... That baby is 15-16 inches long and weighs about 2 pounds... it can't fit in a uterus measuring 4 weeks... i don't understand why they would tell you your uterus was measuring only 4 weeks?<br>  <br>  well that is different!! I wouldn't worry about that. As long as the Dr's have told you the fluid is fine, I wouldn't worry about the size of your uterus. My wife is measuring 3 weeks LARGER than she should... and the baby is measuring 2 weeks BIGGER than she should! nothing is exact, just remember that... if the doc says everything's fine, i'm sure you're ok... remember they have probably gone through 1000's of pregnancies! good luck!|`|mAsQbiIgaa	I was always told if you are in any way concerned, just go to your local maternity hospital-where you are booked in to see the baby.<br>  <br>  Give them a call and say you are very worried and haven't been feeling well and haven't been feeling movement and they should tell you to come on over. <br>  <br>  Mine where very good to be fair.  I'd forget about phoning midwive and just phone the maternity hospital.

Or if you want there is open adoptions where you can keep up with how your childs being raised.

nT6dNIfBaa	My boyfriend is a third generation Donald.. lucky for me.. he wasn't too fond of the name either.. So.. to keep his family from being upset.. we decided to make his middle name Dean after his father and Grandfathers middle name. I do see the importance of your first son having the dads name.. however, it doesnt have to be exact.. you can play with it a little.. and compromise. Maybe use his middle name or make his first name the babies middle name. My boyfriends family was perfectly happy with our sons name even though it wasn't donald.|`|RjpGomsyaa	How about James Lee|`|YkseyT7zaa	Compromise|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	Just tell him you believe children should have their own identities, and although you love him, you don't feel it's necessary or fair for you to adopt HIS family's tradition.  <br>  <br>  Remind him that you've also tried to compromise with Jimmy.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	tell him you dont want to name him Jimmylee, how about first name Jimmy/Jim middle name Lee?

Maybe even name him James <br>  <br>  My son was named after his father Larry Clayton. We call our son Clay. Clayton is a traditional family name.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	how about jimmy jr.|`|paerqxfMaa	I HATE that tradition - because you always have "Big Jimmy" and "Little Jimmy" or worse, the kid ends up getting called "Junior".  I always felt the son should be named after the woman's father, with the father's father as a middle name.  Of course, when my son was born, he was SUPPOSED to be named after his father (like all the other brothers in the family's kids), but, since I was awake when they asked me the baby's name I told them the name I wanted him to have.  End of storry - in the delivery room, the father was kind of spaced out and because of what he had just witnessed he was not going to argue with me about naming our son.|`|AA11273571	I wouldn't feel any particular obligation to name my child after the father unless the father married me.  Even then, it would depend on if I liked dad's name.  Name your son what you like and let the chips fall where they may.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Tell him you're not going to continue.

Please dont do that<br>  <br>  Stick with James Lee.|`|miFe45quaa	What about James Lee (first and middle)?<br>  Technically, he'll be known as Jimmy Lee...so technically they have the (somewhat) same name.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want to tweak the tradition a bit...|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	How about suggesting the name James Lee instead?|`|8uvb3Nroaa	How about James for your son? It might be a nice compromise...|`|Cd2JQJHeaa	name it jimlee|`|N4Ct35GFaa	Hmm, if anything the son could have the middle name Jimmy, I think giving your kid his fathers first name is a bit arrogant.  Personally I think names should skip a generation if you really feel the need to keep it in the family.  For example, make your son's middle name his grandfathers first name.  The first name should be based on what will be acceptable in that generation.  I agree, Jimmylee probably wouldn't be the best name for a child in this generation.|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	I'm not a fan of naming children EXACTLY after their father either. Children should have their own identities, not just be a clone of their dad. I used the father's first name as my son's middle name. If you like the name Jimmy, why don't you suggest naming your son Jimmy Lee (last name). Or using Jimmy or Jimmylee as the middle name or James Lee/Lee James? If he's not willing to discuss it with you or compromise, that's his fault. Ultimately it's up to you and can name the child whatever you want, without his approval. I would never give my child a name i didn't like. You shouldn't do it just to please him or his family if they're not willing to compromise...<br>  <br>  This is YOUR child too and you should definitely have some input as to what the child's name is.|`|rpzHSaI9aa	Personally I don't like the idea of name a child after a parent.... that being said you both will be the parents of this child and should therefore agree on the child's name. <br>  Maybe suggest some names that you like and some that are similar to his and use his name for the child's middle name. Ex James Lee (Last name)|`|4WyUrWaIaa	James ? Jimmy, is a variation if James. <br>  My Fiance's name is Jamie, and I like the name, but, it would be too confusing to have two Jamie's going about, so, we named our son James, which, Jamie is a variation of !!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Tell him that you are going to start your own tradition and name him what you guys can agree upon. I would have Jimmy for a middle name but in my opinion Jimmylee sounds a little backwoods to me (sorry) Maybe go with James? It's plain but better. Good luck|`|k8sukeTbaa	What about James Lee [Last Name]?  Jimmy is derived from James, so it's still technically "naming after."  Lee can just be his middle name, or all his first name and then use the dad's middle name.|`|AA11987492	Tell him that since your son is a seperate being with a seperate identity, you want to give him his own name.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Tell him you're having the kid, you'll name it what YOU want.|`|BA9ymc2Laa	How bout using his name as a middle name for your son?|`|oYmZUO8Caa	You don't HAVE to listen to anyone!

b26Dp8LKaa	I'm assuming your aunt is still alive, yes?  Your best bet would be to talk her to see if she wants to search for her son. You can lend your support & help her search. If she is unwilling, please proceed causiously. Consider her feelings & her reasons for not wanting to search.  <br>  <br>  If she isn't alive, talk to your mom or another aunt or uncle. Enlist their help if possible. Rhode Island allows the siblings of deceased birth parents to initiate contact by mutual consent.<br>  <br>  Then start with what you DO know.  For example, baby boy, born in 19XX, in (City), Rhode Island & adopted in Rhode Island. Include your aunt's statistics.

KG6E8br0aa	Beat like a chicken :(|`|5rp819JVaa	She got brutalized by chris brown.
NgnbtaORaa	Don't cold turkey only never-smokers advise that.  Her doctor, or midwife, should provide your friend with patches, and praise, free of charge she then just needs to follow the stages.  Explain to your friend to stop smoking tobacco it is harming her child!|`|AA10811784	Just quit cold turkey. Her addiction will only harm the baby if she continues to smoke, not when she quits.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	my dr recommended to me that i quit gradually, he said it would creat less stress on me. and less stress on me is less stress on the baby|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I had a friend that did the same thing.. she said it wasn't worth quitting because the withdraw would be bad for the baby.  If that is a worry, I'd suggest cutting back drastically over a matter of 2-3 days.  Get that stuff out of her system as soon as possible!    Goodluck!    Edit: Did she drink before she found out?  That didn't need any cutting back did it?  It is much better to get rid of those bad things while pregnant.  I am glad she is at least trying to stop. I hope it happens soon.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I've always heard stop smoking gradually,that's what my dr told me. He even said though that if smoking is a problem,and you can't stop,don't stress about it too god awful much. If she's not farther than 3 months,I would do it cold turkey. That's what I've always heard. The drs told me if you havent stopped by six months,dont,just stay way way way cut back.|`|vue9NOhYaa	The best way to quit is the way that will ensure that she DOES quit.  Some people have better luck with cold turkey, others cut down and quit gradually over a few weeks/months.|`|vn0DHMXWaa	Smoking really doesn't cause a lot of problems. Tell her to cut down until she no longer feels guilty, and stay at that level - say, a pack a day or less, and her baby will be fine.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	How much does she smoke? If she is a heavy smoker I would cut back slowly. I quit years back before I had kids and I remember how horrible it was!      Remember, even if she cuts her smoking in half while pregnant it will be better. Don't listen to the people who jump all over you and say to just quit cold turkey. They obviously have no idea what it's like to quit!|`|HxGh2oKfaa	Cold turkey.Lighter cigarettes arent any better,|`|TepAZAHyaa	Just quit smoking. Any other reasoning is just an excuse.|`|VGoCh2C9aa	quit straight away. its not as hard as shes making out i used to smoke a lot but i quit as soon as i found out!|`|cjqOUq5xaa	I have heard it both ways. But my dr. told me that stress is the worst thing for you and the baby. She would rather me take a couple drags off a cig then get all stressed out. But Iam not going to argue that it is not good for the baby. But I also think back to when my aunt said she had my cousin-and the dr. sat down on her bed and had a smoke with her right there in the hospital. I would think that it is more of a personal preference.|`|MO2H26XOaa	you should just slow down and eventually quit. because when you quit cold turkey, you are putting stress on your body and thats the worse thing to do. i smoked when i was pregnant, and everything is fine with her. no asthma or anything. just take it slow..tell ur friend good luck with it!|`|8mchLCQhaa	I quit cold turkey and no it will not hurt the baby, her smoking will!|`|34YAS4a0aa	i quit instantly!! it is very bad for the baby to smoke!|`|vYQMuCrQaa	Just quit right away.|`|h85kkDsbaa	Just quit, trying to slow down is so hard|`|AA10781522	I smoked with my second pregnancy. I spoke to my doctor about it and she said quitting cold turkey can create extra added stress to the baby, rather than quit have her gradually smoke.

AA11903503	2T is bigger, it is meant for children who are 2 years (and even up to 3 years). 24 months is for for children who are approaching the age or just past the age. (Based on "average" size/growth).  24 months also has more room in the bottom for diapers, 2T takes on a more fitting size but it is also bigger all over than 24m.  A child will be able to wear 2T for much longer than something 24m.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	2T is bigger- usually after they ahave been two for a couple months- 24 months is a jsut turned two or about to really     my son is 22 months and he's ok in 24 months but 2T is swimming on him|`|vue9NOhYaa	24 months is usually a bit fuller in the seat to allow for the diaper.

Obviously you know the sizes are always accurate for each baby, but that is the general idea.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	In theory 2T is taller and allegedly has less room for a diaper because 2 year olds are potty trained -right?  (Sure I believe that).    I reality I am sure you are away that clothes sizes vary widely between brands and are wacky as far as width to height.    Its pretty sad when I had a 9 month old and a 2.5 year old and I could hold up a size 9-12 month shirt and a 3T shirt on top of each other and not be able to tell the difference|`|AA10754660	nope they are the exact same thing.|`|AA11348933	No, No difference.|`|qZml9VRmaa	Nope, no difference.... :)|`|955YoHvVaa	I thought they were the same size but when I was looking through some clothing for my daughter next winter the 2t were bigger..|`|2ZoUduoPaa	My grandmother owns a children's clothing store and sells handmade clothes.  The diffence in a 24mo and 2T is mostly in the pants/bottoms.  The 24mos is usually about an inch or so bigger in the "seat" to allow for a diaper and usually a tad bit shorter.  Usually the difference is miniscule, but it just depends on the child.    Also, a 24mos is more likely to snap in the crotch than a 2T
eeGN977eaa	"nilk mommy, nilk" Those words still ring in my ears. My daughter got to the point where she was waking up every two hours for nilk (translation "milk")  She too was sleeping in my bed. The thing that I didn't realize is that toddlers are constantly pushing their boundaries and one little problem always turns in to several big problems if you let it.     What we did was re-establish a good bedtime routine. I put her to bed in her room without tv or milk, etc. When she would get up I would quietly bring her back to her room and lay her in bed. When she refused to stay in her room and threw a fit I would hold the door closed for 5 minutes and then give her a hug and put her in her bed. The first two nights were a little difficult but then it got much better. The difference in her temperment after getting a full and restful nights sleep was amazing!    I listed a link below that will give you lots of great tips and ideas. And trust me, you are not the only parent with this problem so don't listen to those who say you are the parent so parent. We all do things that we later regret. Good luck.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Keep a water bottle in his room (or yours). When your son asks for milk, give him the water. If he complains/cries, gently tell him that milk is for daytime. That he can have milk when he wakes up in the morning.  As for sleeping in his own bed. At bedtime, lay him in his bed and sit or lay next to him and read him a story, give him a cuddle and say goodnight. If he cries, just go back in and gently tell him it's bedtime. Also, 2 year old children love to tell people how big they are and love to think of themselves as "big kids". Tell your son that big boys sleep in their own beds and keep praising him for being a big boy when he does go into his bed without crying or complaining. If he comes into your bed, just explain that big boys sleep in their own rooms and lay down next to him until he falls asleep. Stay consistent. Don't let him become distressed or cry by himself and in a week's time he will have gotten used to the routine.  Good luck!|`|rISHTfK3aa	The simple answer to to stop giving him milk at night and to keep putting him back into his own bed at night.|`|z74wSbQoaa	It's not going to be easy, but you just have to be strong.  If you don't want to just stop doing it, maybe you could start with when he wakes up and wants milk, you only give him water.    Make his bed special, maybe get him a radio and play lullabies at bedtime.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	You have to be firm with him. Put him in his bed and tell him he's a big boy and he has to sleep in his bed. He'll fight you but its the only way to break the habit. Its the same thing with the milk, he's use to waking up and getting milk, the only way to stop it is to simply not give it to him. You might feel bad like  you are depriving him but just remember he's not going to die of thirst because he has to wait until morning for a drink nor by sleeping in his room. It will probably be tough to break but worth it in the end.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	Prepare!  Start telling him in the morning that he must brush teeth before bed and he may take a sippy cup of water to bed with him.  Tell him he is a big boy and needs to stay in his own bed and should use the water cup if he is thirsty.  He must not have milk, or anything else that will rot his teeth, at night.      As for the midnight snuggler, while cute, I found it hard to sleep.  I finally bought a small air mattress which fit under our bed.  Our son was allowed to bring a blanket and sleep on the mattress next to us.    It was not ideal, but at least a compromise we could live with.      BTW, if your bedroom door is usually left wide open all the time - CLOSE IT - all the time.  It sends a very important message.  unfortunately my husband was not willing and I was too tired to fight it when my boys were small.  The door is closed now that they are getting older.|`|1XAUxQlDaa	I had the "drinking" problem with my daughter. She also was waking up 3 or 4 times a night wanting something to drink. What I would do for her was get up and give her water. She wouldnt want the water so she would fuss for a little bit and I would sit there and soothe her back to sleep by rubbing her back. I would do this times when she asked for a drink. It would work because she would go back to sleep. It's not easy. Like I said, my daughter fussed. She is also 2.5yrs. But, consistency is what really helps. Being supportive of your child and acknowledging that it's upsetting him but letting him know that he needs to go to sleep or drink water really helps out. Don't just get angry.     Now, for getting him to sleep in his own bed. I would sleep with him in his room a night or 2. Then once he gets used to sleeping in his own bed you will be able to leave him there all night. He will get used to it. Explain to him why he needs to sleep in his own bed. And also, i don't think a cot is too comfortable. I would get him a toddler bed. Or even a twin if you want to go that route. Transitioning them to a bed is very easy and just takes consistency and introducing the bed to them. Letting them play on the bed. Get familiar with it. Starting out slowly with nap times....if he falls asleep in your bed, move him to his. It really works. It just takes consistency. Hope I helped|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Stop giving it to him. You're the parent, you're in control of this. He can't get it himself so the only way he's getting it is if you get it for him. When he sees there's no "reward" for waking at night he'll stop. As for sleeping in his own bed, you're in for a long couple of nights on this one. You put him in his own bed and every time he gets up you put him back there without speaking to him. If you start speaking he will take it as negotiation, which you don't want.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	It will be hell for about a week, but stop giving it to him. His belly will get used to not having it and he'll quit waking up for it. Its good to stop now, too much night time liquid will make it difficult to potty train. If he wakes up and is just sooo thirsty, give him a Little water. Don't give in.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You wait until he grows up a bit more. He is only going to be little the one, short time.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Since when does a 2 year old "REFUSE" to do anything?    You're the parent. Do not allow co-sleeping. Keep putting him back. Stop giving him milk at night. They are smart enough to know to keep asking if they get it.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I agree with the fist answer.  It'll be tough and you may have a few sleepless nights because he'll cry alot, but it's what works best.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I am a spouse....I would be sickened if I found out my husband was sexually attracted to his own flesh and blood. That goes beyond normal in my book. I would be totally fine with him thinking his daughter was beautiful...what dad doesn't think that? but to be sexually attracted to that young of a girl on top of being his own daughter is wrong and disrespectful. I would be more upset if he kept it to himself only because that would tell me he doesn't think there is anything wrong with it. If he told me, I would assume he found it disturbing to him also, and wanted some advice.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	As a parent and spouse, I would find that terribly disturbing.  Most parents think that their children are beautiful, yes, but to say she is "hot"?  No, that doesn't sit well with me.|`|H2IqzG12aa	The bonding mechanism that keeps family members from being physically attracted to each other doesn't always work "full strength" or at all, for one reason or another, but most people don't understand that and take it for granted that anyone who could be turned on by a family member must be immoral or a "monster," but it's purely biology, not morality.      Most mothers would probably be hysterical and throw the poor guy out even if he never had any intentions of making a move on the little heartbreaker.  It's probably well that most spouses under those circumstances don't know about or appreciate the daily battles that their significant other endures keeping desires in check.  This is especially true with step parents, where there is no natural bonding in the first place.    In any case, acknowledging someone's physical beauty doesn't necessarily mean they're actually attracted to them.  My stepson was at an award ceremony for his younger teenage sister and whispered to me, "My God, she is so beautiful!" and I knew he meant it in the purest way.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	eveyone thinks their daughter is beautiful..he just used the wrong word.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	if he just meant she is beautiful as in "my beautiful daughter" like every parent thinks that would be one thing.  but sexually....that is just wrong. i can't even fathom it. i am beyond disgusted and revolted. i can't imagine anyone saying that about their kid even if it was just a joke and they had no intentions with them. so disgusting and disturbing!|`|JpmKtpqmaa	i would feel very uncomortable if my father was sexually attracted to me!!!|`|Y2k81CWWaa	As daughter, I'd be freaked as hell and report him. Even if he didn't do anything, it's just not right...|`|ejJD6BBXaa	i dont think parents should talk ab their kids like that im 18 and i make my family kiss my cheek bc i thinks its unapproate to kiss amy where else|`|ySKK7lCyaa	Spouse: i would be very mad at him and not trust him to be alone with my daughter and make him go see a therapist for it.     Daughter: i would not be alone with my dad, and things would be very awkward between us. I think me and my dads relationship would be down the drain.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	As a spouse who has had a lot of experience with people who were sexually abused, I would divorce him. I know that's not your direction, but I have seen it happen. Being the spouse, I would be afraid of that.    As a daughter (I am still young) I would probably want to disown my father. It's one thing for your father to think that you're beautiful, but quite another for him to find you sexy. And for you to actually find out about this, can you imagine how that would affect your relationships with men for the rest of your life???|`|GEyJMsaKaa	I am a teen daughter. I would find that sickening,and I bet his daughter would too. And I would probably lock my bedroom door every night and avoid him as much as possible. But eww,thats just gross.I see your point :S|`|7SKVCPcSaa	its one thing to say that in high school, jokingly.. but this is his daughter. he had sex with his wife and made that little girl! i mean, its one thing to say that you know your daughter/son is attractive. my MIL is always telling me that my husband (her son obviously) is sexy.. but i know she is saying it to make me happy! i know she thinks he is a good looking guy, etc. but i know she isn't SEXUALLY attracted to him..    your friend.. now he is SEXUALLY attracted to his daughter to the point where i wouldn't doubt he has thought about her during sex. an that is creepy.     if i found out my dad was sexually attracted to me.. thats relationship would be over. my step-dad told me i was sexy one time.. haven't seen the man since and that was 3 years ago.. but he and my mom recently split up so i don't have to deal with him anymore..     and if i knew my husband was sexually attracted to any of our children i would get a divorce and push for supervised visitation!  i'm a spouse and a daughter.|`|sXeyRD9taa	If I found out that my dad was sexually attracted to me, I would be scared! even if he's joking around it's still not cool. Now if he says "my daughter is good looking" then I would take it as a compliment from my dad. But if he's saying "She's hot! admit it" I would be SCARED. Usually if a dads friend says that his daughter was hot, he would get mad. But your friend is saying "Admit it"?       Just tell him it's okay to think you have an attractive daughter all parents should think that, but saying that your daughter is hot hands down! that's weird|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	Everyone is overreacting to this. The guy isn't sexually attracted to his daughter, he is bragging to his friend that she is beautiful and is proud of her.     God, did you guys really think that he wants to have sex with him daughter?|`|7df573746dd6a85c2a8f383acdd3aefbaa	I would be pissed!  That's very disgusting!  I'm sorry but now I think your friend is a pedo.   DISGUSTING!  I hope he isnt sexually abusing his daughter.|`|dlAVbLtDaa	yuck|`|oUm2Nzi6aa	As a 17 year old girl and I would be totally and utterly disgusted. Honestly, that's about the creepiest thing I've read on yahoo answers. I hope my dad doesn't think I'm hot!!!|`|PExOJJLgaa	I'm a daughter, and personally, your father SHOULD NOT think of you in that way.  I'd feel so uncomfortable and my mother would not like it too much--( UNDERSTATEMENT)    i would feel so embarassed but mad that my father is basically a pedophile.  your father should be the one to tell you..    "pull your shirt up." or "that skirt is too short."    he shouldnt be the one ENJOYING IT.    that's just wrong.|`|winmjHAmaa	I am a daughter :)  I believe men (whether related to you or not) think that way.  I don't think it's super weird, unless of course they act on it.  He probably told you because you are his best friend.  If he would tell other ppl, that would be weird.  My dad tells me all the time that he thinks I'm beautiful, I don't take it the wrong way.  Saying your daughter is hot is a little different, but you said you're close so....    It's a fine line there.....    As long as you don't think he would do anything, I wouldn't worry about it.  Again, guys are made that way.  Doesn't matter who it is, they are made that way.        I would be more upset as the wife, with him talking about who is hot!  :)      EDIT:  Okay ppl, "sexy" and "hot" are two different words.  "Hot" means physically attractive nowadays.  The man didn't say "sexy."  That would be disgusting.  But he didn't say that.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Whoa!   Okay Ill steer clear of what you want me to.    My daughter is 7 so at this point, that pig would be loooong gone and not permitted to see her.  Thinking of her as a teen, I would be horrified. Im not sure exactly how I would react. I suppose he should keep it to himself, sepcifically if he hasnt and dosnt plan on touching her. Thinking your 17yo daughter could stop traffic because she's gorgeous is not quite the same as having the hots for her or thinking about what it would be like to "be" with her.  Gee, but, Im not a dad, so I dont know.    When I was a teen, Im sure my dad thought I was a catch, but with boys my own age. he never tried anything on me nor told me I was hot or sexy, never! Id be disgusted if I found out now,though.|`|5NhartQ3aa	I would be PISSED if my boyfriend said that about my daughter (which would be his stepdaughter) and we have one on the way, if it's a girl and he said that, I would be SO hurt and confused!  If I found out that my father said that about me when he was out drinking with a buddy, I think I would throw up and I would not be comfortable around him.  I had an uncle make comments when I was about 14 and I found out a few years later, I was so disgusted and I didn't want to be around him anymore.|`|a5hkW9Mxaa	as a daughter i would feel insecure/awkward around my dad if he told me that he was aroused by me, this is different then saying that i'm beautiful *which i think all dads should tell their daughters regularly* but i would probably start locking my bedroom door everynight and wear more baggy clothes to bed, and maybe more often if i was going to be spending more time with him.    I mean think about that in reverse. if the daughter thought that her dad was hot and 'wanted' him. that is just wrong. but it is different because she really doesn't have the power to 'do anything' against his will - but he does.|`|AA12115728	Actually, I think that these thoughts go through more minds that we know, but no one talks about or acts on it, because it's taboo.      And it should be taboo.  The fact that your friend's tongue was loosened with a few drinks makes me think he is less inhibited, and makes me fear for his daughter's psychological safety.  What if he has a drink or two at home, and then starts to talk about her in this manner?  Your buddy needs to seek counseling.|`|JOQJwcR6aa	This is a weird question...but i gave it some thought...if you think about it if the child looks like the person you slept with in order to make this child wouldn't that only make you attracted to a younger version of that adult??? yes it is very disgusting.. but my dad is always saying how my older sister looks like my mother his attracted to my mother so wouldn't that make him attracted to her as well?? it's too much of a touchy subject...but i think everyone how has children think their children are hot how can you not if the look just like you...or what it be wrong to say my dad is hot when i look just like him??? i would say that my dad is hot but i wouldn't sleep with him....and i think that's where everyone is taking it instead of thinking of the question at hand their thinking about incest....|`|m3rsLUgDaa	i think Dave87gn has it right, everyone thinks their children are beautiful but he said it wrong, people cant help who they find attractive it doesn't mean he thinks anything, he just appreciates that she is an attractive girl. i wouldn't be pleased to learn that of my child's father (in fact id probably would be very disturbed if it was said he is SEXUALLY attracted, that is a very different word you said you asked him "who do you think is really hot" so that to me means really pretty like major, but not sexually (ok i admit that's normally what it means but maybe he just meant hot as in VERY attractive but not as far as sexually)|`|FO0XWRDeaa	I'm a daughter  1.) Slap my dad  2.) Cuss him out  3.)Convince my mom to divorce him  And even if it was meant to be a joke, it still was crossing the line, and really disgusting.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	I believe its ok to know that your child is attractive but to talk about your own child with a sexual context is inappropriate. That actually makes me very uncomfortable just thinking about it. If i found out my  husband thought of my child as sexy or Hott, i think id be very uncomfortable leaving him with her if im not there.. I don't know that's rough.. I have a son and i think he a very handsome boy but i wouldn't even start to think of him in that way, i mean hes my baby.. most parents look at their children and still see them as a little baby.. If i found out my Daddy was sexually attracted to me id be very uncomfortable around him.. it would gross me out then id question things that he may have done with me. like is he holding my hand so i wont get lost or what.. man that's nasty....|`|9CUaikUEaa	if my dad was sexually attracted to me i would freak, and not talk to him. but if he just said i was hot then i'd be fine with that.|`|7ePjzDZTaa	omg!  NASTY|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	as a daughter, i'd be totally disgusted by my father if he felt that.  my father compliments me on how i look when we (the family) get dressed up to go out, but it's always a fatherly compliment.  i wouldn't be able to be around my father if he felt/acted the way your friend.  it's one thing to recognize that your child is attractive but another to make those kinds of comments.  i know fathers who stop their daughters from dressing a certain way because of the rude attention that comes with it.|`|0zjrVM8Naa	that is really inbred  just saying|`|kMevVPiYaa	Man, Im sorry but that is just weird. I would definitely talk to your friend on this matter man. He may have been drunk, but if he was at all serious then lets just wrong. Its called incest. It could cause problems, and cause her emotion and HOPEFULLY NOT but physical damage. He needs to be sat down and talked to. As his best friend he should listen to you or at least consider the advise you give him.|`|FERfSYtzaa	ok first of all i am a daughter of a man and if i were to find out about this i would feel very uncomfortable. I think that it is very disrespectful to your wife if she would ever finds out that you are thinking this and if people were to ever found out about this thst's more problems on your relationship with your wife and daughter. man i think that's just sick of you to think that i know3 this is somewhat of human nature but DAMN what the hell is wrong with you.. i mean are you serious!!|`|gFldqybSaa	First off, you never know, he could have already sexually abused her and he just isn't telling. Personally, this is effed' up. He's worst then a pedo seeing this is incest. I would be really scared if that was me.|`|tudie6lvaa	Thats just nasty.|`|BcXHz47Paa	I am  a "Shrink"- So many men displace their wife with their daughter. When this happens it due to the daughter wanting to compete with the dad for the wife's place in the home and the man's mid-life insecurity. Chances are the girl is undermining mom. These girls typically cling to calling the father "daddy" long after its appropriate( like 10 years old). Its a manipulation, this man is one step above kiddy porn- Get some counseling.  Get the princess a job and quit looking.
DRb4Qlypaa	It could be a lot of other things. If it is bad, you should go to the doctor or the hospital if you can't get in to your doctor.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	A pregnancy test is only $5-10, free at certain county clinics for under the age of 18.|`|8mchLCQhaa	You are crazy for having sex at 16. I hope you are not pregnant. You are just a kid.|`|O2B4oGJvaa	Have you had sex?  Cause if you have your probably pregnant|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	It's possible but as mentioned it could be other things as well.    You can continue to have periods while pregnant.  A friend of mine had hers up until she was 7 months preg w/ one of her kids.  Also, some people have what seems like a light period around when they are supposed to have their period, but its really implantation bleeding.    You could always test.  2 packs run 7-10 $ & up.  I have also heard the ones at the Dollar Store work just as well (and would be even cheaper).
a3MSSvdcaa	Depends on the severity of her heart disease.  She may be perfectly fine, but she may also have to be put on bed rest or things like that.  It's best to talk to her doctor first to make sure her heart can even handle her getting pregnant.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends. They would probably monitor her closely. Certain heart medications are not recommended in pregnancy, though, so you really need to ask her OB.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	She should speak to a doctor about it.  My brother's fiance has heart problems and her doctor said it is perfectly fine for her to have children.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Depends on the disease. But pregnancy raises your blood pressure, so yes, it could cause problems suck as preeclampsia, etc.|`|jXZeoPAwaa	i would speak to a doctor or that to put your mind at rest
lwlZMhiqaa	Yes this is normal.  I did not have morning sickness at all during my pregnancy. So after my extreme sleepiness wore off by about my 10th week I just didn't feel pregnant.  And I asked numerous questions on here about that lol. In a few weeks you will start to feel movement and then you will feel pregnant, trust me! You can start to feel movement from 16-22 weeks on average. Good luck & Congrats!|`|KdqaGnlwaa	Most pregnancy symptoms start to fade away once you hit your second trimester.  Unless you are cramping and bleeding, then I wouldn't worry too much.|`|gdnL63ngaa	Totally normal.
AA10147946	I would usually assume the doctor knows best, but that is odd.<br>  <br>  Most doctors will recommend you start taking prenatals while you are trying to conceive.  It doesn't hurt, and the folic acid is most needed during the very early weeks of pregnancy, when most women don't even know they are pregnant yet.  I would recommend she make sure first with her doctor, but then go get some OTC, and start taking them.|`|miPubuDYaa	No, Its not really normal. Her insurance might not cover percribtion pre-nats (like mine doesn't) So maybe he just assumed that she would get over the counter.<br>  <br>  Tell your sister to go to her drug store in the vitamin aisle there are pre-nats. I take both a pre-nat and Expecta. I've been taking the vitamins since i was 3 weeks 5 days and the Expecta since i was 10 weeks  pregnant.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Dr's don't always  prescribe them; mine never did.  You can get them over the counter; I did.  Some women don't take them and their baby's turn out ok, so they're not necessary, but it is a good idea to take them.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	she should have took folic acid for the first 12 weeks and after that i am not sure as i did not need any extra vitamins.|`|rK5tFAuMaa	That's not normal. When people are even planning a pregnancy, their doctor typically prescribes them prenatals. She should ask her doctor and if he still does not listen I would tell your sister to look for another doctor because it's obvious your sister and the baby's best interest is not with the doctor.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	not all doctors will write a prescription, but he still should have mentioned it. That doesn't seem like a very good doctor. Anyway, there are several that she can buy without a prescription. She should go to Walgreens and talk to someone behind the pharmacy counter, and they can help her make an informed decision.|`|evfYoiFoaa	she needs to ask for prenatal vitamins. i was 6 weeks when i started prenatal vitamins. but they say you should start even before you get pregnant. my doctor still wants me taking my prenatal vitamins until they are all gone and i had my son a week ago. =]|`|XRX6vKNmaa	She should have already been on prenatal vitamins. Her doctor may think she is already on them, so she needs to mention it on her next appointment. They have chewable ones called natachew if she cant take pills.|`|nsBhWisHaa	All women should take prenatal vitamins at least 1 year before trying to conceive...the folic acid builds up preparing the body for a healthier pregnancy and birth.|`|24qsYeGaaa	I got put on them as soon as I found out. I would tell her to switch providers and if the baby comes out and there is something wrong with it, I would sue the doctor.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	no that is not normal.. i would tell her to start taking some.. usually women who are planning a pregnancy start taking prentals before they even conceive.|`|TNx6Kdf9aa	She should have gotten a prescription for them at her first OB appointment. <br>  I always took the over the counter ones.  My dr said that was fine.<br>  <br>  She should get on them as soon as possible.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Before you get pregnant is when you start.  That's not normal, but they don't usually prescribe them they just ascertain that you are taking them and tell you to continue.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	She should have been taking them as soon as she found out she was pregnant. Maybe she should ask her doctor about it or go to the nearest pharmacy and buy some, they do have over the counter ones that she can take, her pharmacists will help her pick out which type is best for her.
zCqtnImUaa	I think that if they got infected it would not be good for the baby. I personally would wait till after the baby is born just to be extra safe. But if you feel it's okay, then it probably is.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	<a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5Ek0Z5JHNIAWu5XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEydmpmM2ZtBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDOARjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0Y4MjJfOTE-/SIG=11mn8gtjl/EXP=1235231396/**http%3a//wiki.answers.com/Q/FAQ/2182">http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu5Ek0Z5JHN...</a>|`|LX41AjMHaa	If your old enough to get pregnant your old eough to get yours ears pierced.<br>  <br>  (In answer Yes, you can get yours ears pierced, lol)|`|NO4mktI8aa	yes you can get your ears pierced.|`|zSABr7praa	I think hepatitis and other diseases contracted through needles are the primary concern.  Generally, they use new earrings and a piercing gun, but I would just wait until the baby came.  It's only a few months!|`|hswTS1jVaa	Yes, why not.  Your ears have nothing to do with pregnancy.
pp9RzHvDaa	I tested the morning I was due for my period and got a super dark positive!  Good luck!
ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You may damage ligaments and stuff. I don't think it would be very safe for you or the baby. It will also probably make pregnancy a lot harder!|`|F3BRG72iaa	i dont think so but you can hurt yourself by tearing a ligament or something.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	no, but you might hurt your back|`|hswTS1jVaa	No probably not.
OI3bf4yjaa	About? How do you expect people to help you if we don't know the specifics?|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Can't really answer this unless I know a little more. Sorry.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Need a little more info than that, hon.|`|iwUInpC1aa	Talking about 'WHAT'!|`|yKS2UI87aa	We need alittle more info please|`|ARmhMq5laa	okayy..we need a little more detail
ZNhP3mpUaa	very very SLIGHT chance, but most likely not. if you're going to get this scared hun, maybe you're not ready to be having sex.|`|sdtqTbmoaa	a very very small chance of it..but it happens. me and hubby were using condoms and it happend. the only way to not get pregnant is to not have sex..yea hubby would love that one... or double up on protection such as pill and condom.|`|reLPODK9aa	Nothing is 100% accurate except for having no sex at all. The next best thing is to use 2 different forms of birth control together.
bUkwtZghaa	He sounds like he may not have been ready to wean.  He needs the comfort even if there is no milk or anything.  I would offer him a blankie and a cuddle and just keep telling him that num nums are gone.  <br>  I think you may be okay with the baby.  What will probably happen is he will ask if he can nurse and what I would do is let him try and most kids figure out that they don't remember how and then will get over it.  Where as if you say no repeatedly and he sees baby nursing, he will keep nagging and feel badly that you won't let him.  Most kids forget how to nurse and he won't remember why he liked it before.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: The previous posters (most of them at least) seem to know nothing about extended breastfeeding and sound like close minded formula feeders to me.  I think it is cruel to yank a comfort away from a child (like breastfeeding) just because he has a birthday.  Oh, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recomends nursing until AT LEAST two years old or preferably as long as mutually acceptable.  Google Child Led Weaning.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	as a nurse I can tell you a lot of mothers have this issue if they breast feed past a year old. I had four children myself and stopped breast feeding when first tooth was cut for each, only because I did not want to deal with this issue and after first tooth they should be learning to drink from sippy cup anyway.  As bottle and breastfeeding can coat their teeth and ruin enamel. <br>  <br>  When you have you new baby you will have a 2 probably 3 yr old by them who will want to breastfeed again you need to be patient and strong and tell him that the milk is for the baby and be sure when baby is sleeping to spend extra time focusing on him and spending time with him to avoid jealousy. also to help with this I would enlist your husband as a mother of 4 kids it is very important that you include you older one. And reassure him he is loved just as much and tell him stories about all the cool things he will be able to do with a brother or sister when they baby is a little older. Good Luck|`|cHROCt3Aaa	I nursed my daughter for about 14-15 months. She was just ready to quit. She still sticks her hands down my shirt and squeezes my boob randomly. I don't get onto her for it, in public I just kind of shoo her hand away. <br>  People think that breasts are for sexual use and thoughts only. Well, they fed my baby for over a year. The most natural thing in the world.<br>  I have talked to other mothers who nursed and their kids do the same thing.|`|AA12190977	so for medical reasons you had to breastfeed until he was 2. fine. but now that he's off the boob, keep him off it. don't let him put his hand in your shirt. you're encouraging his behavior if you continue to let it go on. be firm with the child|`|d162f121edc74fbff5dcd0d3373d75e6aa	Someone I know has knitted 'boobies' that she gave her toddler to cuddle... a bit bizarre maybe, but it worked for her?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	this is the problem with extended breastfeeding..the kid remembers and it's a habit so they want it....don't even let him hold your breast anymore..you must get him used to the idea of being off the breast and when his new sibling comes do not let him join in...he's had his time and now it's time for baby. once kids can eat real food there is absolutely no need for breastfeeding except for comfort and there are better ways to teach him to comfort himself or to seek comfort from mommy. Unless there are medical reasons like above then there is no real need to breastfeed that long...he needs to learn other ways of comfort.<br>  <br>  breastfeeding if for babies and he is a big boy now. I don't care what the studies say...not in the least.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	He won't if you keep giving in to him!  It's OK to say NO to your kid!  Why on earth were you breastfeeding him when he was more than old enough to hold a cup?  If you still wanted him on breast milk you could have put it in a cup!  I think it messes your kid up when you treat them like a baby long after they should be!  Just say NO and put him to bed, if he has to cry a few nights to get over it, so be it, but you need to MAKE him get over it!|`|EMKuBql8aa	Well, this is a hard one. You obviously don't want jealousy issues with the new baby. I suggest somehow replacing that kind of comfort with something else. A blanket, a stuffed animal something of that sorts. Introduce it by having him hold that also while cuddling to sleep, so after a couple weeks, he will get the idea of "when I hold this, I am comforted" Also, have you tried putting him to bed with a sippy cup with warm milk in it? Not the same thing obviously, but it could simulate the warmness of breast milk.<br>  <br>  As for those other people, ignore them, they obviously are going by what society dictates not The World Health Organization.|`|VKLyDiQ7aa	My mom breastfed my little sister until she was almost three.  She was a really sickly baby for medical reasons and the comfort and nutrition of "nummies" was great for her.<br>  <br>  She is normal now at 5, so don't worry (also, I'm actually not young - I'm about 2 decades older than my sister lol).  Every kid is different.  If it bothers you, just be firm with him.  He will be ok in a couple weeks.  Since it has been so long, I would advise to cut him off.  Yes, he may cry himself to sleep, and it is heartbreaking, but there is nothing you can do, and he will be fine in a couple days.  As another person suggested, give him something like a blanket to cuddle.  Or maybe try a glass of milk before bed?|`|I2iNfYCyaa	He can still have..if he wants it let him have it and let him do it until he decides he does not want to do it anymore. I don't think he'll be jealous..at all.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	Aww, poor guy! Sounds like he really wasn't ready to wean, and of course his "lovey" is the thing that brought him such comfort- nothing odd about that! Yes, eventually he will outgrow it. You can gently wean him by saying that your breasts are really sensitive but he can touch your arm or belly instead. Will he want to nurse again? Possibly. It's up to you whether to let him try (and likely fail since once they stop nursing they quickly lose memory of how to properly suckle) or perhaps express a bit of milk into a cup. Play up his "big bro" role- get him a present for becoming a big bro, and let him pick out something for his new baby bro/sis. Allow him to help you as much as possible (bring dipes/wipes- that sort of thing) so he feels involved, and knows how proud you are of him. It's the jealousy factor that would have made me tandem nurse if my IUD had failed. LOL <br>  <br>  GL!<br>  <br>  Oh, and for the "nurse" who weans at the first tooth- seriously, how can you go against the recommendations of your profession? That just wows me. My daughter's first tooth erupted at 3 months- that's far too early to wean! And breastmilk, fresh breastmilk does NOT cause tooth decay. The only studies I have seen saying that it does were with stored, frozen bm on rats. Breastmilk does not pool in the mouth when a baby is actively nursing, and actually has chemicals that inhibit decay.
KyFCYs0Yaa	I miscarried last August when I was 7 weeks pregnant. I have 2 older children and had perfect pregnancies with them so this was a big shock. I found out I was pregnant again 4 weeks after I found out I miscarried. I never had a period, and I am 27 weeks now. It has been different this time than with my first two. I am much more aware of every twinge and movement. It got a lot easier when I could feel the baby move. I am sure everything will be fine with your baby. Call your OB and ask if they can get you in for an ultrasound if for nothing else, your peace of mind. also if you are really stressing about it, get a doppler thing to hear the baby's heartbeat! (You probably won't be able to hear it for a few weeks yet though).<br>  Good Luck, and try to think positive! I know it is very hard though. You are in my prayers!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I have had 4 miscarriages and when I got pregnant last time I was petrified! Hubby wanted to buy baby clothes etc and tell people but I shut myself away and was over analyzing every little cramp, movement etc, then I had some bleeding, we went to the hospital and I was sure I was going to mc again, the lady who did the ultrasound wasn't allowed to tell me anything and I just layed in the bed very upset, then she just looked at me and said I can get in trouble for this but I will just say that everything looks good. I was discharged with a "Threatened miscarriage" and went on to had a healthy baby boy who is now 4!<br>  I't hard to not think you will miscarry but trust me, it's better to try to get through it and live everyday positively.<br>  <br>  You will be fine :o)<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	The first time this happened with a miscarriage   it was unfortunately not  meant to be.It's a sad thing to have happen and very hard to get over,you are not having any symptoms like last time,just relax and think good thoughts.I am sure u will be fine,check this out with your Doctor with any concerns that you have.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	i had similar situation, have miscarriage when i was like 5 weeks or so, i freaked out, couple months later i got pregnant again and now i am 23 weeks pregnant! just because you had one doesn't mean you will have it again, it's all normal, please relax nd be positive, don't over think about it just let it happen, i am sure things will be alright, wish you best of luck|`|VHgfWPS2aa	That happened to me twice , its called a chemical pregnancy , very sad , !<br>  You will be fine this time I know its hard but just try not to think about it even tho its every pregnant women worst fear and we all think about it , You will be fine just take it easy and enjoy your pregnancy , congrats<br>  <br>  EDIT : I was bleeding very bad at 13 weeks for this pregnancy and everything is fine , bleeding does not always mean the worst|`|P1xlrvAaaa	1st of all congrats!!!!!If you have no bleeding and such you should be fine.I think it is totally normal for you to be scared that history might repeat it's self but relax you should be fine.After you see the heartbeat you only have a 20%risk of a miscarriage!|`|dpMssGdnaa	Yes I miscarried twice by my third pregnancy my doctor did additional blood work and found out that my blood coagulates and that was basically killing my babies so he prescribed blood thiners and I now have a beautiful 9 month old|`|UHTcpdkVaa	It happened to us last year too.  Now we are 2 weeks further along than last time and everything seems to be going very smoothly.  You (probably already heard this a thousand time) need to take the idea that it failed for a reason - maybe it would have been deformed or something - and that if nature does it right this time, then it will do it right.<br>  <br>  That said, we aren't nearly as attached to this one as the last one.  It's a coping mechanism for sure.  We are pretty much awaiting the ultrasound this time before we start flipping out again.  The thing I hated worse was telling everyone we lost it more than actually losing it... that sucked.<br>  <br>  I wish you the absolute best of luck.
ce9d609b58380ee151ad9021694da085aa	Ignore the people who are posting ill words.  You are a mother and asking advice and should not be criticized for it.   I agree, that if it goes on too long, yes, you need to take your daughter to the doctor.  But there is nothing wrong with trying to resolve an issue like diaper rash through the advice of other mothers.<br>  <br>  My sister's son had a similiar thing.  She did all the advice I have seen listed below.   I thought the same as others.  Let him air dry, specific creams, soaks, etc.<br>  <br>  Turns out he was allergic to a large quantity of things and at the time it was being introduced through her breast milk.  As your daughter is 11 months old, it's likely it's something that you have recently added to her diet, or change in wipes, soaps or detergents.<br>  <br>  If all the at home remedies don't work... and you do end up going to the doctors... talk to your doctor about possible allergic reactions.  Keep a record of what your daughter has been eating.  Omit any new items you have recently given your daughter.  When introducing new foods, limit the new things to one a week. At this point, you may need an antibotic to clear it up. And then have an allergy test performed.  You would be surprised at what some foods do to a growing child who have allergies to them.<br>  <br>  Please check out the link below regarding allergies & diaper rash.  There are so many different factors that only you, the mother can add up and then find the best solution to treat your daughter.<br>  <br>  Good luck and good job for seeking others advise!|`|ZPYZQxjkaa	Wash her in clear tepid water, no soap. Let her air dry before you put on a diaper. If you're using cloth diapers stop and get disposables.<br>  <br>  I would use a hydrocortisone cream on it but only after you've washed her with clear water and make sure she's good and air dried.<br>  <br>  nEXT give her frequent tepid bathes. Don't pat dry just air dry. Who cares if she pees. She needs her diaper changed way more often than usual. Alo as best you can the hydrochortisone cream will help numb the area.<br>  <br>  Baby powder repels water/urine too.<br>  I wouldn't wait too long to get the doc to check her out.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Give her a good soak in a warm bath with baking soda in the water. It won't sting her skin, so don't worry about that. Then pat her dry really well and use a generous amount of a zinc-oxide based cream. I prefer Sudocrem, it comes in a gray tub with a red and white label. It works really well on my little guy.<br>  <br>  Give her the bath every day and the cream at every changing and you should see it clear up in a couple of days. Be generous with the baking soda, pick it up at a bulk store if you can. But don't put so much in the water that you can't see through the water.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your little baby's bottom :)|`|uLdeIhHqaa	If it has open wounds/sores its time to head to the Pediatrician for a prescribed ointment. Its now to the point where its not going to heal properly without prescribed ointment. Nothing over the counter is going to work any longer, in fact it could be agitating it and making it worse. <br>  <br>  Diaper Rashes hurt! So, please, take your Daughter to the Ped before it gets any worse. Don't make her suffer any longer than she has too. <br>  <br>  Hope it gets better really soon!|`|18AOjbgYaa	Don't use baby wipes. Very gently use soft washcloths, like those really soft baby wash cloths, and only water. No soap. allow the area to air dry, like at least five minutes. Make sure she's dry, then put a and d ointment on it. let her be without a diaper as much as possible, But look, it could be a yeast infection too, so if it's that bad I would take her to the doctor .One of my kids had that and I thought it was just a bad diaper rash.<br>  Just saw the additional details........ take her to the doctor soon.|`|J4YNRrsuaa	ok i just went through this, and it went iaway in 2 days..it was severe also and he had diarhea. heres what i did...<br>  <br>  sat him in baby oil with warm water for about 15 min once a day<br>  .<br>  kept his diaper off for atleast 45 min after every changing.<br>  <br>  applied A&D ointment or vaseline (ALOT OF IT) with every diaper change<br>  <br>  That was all i did and it started clearing up right away, and is now gone|`|B1xrI9ZYaa	My daughter had the same thing almost the same age and i called the dr and they said that it was a yeast infection and that they wanted me to bring her in to make sure that it was and sure enough it was and they prescribe some kind of cream that you can put on it and it goes away within in a couple days i used the stuff even after it went away. i would call the dr and tell them what you have wrote down and they should say the same thing.|`|iXxMgMCmaa	Hi Have you tried diaper rash creams, baby powered? or corn startch also alot of time doctor office have a nurse that can help you over the phone without you needing to come in for an apt.|`|qIWUC1Ceaa	I know you may not believe me but the doctor will so nothing. I know i have taken my kids to the docs tooo many times for diaper rash. The best thing you can do is wash the baby with only water every time it poops. No wipes or soap just plain luke warm water. Let it's but dry out for at least 5 minutes or use a cool blow dryer to dry up the skin. Blow  dryer is best, gets it nice and dry,and my babies have all loved it. Then coat it with stuff called pinxav. It is the best stuff i have ever used, and the only thing i have found to work with all four of my kids, and i have tried just about everything on the market. People swear by butt paste but for some reason it burns my kidos butts so bad and they are in pain when i use it. After using the pixav put on a thick coating of cornstarch or corn starch baby pwder. Make sure to catch poops right away and get them washed off. Don't expect results overnight it may take a few days, but this always works for me. My babies have gotten the open wound and bleeding diaperrash before and this does the trick in a few days. Give it a try i promise it will work. You have to ask your pharmasist for the pinxav it is not sold on the shelves. I get mine from walgreens behind in the pharmacy, but it is not perscription. You may have to call around to different pharmacies to find it, not sure where you live. It is not expensive either, same cost as desitin maybe cheaper.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinxav.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinxav.com/</a>|`|h59Bc4wfaa	If your little one has open wounds on her bum that means she has had a rash way too long and NEEDS to be seen by a doctor. It might not even be a diaper rash, it could be a yeast infection, and for that she needs a scrip that only her doctor can order.<br>  <br>  Please take her to the doc, if you had open wounds on your bum would you not be going to the doc for it? Do for your daughter the same as you would do for yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope she feels better soon~|`|I2iNfYCyaa	There are several ointments you can use I think that will help. Miconastole and Mustela I heard are really good for rashes...mustela can help prevent diaper rashes too. Flanders diaper rash cream is good too :) Desatin, corn starch and even a oatmeal bath works well too. If none of those work for some reason (though I'm sure all those will help), I'd def take her to the pediatrician, who might order a prescribed cream that'll be helpful. Good luck!|`|aYCjy8Neaa	My doctor told me to put a little bit of vinegar in the bathtub and let them sit in it. I never tried it with my little guy because I always thought it would burn. If its bumped up and really red, and you can't get rid of it with diaper rash cream then it may be a yeast infection. My little guy used to get them on his butt alot, and we needed a prescription to get rid of it. Within a couple applications of the ointment it went away. So give it a few days, and if no improvement call the doctor.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I agree with military Sudocrem is a fantastic cream. When my baby had nappy rash I used to try and leave her nappy off as much as possible. You could start potty training her she wouldnt need a nappy on all the time then anyway.I know its young before anybody says anything but it is possible|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	PLEASE take your daughter to the doctor!  You have let this go on way to long for it to result in small open sores. You should be ashamed!<br>  <br>  Added: I gave you advice....<br>  TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  and yes you should be ashamed to let that little girls butt get in such  bad shape that she has sores. If I knew where you lived I would call child protective services on you....next!|`|c73QkZ2haa	If my childs butt had open sores on it and was bleeding i would be going to the doctors. She could have an infection.<br>  <br>  You said open sores so i assumed. She has blisters on her butt? Did you give her citrus? How long has she had the rash?<br>  <br>  Dont give her anymore citrus give her some water and a warm bath and dont use baby wipes they can make it worse alot worse and let her air dry poo and pee can be cleaned up just try to keep her in one area. If she has it for more than a week you absolutely need to see a doctor cause she may have a yeast infection. But she may also be reacting to the citrus. We use a cream callled Penaten but honestly just go to the store and find the one that has the highest concentration of zinc because thats what it is and the one with the highest conc is gonna work the best. Always helps to have a bit more information :)
aLAmvX5Naa	The best way you can be a parent to a teen parent is teach her real world skills and show her the real cost of life. Make her get a job now while she is pregnant. Allow her to go out once a month with her friends for free and charge her normal babysitting rates if she wants to go out more. It may seem unfair but she needs to realize what the real world is like.<br>  <br>  Let her know as long as she is the one getting up at night to feed the baby, she is the one preparing the bottles, she is the one changing the diapers then she can have more say in how things are done. If she is using you as a nanny then you have say on how things are done.<br>  <br>  Show her how to do laundry and make her do her own laundry and her child's laundry. Show her how to use a screwdriver and make her assemble the crib. Show her how to vacuum the floor and make her keep her room clean and safe. The baby can't be crawling around on dirty clothes with jewelry laying around everywhere. <br>  <br>  When the bills come, show them to her. Obviously a teen shouldn't have to pay for the electric or the tv or internet but she needs to know how much they cost. Let her know that in addition to rent she will have bills like this when she moves out on her own. You have to de-glamourize any fantasies she may have about how life will be when shes on her own in a couple years. Take her to the grocery store every week and have her be an active part in the shopping.|`|207dFmdHaa	my best friend is going thru this right now, her 17 year old daughter had a baby 5 months ago.....the best advice she can give is to talk to your daughter....ask what she expects, tell her what you expect...my friend and her husband moved their daughter out of her room and into their guest bedroom that had a bath.....they put the baby bed in there with her along with a rocker.....she is in charge of everything for her and the baby, her mother and father help her when asked.....her mother said it was rough not stepping in and doing, but you have to close your door and let your daughter try...pre birth classes are a must, most hospitals offer them, they teach diapering, suggestions on breastfeeding, feeding, all baby stuff.....their daughter finished high school, and works part time, she is going to start college in the fall....her mother and father only babysit at night occasionally....other friends and relatives help out when she has to work....or she hires a babysitter. THey also have a family meeting once a week, if anything is bothering any of them, things like that, they also have set a goal for all of them....their daughters goal is to stay with her parents until she finishes college. She was lucky to have a grandmother who is paying her college, at the local state college. The babys father wanted nothing to do with the baby until he saw her. Now his parents are helping with babysitting and even bought her a car to get to school and  work.....good luck...it is very tough, but people have been getting thru it forever......if you have other children at home, be honest, get them involved|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	I would have her get a part time job after the baby is born to help support the baby if she's going to keep it.  That will teach her to be responsible for her child and she will be able to finish high school.  As for college, you'll have to cross that bridge when you get there.  Night classes are great when it comes to college as well as community colleges.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Let her try to calm the baby first, but when she gets frustrated, help her out!<br>  <br>  Encourage her in what she decides to do... Formula or breast, epidural or natural, circumcision or not.<br>  <br>  You need to sit down and discuss how you both want to handle everything.... My mom agreed that if I think she's parenting (not grand parenting) too much, I just have to say "thanks for raising me so well. please let me raise my son how I see fit."|`|AA11828121	Ignore the RUDE comments....<br>  <br>  I think that she's going to need your guidance to an extent, maybe let her know what you're feeling and tell her to inform you when you're crossing the line. It's better to learn from experience than a book...|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	Adult decisions require adult actions.

But anyway! Too late to do anything about it now. Love her and guide her.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Be there for your daughter but make sure she is taking the responsibility of her own child. If your daughter is having trouble performing a task for her child than you can step in and explain how she should do it and just help her understand before she gives birth you should explain how it was like when you were pregnant with her and all the things you felt and how it was like when she came into the world. However do not sugar coat anything I am sure you faced your ups and downs with having a child so explain that all to her.<br>  <br>  As for books there are quite a few that can be helpful for your daughter.

XDp8q0uLaa	I would say there is a very good chance your not pregnant.  Not 100% but I would be comfortable saying 99% chance your not pregnant.  Sounds like this scare has weighed heavy on you....none of us are perfect, don't beat yourself up over it.  I wish you the best of luck!!|`|imIiuaAAaa	It's unlikely that you're pregnant, but some women do get their regular periods all throughout their pregnancy...test in a few weeks to be sure, and be careful next time ;]|`|eytlIKITaa	No, you're not pregnant.|`|vigFmfLmaa	You could possibly be an astronaut but my guess to that too would be no.  Why would you think you're pregnant if you had your period?  And why is it so hard to use a freaking condom?|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I would be very very shocked if you were, sine you have had a period, no, but sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days, and if you ovulate with in that time frame (unlikely) then yes you could.  You can get pregnant anytime you have sex.  But I would guess no, you are not pregnant.|`|B7iSU8UYaa	If you had unprotected sex, there is always a chance of pregnancy. So close to your period, it is less likely though.<br>  <br>  Wait two weeks from the day you had intercourse and take a pregnancy test (I prefer the digital yes/no kind) to be sure. Good luck and be careful!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	If you got your period, then I doubt it. But if you want take a test. If you feel pregnant go to the doctor No, you're not pregnant.|`|sTAA8lthaa	If you got your period, then I doubt it. But if you want take a test. If you feel pregnant go to the doctor.

Nothing to fret over! Just make sure you wipe his mouth out every night before he goes to bed with a gauze pad or a wash-cloth. Then, when he gets 3 months they make baby tooth-paste that is safe to use on babies gums/teeth.
WPI0Z47saa	Sorry to say nothing. Even grandparents can't do anything unless the mom and dad are a threat to the baby. But if the mom won't let you see them, there is nothing legally that you can do.

pcb8watraa	You need to start timing your contractions/pains. When they are lasting longer then 60 seconds each and coming every 5 minutes for at least an hour or more you should call your OB. They will advise you on whether or not to go to the ER. Real labor contractions get longer, stronger and closer together. They do not stop when you are active or take a shower. 37 weeks really is early to be in labor unless this is a second or third pregnancy. It can happen so I would keep an eye on things. It's hard to tell what real labor is unless you've experienced it before.<br>  <br>   I'm having my third child and I have such terrible BH contractions that they go on for hours in a row and are 5 minutes apart, then they slow down or stop. This is how I know it is not real labor. Once real labor stops no matter what you do you can not slow it down or stop it. It keeps coming and gets really strong. I've been going through this or a week now and I am 38 wks pregnant. <br>  <br>  So keep an eye on things, take a shower try to do something to take your mind off it. If they pain stops then chances are it's nothing. If it gets worse or does not stop call your OB. good luck|`|tMtLebtNaa	i am only twelve but if you are supposed to be 9 months pregnant and you are on week 37 that means you have been pregnant for 9 months and one week approxamatly. i would say that you need to go to the ER soon because i think the cute little baby is coming soon! when ever you do have the baby congratulations to you and your new family!|`|AA12122209	first of all, have you lost your plug? its like 2-4inches long and looks funny. if so GO TO THE ER not much time before your baby comes!!! also has your water broke? if so go the ER ASAP! i would consult the midwife or doctor that your seeing that you"ll be at the ER. hurry and don't worry about cleaning, you have a baby to deliver!! GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS!!!!|`|SihmWU0Baa	just wait and see if they get worse most contractions start at the top of the stomach where the bump starts and works its way down  but at 37 weeks you are technicly considered full term medicaly so if it gets to bad i would call your doctor and see what they say to do|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Losing your plug now is normal. If you've had sex or a recent gyn exam, that can cause it come out. I think I lost mine with my first at this point and it was almost another three weeks before he was born. <br>  <br>  Pressure, pelvic pain and increased energy are all common at the end. No, it doesn't mean you're in early labor. The baby is probably engaged, is getting bigger and pressing on things, and it causes you physical pain. Plus your pelvis is shifting to accommodate the baby's head, which I think is uncomfortable, too. As far as stomach pains, not sure what you mean by that. They could be round ligament pains, or Braxton Hicks, which are uncomfortable, irregular contractions that help your uterus gear up for labor. <br>  <br>  Real contractions usually radiate from your back to your front, and increase in intensity and frequency. You will know when you get those - like really bad period pains.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	I lost my mucus plug over 1.5 weeks and then after getting my membrane stripped for the second time, I started getting really bad menstrual cramps( i don't know if thats what your having) and low back pain and it got worse through the night and by the time I got to the hospital I was dilated 7 cm.. your probably in early labour.. when you can't talk through your contractions,  go to the hospital.. I was screaming in my pillow from the contractions, they were 5-7 mins apart for 2 hrs .. Good Luck

uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    yes, you show early with your proceeding pregnancy because your body has experienced pregnancy before & can be easily stretched now..so there is nothing to worry..    hope i have helped..!!|`|22wzQ9XTaa	Like i've said in response to a similar question, "No. you are not showing. Your stomach area is bloated, not your uterus. Take a look at this diagram and note how low and far back the uterus and fetus is http://www.babycenter.com/fetal-developm... your uterus is  buried too deep in your pelvis to be showing. the baby is the size of a blueberry... i highly doubt a blueberry would be noticeable as a "baby bump".  Second time moms do often show earlier than their first, but not near this early.  If you were around 4 months, I would suspect a baby bump, but not 7 weeks. And it's not because of hormones that you show early.  you show early because your muscles aren't near as strong as they were with your previous pregnancy. Good luck with your second!|`|nEgIBjOZaa	well I am 4 weeks right now and not showing, its my second pregnancy but I did hear that you show sooner with your second pregnancy because your body has stretched already.

g52eSE06aa	I think little girls that age would really enjoy something like a dancing or singing contest where some of them get prizes, but make sure to give like some candies to all of them even if they didn't win the contests. They might enjoy a small disco in the garden or whatever, girls that age usually like high school musical or Hannah Montana songs. You should www.imeem.com and create a play list for them to dance too so you won't have to constantly skip songs. Pass the parcel is also old but great fun for children along with musical statues. Some candies or sweets are always a big hit and make sure to get a film for them to watch that sucks up about an hour or two and is good fun. Again make sure there are lots of sweets! Good luck I hope they enjoy it.|`|UrrRgmDwaa	You could have an American Idol Contest, Talent Show, or Fashion Show. You could find old wigs, boas, scarves, hats, dresses, etc... and let them make their own outfit and then wear it in the fashion show. You could also decorate T-shirts. I did this once. Just get a few packages of Hanes white Ts. Be sure to put cardboard between each side. Get different colors of fabric paint, sequins, fabric glue etc... If you do it at the beginning it should be dry in a few hours. We did this in the garage to spare the mess.|`|JwtKmZd3aa	i agreee with both answers rose and the one underneath.

2wyDALHgaa	I've never seen a breakdown of the costs for international adoptions but I think that is because every country has a different system which means different expenses.  Even adoptions from the same country can be a bit different depending up the agencies you go through.    My wife and I did an international adoption through India for about $800 US but we lived there at the time.  If we hadn't lived there it would have been the "normal" cost.  We couldn't have afforded to live there if my employer hadn't moved us there so really unless your employer moves you there, again, the costs will remain high.  Sucks but thats the way it is.      Our second adoption, mind you, was free.  We adopted from domestic foster care and those adoptions are generally free in North America (Canada/US) or if there is a cost its usually very small, like under $1000.  Check it out.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Adoption can be free or nearly free....if you choose to only adopt internationally, you are required to pay thousands of dollars.....if you choose to adopt through foster care, you generally aren't charged anything. You MAY be required to pay for the adoption lawyer, but that is only in some states and only amounts to between $800-$2,000 total cost.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	You should consider foster care. There are older sibling groups, too. Adopting internationally can be very damaging to a child.      http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...    http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...     http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/...     http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660        http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.p...         ***ETA****   Just because you make a mean tandoori chicken will never replace a child's country.    As far as you shelling out money for bills only to have a mother decide to parent?? Sorry, but that's whats wrong with the system. Have your own, or adopt from foster care. That way, no one gets screwed, ESPECIALLY not the child.     Oh and Kate/Ktea/KatieJane/whoever you are this week-   so now you're "pro-adoption?" You seem to change your thought process more than Joan Rivers changes plastic surgeons. Thanks for blocking me...glad I could help you when you were down.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Adoption isn't expensive, except in the lives of everyone involved.    Agencies are expensive.    Our son's adoption, as a newborn, including home study, was less than $1000.00 in dollars costs.      It used to be that if a woman decided (and this has nothing to do with the baby stealing era, etc-I'm just giving an example), she was able to be connected to someone either through a friend, or even ads that people placed, and the couples were able to directly deal with a mother.  Now, there's so many middle men, it's nearly impossible for all but the richest, and that doesn't necessarily mean the best, adoptive parent to adopt.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Valentina,    Plain and simple, international/infant adoption is expensive because agencies and facilitators want to make fat profits. Adoption through state foster care programs is actually at a very nominal cost (and is sometimes free!) which covers the paperwork and court costs.     I urge you and your fiance to research adoption thoroughly and take some time to think about things from the view point of your potential children before you worry so much about the financing of an adoption.    Adoption is a very complicated thing and is not something that should be entered into without a great deal of forethought and preparation. Adoption is a LIFELONG process - especially for the child and is not the same as raising a biological child.     For instance, have you thought about what it would be like to be living in one country, speaking your native language, surrounded by familiar culture, food, music, etc. and then when you are 3 years-old, you are picked up by strangers and taken away from your whole world, expected to learn a new language, call people you do not know "mom" and "dad", perhaps never taste your favorite food again, etc? What if this new Mom & Dad change your name? What if they can't understand you when you speak? What if you look vastly differently than your parents and siblings and people are always asking questions about your adoption?     Adoption should be about the child more than anyone else. The child's needs, rights, feelings, etc. need to be protected, thought of, planned for, etc. and not just while they are children, but how you plan to help them deal with their adoptions as ADULTS. Do you and you fiance plan to help you adopted children visit their homeland if they wish as they grow up? What about searching for biological family? Will you be prepared for possible separation issues? What about possible identity issues? What about the feelings of your adopted children about your biological children?    I am NOT trying to discourage you from adopting. I just want to help you prepare for what adoption REALLY is and for being the best possible adoptive parent to your potential child(ren). Please stick around here, read up on some adoption books and blogs by adult adoptees. Ask lots of questions. there is no such thing as too much preparation when it comes to adoption. You may find that there are other adoption options that are more suitable for your family, that adoption isn't really for you or you still wish to follow through with your plans but in a different way.    I wish you luck and hope that you will continue to learn about adoption, whether or not you actually adopt. It is a very misunderstood subject and it never hurts to learn!     Peace.    ETA: Wow. Sounds like you have it all figured out then....you didn't mention that you were an expert. Glad to know you take concern for children to heart.    ETA2: Just so you know, there are children in foster care WAITING to be adopted whose parents have already had their rights terminated. (Seemed like you weren't aware of that.)|`|vwTyihvvaa	As I am pro-adoption, and think anyone who considers adoption wonderful. I also am happy to know that you will allow the child in the future if they wanted to, to go back and find their roots, etc.     Generally though, international adoption is expensive, there really is no way out of it.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Unless you want to pay through the nose and support what just might be a corrupt adoption agency, I would seriously consider domestic foster care.  They have many sibling groups, and with you being accepting of older children, this might help move things along faster.  PLUS... its very inexpensive compared to the international adoptions you are speaking of.    Knowing about the culture, and being able to cook the food and speak the language is a start, but adopted Indian children would still be away from their own culture.  You cannot fully give them the culture that they would and should have in their own country.|`|JP04HX6maa	I'm not here to discourage you from adopting. Really, I'm not. But I kindly suggest that you do a bit more research from the POV of some transracial adult adoptees - from BOTH ones that feel a loss and from those that don't. Just so you're aware of both ends of the spectrum.    But I believe Devon nailed it all.    "Knowing about the culture, and being able to cook the food and speak the language is a start, but adopted Indian children would still be away from their own culture."    Exactly. You hit the nail on the head.    I applaud you for having the right heart to do this - to want to give a child a home, because that is really what adoption should be about. But no matter how much culture you give your adopted child, it will never be the same as if they had grown up with parents who MIGHT have been able to raise them. Yes, even those children who come from rural areas. They are better off being adopted than starving to death in orphanages, but they shouldn't have even ended UP in the orphanages to begin with.    I fully respect that you intend to incorporate the child's culture into your lifestyle, as many APs should attempt to do as much as possible without going into culture overload.    I have many people who have told me, "Learn the language instead of complaining about it! Immerse yourself with the people!"    Well, that's wonderful to suggest, and I already figured that out a year ago. The problem is that there is still and likely always will be a cultural gap. And it's much easier for NON minority parents to say those things than if THEY were the persons of colour.    I'm not saying you can't learn the language. I'm not saying you can't incorporate the culture or cook the food. But you aren't going to "be" your child. For example, if your child is Asian and you are white, you are WHITE. They are ASIAN. You cannot step into their shoes and just tell them "Well study the language." You can sympathize but not empathize: you are not them.    http://sisterheping.wordpress.com/2008/1...    http://sisterheping.wordpress.com/2009/0...    http://sisterheping.wordpress.com/2008/1...|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Try Ethica or InformedAdoptions, for good websites on ethical adoption.    It's so expensive because it's a multi-million $ business where children are the commodity.  And because people pay up to get the 'goods' they demand.    When practiced as a social service for children (as it ought to be!) finding homes for children who need them, it is not expensive at all.  There are approx 140,000 children in the US system who need and deserve homes so my sympathy is for them and not for people who whine about having to  go on waiting lists for what they feel they are entitled to then follow it up by whining about the cost of coveting a baby for themselves.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	It does seem as though you are ordering off of a menu though.    Why not adopt a child already in the foster care system WAITING for a family.      As for adopting from India, I am pretty sure they only like to adopt to people who are East Indian, so as to ensure cultural preservation.    As for your question why is it so expensive?  Adoption, especially overseas adoption is currently very popular and as more people want to do it, the more the fees increase. And the more money their is to be made, the more chances people will traffic children, stealing them from homes where they are already loved, having their mom's pressured to "give them up" etc. etc. etc.    By continually participating in this, people provide opportunities for this child trafficking.  I realize there are places it is needed, so find THOSE Places and adopt a child truly in NEED!|`|6orvPrLLaa	because adoption lawyers suck as trial attorneys and this is the only gig they can get to pay for their new BMW.    seriously, adoption is a BUSINESS. and the commodity is placing babies. and the more in demand the baby (usually white and newborn), the more the cost.|`|SAMRKyZsaa	One there are lots of fees home studies visas and things like that is why it is do expensive  Also there are kids legally free in foster care meaning you don't have to foster them first. Also their parents rights are terminated and they won't get them back under any circumstances|`|rD03JBxmaa	International adoption can be expensive, for sure, but it doesn't always have to be extremely expensive.  India does not have terribly high fees for adoption, and because you are hoping to adopt older children, usually the sending country lowers the adoption fees because older children are unfortunately  harder to place.  And also remember that you will have a $12,000 adoption tax credit for EACH adoption completed in that tax year, so if you are adopting two children, you will have a $24,000 tax credit and it can carryover for 5 years.  That really does help with paying down any loans or expenses you have incurred in the process.  The only route to adoption that is truly inexpensive is U.S. foster care, so you could look into that also, if you can handle the risks involved.  Good luck!
5axGfFofaa	I Had my 2nd m/c on Jan 5.  I am not even due for my period (assuming it is a somewhat normal cycle) until Wed or Thur.  In Dec I had a 28 day cycle (ovulate day 14) this month I did not ovulate until day 16.  I know when ovulation occured b/c I have a fertility monitor.  So, to sum it up...I am not due until Wed or Thur so you should not test and just wait for a period.  If it you don't have one by next week you could test.  I know that is a long wait but...well...as we are learning the hard way....be patient b/c we have nothing but time!  I found your story pretty similar as I too am 29 had 2 m/c's and get to start all over again at this TTC thing.  This month we also used the old trusty pull out method!!|`|AA10390690	i'm sorry all that you have went thro... i think for your sake since you are scared to wait a little while... i hope things work out for you either way! =]|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im soory or ur loss, im in the same boat, id waita little as you dont want fasle hope. gud luk.|`|8EW3JDmbaa	I have also had 2 mc's and I ttc again this month, however bf got ill around ovulartion time but I did bd 3 times before ovulation. I didnt think this would be my month, however a couple of days ago I has sore boobs, but that went, and the past two times I was preggo I just knew. This time I dint think I would have any of the preg symptoms, however today at 8/9dpo I have got cramping and that lower back pain I only ever have had when pregnant. So ive just whizzed down to the shop and got 2 First Response tests, (day off work and peeing on a stick on my mind!) and takenone, which I knew whould be neg as it was too soon to test, so I will make myself wait until 13dpo.    Do you have any symptoms or "feel" pregnant? If you have a 27 day cycle and are on da 28 then take a test, if it is neg and af does not arrive then take another, wondering if you are wont help anything.     The way I view neg tests is that if your period does not arrive then try again.    Anything is possible whe it comes to getting pregnant, when I got preg the first time, I had come of the depo shot 4 months prior to ttc and bled for nearly that whole time, around the time I concieved I only had sex twice in 3 weeks as these were the only only times I wasn't "on" ad I got pg.    Take a test and let us know!! xx
79eRDIbXaa	Yes you could be - there is a chance you can get pregnant at any time in your cycle. Wait till your period is due then take a test. x|`|THZEgP3waa	there is a chance you are pregnant.  you can take a first response test up to 5 days before your missed period, otherwise wait and see with another type of test.|`|CSrNYeMaaa	put a condom on ( DUH)|`|ECPdAeHQaa	There is always a possiblity.|`|E66YWl6Kaa	I would agree...wait until you are due.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Breath holding is common, and won't hurt her.  Very rarely a child will do it long enough to pass out, but then as they are no longer able to hold their breath they will breathe.  It will not cause brain damage, and holding it long enough to faint is rare.  Some people blow in the child's face which may cause them to breathe.    You can't force a child to get over separation anxiety, and all the methods of "gradually" leaving and returning (when you don't need to) whatnot don't actually work.  They just take a long time and the child would have grown out of the behaviour anyway.      http://www.babycenter.com/0_separation-a...  Option I  Minimize separations as much as possible and take your baby along if he seems to feel anxious. With this option, you're basically waiting for your baby to outgrow this stage.    Option II  If you have to leave your baby  for example, to return to work  try leaving him with people who are familiar, like his father, grandmother, or aunt. Your baby may still protest, but he might adjust more easily to your absence when surrounded by well-known faces.    Option III  If you need to leave your child with someone he doesn't know, give him a chance to get to know his caregiver while you're still around    http://www.babycenter.com/0_toddler-mile...  12 to 18 months  Early in the second year of life, the adventure of self-discovery truly begins. This is a time of astounding transformation from helplessness to independence. As a result, it's also a period of extreme mood swings and troubling behaviors. But understanding the reasons behind your toddler's actions can help you survive this tumultuous period.    Once completely dependent on you, your child now has the physical and mental capacity to explore on her own. She embarks on voyages of mobility, believing she rules her world. All too quickly, though, she learns the limits of her powers as she tries new experiences, whether it's climbing up on the couch and then not knowing how to get down or trying to put on her own coat and getting hopelessly tangled in it. And when she realizes she doesn't have everything figured out just yet, she becomes frustrated and frightened. But there's value in all of it  she's developing an identity.    Your toddler has learned that you are a separate entity and that you can leave her. However, she doesn't yet grasp the reliability of your coming back, which can make her very upset to see you go. This separation anxiety, which can come and go throughout the toddler years, typically peaks around 18 months and fades altogether by age 3.    In the meantime, resist the urge to sneak away when your toddler's back is turned  when you leave her at daycare, for example. It won't help her cope, and it may just make her more afraid that you aren't coming back. Hard as it can be, say goodbye and go while she's watching|`|J4W68owgaa	First, don't worry about the breath holding, it won't hurt her. It looks much more dramatic than it really is, it's a pretty common tactic among the preschool crowd :)    Secondly, try going away from her for 10 minutes at a time and showing her that you DO return. Let her be angry and throw a fit, but make sure you return at that time. Set a timer to help her count down the time. Then slowly increase the time.    She's feeling insecure. She's in a big huge world and feels scared when you are gone, a lot of kids go through that. You just need to make her understand that you will ALWAYS come back to her.    Really assure her that you will be back and you're probably just going to have to deal with the tantrums for a bit. She will outgrow it and you leaving her for short periods and returning to her will help her tremendously.    I know it's hard sweetie, but this will pass.|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	just let her do it  she will breathe when she realises that SHE is not in control  leave your husband and her alone at home more|`|fbl6aaK9aa	As far as attached is concerned, that goes away in time.  The breath-holding spells are odd, but just let her do them.  The body will breathe automatically even having held your breath as long as you can.  She'll grow out of it.  You seem to be a good mother!
EmfQUQDDaa	this could mean anything you period could just be late or you could be pregnant i would get checked out to see  for myself.     good luck hun (:|`|gwuTKiNXaa	you maybe pregnant if you have already tested and it was a negative maybe wait another week and see what happens then.

0OtHu9Zmaa	I never used the one from the dollar store, but the most accurate one, I believe based on my experience, is First Response digital test. You don't even have to guess the color of the stripe, or sit there and wonder is it a plus sign, but the crossing looks so vague, etc. It just simply reads 'Pregnant' or 'Not Pregnant' so there are no doubts if you interpreted it correctly.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends. If you are trying to test early, like before you missed your period, the Dollar Tree tests probably won't give you an answer. Some are more sensitive than others. But if you've already missed your period, then the Dollar Tree tests are probably just fine.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Clear blue, Digital...|`|h5X0Rjjyaa	Dollar store tests are actually pretty sensitive in predicting pregnancy.  They can detect 25ml of hcg which is early detection while others like digital is 50 ml. I would say this is a good test just less expensive.|`|hT1bVVFraa	Before I found out I was pregnant, I used all the expensive name brand tests because I thought they would give me the most accuracy (turned out i wasn't pregnant then). Then one month I was at the grocery store and there was a generic store brand pregnancy test all banged up on clearance, and when I used it, it came back positive and worked just fine!    So I don't think it really matters which brand or kind you use, if you are pregnant, it will show on the test! My suggestion would get a box with two tests in it though, and do it first thing in the morning two days in a row for best accuracy.   Good Luck!|`|ypXhrxHfaa	I just took a dollar store test and it came back negative. I still totally feel pregnant.  I have not missed AF yet so I am waiting until I do to test again.  So I would say wait and see.  And yes I know how hard that can be.  Good luck and God bless!
WlU3NFu6aa	Rear facing is safer. Check your state laws. here in Hawaii it 20 lbs AND one year|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Nope, you need a convertible car seat if she outgrows her infant carrier and isn't one yet.      Check your infant carriers weight limit, mine was a graco and 22 lbs.     I bought a convertible, one that went from rear facing to forward facing.  It goes up to 35 lbs rear facing, 50 forward facing, and then converts to a booster up to 100 lbs.    I am choosing to keep my 1 year old rear facing for longer then a year.  I am not going to switch him until he really want to be forward facing.  Rear facing is safest for child up to 3 years old.|`|xK6wehG7aa	it's 20 lbs AND 1 year, however studies show that rear facing is the safest for your child. I am going to do extended rear facing for my son.    http://www.carsafety4kids.com/rearfacing...    Here's a video of a child that demonstrates the safety of rear facing.    PLEASE remember, broken legs can be fixed, broken necks can not.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmUWg7Qr...|`|fMxVDps3aa	I faced mine forward after 20lbs. That's up to you. In my state there are all these car seat laws though too.|`|r52rfBkeaa	You need to check the requirements for  your state, but when you have to meet all of them, not just one.  For example, my son is 15 months old so he meets the age requirement, but he only weighs 19 lbs 12 oz, so he's still too light.  Honestly, it's best to keep them rear facing for as long as possible so even if she's past one year, unless she's uncomfortable with her feet hitting the seat, keep her rear facing - it's so much safer for them.|`|aqto0hJTaa	20 pounds AND a year.  She has to meet both requirements.|`|ti3AEcIFaa	yea sure, you should go and get her a farward facing seat, because she is almost 1 and she is 20 lbs|`|hSJnaysiaa	Its safest to leave them rear-facing as long as possible. I believe in europe or somewhere where their safety regulations surpass ours here in the states kids ride rear facing until they're like 4 years old.    So even though rear facing as long as possible is suggested, you need to make sure YOUR carseat can handle it. Read the manual. If it doesn't support rear facing past 20 pounds you need to get a new seat. If it supports forward facing (like a convertible carseat) then you can turn it around but read what the seats instructions say to do. Also, look into your states laws. It is safer to leave your child rear facing, but if the carseat isn't designed to hold a child past 20 pounds rear facing then forward facing or a new carseat are necessary.|`|YVBXMghXaa	Laws vary by state, but most are one year AND 20 pounds.  Safety is most important, and as others have said, rearfacing as long as possible is the safest.  My 25 pound 2 year old is still happily rearfacing, and will be until he reaches the 33 pound limit on his seat.  You'll want to purchase a convertible seat if she is outgrowing her infant carrier.  It can be rearfacing, then turned around when the time comes.    The reason that the age issue is just as important as weight has to do with the development of the spinal column.  The spine isn't properly fused to the skull until at least after the age of two.  Force that would cause a broken neck that will heal in you or I, can cause internal decapitation in a small child.  That is exactly as horrible as it sounds and it is deadly.    This video has great facts, crah test videos, and pictures of older children still comfortably rear facing.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2DVfqFhs...
x8JRkRNkaa	Trying to determine if you're pregnant or not based on a couple of symptoms is a really bad idea. Lots of things can make you feel sick and pregnancy does not usually cause horrible pain. There is not enough information here to say weather you likely could be pregnant or not. If you feel you are the best thing to do is take a test 2 weeks from the time you had intercourse last.

627pWyVkaa	possibly. You do realize it takes a full month before birth control protects you from getting pregnant? So if you Just started taking birth control in feb and had unprotected sex in January, then its quite possible you are pregnant. You should be taking a pregnancy test and should have waited until you started your period in February before you even started taking birth control because you could have already been pregnant before you started taking which would be pointless. Go test yourself.|`|ad0F70IMaa	It's possible you can still be pregnant. You should test in a couple of weeks.

I have four children I would die for, and one of them I just have guardianship of, But I voted for Obama. Anyone is better than Bush, by the way where are you from, you said you feel sorry for America, why we have someone who is going to get this country the makeover it needs.I just hope he gets our troops back home soon.|`|jqZY0OyPaa	You never know what reasons a person gets an abortion for.<br>  <br>  Maybe they can't support the child, emotionally, financially or physically. Most families have both parents working. Some kids are having kids and its only right to not go through with it.<br>  <br>  Btw, face facts. When abortion is legalized, it shows that at the time the fetus would be a teenager, crimes are way lower than when abortion is illegal. When you can't take care of your kid, its better to now have them.|`|i8Ch743Laa	It gets sooooooooooo old seeing this stuff. Abortion is the mom's choice,and I don't agree with it,but it is a legal thing. I don't agree with partial birth abortion,but theres been NOTHING said about it,and it won't be legalized even if they try. Stop posting this anti obama bullshit. Some of us LIKE our president. This should have been in politics. I'm FOR OBAMA,and I dont give a f*** who says I'm a bad person. I've heard only speculation about this,nothing from his mouth about it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'm disgusted that any type of abortion is considered medically. Considering the first rule is "do no harm"|`|1HLPznZhaa	I feel sorry for you ..I don't know where you are getting your facts but you need to do a little research..Your ramblings have so many inaccuracies I won't wast my time<br>  trying to correct..|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i wonder if you felt as strongly about all the young people who died in Iraq b/c of Bush's senseless war. Just b/c you put on here the steps of a partial abortion doesn't make it fact that he is going to make them legal (which he has no intention of doing). If you want to ramble on about politics you should go to that section where people will have ready facts to give back at you, instead of making a bunch of pregnant people upset.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Partial birth abortions are illegal and Obama has no intentions to change that.<br>  <br>  I am pro life, but frankly with any president there is going to be good and bad things. Abortion was still legal when Bush was president, the only change is that Obama is funding a program to spread information about abortion, not promote it. If you were going to get an abortion anyway it doesn't really matter what president is in office, you're still going to do it.<br>  <br>  So stop trying to make it seem like Obama wants everyone to get an abortion and any baby that is aborted its obama's fault. He's still 1000x better than Bush.<br>  <br>  <br>  PEOPLE! Partial birth abortions are ILLEGAL! Obama has done nothing to legalize them! Get  your facts straight. The ONLY abortion related thing he has done is offer funding to organizations that distribute information on abortions. THAT'S ALL! Abortions were already legal, nothing has changed.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	I have known for a while how abortions of all types are done. Which is why I have always been against and never will be for it being done here or anywhere. I feel it is murder. There is no nice way to say it, and of course some people don't agree. Fine. But what else would it be? It is sad and sickening and should be illegal. Why anyone would willingly murder an innocent child is something I will never understand. How you can chose to take a life is so wrong and confusing to me. I do not judge people. I feel like that is not my place either. I believe in a higher power and even though I don't know what that is, I do believe. And I believe there will be consequences for taking innocent life. I'm sorry that anyone would support this.
GtPnXzPAaa	I'd go for some unsuspecting pro athlete. Double bonus! Babby and a PAY DAY!!|`|aWL7mkbMaa	Of course...  I thought about it when I was 30; I was going to do it with an Scandinavian Sperm Bank that assures you get good genes for your baby but I meet somebody started a relationship and now I'm pregnant at 33.<br>  <br>  An anonymous sperm donor is better because a one night stand can be dangerous (you could get something different than a pregnancy), or If you know the father, at some point he may want rights over the baby or he can become an idiot and make your life miserable (you never know how people can change in the future or what will happen with them).<br>  <br>  If you have enough income to take care of it yourself then do it!!!!  There are many single moms out there, you will just be one of the responsible ones.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I would do it for sure.. Especially if I knew I wanted kids but my biological clock was ticking adn I knew time was running out. I would DEFINITELY NOT go about it with a one night stand though. That's cruel. I would probably do it through an anonymous sperm donor. I would only do it with an ex or a good friend if they knew and agreed on what what goign to happen.|`|78J2Q1gMaa	I would definitely consider it, but there are other things involved.  How would you support it on your own? Babies are alot of work, and having help is always a plus.  As for how... if I was desperate enough to have a baby RIGHT NOW, if I had a friend that would be willing to help me out (DO NOT just try to get pregnant without their knowing) otherwise I would go to a sperm bank or my doctor to find out options.|`|5eSSAT69aa	I would use my exboyfriend who is also a good friend of mine. If he refused, I'd get him drunk and then get him into bed. It isn't to hard with him. Well, it is, but getting in his pants isn't very difficult. Let's word it that way.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	erm....i would prolly just adopt :) there are Plenty of babies out there wanting a family who loves  and wants them :)<br>  <br>  Artificial insemination is pretty expensive now days..<br>  if you had one with a good friend... what good would being friends do after the baby is born you know??? and an old boyfriend, HELL no lol <br>  thos are just my opinions..<br>  <br>  i really don't know, that's a pretty good question...:)<br>  <br>  39 weeks pregnant today!!<br>  <br>  good luck on whatever you choice is!!!|`|iHJuXKBiaa	You have a good head on your shoulders.

I make cute babbies.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	Honey if you have a maternal need, it is better to do something about it now than wait and regret it. This answer is coming from an infertility place, I was told as a 20 something that I couldn't have kids (severe PCOS) and if I magically fell pregnant the chances of miscarriage were very high.<br>  <br>  My kids drive me insane, but I know I could never be without them. It took me 10 years and a miscarriage to get my daughter, 18 months and another miscarriage to get my son and then oopsie, I have my babby with no problems......WTF???<br>  <br>  If it was my partner that had the infertility for example I probably would go for an anonymous donor, that way I could pick someone who had similar traits to my partner, therefore limiting people asking if the kids were "ours".<br>  <br>  I'm 31 with 3 kids.........I would go for it if that was the position I was in. Yes having a baby is hard, the lack of sleep, the baby crying the feeding and nappy changes, but if you have good family and friends then you don't need a partner, you just need help and support.<br>  <br>  I hope my answer wasn't too soppy for you, lol|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	How about a Yahoo!Answers contact?  I'm certain there are plenty of us who'd be willing to make donations to the cause...<br>  <br>  So in reading the answers, I thought Rosie had the best idea, until I read Crazy Baby's answer.  Now I'm jealous that I can't get impregnewted by some unsuspecting pro athlete...|`|5lfnpGmUaa	I think probably one of your YA contacts would be the best choice.

But I would be happy to help out.  I think I could get the wife to go along.  After all, it's to help out a friend.  And she loves "The Big Chill."|`|lXE75yQjaa	Hmm..I'm with the others on the old boyfriend being too much baggage.<br>  Personally, I would not want to go through a pregnancy alone. I was high risk though, so maybe that's why. And not only that, but the newborn thing is so damn exhausting...it just makes it easier if you have some support.<br>  <br>  If you want a serious answer here (although I am capable of giving a smart azz one , which you know)..personally, I would be looking into adoption.|`|C42zVqrSaa	I don't know if I would.  However, I do know 2 people that did.  One woman actually adopted 2 children and another went to a sperm bank.  They are both very happy with their decision.  And both are financially stable.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Here's hoping that if you chose an old boyfriend or a good friend they'd be smart enough to go to a lawyer and draw up a rock solid contract to keep you from going after child support at a later date.<br>  <br>  Why not adopt?|`|kQEnJpOvaa	I would want to have a child. Maybe an old friend or old boyfriend as a donor, if they are willing. If not then you could always adopt or get a anonymous donor. Good luck.  Maybe Octo-mom  can share one of hers.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	An unsuspecting one night stand would be the route I would take.

AAHdy9haaa	I am 38 weeks prego now, I also had pre term labor with my first and was out on bed rest. I am having the same pressure you are talking about for about  6 weeks now.  I keep a heating pad on my lap and that seems to help a little. Also, stretching ever so gently helps. But I would definitely be very careful since you are on bed rest already. <br>  <br>  About stopping labor, I have always heard that at 36 weeks they wont stop it, but I am no dr...I think it depends on your history and your dr. preferences.<br>  Feelin your pain! good luck|`|nfLyS1toaa	you need to call your dr. and ask him. he would be able to answer your q's better.|`|3hUR2SQ9aa	I had my daughter at 35 weeks and they did try to stop it.<br>  <br>  About the pressure, that is most likely just the head dropping into place. I had those same feelings a few weeks before I went into labor. Also could you have an infection?

I would think having to go through labor with the flu would suck! :) Feel better soon!<br>  I am also 38 weeks! Good luck!|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I think you should go to the doctor asap, my fiance' mom felt the same way before she had her daughter so you may be going into labor soon. Good luck and congrats!|`|nfLyS1toaa	1) call your dr.<br>  2) you could be getting ready to go in to labor but since your dad is sick you could be getting sick too<br>  3)no it shouldn't i had the stomach flu with my 2nd at 5 months pregnant and i was fine.<br>  4)probably not because she has your immunities for a while<br>  5)dont know you need to call your dr. and ask since you are 38 weeks and ask if you get the stomach flu if it could put you in labor.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	If you're with someone like a qualified midwife, you'd probably do just fine. You're in your own home, a comfortable setting, and a LOT more relaxed. Assuming you had a trouble free pregnancy, I think it's entirely possible and safe with a qualified birth attendant. That person would no doubt be trained to know the signs of trouble and transport you to the hospital if need be. <br>  <br>  And FWIW babies do die in hospitals, too. <br>  <br>  I think in order to have a home birth you have to educate yourself fully  on the ins and outs of it. You also have to know your body very well too and possible signs of problems. The more 'in tune' with your body you are, the better. While I didn't have a home birth with my last one, I did have a VBAC, and knew I sure as hell wasn't going to show up at the hospital the minute I had my first contraction. I paid attention to my body and labored at home for several hours before going in, and knew, I guess by intuition, when to go in. Everything worked out just fine. <br>  <br>  It's only been in the last 50 years or so that more babies have been born in hospitals. Before that, they were all born ... at home! Sure, the infant mortality rate was higher then, but it's starting to rise now because of births in HOSPITALS with lots of medical intervention, coupled with the alarming rate of c-section in this country. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Cesarean-Section-May-Increase-Infant-Mortality-Rates-in-Low-Risk-Women-13838-1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-new...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicineonline.com/news/12/6008/High-infant-mortality-seen-with-elective-c-section.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicineonline.com/news/12/60...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blogher.com/ama-ricki-lake-no-more-babies-born-bathtubs-please-ricki-lake-ama-stuff-it" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogher.com/ama-ricki-lake-no...</a><br>  <br>  CIndy Crawford had home births, too. :>|`|vue9NOhYaa	Dangers:  VERY rarely there might be a complication that the midwife couldn't handle, and that would occur so fast that you couldn't get to a hospital.<br>  <br>  Benefits:  Safer (assuming low risk pregnancy)<br>                 Cheaper<br>                 Less chance of unnecessary interventions<br>                 More relaxing for mom (assuming it's her choice)<br>                 More attentive care (midwives are there for the whole labor,  rather than just showing up to catch the baby)<br>  <br>  <br>  All of this assumes that it's a planned home birth with a midwife and a mother who has made a choice to give birth in that setting.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i had my second boy who turned a year today at home. <br>  benifits- you are so much more relaxed<br>             you can have as many or as little people there but hospital limit is normally 2 people. You can watch tv or eat or whatever. your baby will be less stressed if you are less stressed. after the birth you dont have to clean anything up as midwives do it. Your baby will be born into your home how nice. you can climb into bed after it.<br>  <br>  Dangers- there is no ambulance waiting at your door step if baby stops breathing BUT  midwives all know mouth to mouth and unless you have complications throughout your pregnancy everything should go fine. you only get 2 canisters of gas and air- i only used half of 1. <br>  If you dont deliver the placenta you have to go to the hospital to have it removed. <br>  <br>  It was the best experience i ever had!|`|3NoDjKLoaa	you are in the comfort of your own home, that can make you more relaxed and that always helps labor.. You can eat (thats a big one.. most hospitals dont let you eat when you are hungry or drink)  you cannot get any pain medication, a midwife may be able to give you the drug that takes the edge off but definitely no epidural.  you can change places as you go through the process. you may first want to be in the bath, and then in the bed... hospitals dont usually let you do that, you are most likely sitting in a bed or in the water.  You have people coming to bother you all the time to check on the baby, your midwife knows when its important to check the baby and its not every 5 to 10 min lol. (that helps with relaxation also) a big danger could be that you need a csection in the end and you arent close to a hospital, therefore threatening the babies health and your own.  Other complications such as the placenta detaching before the baby is born, that can cause hemorrhaging.  Good luck to you.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I am having a homebirth in August and am so happy with my decision.  My midwife has talked me and my family through a lot of questions.  First of all, I just can't bear the thought of going to the hospital again.  My daughter's birth was so traumatic for me, and I can't imagine it was a picnic for her either!  They didn't let me eat or drink.  They made me wear an ugly green gown which was three times too large and my butt was hanging out.  They broke my water against my wishes by making me think it was the best thing for the baby, when it wasn't.  I was in so much pain after that I had to have an epidural.  Then I couldn't feel myself pushing.  That led to an episiotomy, which led to stitches, which led to a sore butt.<br>  <br>  At home, I will be able to labor in my own tub and have the baby there too if I so choose.  I will have people who are experienced with natural childbirth and can actually help me achieve one!  (Many doctors and nurses have only seen a handful of unmedicated births.)  Breastfeeding will go smoother without the drugs and because I will be able to start right away.  Finally and most importantly, I will NOT have to have my baby taken from my arms against my wishes.<br>  <br>  If you are high risk, and the definition of this varies state to state, you may have to go to a hospital because midwives will not be allowed to legally attend you.  I certainly think high risk ladies belong in the hospital.  However, if you are healthy, go for it.  Midwives bring injectable pitocin to your home so that if you start bleeding they can usually stop it (pitocin=same thing hospital uses).  They know more than most EMTs about how to save your baby should something go wrong.  In the case of shoulder dystocia they can do most anything except a c-section to get the baby out--the same things they do in the hospital and more, because in a hospital a mom is often numb from the waist down and that makes certain maneuvers (like the Gaskin maneuver--named for a MIDWIFE) impossible.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.  We finally concluded that God did not intend for a doctor to snatch a baby out and take the glory for "saving" him.  I think that if I do need to be in a hospital, I will end up having some risk factor or another that gets me there.  My midwives also know what to look for and when to transport me if I need it.  It's a tough decision to make in this culture, but it was the right one for us.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Obvious benefit is that you do not have to be in a hospital and you have more control over the situation rather than people telling you what you need to do!<br>  However, at home you do not have the same medical attention if something goes wrong. Also you have zero access to pain medication if you change your mind and feel that you need it! <br>  My suggestion is to have your first in a hospital to test yourself and see how your body deals with labour, I know that I am happy to have done this because it turned out that my son weighed 10'11 and was not going to come out to easily without medical attention! <br>  However, if you feel confident and trust your midwife and your partner and have access to emergency services then I say go for it! Their would be no greater joy then having your baby in the comfort of your own home!|`|LWxEbK31aa	It's good to have a home birth... but... when it goes wrong during or after birth it goes wrong so fast that if you couldn't get to the hospital in time you could die from blood loss.<br>  <br>  I was all for home birth until my mum adviced me against it because she works at a hospital and has seen the bad side too many times.
tC6bKxRAaa	Wellll get this... My mom is AB- and my dad is O+ and guess what I'm O+ too... Sooo does that mean my mom is not my real mom and she is lying to me??? WTF???

222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	DNA tests aren't 100% accurate even on totally unrelated people, so for identical twins they would not show which of the two fathered the child at all.<br>  <br>  The DNA of identical twins is not the same, but it's close enough that a DNA test can't tell them apart.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Nope, they have the same DNA. It was on Maury once. Lol But we also learned about that in bio. The only thing different about them is their fingerprints. Identical twins have everything the same.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No.  I've actually seen this on Maury where the result was both men were determined to be the father.|`|AA10424047	About 8 or 9 years ago, the talk show Montel did a paternity test on a young boy because his mother slept with her boyfriend and his identical twin brother. The DNA test performed was inconclusive, stating the DNA was so identical, it could not determine who the father of the child was.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	this is an Oddly interesting question! I don't know!!<br>  <br>  i looked it up... an expert would be able to figure it out... read this!|`|hswTS1jVaa	No, if they are identical, they have identical DNA.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	no|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	My husband is an identical twin.  As he has gotten older, he no longer looks identical to his twin.  They both like entirely different foods and have different health issues, so I would say that the DNA is definitely different!|`|dbafItLvaa	I hadn't ever thought about that before, but a DNA test would not show who the father is, because the twins' DNA would be identical.  I guess you would never know for sure!|`|OU9xnW86aa	Identical twins = identical DNA <br>  <br>  *unless one of the twin's DNA mutated when conceived-which is unlikely*|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	if they are identical twins then no,<br>  <br>  the DNA is the same, hence why they look the same|`|AA11784984	Identical twins have identical DNA there wouldn't be a way to prove who the father was.|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	LOL good question, hope its curiousity & not a real problem! otherwise your screwed!|`|KVBTtF9faa	Identical twins split from the same egg/sperm combo and they have the same DNA.|`|JAZqgHpGaa	No, but other tests might.<br>  There is a test for a protein in the blood that might do it.<br>  The reason is that even though the twins have identical DNA, that doesn't mean that they have all of the same genes being expressed.<br>  <br>  DNA is a blueprint for your body and like most blueprints it has flexibility in it.  Certain environmental factors can change how the DNA is "read" and there can be variations in the actual chemistry of the body.  These may be traceable, but this all blind speculation on my part.|`|mIsxQxO5aa	ugh.......<br>  <br>  If identical twins had the exact same dna they would look IDENTICAL, IE same finger prints, same vision, same weight, same everything......<br>  <br>  in the real world...identical twins DO not share those same qualities.<br>  <br>  Identical twins DO have different DNA. <br>  Im an identical twin, 30 seconds older than my younger sister. <br>  Our DNA is different and I have the tests to prove it. <br>  <br>  Yes the tests would show...|`|2CZ9EUHnaa	No. the identical twins have the same exact DNA, therefore it would be impossible by DNA to determine the father of the child. <br>  Lets hope this doesn't happen very often ;)|`|rdDM4lcxaa	No, the twins have the same dna. when the egg is fertilized, it splits. so one egg plus one sperm makes two ppl with the same dna. That's why they're identical.
vue9NOhYaa	It was possible, but usually VERY unlikely. Most women do not ovulate until a week or more after the last day of the period -- and the sperm cannot live that long.<br>  <br>  But -- unless you are very familiar with YOUR cycle and the way  YOUR body works, best to use birth control every time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Once again, tons of ignorant advice here. You can only get pregnant if there are sperm and egg in the same place at the same time -- which is VERY unlikely if you are on your period.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You can get pregnant any time during your cycle.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	It is far less likely to get pregnant while you're on your period. Having a period is actually shedding the lining of the uterus and expelling the egg that did not get fertilized. Therefore having sex while on your period is not likely to get you pregnant. But not every woman's body works like the others so there is the very slight possibility of ovulating very close to your period.|`|SlxeK1p6aa	yes anytime<br>  <br>  better to use protection|`|VSb6S6muaa	she's more likely to.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	your more likely to get knocked up|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	yes you can defintiely get pregnant whilst on your period, you can get pregnant whenever you have sex, any time no matter what, obviously unless its protected! not being able to get pregnant whilst on your period is another myth like not being able to get pregnant the first time you have sex!! of course you can!! so be careful with protection if yuo dont wana be pregnant! :)|`|nMBVqOI2aa	Yes you can get pregnant any time though it is less likely because your womb has less lining so it is less likely to fertilize. However whenever you have sex you should always use protection because there is always a chance.|`|zCzPnQ2Baa	yes it is possible.. you can get pregnantwhenever you have sex or he just ejaculated, the sperm are like programed to do one thing and that is find the egg|`|b7329aa7a50c45d2073625da82916595aa	Absolutely, a girl can get pregnant at any time.
NPmRmnG6aa	Why do people keep talking about her. It's what she wants. I am totally over this Octumom. I could really care less if she buys a 10 million dollar home.|`|VHHis05Naa	I think she got money for her interviews and donations and is buying a house with that.  It's terrible that she has done nothing to try to save her mother's home since she got her into that mess.  I think she's just looking for more donations.  She won't be getting a dime from me.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's California, that's the average price of a medium house in the rest of the country, she probably did not put that much down on it in the first place AND she can't sell for what it's worth and get her $ back, she'll still be owing money when it sells.   She also was on bed rest for 2 months at least, and she had a passel of kids before this last pregnancy - I totally believe she doesn't have cash right now.   I just feel sorry for her kids, only one parent, so many little ones to share her with, and all so very young.
WSXDQ4bpaa	I took my test 4 days after my missed period. But with a blood test at your doctors office I think you may be able to find out a bit sooner.|`|7AYnWg3paa	when u miss a period or 4 weeks..same thing|`|vue9NOhYaa	You need to wait until you miss your period or (since you've been on depo and so may not get a period at the usual time), at least 2 weeks.  Tests MAY be accurate a couple of days before the missed period, but will usually read negative, even if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  YOu're just wasting money on tests. It's just been 5 days since you had sex, and NO test will be accurate. <br>  <br>  And yes, if you're not having periods yet, you are almost certianly not ovulating yet, and the odds of getting pregnant would be very low.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	The earliest is 10 days post ovulation or about 4 days before your expected period. It takes 7-10 days for the egg to implant and release HCG which is what the pregnancy tests test for.|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	pharmacys sell pills in case something like that happens . there like birthcontrol pills but for emergencys . take a test in about 2-3 weeks|`|1xCBR1aBaa	I would say most people find out at 4 weeks or so, you can find out earlier by a blood test.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I would say wait 4 weeks after you had sex.|`|jVx7pmCgaa	Just go see the doctor and get the reliable advice you need. It would be hard to extremely hard to judge if you don't know where in your cycle you are, unless you take a test every week for a month.|`|7TR5JHUyaa	i would say after a couple of weeks from when the egg meets the sperm.  My wife and i found out after about two weeks from conception from an EPT so i think its possible.|`|7DG99jUnaa	i think it will be about two to three weeks|`|OuuYoSBeaa	implantation takes 7-10 days after ovulation to occur and no test will come up accurate untill after that happens. You also have to concider the HCG levels in your body since that is what the test is going to pick up. if your levels are too low for the test it will show up negative. <br>  Everything is going to be screwy for you if you where on the shot prior to this and just didnt get the second dose since now you body is going to try and get itself back on track. I would find a doctor and speak with them about everything. If you are not getting a period, usually that means there is no ovulation happening. A doctor can issue you a blood test to confirm everything and get you back on track with birthcontrol, or conception.
vue9NOhYaa	You're fine.  Dental x-rays are very low in radiation, aimed at your mouth AND you always wear the lead apron to shield you from any stray radiation.  (I'm 48 and have had a tubal, and the hygenist always puts the lead apron on me still!). <br>  <br>  Docs and dentists do try to avoid unnecessary x-rays if they know you to be pregnant, but I wouldn't give this one another thought.  It happens, and baby will be fine.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I have had an x ray before while I was pregnant and didn't know also and once I found out and told my doctor that I had an xray a week prior she said that everything would be alright, it's more of a risk if they are like xraying your stomach or you are really far along. Def bring it up at your doctors appt.|`|GU3RauKOaa	You're going to have an Xmen style mutant for a baby!!!<br>  <br>  No, I'm kidding. Actually it should be fine.

chTCMyQ5aa	My doctor suggested Unisom for morning sickness. It made me really tired, and didn't help very good during the day, so I just too it at night. I never slept so good. Unisom was actually developed as a Dramamine for pregnant women.<br>  <br>  I actually had to have my doctor prescribe me medicine for my morning sickness. I was in the hospital 2 times for dehydration cause I couldn't keep anything down. Now most of my morning sickness is gone, but if i'm feeling nauseated I will eat something and it goes away.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Another thing I did to help me sleep was to buy a maternity pillow. There is one at walmart.com for around $50 that has really good reviews, and I love it!|`|zbZOhlNwaa	i know its easier said than done but try to eat little and often don't let yourself get too hungry thats when it feels worse.  have some plain biscuits by your bed so that the first thing you do is have something to eat. sip water all day too. try ginger biscuits as they are great for nausea. it does get better honestly. i'm 24 weeks now and weeks 7-10 were my worse, i was never actually sick but had the awful nausea. try to rest as much as you possibly can cos the tiredness can really overcome you. most of all try and enjoy it, its a miricle and you are truly blessd. good luck with everything. xx|`|5hjMaNewaa	i was very sick too at 8 weeks. there's not much you can do about it. i would take some saltine crackers and ginger ale to work with me. my sickness was worse when my stomach was empty and growling. so even if i just took a bite or two of something, i would eat something every 2 hours. i know what you're going through and i feel bad for you, but it will be less intense soon, about 2 more weeks you'll start feeling a little better.|`|5gG6zimTaa	try to eat crackers, it will help and bring ginger ale with u at work it also will help try to settle your  nauseous  down. and after you get off work you should consider taking nap because your body needs it ..<br>  <br>  <br>  congrats on your baby!! =)|`|hYZIYla0aa	The doctors do prescribe medicine for extreme morning sickness,I was given Promethazine.Good Luck|`|8492491d97ee630da8a149444b0b195baa	Work from Home!!|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I don't have any great answers for you, but I'm in the exact same boat as you. I'll be 8 weeks tomorrow, sick morning til night, tired as could possibly be, can't sleep well at night, lots of back pain, always hungry... but everything I eat makes me sicker :-) I figure it always helps a bit to know one other person is going through the same stuff. <br>  Luckily, I'm able to stay at home and wallow in my misery from the comfort of my own couch, but I also have a 17 month old who runs nonstop all day so that's been tough. <br>  Like you, I'm SO excited, but also SO ready for this stage to be over and the more exciting stages of pregnancy to begin. Last time I felt quite similar, and it lasted til 22 weeks... but this time I'm praying for the 'average' 12-14 like most women. <br>  I'd just try to keep eating, small meals though. I haven't been able to get lunch or dinner down for the past two weeks, but I try to keep my energy up by eating fruit, nuts, etc every hour or so throughout the day. A lot of bananas with peanut butter :-) ...and I'd also try to rest whenever you can. If you have your own office use your lunch break as nap time, or try to find a quiet place to rest elsewhere. <br>  The best advice I have is to keep reminding yourself that it WILL pass. One day in the upcoming weeks you'll wake up and feel so much better. The 'middle' of pregnancy is so exciting, and you'll (most likely) be feeling great by then. Just keep up hope that it'll end soon!<br>  <br>  Oh and regarding the uterus stretching... no worries. Some women don't really feel much of that at all. I wouldn't be worried about it :-)
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Your mucus plug is just that - a huge blob of mucus (usually). The water breaking is like peeing, only it's a flow you can't stop like you can with pee. It'll go through your clothes and you'll get all wet. There's a definite difference. <br>  <br>  If you had sex or a vaginal exam recently, it can often cause you to lose your plug.|`|8oAlBL91aa	When your water breaks you usually know it sometimes it can be a big gush or just a light trickle like you peed your pants but either way you'll know something is up when your pants are wet.<br>  <br>  Mucous plus basically is what it sounds like it's just like a hunk of goo at least that what I hear. I do not remember losing mine with my first.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	You will know the difference, the mucus plug is green and nasty , hate to say it but it looks like someone with a bad cold blew there nose in your undies lol , water breaking is a clear liquid that will be a constant flow , you will know the difference. <br>  I made 3 false alarm visits with each pregnancy I have had 2|`|OPTDFRuzaa	your mucus plug is a jelly thing not that big and sometimes had a streak of blood through it but you may not even have one. i did not with my first and my second came out when labour had already started. Your waters will either gush out which you defo wont mistake or leak and to tell if it is your waters put a pad on and if after an hour it has soaked through that and whatever your wearing then yes its waters.|`|BzvstX7uaa	When my plug came out it was a thick chunky slimy cork lookin thing Mostly green, lightly streaked with blood. It made a big plop in the toilet so yes, there is a big difference between that and your water breaking... In my experience anyway.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	Your plug is greenish yellow with blood streaks in it. Your water breaking is like you peed on yourself but lots more fluid.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	1. Did you go into labor earlier with your second child?  It's hard for me to compare this part of my 2 pregnancies b/c I had preeclampsia w/ the 1st and had to be induced at 36 weeks.  However, I had early signs of labor starting at 30-31 weeks with both.<br>  2. Did you start to show earlier? OMG, YES!!!!!!!  8-10 weeks with my 2nd VS 3 months with my 1st<br>  3. Were your symptoms throughout pregnancy similar to your first or quite different?  VERY different.  I had no problems the 1st time.  The 2nd I had morning sickness, heartburn, gallstone issues, etc<br>  4. Did you make any lifestyle changes after your first pregnancy (regarding eating habits, exercise, etc) and find a noticeable difference in how you felt throughout/or how your labor experience went?  Not really.  I was a gym rat prior to getting pregnant the 1st time so despite gaining 70lbs both times, that labor was much easier on me.  I did pilates a lot during that pregnancy too.  (No time for that with my 2nd)<br>  4. Did you choose the same/different route for feeding your consecutive children as with your first (breast or formula)?  I succeeded w/ breast feeding much longer w/ my 2nd (more educated the 2nd time around)<br>  5. If you did breastfeed, was it easier the second time around?  Much.  My 1st was hospitalized for jaundice, weighed 6lbs, wouldn't latch, etc so that was probably a big issue there.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	A few questions on my mind...<br>  1. Did you go into labor earlier with your second child?  Yes, I had my twins at 36 weeks.  I went into labor.  My daughter came at 37 weeks.  I was not having any signs of labor with her.  I had severe kidney stone problems and had to have a stent put in one of my kidneys.  I had that put in about 4 pm on 9/18 and by 8 pm was in active labor with her.  I had a planned c-section as I had one with my boys.<br>  2. Did you start to show earlier? Yes, I was in maternity clothes at 8 weeks with my daughter....whereas with my 1st pregnancy (twins) I started wearing them at 10 weeks.<br>  3. Were your symptoms throughout pregnancy similar to your first or quite different?  Very different-not sick at all with the twins....sick LOTS with my daughter<br>  4. Did you make any lifestyle changes after your first pregnancy (regarding eating habits, exercise, etc) and find a noticeable difference in how you felt throughout/or how your labor experience went? Not really<br>  4. Did you choose the same/different route for feeding your consecutive children as with your first (breast or formula)?

If you did breastfeed, was it easier the second time around?Yes, it was much easier (but I only had one to feed this time)|`|OXIX00cDaa	A few questions on my mind...<br>  1. Did you go into labor earlier with your second child? yes<br>  2. Did you start to show earlier?  no <br>  3.

Did you make any lifestyle changes after your first pregnancy (regarding eating habits, exercise, etc) and find a noticeable difference in how you felt throughout/or how your labor experience went?  my eating habits i did not eat much a aft re. I have my 1 baby.<br>  4. Did you choose the same/different route for feeding your consecutive children as with your first (breast or formula)? my son wasformulae feed and was go to breast my 2 baby but she did not like it now if my son will I will breas.but if  he will not I will formula<br>  5. If you did breastfeed, was it easier the second time around? No I formula feed  my son and mybaby girll.. now if my son willbreastfeed it will be the 1st time I havebreastfeed|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I went into labor about 4 days later with my second pregnancy than with my first. I did show a little earlier though. Symptoms were similar in some aspects and different in others. I had a little more morning sickness, but didn't have the same aches and pains as in my first pregnancy.<br>  When I was pregnant with my second, I tended to eat more "kid type foods like PB&J, and ran around a lot more mostly chasing my almost 2 year old. other than that, I didn't really make any lifestyle changes.<br>  I tried to breastfeed my second, and although she latched on much easier than my first ( I didn't get sore at ALL!) she had a milk allergy, and had to be put on special hypoallergenic milk free soy free formula!<br>  It is really different with every pregnancy, and every woman, so you will really have to just keep an open mind. Things will be different in some ways and the same in others. Good Luck!|`|R2TnvAbfaa	Well, I'm only 26 weeks along with my 2nd, so I can only answer a few of these questions.  I did start to show much earlier.  As of now, though, I think I've slowed down and have gained about as much weight at this point in this pregnancy as with the last.  My symptoms were a little bit different.  With the first, I never felt fatigued.  With this one (especially in the first trimester), I slept all the time.  I had nausea/vomiting and hunger with both pregnancies, but this time around I was hungrier much more often and felt nauseous further into the pregnancy (it quit around 21 or 22 weeks, where with the first, I felt better around 18 weeks).  With this pregnancy, I did have some spotting around week 12, which I didn't have with the first.  No notable lifestyle changes to mention, except running after a toddler.  I am planning on breastfeeding this one, as I did with my first.  Hoping it goes easier.
Fh4B88ZGaa	Your hormone level indicates 4 weeks, not 6-7. Also, why where you given rhogam so early? Usually it is not given until the 28th week, and then again after the birth.|`|YjeehK9Jaa	if your talking about your hcg level being 633 then that is incredibly low.

I'm almost 20 weeks and have been dealing with that. My baby is fine. Normal size and everything. If there is an oxygen issue it's not due to her eating. It is likely due to the placenta not being attached properly or the cord being restricted some how.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	162 is not a bad heart rate.  if she really is in trouble the doctor should be setting up care for her to recieve nutrition through an IV.  if she cant keep anything down for several days and the doctor hasnt done anything advise her to go to the ER they will put her on an IV and get some liquid and nutrition into her.  i had a freind with that problem and she was in adn out of the hosp and on an iv for almost her whole pregnancy.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	That doesn't seem right about the heart beat.<br>  When a pregnant women doesn't eat, that means she is not only starving herself she is starving the baby. If the doctor was really worried though he would have given her a shot (they take in the butt) TMI.<br>  The shot would help her keep things down.|`|paHbLR9aaa	I think that's a pretty normal heart beat for an unborn baby.  My daughters was usually 155 bpm.  And I had morning sickness 24/7 until week 20 or so, my doctor prescribed some anti-nasuea meds.  A fetus doesn't eat.  It gets its nutrients from mommy via the umbilical cord.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I wouldn't necessarily be concerned about the heartbeat. It's common for babies to have heart rates up to 165+ (my son's was always high and he was perfectly healthy). <br>  While in utero your child takes all the nutrients from you, so for example, if a woman weren't able to take prenatals, the baby should still get vitamins (takes them from her body), but the woman would be really low everything.<br>  If the doctor was really worried about your friends/her baby's health because of her not being able to hold food/fluids down, then he should've sent her to the hospital to get IV's. It's not uncommon for women suffering from extreme pregnancy sickness to end up in the hospital to get fluids & nutrients via IV's.|`|bWvqj955aa	Sounds like she has hyperemesis gravidium.  Basically really terrible morning sickness to the point where medical intervention is necessary.  <br>  <br>  I had it in the beginning of my pregnancy - one time I threw up 18 times in 4 hours - I couldn't even keep down water and got so dehydrated I wasn't making any sense.  My husband took me to the ER and they treated me with IV fluids and anti-nausea medicine. I felt better almost immediately. My OB also prescribed a drug called Zofran which is an anti-nausea tablet typically used for chemo patients.  It is safe for baby.  Luckily, my hormones chilled out and the nausea went away for the most part by the time I was about 23 weeks.  Just waiting for baby in the next 2 weeks now! <br>  <br>  162 is not that high of a heartbeat from what I understand...<br>  <br>  Hope she starts feeling better|`|kSjHLJI8aa	um...no. my babys heartbeat was at 164 at 15 weeks and the doc said thats good. and i went yesterday and it was at 156 and i'm 19 weeks. the baby isnt struggling for air because she breathes as much as the mom does. and the babys living off whatever fat cells the mom has right now. but she does need to be eating a lot more at 17 weeks. yeah and as kendra said they give u medication for nausea. i forgot about that one. lol.
