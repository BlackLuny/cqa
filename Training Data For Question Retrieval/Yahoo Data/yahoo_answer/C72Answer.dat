AA10645437	I would say "no" though to be sure, there are many religious Christians whose support of Israel is religiously based (though that is not the same as America).<br>  <br>  The reality is that Israel is a secular Western style democracy in a similar vein as the USA and other countries. It may surprise you but the USA also gives "unwavering support" to Canada, Britain, Australia, etc. etc.<br>  Yet no one seems to have any questions about those relationships.|`|1amF7oNwaa	Possible most Christa ins probably believe that the land was given to the Jews by God.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Are we not all, one from one of the 12 tribes of Israel?|`|7BT7XYeuaa	yes and no.<br>  <br>  The main reason for the unwavering support is the fact that in the USA a lot of jews have made great successes of themselves due to the capitalistic and anti discrimination atmostphere of the USA.  You might say that the USA is the perfect economic crucible for them to do what they always do...be successful.  That success has made many of them filthy rich...and that money and wealth has been used to put pressure on politicians to make sure that they toe the line and support Israel blindly...if they want to get political donations and if they don't want to be attacked as being anti semites.<br>  <br>  Combine these truths with another, which is that the USA probably has the greatest percentage of its population of all countries that is what you might call evangelical, fundamentalist christian types..who are led by men like John Hagee, who I have seen with my own eyes on TV say that the first duty of the USA above all else..above all else....I repeat..above all else....is to support Isreal.<br>  <br>  and there you have it........

VCIZJQCJaa	congrats first of all you have been to hell and back and had to wait to hear  those magical words  the judges words. you can stay.ask your attorney to do this as he can cut through the paperwork faster.it takes 6-18 months depending on your state backup of applications meanwhile you can ask him for an application and get started on gathering all the information(that can take up to 3 months to do)like marriage divorce military documents.once you have your i.d photos done and all the gathering send it back to your attorney to submit and wait.meanwhile in immigration court you received papers -order of the immigration judge.look at the bottom and see if you are a 12c,if so that is the reason your able to stay here.make some copies of that form and carry it with you at all times and have an extra copy or two with trusted people in case you get accused of something.stay out of trouble at all costs,work if you can find a job.file taxes,and wait for the good news,it will happen just be patient
ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	No. I won't be getting any of that. Most of us Conservatives will either be dead, or reconditioned in one of the Obama training camps if we're considered an asset to the Collective. I'm not f/n round. It's already happening. Obama is moving quickly. He's taken our right to privacy away already, the Census bureau is HIS, and no one did anything, because the Liberals are all in COMPLETE control of every office of the Federal Government, the GOP have NO power. Conservatives citizens are basically alone.<br>  If you don't believe me, just wait. Think of Germany, the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, the Russian Coo under Boris Yeltson, that one happened so fast even Yeltson didn't know it.<br>  <br>  Please prepare.

Go figure.|`|4tFuosueaa	It couldn't be worse than what we have. I have heard of all the things you mentioned happening here in the U.S. too. Sometimes people have health insurance they are actually paying for and can't get care, or get stuck with the bill because their insurance decided they didn't want to cover it.  NO ONE should have to die because they can't afford health insurance. Also, NO ONE should lose everything they own because they get sick. This happens in America every day!!!|`|V8yR8BU1aa	I'm for a mixed system.<br>  <br>  I'm Canadian, from Alberta.  This province is trying very hard to initiate a mixed system, and I certaintly hope it works out.<br>  <br>  Not that our health care is atrocious or anything.  Most of the stuff you guys hear of are honestly horror stories.  There are wait lines, but they're not near as ridiculous as the claims I've seen on CNN (at least in my neck of the woods anyways).  I still need health insurance for my asthma medication, it's not as though it's completely free and "nationalized".  The unions in the medical profession also tick me off, but that's a whole different story all together.<br>  <br>  I think it's much more accurate to take a look at the time when natioanl health systems wer emade... most of the population was young and healthy, meds didn't cost nearly as much, and long term diseases such as most cancers were not fully understood and not nearly as rampant.  Now in North America we have an aging population, and more understandings of diseases meaning we have more long-term patients. <br>  <br>  It stretches the system no matter how you slice it.  I think that a mixed public-private partnership would be preferrable in this circumstance.  That way you can reach a deal where you can assure that everyone is getting proper health care, and you've limited the fiscal stretch of the province (or state, or whatever where you come from).  <br>  <br>  I don't understand why in America anything adopted by the State is viewed as evil... I don't understand why in Canada the words "privatization" and "health care" don't belong in the same sentence.  Why must either of us go to extremes?  I think a nice middle ground stance is in order here.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Thanks for letting us know about how things are in the UK<br>  <br>  I feel your pain<br>  <br>  The doctors in this country are also going to feel the pain if we go<br>  <br>  full blown socialized medicine.<br>  <br>  We have sky high insurance premiums because people file to many<br>  <br>  lawsuits against the doctors.<br>  <br>  I wonder how this is going to be~can people still sue these doctors<br>  <br>  in a socialized program?<br>  <br>  I think you said a lot for us Yanks to think about~Thanks again for your<br>  input|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  Now look at the facts.

I was young and seemingly healthy and lived a commute away from the city in which I worked.<br>  <br>  Unbeknowst to me, my union canceled my insurance after I refused to accept a Kaiser plan that was only offered in the city where I worked.  Seems they offered the PPO plan, but did not want anyone to accept the PPO plan.  Something I later learned they had done to about 7 of us who lived outside of town - not enough for a class action suit.<br>  <br>  I was in fact continually sick.  Going to the doctor monthly over the course of a year & a half.  Always told I was a stress case.  Occasionally told there was a problem w/ my insurance, which my union continually denied.  I always believed the doctors at Sutter North were mistaken.  The insurance company, BC/BS repeatedly told me I needed to talk to my union.  The teamster's always told me they the insurance company was mistaken and they would handle it.  I always in the end, believe them.  They were taking a large sum out of my check and for God's sake, I was a TEAMSTER!<br>  <br>  ...and this went round and round and round.<br>  <br>  I finally got so sick I went out on disability under my doctor's care who ran several tests on me revealing a large gallstone, but who insisted I was just a stress case and the gallstone was not causing my symptoms.  And, occasionally mentioned casually that there was a problem w/ my insurance which my union continued to deny.<br>  <br>  I was a bedridden 'stress case' for 10 weeks until, I woke up one morning, hunched over in pain, dry heaving.  My gallbladder had burst, the stone had out grown it, leaving it necrotic.  I almost died, spent 8 hours in surgery, 4 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics, took another 2 months to get my strength back up to where I could return to work, was fired by Hertz immediately upon going back to work for 'unexcused absences' related to my disability.  Had had to file umpteen complaints w/ numerous state agencies and Teamster's National while on my disability in order to get needed prescription and my medical bills paid.  Had no recourse against Hertz bc they were unionized and my termination was union blessed.  Had no recourse against the union bc no lawyer would take the case w/ out 10k down.  Had no recourse against my doctors bc how could I expect them to perform surgery on me when I had no coverage?<br>  <br>  In the end, it was best I got fired bc it took a full year of my life to get my strength back up to a point where I could work full time.<br>  <br>  This is what is currently happening in our country to the uninsured, even those uninsured by no fault of their own when they, also, make too much for state medical.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Well that can't be true, you hear about all those people that swim to england for hea....wait a minute- everyone comes HERE for healthcare|`|yJE7INkUaa	I think there should be free heathcare, but if you want a privitized heath care and you can afford it you should have that option.

But our system needs help. It has become very burdensome in cost. There are many reasons for this. That is where I wish the government would offer their help. Having the government make your medical decisions will be worse than the HMO's. Why does it cost so much? High cost of a medical education, malpractice insurance, medicines, medical equipment. So, what if it cost significantly less to get a medical degree and a nursing degree? What if  the cost of malpractice insurance did not cost so much. What if hospitals and medical equipment did not cost so much. Would that not result in much more affordable health care? Seem to me that what I hear over the years is "we want affordable health care". So, make it affordable. Is the government spending trillions going to make it better? No. How much of that will be wasted? Look at government programs now. How much waste and fraud is there? Very scary, and some people want these clowns in charge of their medical care.

I now live in Perth, Western Australia. Last week I gashed my arm and had to have seven stitches in it. I was in and out of Perth Royal in under 3 hours, paid not a cent, and had a cute female doctor stitch me up whilst telling me jokes. In the UK & Sweden I have been hospitalized a number of times for bone breakages, dislocations, and the occasional bout of unconsciousness (the perils of being a Sunday League goalkeeper). I was treated promptly and efficiently, and the only cost I ever bore was the standard prescription charge for drugs/painkillers, which then was the equivalent of $10US. I got an ear infection after scuba diving in Cuba, and was in & out of hospital in under an hour, paying about $5US in antibiotics. In the USA I spent a night in hospital in Santa Barbara for a viral infection. The first question I was asked was my name, The second was did I have insurance. Luckily I did, but there was no doubt if I'd said no I'd have been slung out with no treatment. You may have noticed the other 4 nations I mentioned all have socialized medicine. So as an experienced traveller who has seen the various types of helthcare the world has to offer, all I can say is stick your US-style healthcare up your ar$e.

Obesity, smoking, diabetes, high risk pregnancy and other preventable diseases are eating our health care dollars up and yet, doing nothing to cure the problem.  This continued bleeding of health care dollars is leaving nothing for those catastrophic diseases that can't be prevented and leaving American citizens to die because they can't afford health care.  You can pour all the money you want into taking care of the catastrophic illnesses however, if you don't find a cure for society and those preventable diseases, you will never have enough health care dollars available.|`|1amF7oNwaa	Insurance companies are in the business of spreading costs of unexpected events and have been around for a long time.<br>  <br>  Most people cannot afford to pay for the cost of major health illnesses and that is where health insurance comes in.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Health insurance does not prevent people from getting sick.

That’s because when the crisis began, the insurance rates rose and people began to save money on visits to doctors and medication. As for the unemployed, they have lost health insurance completely. The government is trying to rescue the situation using the same principles that caused the medical industry to go into crisis in the first place: allocating funds to exalt the ego, which is the only cause of the crisis.<br>  <br>  What do I mean? The motivation to make more money has become more important than the right relationship between the patient and the doctor. Modern medicine is founded on the profit principle. It’s not about how effective it is, but about how much profit it brings. Therefore, there’s no trust between the doctor and the patient. The patient suspects that the doctor wants to make money off of him rather than cure him, and the doctor is afraid of being sued for malpractice because the patient wants to profit from the doctor’s mistake. Therefore, the very principle of modern medical insurance is based on profit rather than care for the patient. It’s all arranged so people will pay for the insurance, but never actually use it.<br>  <br>  And here’s how health insurance used to work in ancient times: About 4000 years ago in China, a healer would make his rounds around the village every morning. A vase was mounted by the entrance to every house. He would reach his hand into the vase and take out a coin. If the coin was there, this meant that everyone in the house was healthy. If there was no coin in the vase, it meant that someone there was sick. So the healer would come inside and treat the sick person to the best of his ability. In this case, the herbs, needles and other medical supplies were paid for by the coin that was not put in the vase.<br>  <br>  In his free time, the healer would go into people’s houses to make sure that their diets and lifestyles were healthy. Whoever wouldn’t comply with the rules of the insurance (such as being too lazy to exercise every morning, for example) would be excluded from the healer’s daily rounds.<br>  <br>  So, the principle of health insurance was opposite then to what it is today. People paid money to help keep others healthy, and the person who was ill did not have to pay.<br>  <br>  My Comment: It’s clear that we have to do everything possible to stop medicine from being a business. Doctors’ first and foremost concern should be for their patients to become healthy, rather than for the patients to remain sick for as long as possible!<br>  <br>  In ancient times, people’s egoism was very small, and therefore the health insurance practiced in ancient China was possible in a small village. However, now we are dealing with a global problem and people have an enormous egoism. The only way to create a correct medical system under these circumstances is by correcting people’s egoism, so everyone will want everyone else to be healthy, just like in one family.<br>  <br>  The crisis will show us how interdependent we all are. Then we will set up health insurance that will actually benefit humanity<br>  <a href="http://www.laitman.com/category/health/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laitman.com/category/health/</a>|`|c63c1a8a3f313613d03647643c55dd58aa	They take all your money so you can't afford to buy another bag of Dorito's..........

The crisis has many contributors. Carter created the sub-prime mortgage market. Clinton expanded the sub-prime market which has since imploded. Clinton also oversaw the most reckless spending period (consumer spending) in American history. We the people went from big cars to small cars to giant SUV's. We the people caused ourselves to be caught in the biggest money transfer in history (to buy foreign oil). We the people bought the cheap imports costing millions of jobs and trillions in lost wages and revenues. George Bush invaded Iraq (good or bad we are there and it cost billions). obama spends a trillion with nothing to show for it with plans to spend trillions more. Our younger generation feels a sense of entitlement. They did not see the hard work and sacrifice it took to build this great nation.

The Pope is refusing to comment, but a Vatican spokesman later issued a statement saying: "We've conducted our own investigation, and concluded that the kid is making the whole thing up. Most likely, he's just trying to get a piece of the trillions of dollars in assets we're sitting on, paid for by contributions from ignorant, abjectly poor third-world parishioners we exploit."|`|eCGg94HJaa	It's a good job altar boys & choirboys can't get pregnant, or the catholic church would have had an awful lot of rape induced abortions to deal with before now|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Only a Liberal can scale the value of human life.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	way to go Nazi pope!...... wow.....I thought we were against babies having babies....|`|9LgNlh8Uaa	No I do not agree- that child should be able to have an abortion in peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have no problem with abortion for victims of rape or incest or when it is medically necessary to save the life of the mother.|`|RyU5XDmuaa	Right<br>  <br>  Canadian, ay?|`|sfjMv6bdaa	thats messed up..|`|T2WPvUc1aa	I am generally against abortion, but in cases like this they have good reason to do the abortion. Even if the church considers aborting the fetus to be taking a life, the girl's life was also in danger. Who are they to say that the life of the fetus is more important than the life of the girl? I do not think that abortion should be completely illegal, because of cases like this.<br>  However, when abortion is just used as a way to carelessly discard a child that someone willingly conceived due to their promiscuity, this is wrong. There is a HUGE difference between a child who is raped, and a grown woman who refuses to use birth control, and decides after several months to have an abortion. <br>  Abortion should not be an option to someone who decides to have sex without birth control, and then decides three or four months later, to abort the baby. That is just plain wrong.<br>  There are so many methods of birth control available to women, and they even have the morning after pill. Abortion is frequently used just to avoid the responsibility of not having taken precautions BEFORE having sex. <br>  That is NOT what abortion should be used for. It should be used only when necessary, and in the case of this little girl it was necessary. It should be a MEDICAL decision in those cases, not the church's or government's.<br>  Of course all of you pro choicers will forever argue, that you have a right to do whatever you want to with your own body. Yes, you do have that right. You have the right to use your BRAIN to PREVENT the pregnancy in the first place. You have a right to use birth control, and have the right to use the morning after pill. Once you have gone two to three months or more, it's not just YOUR body anymore. At that point it is the body of the BABY inside of you that depends on YOU to keep it alive.<br>  And, more food for thought. I have NEVER heard a pregnant woman say, "hey guess what I'm going to have a fetus." They say they are going to have a BABY, right from the beginning of their pregnancy. Once that fetus has grown to the point where it has arms and legs, and moves and kicks inside of a woman, it IS another human being, no matter how you look at it.|`|ivsKcwwvaa	The really messed up thing, is the Vatican and the liberals both go out of their way to insure the scumbags that commit these crimes, go on living|`|yAsLhdp2aa	generally pro life advocates support abortion when the idividual is a victum of rape/incest or the abortion needs to be preformed for the sake of the mothers health.<br>  <br>  the vatican is corrupt in more ways than 1.  to not allow a 9 year old child to have an abortion due to a brutal rape, compared to supporting planed parenthood through out all of africa.

Don't know about vehicles, you probably can buy one but the DMV is a screwey institution, they hate everyone.|`|hwVeNGRmaa	Yes and no. Yes if the military did change and alter the equipment in order to be put into a position where if has no military secrets or deadly firepower left on the equipment and it the military signed off on the asset in an effort to sell it. The military needs to sell old equipment and parts to other third world countries as well as the private sector in order to write the equipment off as a liability on their accounting side of things and to make room for newer more up to date equipment. Everyday the military sells old equipment and they usually contract these efforts out to private auction companies and companies who specialize in used equipment sales.<br>  <br>  So once the military approves it for private sale, you can sell it but not before. I bought and sold 12 ex-military humvees which were once the military;s however, only after they signed off on it and allowed me to buy it and sell some of it.<br>  <br>  Other countries do this as well. I know where someone can go buy used MIGs from the Russians. These are hot little aircraft. The secret it to buy three of these. One to up keep and restore and the others used to pull used parts off in order to put in the restored aircraft. These old MIGs were being sold for $25,000 a piece a few years ago. But every country does this.|`|YPLydxcXaa	Well if you were wanting to sell military surplus such as blankets,MREs toiletries,youd be ok..however the US is very concerned with the spread of terroism abroad, and also has several nations on a list of places not supposed to be able to buy weapons or technologies as well as serious restrictions on who can and cant buy military style heavy weapons/technology ..to sell things like tanks helios munitions etc abroad you going to be very illegal unless you completely comply with what you can and cant sell and to whom. standard policy is only goverment agents can deal in that sort of equippment and then only with proper representitives of another goverment..so under most circumstances what you do is illegal,here and in most foriegn nations as well.|`|H2ynm1geaa	Uh dude, don't do it.

Neither the witnesses nor the notary can potentially benefit in any way from the execution of the power of attorney.  You should always use disinterested third parties as witnesses and as the notary.  A power of attorney is a very powerful (no pun intended) document, and every effort should be made to make its execution beyond question.

A society is a group of people gathered together for a common purpose.  A basketball team is a society.  A couple of guys meet every 3rd Wednesday of the month for poker.  That is a society.  A family is a society.  A church is a society.  The state is a society.  Each society has certain goals, certain rules.  In a poker club the rules may not be formally stated, but all the members know the rules.  In a nation state the rules would be in the laws enacted by the government of the nation.  In a family members look out for the welfare of the other members of the family.  Now that is theory and practice.

Too many people want to point to bad behavior to excuse other bad behavior. Why, you say can you ever blame Obama, I guess you didn't pay attention to all his hype about being for change, giving us real hope...all he has done is spend more than any other president in history. His porkage will not sustain job grow, it is simply a band aid for votes. I blame all democrats who fought against regulation of the lending giants, I blame sheeple who are too lazy to research the facts, following a false Messiah.

Considering the democrats(Frank, Dodd and Waters..oh my!) who told Bush he was full of it when W told them that Freddie and Fannie were on dangerous ground a year or so ago.  Obama did see fit to take the lion share of the political contributions from Freddie and Fannie.  Keep in mind that Obama was in the Senate and can't be held blameless for the economy tanking.  What should concern us is the reuse of failed economic policies that bombed under FDR, LBJ, and Carter.  Clinton didn't even try to go that far!

From it's beginning to it's end, the African Slave trade was run by African Kings. Slavery in Africa was only abolished after the British established colonies. <br>  <br>  American Merchants were barely involved in the Tran-Atlantic Slave Trade.That involvement was for a very short time compared to the Dutch, Portuguese or British involvement.  Congress banned the importation of slaves into the United States in 1808<br>  <br>  The War for Independence didn't end until 1783. It took years before the American Merchant fleet was built up enough and the American economy had recovered enough to participate in the Slave Trade. <br>  <br>  The vast majority of American Slaves were the descendants of slaves who had been imported under British rule after being purchased from African Kings. <br>  <br>  Of course, it is much more profitable to sue the United States government then it would be to attempt to track down the decendents of overthrown African monarchs and attempt to sqeeze money out of them.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	They dont call it reparations for the indians.<br>  <br>  Maybe we should be giving out plane tickets back to Africa to those who are pissed about being here.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Land was stolen from Native Americans years and years ago.<br>  <br>  Slaves were sold from Africa.<br>  <br>  What reparations should current black Americans recieve?

That caused increased prices which still have yet to come down despite gas prices dropping.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	greed and corruption in Wallstreet combined with greed and corruption in the housing markets had a pretty big hand in it.|`|B1XT60WEaa	no- It really was caused by only one thing period.

What on earth is that supposed to mean?<br>  <br>  If you are going to compare two things, it's helpful not to just drop the two things on the ground like a dog when it does its business.  You have to define your terms and explain what you think the basis for your comparison is.  Otherwise you're not really saying anything.<br>  <br>  But if you're talking about Nazism, then the answer is clear.  anyone who thinks Obama is like Hitler is incredibly, almost supernaturally stupid.|`|lsuT5whmaa	I have studied a great deal about WWII!

vCZuh3oDaa	More money, more time spent rainmaking, longer vacations, better work quality with bigger clients|`|x6easjsvaa	More money, prestige, and you can tell more junior people what to do.  Also, becoming a partner is like being part of a special "club" made up of the leaders at the firm.  <br>  <br>  But there are plenty of downsides -- more travel, more time committment in some ways, more responsibility.  People will be looking to you to bring in business to make the firm profitable.  Also, if the firm isn't profitable, your pay is affected because you're an owner of the firm, rather than just an employee.  So, there is some risk too.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	ask the partners before accepting.
ENXSD68Naa	I see your point. You want them to only search terrorists so as not to waste time.|`|qbzt3r4xaa	Am not exactly sure what you going on about n what point it is that you trying to make... i dont think there is anyone who wouldnt agree to the police carrying out their job. Its best to be safe than sorry and they are looking after your interests as well as their own. <br>  As for your questionin to, why you and not someone else, is of no relevance. What may be of importance is that  attitude which the police show within that procedure. <br>  Positive attitude in respect with patience for any disagreement is a must. Its unfortunate, how your feeling for this situation are in bad taste.. perhaps more for the police force.<br>  Hope they look after you more next time..lol. We all react differently.<br>  BUT the job is for the police.|`|iFmMR2rOaa	I understand it's frustrating, but you might have been a suicide bomber, like those who killed 55 people on the London Underground.

These plastics are paid a hefty salary to walk around looking good and stop such as you at "random" to check if you might be a terrorist. These plastics have nil brains so to say they chose at random is a lie because they are all following orders from bosses.They are overpaid twits who should all be replaced by real officers and these officers should be out on our streets fighting the crimes which are already there and out of control instead of stuck in stations under mountains of paperwork .This is just slimy Brown's way of trying again to pull the wool over the eyes of the gullible folks and make them think he is ahead of the game. At the end of the day if you had been a terrorist  and you did have a bomb in your bag you would have blown up the train not waited until the plastics checked your bag outside.I hate to say this but I wonder how many ethnic looking people were stopped that day at the station ?????? We mustn't have the plastics looking racist !! These CSOs are the ones who give the real hardworking police officers a bad name.<br>  Edit... PCSO's actually earn ￡17,500 -￡19,500 rising on an incremental scale...I call that pretty good seeing as they have very little powers.|`|kLkzBbeAaa	I am a trucker and with us it is called a roadside inspection I just got one the other day and if everything is up to par they are supposed to give you a report to turn into your terminal good for 5,000 safety points but when I asked for it the state trooper told me he didn't have time for that everything was good and to go about my business, not fair but life is not fair.|`|2COaydcfaa	Ive seen this happen in a train station. As someone passing by it just scared me. It did,nt make me feel better|`|SSlz82Djaa	I think in that particular situation (leaving a station) it was wrong. <br>  I don't think I'd like it either. <br>  I also wonder how many terrorists would be caught with random searches? Better odds of winning the lottery I reckon! <br>  <br>  I think they should put the effort into real police work such as solving crimes and catching criminals instead of 'meeting targets' and performing stupid tasks such as bag searches with the teeniest, tiniest possibility of catching an actual bomber on their way to blow something up.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that us law abiding citizens - who pay their wages btw - have to put up with crap like that.

GHD8JicSaa	Allotments usually start the pay day after the paperwork is done,  they do not do "retroactive."   The allotment system requires Direct Deposit to a bank account so he would have to have all your information to arrange it.  (Tracking number,  bank account number, etc).   It is also not "user friendly."   If he needs to make a change to it, it takes a while to do.  If he is deployed it will be even harder.  <br>  <br>  A better approach would be for him to get a checking account and set up a direct payment to you.  That way if he has excess money he can make a quick change and either increase it or just send you an extra check or two. All he will have to do is have internet banking and he can make a change at any time over the internet,  even from the war zone.<br>  <br>  <br>  You might seriously consider getting married ASAP. What are you going to do if he is deployed and you get sick? Do you have health coverage? If you are married, you do. Also if you are married you will have an ID card and can easily get on base to shop at the commissary (no sales tax) and exchange. Also if you are married the service will make an effort to keep you in the loop as a spouse. They could care less about "girl friends."<br>  <br>  Do not forget to get your kids on DEERs since she is his dependent. She at least should be able to get medical care even if you do not want it.|`|qXFACB58aa	Do what's best for your daughter|`|SsB7aRExaa	An allocation is simply a deduction from his check that is sent to whomever he designates.

It will come as a check, or possibly, as a direct deposit to your bank.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Allotments are paid on the 1st of each month, so if he sets it up now then it will be paid into the account on the 1st of April.  It will be fully deducted from his pay on the 1st.  This is if he sets it up before March 23rd.  If he sets it up after that then it will not start being deducted from his pay until the 15th of April and paid out to your account on the 1st of May.

When you are on school property you have no privacy or real rights anymore. It is not a right but a priviledge to be at a public or private school. If you break the rules they can expel you which means you have to go to private school or vice verse.<br>  <br>  They will most likely give it back to your parents if they request it.|`|o1PuFnWmaa	In my kid's school they do it.  In order to get it back your parents have to come get it.  I think that's the way it should be.  Rules are rules, and if they are broken, the person breaking them needs to deal with the consequences.  <br>  <br>  There are quite a few schools though where the policy is that they can't take it away, only tell you to put it away.  I hate those schools, too PC for me.

ZTc7rE1Haa	I agree with what you wrote. I don't agree with all of the BNP's policies, but then I don't agree 100% with any party's policies, so I might well vote BNP in the future. I certainly agree with what they have to say about islam, and that would be enough to make me vote for them as islam is the biggest threat we've faced in decades. I think they should be given a chance. If they don't deliver they can be voted out again at the next election.|`|HskD8XYOaa	Your dead right. But only when people start voting for the BNP will the other parties realise the strength of opinion about this in the country. You dont have to be a BNP supporter, or even like them to give a protest vote.

AA11707728	30 states have passed resolutions affirming state soviegnty and denying almost all federal authority (including denying most federal laws are legal).  Several of Obama's plans are mentioned specifically as not being allowed in that state.  One state (indiana) is planning to print its own currency (indiana honest money act).  Three states (texas, montana and alaska) have raised their own state armies (something that has not been done since before WW I).

Rome was founded in about 750 BC when the Etruscans were at the height of their civilization.  Yet Rome conquered the entire civilized world, and the Etruscan civilization disappeared.  Why was this?  The Romans were UNITED.  Do not talk of civil war, unless you want to destroy everything we have.  Be like a sapling, bend with the breezes.  Mighty branches and trees fall because they are not flexible.  Be patient, today's storms will pass.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	There should be a revolution. If there is a civil war, we will only end up destroying ourselves. The Libs, Cons, and Indies need to fight for a single cause, and that is for the preservation of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and to repeal every single law that weaken habeas corpus, and our civil liberties. We need to restore the idea of having diplomacy, not war, spend less, reduce the size of government, and bring more power back to the states, and the people.

We have no idea what crimes these people have committed in their own countries and came here to evade the law. <br>  As for our security,if we can't control our own borders,how safe and secure do you think we are. We have no idea who is coming across the border and what they are bringing with them.|`|ShatBd6Oaa	Immigrants come in two varieties: documented and undocumented.<br>  <br>  As long as an immigrant comes through the front door, completely documented, I have no problem with them.<br>  <br>  However, undocumented immigrants have flouted the laws of the land in order to be here. I find that very disturbing. We are a nation of laws. People who cannot enter by the rules will probably not play by the rules when they are here.<br>  <br>  We have a real problem with illegal immigration. It causes excess strain on our social services, creates problems in our schools, and leaves our borders open to illegal activities.<br>  <br>  Yes, immigration, unregulated, poses a threat to our safety and security.|`|tvWm1e4naa	In every country there are immigrants and based on what i know<br>  they left their country for the hope of finding a better future.<br>  Most immigrants that i see are hardworking people because they need to survive so their focus is  their work and lives and they have no time to mess with other people's lives. <br>  In a way they are a threat .. to those who are lazy. <br>  As for safety, the governement already screened them. The gov't. check their backgrounds and they should also pass  the medical check up before they can come here.<br>  As for illegal immigrants, that i don't know. I think  since they are already here, it is best to legalize them so that they will have records here and the government can trace them if ever they did something bad. And  so that they can pay their taxes too.|`|AA10815904	I guess the criminal ones are. The problem is until they get caught we really don't know which ones are the bad guys until they are.<br>  <br>  Actually they pose a threat to our economy.

If Obama does go through with this alleged gun ban, whose to say they will not cross over the border. I think we are not entirely protected. And plus, they could bring the guns over.

"Pure communism" in the Marxian sense refers to a classless, stateless and oppression-free society where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made democratically, allowing every member of society to participate in the decision-making process in both the political and economic spheres of life.<br>  Communism is a branch off of socialism, they both look great on paper, but human nature can not be defined just on paper.  The reason why both communism and socialism are bad is it deprives individual freedoms.  Those basic freedoms take place for the common good.  The reason why this has never work is people simply do not have a ideological behavior, instead we are greedy, genius, compassionate, merciless and a wide variety of contradictions.  It is impossible to destroy individual personality.  Despite all the soviet indoctrination and social studies to determine how to create ideal people for the ideal society.

People are programmable, we can be conditioned, taught and mentored, but we can not be controlled.  China the last standing Communist state is no longer a true communist state.  Its market have loosened up and become more capitalistic since the return of Hong Kong. China studied the Hong Kong economics and found that when you let individuals produce and keep wealth.

Our animal ancestors shared in the spoils, from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.  It made sense when we lived in small tightly related bands.  Nothing belonged to an individual.  Whatever the group killed or collected everybody ate.  Nothing they created lasted, nor could much be carried.  Property as we understand it did not exist.  <br>  <br>  It took millenniums for humans to learn all the tools that make a modern society possible.  Without division of labor and specialization we could never accomplish what we can today.  Without private property it would be impossible to create and improve tools.  Nobody would maintain anything as they wouldn't have motive to do so.  Without the tolerance of individualism we would never have developed culture and arts.  What can the imagination accomplish if all thoughts must be agreeable to all the minds.<br>  <br>  Somewhere along the line people got lost, when the world no longer made sense, they just fell back to their default programming.

"Pure communism" in the Marxian sense refers to a classless, stateless and oppression-free society where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made democratically, allowing every member of society to participate in the decision-making process in both the political and economic spheres of life.<br>  <br>  As a political ideology, communism is usually considered to be a branch of socialism; a broad group of economic and political philosophies that draw on the various political and intellectual movements with origins in the work of theorists of the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution.[4] Communism attempts to offer an alternative to the problems with the capitalist market economy and the legacy of imperialism and nationalism. Marx states that the only way to solve these problems is for the working class (proletariat), who according to Marx are the main producers of wealth in society and are exploited by the Capitalist-class (bourgeoisie), to replace the bourgeoisie as the ruling class in order to establish a free society, without class or racial divisions.[2] The dominant forms of communism, such as Leninism, Stalin-ism, Maoism and Trotsky-ism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as Christian communism and anticommunism) also exist.<br>  <br>  The problem with communism is...who's in charge?  Ideally it would be a purely democratic state...unfortunately humans are far from ideal.  Therefore the state would have to control everything and freedom/liberty would be taken from the people in an effort to make everything be "fair"...but what is "fair"?  Also as an economic system communism destroys the incentive to excel.  Why bother to strive to improve things?  This would destroy the human spirit...our innate sense to thrive and become better would be replace by an apathetic sense of stagnation and acceptance.<br>  <br>  Historically communism has been nothing more than an aggressive, militaristic form of socialism...and has led to nothing but 3rd world status for nations choosing to employ this socioeconomic and political system.  The Soviet Union failed miserably.  China is progressively working its way toward capitalism.

Christians adhere to the New Testament as their spiritual guide and instruction.  St. Paul wrote: <br>  “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.<br>  For no man every hates his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one.’ This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the church; however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband” (Ephesians 5th Chapter, 25th through 33rd verses,)<br>  <br>  There are not pro-gay scriptures for a Christian to wrap their head or belief around, but there are proscriptions.  As St. Paul describes marriage, it appears sacred, and one would hope to achieve such a marriage in the full manner described therein.  Of couse, if it were, the %'s would be better.  In hoping to follow a spiritual path to marriage as described in the Christian scriptures, it would be difficult for any man or woman to want to encourage or support a departure from the scriptures of his/her faith, including those that characterize marriage.  <br>  I don't know of any, if there are any, Christian scriptures that address the other issues that you mention, i.e. Christians and Non-Christians, Jews and Muslims.

I know your question is aimed at Christians, but I think my perspective may add insight. <br>  Unfortunately, many gays align themselves with Marxists, who have long accepted them. Marxists believe that people should share everything, based on their abilities. If a traditional married couple has several children, then it would of their ability to forfeit one of their children to a gay couple who wants a child, but can not have one on their own. In many states, single people can not adopt children by law. Therefore, gays must be legally married to adopt children.<br>  Also, many of the social workers are Marxists and will remove children with no cause because they believe a child would be better off with gay, in some cases more affluent couple. This is going on and cases like this have been documented.<br>  So, it is not really an issue of what defines a marriage, I personally could care less if 2 gay people are happy and want to get married. This is an adoption agenda, and is very dangerous to the rights of good, traditional families.

U95m4LhAaa	The federal law makes it unlawful to record telephone conversations except in one party consent cases which permit one party consent recording by state law. What that means is a person can record their own telephone conversations without the knowledge or consent of the other party in those states that allow one party consent. <br>  <br>  It's important to understand the difference between what has become known as one party consent and two party or all party consent. One party consent simply means that one party to the conversation must have knowledge and give consent to the recording.

Great info.  I often record calls for my job - witness interviews, etc.  <br>  <br>  I wrote a "how to" article that goes over how to Record Calls.  Not an advertisement for a product - just a step by step deal.  Take a look if you like.  It also has a link to State by State law.  However, Queenie is right on target with her answer.
RzBH6lHMaa	It's obvious the other people who responded didn't even read the article, because it specifically says the prayers were STUDENT LED, and that the coach was being told to not participate in the STUDENT LED prayers. If the coach was forcing kids to participate in prayer, then sure, that would be the same as forcing people to not pray, but that's not the case. The coach wasn't even the one initiating the prayer, he simply wanted to participate in the prayer that the students were having.<br>  <br>  Is it hypocritical? Of course. Is there anything you can do about it? Probably not. For now, we have to live in a world that rejects God, but remember that we will eventually live in a world where everyone worships God. Don't feel bad for the coach though, he’s not the one you should be worried for, those who wish to stifle his freedom to worship God are the ones you should be worried for.|`|Jq5WK8caaa	It is not a endorsement it is a denial.  Pure and simple.  The student is not a employee of the state and is mandated by law to attend school, so in affect the state has made a law prohibiting religion.  This would be a interesting case at the supreme court level.  As for the coach, since he is a state employee the can prohibit activities while he is working.  But that is not to say he can not pray on his own.  Atheism is not a religion, the coach can participate in religious activities with the students during church functions, any attempt to prohibit the coach from practicing his religion while not working would be a direct violation of his rights.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	The **teacher** (paid by the govt.) can't lead a prayer.<br>  <br>  That doesn't endorse atheism, it makes sure govt. employees aren't establishing a preferred religion. (which they are banned from doing under the constitution).|`|oVmGcRVtaa	All students do not practice the same religion, would be a good place to start.  If you were a Roman Catholic would you feel comfortable being expected to recite the Lords Prayer if it was the King James version?<br>  <br>  What if you were not Christian if you were Jewish would you feel comfortable?<br>  <br>  Religion or prayers have no place in public schools.<br>  <br>  You want to pray before a test then pray to your god in silence, no one will say a thing.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	It is not an endorsement of atheism.<br>  <br>  As a theist, you can pray in school (silently)<br>  You can pray at home, in the car, at work, at church, etc.<br>  You are free to pray whenever and wherever you want.<br>  No one is forcing you to be an atheist.<br>  <br>  If there is organized, audible prayer in schools I, as an atheist, am forced to endure your religion being forced upon me.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Because the default state isn't "let's have religion in the schools."  You don't have to introduce "the absence of religion" through any positive action.  You're not supporting atheism by actually paying attention to the Constitution and keeping religion out of public schools where it doesn't belong.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Whose religeous prayers do you use?

3YRrGfkiaa	He'd have to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who were willing to overturn the decision in Roe v. Wade.  And that's not something that happens overnight.|`|XowM9e7Naa	No, it would not be practical to do so.   It would not be popular to drum up a movement to do so.  The president does not have the powers to do so.  It can be overturned by the Supreme Court reversing its decision or by a constitutional amendment (that will not happen).  If the attitude of the American public changes overwhelmingly, the supreme court with different men might reverse the decision.|`|eu6UQElYaa	The only steps they can take really are to appoint like minded Supreme Court Justices into a majority role in the Supreme Court who could then decide to take steps to try and overturn Roe v. Wade.
AuWHIJPKaa	Theoretically, yes, Venezuela is a democracy in which Hugo Chávez is the president. However, he unsucessfully tried to remove the balance of power.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Venezuela citizens vote, and they apparently like Socialism and Nationalism. Of course, sometimes more than half don't trust Chavez's motives; he sneaked by this past election on term limits.  The problem he faces, thus his People, is the need for $80 a barrel oil to finance his Socialist programs. Look for armed unrest in the future.|`|ERVib5gYaa	do you think that hugo chavez's government a democracy?..<br>  I dont get it?<br>  Not sure what you mean but he is for socialism (not to keen on that) & democracy & doesn't want globalization.. he doesnt seem too bad.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Hugo Chavez's hates America thats enough for me to hate him|`|RbSa5YNSaa	Bill Clinton did not have sex with that woman.

The economy is so bad that here are so many poor people that Socialism looks very good to them. Chavez nationalized much of the industry such as the oil industry and then uses the money to buy the allegiance of all those poor masses. Under these circumstances he now has had those same people and his appointed ministers remove "Term Limits" for the president! All done by Democracy (Vote of the people) Next will be a new election and change it to President for life AKA Dictator! Then he will be able to ignore the masses as he will no longer need them!<br>  <br>  Yes Democracy used as a road to Dictatorship. I fear this is the same plan Obama has for America. The difference here is we are not a Democracy but rather a Republic. Made up of 50 Democratic states! To change our constitution requires a 3/4 majority of both houses of Congress and then Ratification of 75% of the States! Very difficult to do. Under this method, the President has no say whatsoever in amending the constitution. Than God for small favors! Our founding father forsaw this possibility And made it a very difficult thing to do!<br>  <br>  You gave us a "Quick History lesson so here is a quick current event lesson: March 5, 2009:<br>  <br>  “It has become customary for the Chávez administration to launch new offensives after each election,” according to VenEconomy, a consulting firm that provides financial, political, and economic data. It seems Chávez is using his narrow “mandate” to press forward with the government takeover of the economy. "With today's victory, we start the third cycle of the Bolivarian revolution, from 2009 to 2019," Chávez explained after winning the right to run for office again. But his revolution is already showing its fruits: shortages, poverty, more government and less freedom. What Chávez really means is he will continue doing his best to give out free goodies — the source of much of his political support. But with oil prices back down after reaching record heights last year, Chávez’s coffers are no longer bursting with oil money.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the inflation and the most recent onslaught of state force will cause Venezuelans to think twice before casting their vote for Chávez again. The results of his policies are becoming increasingly obvious as time goes on. So, it is to be hoped that the Venezuelan people will wake up before Chávez and the government entirely destroy the economy and turn it into another Cuba. Who knows what Chávez would do if he won yet another election or referendum."<br>  <br>  <br>  Complete article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-mainmenu-26/south-america-mainmenu-37/858" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-main...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Proud Vet|`|3f7UV5zDaa	You need a lesson in history and you should keep up with current events as well.

Obama has been in office for less than two months and in that span of time, he has been proven to be a hypocrite and liar ("no lobbyists in MY White House"; cutting the budget; cutting the deficit to name just a few). Moreover, his pending policies are not only sure to be unsuccessful, but blatantly unAmerican and unConstitutional. The "stimulus package" is filled with hundreds of billions (seriously, hundreds of billions) of dollars in ear-marks. What's more, a bill designed to create jobs is filled with money allocated to repairing schools, fighting the drug war, increasing broadband access and countless other useless (job-creation-wise) measures. The point of the stimulus is not ensuring the everyone can look at porn faster on the internet, the point is making sure that everyone can find a job, make money and then SPEND that money in our economy. As far as unConstitutional policies go, can you say Fairness Doctrine? (err, excuse me, "diversity in ownership"). Collect taxes, print money, protect my life, protect my liberty. Those are the four jobs the Federal government has. For a former practitioner of Constitutional law, Obama sure has a lot of learning to do.|`|nx7QtF0paa	The big deal is, America is dead and you no longer have the right to your opinion if you don't agree with the dear leader....  if you don't want Obama to succeed then you're just racist.|`|i5TqhvrOaa	It is not a big deal i agree 100%.

gW0nD5cEaa	Liberals in the sense of being against the British crown, and maybe some, if not many of those in the Constitutional Convention were 'liberals', but many were not, many were slave owners, etc. I would call them conservative. And like several have pointed out, the terms don't mean exactly the same things in today's world. <br>  <br>  I think of modern America as ideally "Middle of the Road", with both conservative and liberal ideas, sometimes called "Centrist". If you go too far to the right or too far to the left, I don't think it is good. <br>  <br>  America was not supposed to be 'free from religion' but free from one or another religion, like the ANglicans, Lutherans, Catholics, etc. running things like they did in European countries, where each King had an official church. Other churches were either outlawed or people in them had fewer rights.<br>  <br>  The AMerican ideal was all religions were equal, not one over another. The founding fathers were not trying to get rid of religion, but not institutionalize any one church.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	History was not one of your better subjects...  The USA was founded upon liberty.  France emulated the American spirit of liberty.  NOT LIBERALISM.<br>  <br>  The founding fathers you embrace as "Liberals", saw nothing wrong with slavery, or child labor, or preventing women from voting.  They did not believe in taxing.  They supported the right to bear arms so that the populace could overthrow the government. Capitalism was run without ANY government oversight.  <br>  <br>  So in what ways you do consider these founding fathers as "liberals"?|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Perhaps liberals back then loved their country, but now they seek to ruin it by letting immigrants walk all over the nation, giving money to lazy scum, and over-tolerating Islam.<br>  <br>  That is what it is like in the UK anyway, and it sucks!|`|4ErIxkhyaa	YES<br>  <br>  But religious organizations were so reprehensibly hypocritical that Citizens insisted on separation of Church and State<br>  <br>  People believed in the Liberal teachings of Christ but wanted protection from predatory religious organizations.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	the definition of a liberal back then isnt the same as now...do you really think the founding fathers would have supported issues like Gay marriage?<br>  Lincoln was a Republican....Republicans were obvioulsy different then|`|VK0brk89aa	WOW  your getting the words liberated and liberal confused.

United States has always been a very religious country. Separation of Church and State only means that Church cannot rule the people. There were no "liberals" during the revolution. <br>  <br>  New-Left movement that's started in the 1960's is closer to a socialism. It's ideology is not the same thing as socialism, but it's close. How could liberals be open-minded, that whenever an opposing conservative opinion is heard, some of them use name calling and other try to discredit the opposing speaker.|`|fsEr4x6oaa	The founding fathers stood for everything that the liberals are trying to suppress. They founded this country under God and christian values. They wanted a small central gov. and state rights. How dare the libs try to put themselves at their level. But then again, they take credit for everything good and the bad stuff is never their fault. Remember, Al Gore made the internet. Ask our "liberal" founders if they would let two men get married, ask them to give up their guns etc.|`|981ae6721baf70bba18f8ca87d655a38aa	You could insert "conservative" wherever you use "liberal".<br>  The scribes of the constitution debated long over the wording of the final product.

Capitalism is a cruel pyramid scheme<br>  <br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  While employing democratic rhetoric to legitimize its rule within the United States and to justify its use of violence all over the world, the contemporary American state retains at its disposal repressive mechanisms of unparalleled scope: a prison system that, with more than two million people behind bars, is the largest in the world; a massive and heavily armed police force; a judicial system that processes over 14 million arrests annually and that has the power to inflict capital punishment; an immensely powerful and lavishly funded military force, imbued with militaristic and anti-democratic sentiments; and a vast “national security” apparatus, which has been given extraordinary latitude in spying on and prying into the private affairs of the people. Over all these institutions the American people exercise virtually no effective supervision or control. Torture has become state policy, habeas corpus has been drastically restricted, and the state operates, in addition to its public prisons within the United States, an international gulag network of secret prisons into which nameless individuals, deemed “enemy combatants,” are made to disappear.<br>  Democratic rights established in an earlier historical period have been drastically eroded. Lincoln’s democratic vision of a government “of the people, by the people, for the people” has long since degenerated into rule of, by, and for the rich. The right to vote means little in a political process regimented by an institutionalized bipartisan “two-party” system that guarantees the monopolization of election campaigns by the two corporate-backed political parties. The existing electoral set-up excludes effective participation by parties opposed to the Democrats and Republicans. Ballot access laws have been designed to prevent challenges to the two-party dictatorship. Likewise, freedom of the press means little when the major media outlets are controlled by powerful corporate interests.<br>  The defense of democratic rights is inseparably bound up with the struggle for socialism. As there can be no socialism without democracy, there will be no democracy without socialism. Political equality is impossible without economic equality. Like the struggle against war, the fight to defend and expand democratic rights requires the independent political mobilization of the working class, on the basis of a socialist program, to conquer state power.<br>  The struggle for power requires the unconditional political independence of the working class from the parties, political representatives and agents of the capitalist class. The working class cannot come to power, let alone implement a socialist program, if its hands are tied by politically enfeebling compromises with the political representatives of other class interests. First and foremost, this means unwavering rejection of the timeworn and fraudulent myth that the Democratic Party represents, as compared to the Republican Party, a “lesser evil.” The subordination of the working class to this reactionary capitalist party – which traces its lineage to the slave-owning class in the pre-Civil War era – has been, historically, the Achilles heel of the labor movement in the United States. Despite its tradition of violent class conflict and industrial militancy, the labor movement’s dependence upon the Democratic Party – promoted for decades by the trade union bureaucracy, the Stalinists of the Communist Party, and innumerable middle-class political tendencies – effectively blocked the development of an independent and politically class conscious movement of the working class, fighting for its own class program, under its own banner.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	Your question does not make sense, A free market economy does not give govt. power. Socialism does . Socialism is Government owns everything , Citizens/slaves own nothing , The govt. makes decisions for you. A free market economy is what it states FREE.

First by cheating to be elected, then responding to 9/11 by sending more people to be killed on a hunch, taking away our Habius corpus rights, torturing people, nationalizing banks, evading responsibility, and just flat out IGNORANCE.

No. But on the same end not much was done by anyone until it got worse.

Every day that Obama got closer to being elected was a day closer to the beginning of the end.  Did you watch Wall Street?  It was just a precursor to the drop we are experiencing now.  Everyone was preparing for the worst and the worst came.  The closer he got, the more stocks were sold and when he won, the barrel dropped out.  People who researched him and listened to the radio knew what was coming.  Oil Companies knew what was coming.  Why do you think the speculators let oil drop?  Because they knew the out of line taxing that would be going on.  Why is this man spending so much of our money, money that we don't have?  Why is he going to try to break the rich?  Why is he doing this to America?  Who is this man anyway?  I don't consider anyone who would do this to our wonderful Country to be my President.  And what about Reid and Pols?  The whole cabinet is crooked and so is the House with the exception of a few good Dems and Rep's.   <br>  By the way, if it wasn't for the wealthy, who would be providing the jobs?  Who would be spending money on products to keep those jobs going?  I'm not wealthy by any means and never have been, but I'm smart enough to know that Capitalist make money and they spread it around by spending and creating jobs.  No one is spending like they were when Bush was President.  We know to hold on to what little we have left.  This isn't good.  People are losing their savings and retirement.  Your parents are losing their retirements they have busted their asses off for so long to achieve.  Who is going to help the people who have lost their jobs?  Why create more jobs, lets just get our old jobs back.  Why should we only help auto workers?  There are plenty of industries hurting out there that could use some help, or better yet, Government can just get out of our faces and let America fix America, they just need to keep us safe so when our men and women do come back from Iraq, they will have a place to live and work.

What we have here is another confirmation Obama is a liar and a fraud.<br>  <br>  In election after election—2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008—the American people have been defrauded, denied the right to cast any real vote on the war in Iraq. Time after time, the Democrats have colluded with the Republicans to assure that the act of military aggression that both parties approved and sustained could not be challenged by the electorate. The millions upon millions of voters who wanted an end to the war have been effectively disenfranchised.<br>  This process culminated in the 2008 election itself, in which Obama's capture of the Democratic nomination was unquestionably driven in large measure by his attempt to identify himself with these broad antiwar sentiments and to pillory his principal Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for her October 2002 vote authorizing the war.<br>  Now Clinton serves as his secretary of state, while Bush's appointee Gates still heads the Pentagon.<br>  The emergence of the Obama administration's policy of continued occupation in Iraq and escalation of the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan only underscores the bankruptcy of the American democratic process. It is impossible under the present two-party system for the voters to exert their influence on war or any other essential question.<br>  Obama's policies are being determined not by the popular hostility to war felt by the millions who voted for him, but by the financial and strategic interests of the America's corporate and financial elite. He has emerged more and more openly as a mouthpiece for finance capital and the military.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f26.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a>|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Obama does not want to be the president that loses the war in Iraq.

Americans, in their ignorance, call Pashtuns who are fighting to end foreign occupation of their country "Taliban." There are many more Afghans fighting the US than just "Taliban" who were just a ragtag force of religious students created by Pakistan's ISI. Pashtuns never attacked the United States. They did harbor al-Qaida but al-Qaida is now either dead or no longer needs Afghanistan to operate from. What the US is doing is fighting the Afghan people, and no country has ever won that kind of war, unless of course the US commits genocide. So the only solution is some kind of a compromise with Pashtun tribesmen, as Pakistan has done, to bring about peace and stability. Otherwise, Pashtun tribesmen will keep fighting the US for generations [they are too tenacious to give up] and this so-called "war" will not get anywhere.|`|LisP31O8aa	I'm going to assume that everybody knows the origins of the Taliban but just in case , you can ck this out yourself.  There's more info where this came from.<br>  www.satp.org/satporgtp/usa/Taliban.htm <br>  <br>  By definition, the Taliban are extremists and their goal is to establish pure Shariah law.  Where's the moderate in that ?   Does Mr. President have an answer for this one ?  Yet, we are fighting a battle that can never be won against any of these groups, i.e. Taliban.  Take a long look at the history of the Middle East back to when Mohammad came out of his cave in the mountains and sent his followers across the country and across Africa with the orders, '''Convert or Kill'''.  So much for peaceful coexistence. <br>  <br>  We are in a Lose-Lose war here in Afghanistan so what are we to do ?   Make nice with them ?  Make outright war on them ?  How can we kill practically the whole country ?  Taliban are Afghanistan people.  Yes, they harbored Osama and they will continue their Jihad forever against all infidels, (That's us)<br>  <br>  WE can not ever win a 'War on Terror'.  It will never stop unless we are totally defeated, or they are.  Does anybody know what started this whole deal by the way ?  Who cast the deciding votes at the UN on November 29, 1947 ? Take a look if you don't already know.  Lots more where this came from also. . . . .  <br>  #<br>  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_UN_Partitio... - 182k - Cached - Similar pages<br>  #<br>  With this, the dye was cast and terrorism was born against the infidels. ( That's us. )  <br>  <br>  WE all need to acknowledge what the real truth is here and to deal with it..  Mr. President Obama has a lot to learn.  Actually I don't think that most Americans have a clue either.
RLHKEAaLaa	you will never get a good answer|`|1AgD0dsBaa	Economic Historian-The term Economic Reccesion is an econmoic term that many in American culture have no clue about. A reccession is a cyclical movement of the economy. The cycle is usually every ten years there is a decrees in economic production. In the 5th Reccession the first of its kind a global economic chriss.<br>  <br>  There have been 5 Major Reccisons in American history after the turn of the 19th Century. The first major Reccession was in the Great Deppression.FDR prolong the reccesion as the end of the 1930's we went to war with Germany, Japan, and Italy. With the need for weapons and supplies, the US became the major supplier of weapons and goods to its allies and we moved out of the reccession after WWII.  However-Its is believed by both Conservative and Liberal Historians in the Economic Field that FDR prolonged rather than solved the Economic problems. <br>  <br>  In the 1960's  under JFK, America went into a reccssion that began to spring in rural areas. By the 1970's under Jimmy Carter antther Reccession hit. In 1980 Ronald Reagan had a small reccesion, but in 1999 a major reccession worse than this current global reccession Under Clinton happend. Now under Obama another one hits the dust. These matters are based on the GDP when it lowers the Reccession hits. Don't worry will be out in a few years.|`|8FMtEW5naa	I'm not exactly sure what political party I would say I am(I'm only 17), but I'm pretty liberal and seem to relate most to democrats.<br>  <br>  I think that no matter the situations with past recessions and how they were "fixed," this is a completely different time and it won't require the same tools.

I made a horrible mistake.<br>  <br>  This so called recovery plan couldn't have been meant for recovery at all. No one is that stupid, certainly not Obama and all his people. It has a clear objective as do the rest of his actions which are so crooked I can't believe everyone is not out shouting about them.<br>  <br>  Taking all the money out of the lending pool and being forced to give higher interest in entice investment in our debt will raise the interest rate which will kill small business start ups and expansion. Those small businesses are exactly who always pulls us out, but he is ham stringing them, why? I know he knows this, and I know his people have to know this, it's to obvious in history how these things work. Kennedy knew this, Obama doesn't now?<br>  <br>  Not only that, they are raising taxes on the very small business owners who create more jobs, which along with higher interest rates will be a double whammy. Those who make over $250,000 produce over 90% of all jobs created by small business.<br>  <br>  Obama's plan is a KILLER, he is worse than Carter was. I can't be a democrat any longer. My conscience would kill me and I could never sleep, not that I will much anyway because all this scares me to death. There are bad things coming in the US.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry I actually supported this guy. He lied to us. I'm sorry.|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Well big government spending helped for the great depression.

I am an independent.<br>  <br>  Recessions are a matter of economics.  In economic cycles you can have bubbles and the the burst.  There is usually an over correction to any cycle.<br>  <br>  In this case you had a housing bubble, that was exacerbated by risky loan practices in a low interest environment.  This lead to a collapse of the housing market along with a credit crisis, which put the banks into default.  The government spending programs will do little to address the underlining causes of the recession.  <br>  <br>  To correct the recession you need to reduce the excess housing and allow some banks to fail. Then there should be added added regulations to sub-prime loan practices and how they are packaged and marketed.<br>  <br>  It may take a year or two for the free enterprise system to work out its excesses, but when it does it will be stronger.|`|ZWePAEZUaa	Easy.   We take the current social climate and measure it base<br>  on human characteristics.  In other words, whatever the world<br>  is using now that is efficient to us for a means of survival,  then<br>  let us figure out a way to expand our horizons.  But using innovative<br>  technology, and new ideas and resources to help our industries grow.<br>  We used cash crops back during the Civil Rights and World War<br>  eras to fuel our economy.  What you are going to see now,  is<br>  advancement in clean, reliable energyy.  Electric cars, wind mills,<br>  etc.  And we will create reform on immigration here in the US.  This<br>  will balance out our economy,  so we can have jobs for Americans.<br>  And we dont not have to spend extra money on people who are<br>  draining us to survive.  It is called effective socialism.|`|26DoxkOBaa	For all the BS about Obama following FDR, Obama is actually doing what Hoover did which tanked the economy, and then FDR rescued it by doing the opposite, which Obama should be doing, by shutting down the Federal Reserve Bank and not bailing out the banks, but doesn't, because he's deliberately trying to tank the economy at the behest of his Zionist controllers who are hell bent on a NWO and globalism, which they can't have with separate nation states, of course.|`|YupMCYHlaa	I am not a Democrat but a liberal.  I usually vote Democratic only because I find the Demo candidate a better choice.<br>  <br>  The idea is called Keynesian Economics after John Maynard Keynes, a famous economist in the first half of the 20th century.  Keynes is credited with the idea that government spending can boost the economy.  During the Great Depression, he said that the govt. should hire people to dig holes, and other people to fill them in.  The idea was that this money would go into the economy and circulate.  People would have more faith in the economy and buy things.<br>  <br>  FDR took his advice.  He set up govt. programs to hire people to build roads and bridges, monuments, govt. buildings, dams and water projects, to work or rural electrification, etc. etc.  There were even theater companies financed by the fed. govt.that traveled from town to town doing plays.  Most historians believe this really helped.<br>  <br>  After WWII, every president, of both parties, used defense spending to boost the economy.  Starting with the Korean War, the US was on a constant war footing, developing generation after generation of new airplanes, tanks, guns, and nuclear weapons.  This was because ALL presidents had learned the benefits of Keynesian economics.  Defense was the safest way to spend the money because anyone who criticized defense spending could be bashed as 'unamerican'.<br>  <br>  But because of this spending we built up a huge debt.  We now spend more on weapons and military than the whole rest of the world combined, and wouldn't you think that was enough?  No, politicians of both parties try to outdo each other in proposals for increases in defense spending.<br>  <br>  The problem is that any president has an incentive to spend us into debt.  He can take credit for the growth of the economy, but when the bill for the debt comes due, he will be out of office and it will be some other president's problem.<br>  <br>  But how we're facing a big recession, so now is the time for the govt. to spend money in ways to help people.  That's what Obama is doing.  Rather than fighting a new war or building another big unnecessary weapon system, like Reagan (and Johnson), rather than just shovel huge amounts of taxpayer money to banks to do whatever they like with it (like Bush)  Obama is spending money on things we needed anyway, like roads and bridges, the next big source of energy, fixing schools, etc. etc.  People will have jobs, plus what they make and do and fix will be useful to us.  At least that's the idea. Plus he's trying to give the middle class a tax break, not just the rich.<br>  <br>  The big disagreement between Obama and the Republicans is that Obama's plan is 1/3 tax cuts and 2/3 govt. spending, while the Republicans wanted 2/3 tax cuts and 1/3 spending.  But to listen to the Republicans, it sounds like Obama's turning the US into a Communist state!|`|mBt5VgtHaa	Republicans like to point to the tax cuts in JFK years as point that tax cuts are best but that was a period of high government spending and low interest rates. During the Bush I years, he raised taxes and the economy recovered. During the Clinton years, he raised taxes  and the economy boomed. During Bush II years, he cut taxes and the economy grew very weakly. <br>  <br>  In the past couple of recession, monetary polices were used to offset the effects of the recession. In other words, central banks lowered the interest rates to spur growth. Now, the interest rate is zero. The only way to stimulate the economy now is spending. See the link below from Jan. 2008. After reading it, Democrats and Republicans can agree that spending is only option left.|`|AA10164318	Recessions are created by distinct events.  There is no universal cure for recessions.<br>  For instance, the early 1980's. recession was caused by banking failures in the Savings & Loan , coupled with a speculative bubble in Texas oil and the Middle East embargo, which was severe enough to cause the auto industry and airlines to fail.  There was also a housing bubble in Texas.<br>  <br>  Interest rates were raised and government spending was cut to fight inflation - which made unemployment worse.  Increased govt spending later and interest rate decreases eventually ended that recession.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Do you know how they start? I will give you a famous quote and you guess who it was by: " intellectuals solve problems; geniuses prevent them". The problem started because of greed and the fact, the FACT that there isn't an ideal economy at this moment in time. It is a work in progress, and that's what it shall be as long as people are greedy. <br>  <br>  Do you know how Germany went into their fake depression?<br>  <br>  It started after world war one ended with the armistice. After that, the treaty of Versailles left them without any real possibilities of a negotiation. The Germans were lied to, and it gave Hitler more of a chance for empowerment.|`|mgVrAqpkaa	honestly, times change, circumstances changes, the economy changes- people are scared of change, and our economy needs a big one. So, i find it hard to compare what obama is trying out now, as opposed to what worked in hx. the divide in this country between socioeconomic levels at present time is huge and that needs to change- and i'm not saying rich people need to give their money to poor people, but it needs to change. <br>  obama's idea of working from the bottom up in my opinion is a very good one, and it has not been tried before, if the past recovery strategies had worked we would not be finding ourselves in another recession. i feel president obama's ideas need to be given a chance before people tear them apart- his ideas and heart are in the right place.|`|86jsHmOVaa	There is only one comparison to the current economic situation and that is the Great Depression. FDR used massive govt spending to put people back to work and stabilize the economy, similiar to what Obama is proposing now.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Previous recessions ended naturally despite all the programs, but the people of America would not be able to take that method, they are spoilt and want someone to fix things now, they have no tolerance for pain.|`|diCASlUXaa	New technology came out which created many jobs.|`|c3vPZfghaa	past recessions were fixed by the government spending more.<br>  Can't say it really fixed anything when we have an 80% service sector economy though.<br>  That is why reducing taxes keeps creating these bubbles, and making the economy appear strong for a short time.<br>  <br>  What fixed the greatest of all economic crisises was government increasing spending to put people to work, thereby putting money into the hands of people who would spend it. Meanwhile surpluse production was destroyed to increase price to make the production profitable again. <br>  Shortly after things started to improve WWII created a protectionist environment for American businesses and strong unions made consumer confidence strong, which boosted consumption which is what a consumer driven economy depends on. That along with the fact that our economy was not devastated by war is the reason why our economy was the strongest in the world until trade was normalized with China and many of our businesses started moving offshore, when that protectionist environment was no longer present.<br>  <br>  Since that protectionist environment for American businesses is no longer present, I don't see increasing governmetn spending do much in the long term to fix anything.<br>  I really see no long term fixes.<br>  The whole purpose of mutlinational business isn't to trickle wealth down to Americans, it is so the multinationals can accumulate more capital, by trickling as little down to foriegn laborers as possible while Americans lose out.<br>  <br>  Remember the old "united we stand divided we fall" quote?<br>  Well mutlinationals are trying to work outside that rule.<br>  They don't want to stand united with anything but the almighty dollar and paradoxially that is what is causing it to collapse.<br>  <br>  personally, I think our answer would have lied in the government not allowing nuclear power to be privatized, and making most of their revenue from nuclear power while keeping the price lower for consumers.<br>  This way they could reduce all business and personal income taxes to 0%.<br>  The lower power prices would have compensated businesses for higher wages compared to foreign labor which would allow 0% in taxes to be enough incentive to move back. As currently, the demand for higher wages prevents even the greatest reduction in taxes from being an incentive.<br>  But the right would cry socialism and always will with any possible solution to fix anything. They aren't about compromise and that is not only what is destroying America, but their own party as well.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	The 'free' market is a lie and a fraud. Capitalism is a cruel pyramid scheme. Capitalism= opression<br>  <br>  capitalism, and the imperialist system that develops upon its economic foundations, is the main cause of human poverty, exploitation, violence and suffering in the modern world. As a system of socio-economic organization, capitalism long ago exhausted its historically progressive role. The blood-drenched history of the twentieth century – with its two world wars, innumerable “local” conflicts, the nightmare of Nazism and other forms of military-police dictatorship, eruptions of genocide and communal pogroms – is an unanswerable indictment of the capitalist system. The number of victims claimed by capitalist-inspired violence runs into the hundreds of millions. And this figure does not include the consignment of the peoples of entire continents to unrelenting poverty, with all its attendant miseries.<br>  The gigantic scale of the existing productive forces and the extraordinary advances in technology are more than sufficient not only to abolish poverty but also to guarantee every human being on the planet a high standard of living. Culture should be flowering amidst unprecedented material wealth. But, instead, conditions of life are deteriorating for the working class, and human culture, deprived of perspective and hope for the future, is in deep crisis. The source of the contradiction between what is and what should be is a global economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, and the irrational division of the world into rival nation-states.<br>  All efforts to raise the living standards of the working class and address serious social problems run up against the barrier of private ownership of the means of production, the anarchy of the capitalist market, the economic imperatives of the profit system, and, last but not least, the insatiable greed and money-madness of the ruling class itself. The claim that the capitalist market is the infallible allocator of resources and the supremely wise arbiter of social needs stands utterly discredited amidst the endless series of speculative scandals and multi-billion dollar bankruptcies that have rocked the world economic system during the past decade. The boundary lines between “legitimate” financial transactions and criminal fraud have narrowed to the point of being almost invisible. The separation of the process of personal wealth accumulation from the production and creation of real value is an expression of the general putrefaction of the capitalist system.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep2008/prin-s25.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...</a>|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	A government hands off approach to the economy.|`|VS0PuI5paa	The only economic system that works to date.

If you take it for the Army and decide to go Navy (or any other service), all that is required from the Navy is to transfer your scores from the Army to them.<br>  <br>  Retaking the test requires a one month wait for the first three tests, then a 6 month wait for a 4th retest. <br>  <br>  Not sure on your level of education, but if you're dead set on joining the military, you should probably act fast. Many benefits are starting to decrease due to the over strength of almost every branch.

One of the main arguments by the left was that Iraq cost too much money....well how much is Afghanistan going to cost?<br>  <br>  And what is it with Obama having to make a speech every damn day. If this guy would just shut his mouth for about 3 days out of the week, maybe the stock market would recover a little. Every time he speaks it falls.

So even though he hates the war, we can't be irresponsible when pulling out the of Iraq.|`|AA11963685	Maybe because he understands that we went into Iraq based on lies, and that they were not an imminent threat.  Maybe he understood that it was Bush's obsession, seeing as how he abandoned the destruction of the Taliban and Al Queda - our true 911 enemies - for the nation building he felt compelled to pursue.<br>  <br>  Thanks to Bush and his incompetence, the Taliban and Al Qaeda are stronger than ever and the Taliban is poised to take over Pakistan - a nuclear country.

AA11511852	It is wrong because most people now a days only read history that has been re written after 1980.  When is shows that there is a place called Palestine.<br>  In fact if you read history from Egyptian, circa, 2500 b.c.e. through Roman history, circa, 350 a.d. there never was a country called Palestine but rather the Romans called it Palestinia because of the rebellion of the Jews in this area and it was to humiliated them because of it.<br>  Not until 1967 has there ever been a country called Palestine and this is when Yassar Arafat declared it to be a country at the Khartoum Conference. Also until 1918 when the British told the world and when they took over this area that there again would be a country called Israel the Palestians were nomads that not one Arab country would let settle in their lands.<br>  They told the nomads that they could settle there and when they wiped all of the Jews out of this area then they could have a county and land all their own. Too many wars later and the Jewish people are still in the land that history shows that they have lived, since 1200 b.c.e., and the Arabs still refuse to except this fact.  Egypt being the exception.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Which holy places? The temple was built by the Jews, true, but it no longer exists.

Does that mean someone claiming Philistine heritage should be able to tell them BOTH to get off their land?  That is, of course, ludicrous.<br>  <br>  How about the case of the American Indian?  Certainly they were here before any Europeans.  I didn't take it from them, neither did my parents.  Should my parents and I now surrender any rights to property we have purchased because the Indians were here first?<br>  <br>  The Palestinians want the land because it means a lot to the Palestinians, it just happens to mean a lot to Jews and Christians too.  Since all three religions claim to love peace, it would seem a solution of sharing would be easy and logical, but man is petty, and against his wants and desires, loftier philosophies fall to the side.<br>  <br>  Please do not suppose that the hatred is a one way street.  I'm sure for every 100 Arabs, there is some number of those, not all, who hate Jews.

After Rome fell the Ottoman empire took control of the region & when the Ottoman empire fell at the end of WWI, the British empire took control of the region. It wasn't until Jewish people started re-settling there and finally gained an autonomous gov't in 1948 that the Ishmaelites ( Muslims) got jealous. <br>   You have here a strip of land no larger than the state of NJ, where there is no oil, no gold, little plant life, very little of any kind of natural resources so that the ONLY reason the Muslims want it is because the Jews have it. There will never be peace there until it is established in the millennial reign of King Jesus.<br>  The other writer who said it was called Palestine before it was called Israel is wrong.

We have achieved nuclear power, own cryogeinic rocket engine, our own satelites, a very dependable communication system, nano car and a lot of wonders the world already witnessed. Our army is one of the best discplined in world. We almost have everything. And we have achieved all these within a lot of poverty and corruption. Only a bunch of greedy Indians going abroad for more money ! Yes ,i do agree that mindless increasing in population is a hindrance in our path of progress. But definitely we are going to be a developed country very soon. Even before 2020. Thanks.|`|y9HCa0u6aa	Yes I think India is catching up with the developed world quickly. And some developed countries such as the UK will be classed as underdeveloped by then.|`|C9AbiTDdaa	I dont think so<br>  even in 2050 also india will be developing country|`|ByWBKf6daa	I do think so.

qRlPRJ1Jaa	Socialized medicine does not provide the best care. You have to wait for things like CT Scans, sometimes months. They do not pay for things that may make your life better, but are not an immediate necessity (like a knee or hip replacement). Once socialized medicine takes over, the doctors are working for the government and are subject to the priority of saving the government money.  Ever have to get treated at a hospital in Canada?  If you are not a citizen, you have to pay cash for care-no cash, no care. Even if you have a heart attack, they will ship you over the border. If you die on the way over, the canadian gov. is not liable.  Those who presently have no insurance and take an ambulance to an emergency room for some non emergency like a sore ankle etc., will find themselves being turned away once obamas universal health care takes over. You know that old saying "be careful what you ask for, you just might get it", well such will be the case with universal health care.|`|YUmbRmitaa	LUNATIC:<br>  <br>  yeah, those who can't afford better coverage will choose to pay for it. that's given. but then there are all those people on the border, who can somewhat afford to pay for it but would make life easier if the government paid for it, that would choose to NOT pay for their healthcare anymore and go with the free government healthcare.<br>  <br>  millions of people will be doing this, simply because the cost isn't worth it to them. you know who pays for all those people's healthcare when they make that decision? mhmm...<br>  <br>  people think that oh, its fine, if you can afford to pay for it go ahead and do so. those who can't get it for free. <br>  don't you think that MANY of those people who CAN pay for it are going to go along with the free care?|`|NQq7xykxaa	I know tons of Canadiens and they would never come here for health care, they love their system, it works great and they think we are crazy for the way we do it. if any of them need specialized care they usually go to Europe or Singapore to get it because the cost is reasonable and good and in the USA its just to high, Doctors and especially insurance companies are out of control in the USA.|`|zrggGS2Caa	Now, on the other hand, why do so many Americans go north of the border for elective surgeries and more affordable prescription drugs? Cost!  Health care costs are forcing companies to relocate our jobs overseas and until we see an overhaul in how we offer health care, our jobs will continue to disappear.|`|SIKuOevVaa	Because Stephen Harper has only had 3 years to screw up Canada's economy, not 8 years like Bush had to screw up ours.  I'd say give him time, but, in a parliamentary system, he may not have the time.  The only reason he survived the last election is because the Liberals were pathetically led.  Once they have a leader who knows what he's doing, the Conservatives will be out in Ottawa.  They still have only a minority government, i.e. they need other parties to form a majority.|`|mBt5VgtHaa	The better way to look at the problem is to look at what money is spent on healthcare and what are the outcomes. Canadians as country spends less on healthcare and gets similar medical outcomes as the US. What is why the US needs health care reform.|`|40559ac88dd0ea7e2a8e896483eee069aa	We have better health care here the way it is now and quality typically costs $$$$|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Its basically a you get what you pay for system. If you pay a lot then you get good treatment if you don't want to pay then you get crappy treatment and have to wait in line for the other people that had the same idea as you.|`|AA10389562	See, that's the beauty of Obama's plan.  Once we have universal health care and everybody has access to the care they need, if you want to get care above and beyond what is necessary and you can afford to pay for it, it will be right here in the US.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The US system is the best system if you can afford to pay for your own care.  So yes, Canadians who don't want to wait for that non-critical surgery can come to the US and have it right away, if they have the money in the bank.  Those are the Canadians who come to the US.<br>  <br>  But the Canadian system has about the same outcomes as the US system and costs about half as much.  And it has -better- customer satisfaction than the US system.  I have spent a lot of time in Canada and over the years I must have talked to 100 Canadians and asked them about their health care system, and I have never heard a single 'horror story' about someone dying because they couldn't get some procedure they desperately needed.|`|k6hicodfaa	If our system works so well how come so many Americans go to Canada, Latin America and Asia for health care?|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Yesterday about four doctor's wives called in on national radio and all said their very talented husbands plan on cutting back....<br>  <br>  We will have NO health care under Obama.|`|gT3v7A1paa	Only rich Canadians get American health care.

Obama gets credit for what Barack does.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	The guy can do no wrong. He knew the entire election process that he could NOT bring home those troops as he claimed he would. He was simply pandering on that issue just as he did on all of them. <br>  <br>  What makes this so pathetic is that even if he destroys this country (and he is doing a "fine" job with that) the ignorant and the "party first, I win" generation will continue to vote for this guy!|`|k6hicodfaa	So let me get this right.

You do realize that Bush never included the cost of war or his no-bid contracts to his friends at Haliburton and Blackrock in his budget's don't you?  Oh, I'm sorry, that's not something Limbaugh would talk about...|`|Fy54FMemaa	Take credit for tax $$? You cant be serious! Bush had no plan to do anything, he invades the wrong country and insists on "staying the course" and years later, where the F is Bin Laden? He makes more video's than a music artist and we cant freaking find him. The cost of staying to course is felt by everyone, and don't even bring up Katrina, the old man was doing NOTHING for those people who lost everything until he was forced, and you may not know, he was forewarned about Katrina AND 9/11, don't get it twisted. Bush has a financial interest in oil which corrupted his decision making. Let's talk about Bernie Madoff shall we... This man's financial scandal was sign, sealed and delivered to the government (Bush's admin) and Bush did just what he does best... NOTHING... now a new guy is in charge left holding the big bag of shhit and you want to point out Bush's ACHIEVEMENTS... oh little girl you need to just stop right there.

3gljWitCaa	actually<br>  Canada has some of the best trained soldiers in the world<br>  to say THE best is wrong, no one knows<br>  but Canada DOES train alot of American Pilots up here in Winnipeg, Manitoba<br>  <br>  The Canadians are known as the elite house to house fighters [street fighters] and also known as the Storm Troops.<br>  <br>  If anyone doubts the Canadian power, just look at any battles the Canadians fought at.  For examle Vimy Ridge,  that ridge in France was taken over by the Germans in the beginning of the war.  For 3 years Britain and France tried to get it back but they couldnt.  They called in the Canadians.  Canada took it over in 3 days in April 1917.  The odds against the Canadians were astronimical, literally.  but they took it over<br>  <br>  Also, The Battle of Ortona.. without that win the italian campaign in WWII would not have been successfull.  Thats the battle where the Germans called the Canadians the elite house to house fighters.<br>  <br>  Now of course all you're going to hear, is that no the Canadians aren't.  But if anyone looks at the facts written on paper and studies it, you will see that it is true.  Canada has some of the best trained soldiers in the world.<br>  <br>  Watch the movie Passchendaele, its a good movie :) i love it, its about the RCR during the battle of pass. in WWI<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|2tdAG44Laa	Regular U.S. soldiers no but there are guys in some elite "covered up" groups in the military that are incredibly trained.

It was absolutely crazy and no exaggeration I met the guys once. Even learned a whole bunch of technology stuff like hacking and that.

They are the ellite of the ellite forces.<br>  <br>  And just because one country trains with another country doesn't mean they are nesscarily better.  A lot of the militaries are doing joint forces excersises between different branches and different country's so that their forces are use to fighting together.  We host jump/airborne training with germany and austraila every year.  My husband has jumped with a german jumpmaster to get his german jump wings, just as the german troopers jumped with a us jumpmaster to get their american jump wings.  We've also had british paratroopers here for several weeks doing field excersises.

Also include where together 2/3 of the states can also call a referendum on Federal law.|`|Bm9j62Zzaa	Chinas capitalism...no taxes on capital gains, is attracting billions of dollars from around the world , at our expense coz we are morons<br>  Also, Chinas handling of traitors, one shot to the head at .25 apiece.<br>  For 5 bucks we could be rid of the bama, pelosi, reid, schumer, waxman,vermont......I just noticed, Japans?

MOALBorJaa	The fact that the biological father has made no attempt to have an emotional relationship with the child will go a long way towards supporting your application for adoption. The biological father will probably be glad to not oppose the petition since his legal obligation to pay child support will cease upon the application being granted. You should seek the advice of an attorney with expertise in adoption to walk you through the steps.|`|ucYwexwJaa	You can apply to be the adopted father, his real dad is going to have to sign over his rights to him, which he probably won't do if he's been making child supports payments.  How often do they see one another?  Also, if you do adopt him and get the real father to sign over his rights, he won't have to make anymore child support payments.|`|AA11830777	If he has religiously payed the child support it may not be a case of abandonment.<br>  Has your wife tried to contact him regarding signing over his rights? If he hasn't seen his son and not in his life he may do just that. Remind him that the child support payments will end.|`|MP1nA5fRaa	You can't claim child abandonment because he is paying child support (even though it was court ordered)  See if your wife will talk to him about relinquishing his rights as the father.  He no doubt will because he isn't in the child's life.  Once he agrees to give up his rights, all 3 of you will need a family practice lawyer (1 that specializes in adoption is best) to draw up the papers, present them to the court and the Judge will make his ruling once he is convinced the biological father is sincere about being "set free".  Your step-son may be asked questions by the Judge regarding who he prefers to have as his dad (doesn't always happen).  Then the Judge signs the order and you become the legal father, usually resulting in a last name change for the son.<br>  <br>  You sound like a wonderful, decent, caring man!!  We need many more like you!!!<br>  <br>  Congrats|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	You will need the father's consent.  I'm sure with no contact, he will be more than willing to sign in order to stop his support payments.<br>  <br>  He can refuse, though, as is his right.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	If he has paid his ordered child support, the biological father will not be found to have abandoned the child, so you will likely have to get his consent in order to adopt the child.  If he has no interest in being a part of the child's life, then he will probably be willing to consent in order to be free from child support payments.

It has nothing to do with the economy or stimulus.  That is just an excuse to scare Americans into going along.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Read a little closer and you will see that all of these "stimulus" packages are nothing more than kickbacks to the people who helped him get elected. As long as he and the Democrat Congress can keep the charade going they will keep pumping our treasury into their friend's hands at a record pace. <br>  <br>  Those silly liberals complained when a few companies in Iraq got no-bid contracts (which did create jobs, btw) so where is the outrage now when their own savior is doing the same thing on a much larger scale?|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Even though Fox News and Limbaugh are claiming that federal spending didn't help during the Great Depression, they had to rewrite history to make that claim. Actually that was what brought us out of it.

The stimulus will fail, but he will invent new taxes that down the road will be paid by the poor and the middle class. The rich will end up with loop holes. Just like Fed income tax, medicare, SSI,  and other sheet that was set up that rape the average man that FDR set up. The he will Do like FDR did get into a big war with Afghanistan. The war will create jobs,  and the end of the recession JUST LIKE FDR DID. Then he will take credit as a great saint just like FDR did. In the the years to come our children and grandchildren will have added on taxes that will never go away. JUST like the taxes that FDR CREATED.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Hitler held many hysterical beliefs which not only include, God and Providence but also Fate, Social Darwinism, and ideological politics. In Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, he spoke, unashamedly, about God, fanaticism, idealism, dogma, and the power of propaganda. Hitler held strong faith in all his convictions. He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. <br>  <br>  This is a quote that I think is one of his most revealing statements that makes this quite clear:<br>  <br>  "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<br>  <br>  o_O|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Hitler is president of the United States....Where have you been?|`|kprKXEOSaa	Hitler has been dead for quite some time now.<br>  <br>  We would do well to ask ourselves, however, how did Hitler get such a large portion of the German people to support him?

l9iGfpB4aa	You need to provide the bail bond place with a paper from the court stating that the case is closed.  You do however have to pay 10% of her bail. That is not refundable. I can't believe that they took a down payment from you! Did you make payment arrangements? If so you have to pay!  They put up a bond for the $40,000. You are responsible for the customary 10% charge.  I had to pay $32,000 cash for bail for my son. His first bail was $100,000 and then the judge increased it to $220,000,00 at his arraingment.  Consider yourself lucky and pay up!|`|LsAArkUyaa	Yes they can. You were suppose to pay 10% of the 40K and did not.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Only Congress can declare war or peace.  However, a "declaration of war" in a strategic context entails many political, economic and military aspects that would adversely impact the national economy.  Two examples of which are nationalization of the railroads, and the full activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to name two I can mention in this forum.  Don't expect to see one in your lifetime; especially as the latest national security threat comes from non-state actors. <br>  HOWEVER, the President as Commander in Chief, may initiate military action without consultation of congress if it is an imperative to "defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic".

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	In Mill's writings, a concrete situation is a situation that deals with non-abstract things.  For example: one man could go on a mission to stop Hitler before he begins the concentration camps. The man will die, but millions will be saved. Everything in this is concrete, not subjective. The idea of 'goodness', for example, is subjective in some sense. So is 'redness', etc.<br>  <br>  The principal of utility states that "actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.”  The greater happiness is the greater good. If, in the above case, the man's death would promote greater happiness, then his death would be the best thing. <br>  <br>   Feel free to e-mail me with any questions.

Men who are accused of being terrorist are acual going to be given trials to prove that they are terrorist.<br>  <br>  The national debt is not as big a problem as it is sometimes made out to be.  People who invest in the debt earn interest.  Most of the people who invest in the debt are Americans.  Only a small percentage is foreign.  No one will have to pay off the debt.  Any elected official now or in the furture who tries to will not be an elected official for long.<br>  <br>  Obama is doing what I think a president should do.

Conservatism has hurt this country so much that Obama needs to do this much and more to clean up the mess and get us going in the proper direction again.  This is the biggest declaration of liberal principles any President has made since LBJ in 1965 -- and he began to turn away from that in order to run a mistake of a war.  Obama's going to be that kind of liberal President and turn away from a mistake of a war -- and win the war we should have been fighting all along.  This is a pretty good chunk of the change I wanted.  As for the rest, well, considering the garbage the GOP is considering as 2012 nominees, I think Obama will have a second term in which to do it.

The vehicle is on the property listed on the search warrant to be searched and the evidence  being sought could be found inside the car or,<br>  3).  If the vehicle is in a public place (i.e. parked on the street) and probable cause exists to believe there is evidence of a crime inside the vehicle.<br>  <br>  The third stipulation is a little outside of the question but falls under something called the Carroll Doctrine and is based on a US Supreme Court Case:<br>  <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/267/132/case.html" rel="nofollow">http://supreme.justia.com/us/267/132/cas...</a><br>  <br>  I'll try to find you a link in a second to illustrate the second point also.<br>  <br>  There really is no need for a search warrant in that case.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Okay here ya go for the second scenario.

They can search any and everything on your property.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Cars are a bit different then homes. A car is mobile and the Supremes have recognized this. The car may (not can) be searched without a warrant. The circumstances involved fill large law books and change slightly depending on recent decisions by federal district courts and what district you are in.<br>  <br>  The warrant does not cover the car unless it says so or the car is within the house. Normally if they had probable cause for the warrant for a residence they had enough for the vehicle and would have included it in the warrant.<br>  But often there are valid reason to search a car without a warrant arising from new info. If they have new info and the car can be secured they must get a warrant for the car.|`|dvS6F9ZSaa	Vehicles have to be identified and mentioned in the search warrant to be searched.  Search warrants can be extremely specific, i.e. DNA from a person to a more broad i.e. the residence located at 123 Main Street.  Generally, search warrants for residences will include any vehicles the resident may own.|`|ugWaptu2aa	Yes if the vehicle is mentioned in the warrant, also if the property is to be searched and the warrant states that all items on the property are allowed to be searched then the vehicle could be searched if it is on property. It all depends on what stated on the warrant.|`|5jZmbinuaa	The car must be mentioned in the warrant itself.|`|oW5gYNm3aa	Yeah....It would be legal to search anything at your residence and the car would fall under probable cause.|`|AA11376640	it must be mentioned on the warrant!
4Q4dZJHpaa	Dont let him get away with that s**t.keep a copy of all agreements etc.I think a landlord has to give you notice as to when he/she is coming round.Ive been done by a landlord before n it was a nightmare,I swear if i see him again im gonna rearrenge his face.What hes doin is illigel.but you need proof or else its very difficult.thats why i got done 4over 700euros even though the police were on my side.dont let him get away with it.check around the internet n find out your options,you have rights|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	If you didn't sign anything...he can't do ****!!!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Call the cops and get a restraining order, then call environmental again~!|`|n6IBfiDPaa	As long as you didnt sign anything then your rent has not changed<br>  Make sure you are getting a receipt when you give him money so he cant come back and say you never paid.<br>  <br>  I would call the cops if he keeps bangin on your door<br>  <br>  I also agree with the whole withholding rent until things are fixed. Its the law<br>  <br>  What a jerk|`|tOx475R0aa	I would just move out.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Yikes, what a nutcase!<br>  <br>  It sounds as though he has conned you by using the "extra" money you gave him as evidence that you've "agreed" to a long term rent increase. Never EVER give a landlord money other than what you've agreed to pay in rent, he's running a business not a charity after all.<br>  <br>  Change the locks, try and get a restraining order or something, and start the process of finding yourself a new home. Get the police involved at every stage if you have to.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, DO NOT pay him any more rent, or any money whatsoever. Not a penny. He's broken his side of the rental agreement (and broken the law) by harrassing you in this way and by trying to enter the property without your permission, so there's no reason why you should keep to your side of the agreement.<br>  <br>  Landlords usually request references from tenants before signing a rental agreement. It's a shame most tenants don't ask for references from landlords as well, because it would mean creeps like this would quickly get a bad reputation and go out of business.|`|SVoVyAyIaa	Contrary to what some have been saying your land lord doesn't need your consent to increase your rent but any increase has to be justified and reasonable, if he persists in harassing you for an unlawful debt when you have proof you don't owe he is breaking the law and can be stopped but it does mean he will most likely ask you to leave at the end of your agreed tenancy out of spite|`|dJ7d58Ydaa	I've been a renter for a long time.  Sometimes you get good landlord, sometimes bad.  <br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to contact a real estate attorney.  Ye, you are going to pay the attorney, but it will ease some way your pain.  <br>  <br>  Next time you rent do some homework on the Landlord or Management Company, ask other tenants if you can.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3uI0JAAwaa	This is illegal, get you a real estate lawyer, and quit paying rent.  You have the right to with old rent untill he has fixed everything to your demands.  He is providing a service for you...the above is only tru if you are living in the USA.|`|EFD3HK2Laa	First, ask him to show you the proof that you agreed to this rent increase. If he doesn't, or can't, then visit your local CAB for advice, detailing the problems you have mentioned. As your landlord, it's his DUTY to ensure that the property is fit for human habitation, which is something he doesn't appear to want to concern himself with doing.<br>  <br>  Also, keep reporting him to environmental health, as the fact that the shower leak is very dangerous (could cause the shower user to be electrocuted), meaning that the property is not fit for human habitation.<br>  <br>  Once this has been done, you can then obtain a restraining order against him, preventing him from harassing you. If he breaches that, then you can take him to court, citing the harassment and the lack of care of the property (take photographs to back up your claim for negligence).<br>  <br>  make sure you take as much legal advice as you can afford, as this will be of great assistance in helping you with your case.

I'm assuming the law is similar to the United States, you cannot discriminate against someone due to pregnancy.|`|bbc94e509cc1cde8fbb2273c1fbd2897aa	If she has been offered the job then she will be fine. If it was still at the interview stage then they could reject her and say her interview wasn't good enough or whatever (they're not allowed to reject someone because they're pregnant I don't think). Also doesn't probation mean she's convicted of a crime, but hasn't done jail time yet? lol|`|EbCsHW9saa	I have been in this position before.  I was pregnant, unemployed and taking a full load of engineering classes when my husband of 7 years decided to walk of with a skirt that had no children.  So getting a job was important to keeping the house for myself and my 4 & 6 year old.<br>  <br>  I just wore big oversized clothes and was pretty good at hiding it. VERY VERY VERY careful not to let any one know.  It wasn't until I was about 6.5-7 months along that you could definitely tell I was pregnant.  The baby was born 10lb7.5oz... I am 5ft 120 - so it was hard, but that employer told me flat out that I was lucky that I kept it from them because they would have termed me.<br>  <br>  Personally the more she keeps it to herself, the safer she is in her employment.  I know there is FMLA here in the states and NV is an at will state giving business more freedom to select a more appropriate candidate for their needs.  You should also know that employers under 50 employees do not have to follow a lot of federal employment laws.  <br>  <br>  During my final pregnancy (my second husbands baby), I was terminated from my job as an accounting manager for a construction company (mormons) that had 22 employees and there was no recourse because they do not have to follow FMLA.  My mormon girl friend told me that Mormons discourage women to work while raising kids, but not all are like this ~ there are variations in how one discriminates as there are number of people on our planet.<br>  <br>  Dont learn by personal experience.  Best to keep it under your hat as long as you can..  Hope this helps and CONGRATULATIONS !!!! Babies are so wonderful!  You guys be good to each other ~ Many Blessings from Nevada!

AA10667393	I wish wizjp would stop answering legal questions. He is rarely totally correct.<br>  <br>  He is right that you are emancipated by your actions. You usually don't go to court for emancipation, though some states have a legal procedure for that in certain cases. Nevada has such a provision, but you must reside in the county to file a petition for emancipation.<br>  <br>  Iowa has no legal procedure, but there is a bill to establish one in the legislature.<br>  <br>  Marriage emancipates. Having a child does not emancipate in Iowa  (or most states). Joining the armed forces emancipates. Earning your own living emancipates. Living off a boyfriend while being a full-time unemployed student does not emancipate. An after-school job usually does not pay enough to emancipate.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Everything Wizjp said. Getting emancipated does not affect any other laws requiring a certain age. If your boyfriend is over 18, he could still be jailed for sex with a minor (depending on State laws). Emancipation also requires you to be able to support yourself and live alone. The purpose of emancipation was for those who are able to live on their own with no help from family, friends or Government benefits.|`|AA11206283	They don't emancipate you. You emancipate yourself.<br>  <br>  You need a job, the ability to support yourself financially and socially, a place to live, a plan for the court for conducting your life, usually your parents permission, and a court order.<br>  <br>  uh...in other words, lawyer...I'm right about NV.<br>  <br>  Rarely totally correct beats being totally wrong I guess.<br>  It's a general forum with general advice.

In making its determination, the court shall consider:<br>  <br>        (a) Whether the parents or guardian of the minor have consented to emancipation;<br>  <br>        (b) Whether the minor is substantially able to support himself without financial assistance;<br>  <br>        (c) Whether the minor is sufficiently mature and knowledgeable to manage his affairs without the guidance of his parents or guardian; and<br>  <br>        (d) Whether emancipation is in the best interest of the minor.<br>  <br>        (Added to NRS by 1987, 1279; A 1993, 2691)<br>  <br>        NRS 129.130  Decree of emancipation: Effect; petition to void decree.<br>  <br>        1.  If the court determines that the petition should be granted, it shall enter a decree of emancipation.<br>  <br>        2.  A decree so entered is conclusive and binding.<br>  <br>        3.  Such a decree emancipates the minor for all purposes and removes the disability of minority of the minor insofar as that disability may affect:<br>  <br>        (a) The incurring of indebtedness or contractual obligations of any kind;<br>  <br>        (b) The litigation and settlement of controversies;<br>  <br>        (c) The acquiring, encumbering and conveying of property or any interest therein;<br>  <br>        (d) The consenting to medical, dental or psychiatric care without parental consent, knowledge or liability;<br>  <br>        (e) The enrolling in any school or college; and<br>  <br>        (f) The establishment of his own residence.<br>  <br>  ê For these purposes, the minor shall be considered in law as an adult, and any obligation he incurs is enforceable by and against him without regard to his minority.<br>  <br>        4.  Unless otherwise provided by the decree, the obligation of support otherwise owed a minor by his parent or guardian is terminated by the entry of the decree.<br>  <br>        5.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a decree of emancipation does not affect the status of the minor for any purpose, including the applicability of any provision of law which:<br>  <br>        (a) Prohibits the sale, purchase or consumption of intoxicating liquor to or by a person under the age of 21 years;<br>  <br>        (b) Prohibits gaming or employment in gaming by or of a person under the age of 21 years;<br>  <br>        (c) Restricts the ability to marry of a person under the age of 18 years;<br>  <br>        (d) Governs matters relating to referrals for delinquent acts or violations of NRS 392.040 to 392.125, inclusive, unless the minor has been certified for trial as an adult pursuant to title 5 of NRS; or<br>  <br>        (e) Imposes penalties or regulates conduct according to the age of any person.<br>  <br>        6.  A petition may be filed by any person or by any public agency to void a decree of emancipation on the following grounds:<br>  <br>        (a) The minor has become indigent and has insufficient means of support; or<br>  <br>        (b) The decree of|`|4uike3ARaa	A legal emancipation would be fairly easy, but really, what difference would it make?

In my day, back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth, people took their time getting to know someone before deciding to date them-- generally you took part in group activities with a bunch of people (going to a movie as a group, bowling, concerts, that sort of thing) and spent some time conversing with a person before going on solo dates with him/her.  This served the purpose of having a chance to see what a person was like and being able to ask other people in the group what they thought of the person.<br>  <br>  IMO, if you feel you need to do a background check on someone you're dating, then you're moving too fast in your relationship with them.  <br>  <br>  It's also a good idea to maintain a healthy "Oh, yeah?" skepticism about someone until you've had a chance to really get to know them:  where they work, what they do for a living, their background, past relationships and so forth.  <br>  <br>  Maybe I'm coming from a viewpoint of too long ago, but if I was dating someone and found out that they had run a background check on me, that would end the relationship.

EJ8RZF7taa	Heya Alexis, I am also an aspiring officer. I have done extensive research on becoming a police officer so hopefully some of this info helps. I am assuming that you are either in high school or very close to starting.<br>  I would like to mention that your pathway to becoming a police officer can and should start before you even graduate from high school. <br>  <br>  With that said, I would highly recommend that you try to do a co-operative education with your local police department if it is offered through your secondary school (talk to your guidance counselors for possible opportunities). This co-op program will allow you to examine the various aspects of policing and upon completion your local PD may even give you a reference to use when you actually apply to become a police officer (I know isn't it great!?!) not to mention the high school credits you will receive that will go towards your graduation. <br>  <br>  Now I am assuming that you are a person residing in the U.S. as the majority of people on YA (especially in this category) so I am not sure whether or not your schools offer such a co-operative program as they do in Canada. If they don't why don't you talk to your guidance counselors to maybe start up a program. <br>  <br>  Another option (which I have been led to believe by many answers on YA) available to you in high school which is unfortunately not available to us high school students in Ontario Canada is a ride along with the police which would also be a great experience as you will be able to experience aspects that cannot be experienced in a restricted co-op program.     <br>  <br>  Another thing to note and is very important is that police department look for lots of community involvement so do get involved with the community through community service and such. Also keep in good shape, don't get in trouble, and no matter how bad the peer pressure is don't experiment with drugs!<br>  <br>  The information provided above is very condensed and is something that should be further discussed with your guidance counselor as they should be able to help you on your route to become a police officer.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions feel free to contact me at karlballesteros@yahoo.com or preferably at Karl_luigi_ao@hotmail.com and I'd be happy to help with any other questions no matter how long it will take me to answer.|`|LqaM39Mbaa	Join the police explorers program at your local police department.|`|AtwHV3pXaa	Actually there are always books you can start reading to get you ahead.

Why don't you just ask your boyfriend? You can just call the police and say that you have reasonable suspicion that there is criminal activity at this person's house, and that a child is in grave danger. <br>  <br>  And yes you will have to disclose your identity, but ask that your identity not be disclosed to the public out of fear that you will be endangered if people know you snitched. <br>  <br>  Or you can try those Crime Stoppers Tips Hotlines. I think those are "anonymous". Call from a pay phone or prepaid cell phone that was bought with cash if you want to remain anonymous. <br>  <br>  I would call. Or else if that kid died by accidently ingesting cocaine, or maybe there was actual violence, then I would think you'd be partly responsible for not calling because you could have stopped it.

Because the government gave the banks money we think that gives us a say in how they use it.  So rather than being strictly accountable to the shareholders the management becomes answerable to millions of people who have no idea of the issues involved and who want to micromanage everything.  All this does is destroy any hope of returning to profitability and paying the money back<br>  <br>  This is no way to run a business at all.  There should be no more bailouts of anyone.

KOF2lcydaa	L.O.L.<br>  <br>  I guess a moderate Taliban would only squirt acid on half of the face of a little girl going to school. <br>  <br>  Or perhaps they would give a few less lashes to a woman caught fornicating. (for some reason the men never get punished for these things)<br>  <br>  'Moderate Taliban" It's like being a moderate Nazi. "I just want to eliminate most of the Jews."<br>  <br>  I suppose Obama wants to cut a deal so someone will kill Bin Laden or turn him over to us. After all, the invasion of Afghanistan had nothing to do with stopping the insane oppression of the Taliban. It was about catching Bin Laden. <br>  <br>  If we get Bin Laden, we can abandon Afghanistan, bring the troops home and proclaim victory. The Taliban can go back to blowing up ancient stone Buddhas and beheading people before soccer games. <br>  Everybody wins.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Under the Taliban, people had 2 hours of electricity a day.<br>  <br>  Under the U.S. Occupation, people have 3 hours of electricity a day.<br>  <br>  That's a 50% improvement!!!!!!|`|3MM64geHaa	HAHA!

Americans, in their ignorance, call Pashtuns who are fighting to end foreign occupation of their country "Taliban." There are many more Afghans fighting the US than just "Taliban" who were just a ragtag force of religious students created by Pakistan's ISI. Pashtuns never attacked the United States. They did harbor al-Qaida but al-Qaida is now either dead or no longer needs Afghanistan to operate from. What the US is doing is fighting the Afghan people, and no country has ever won that kind of war, unless of course the US commits genocide. So the only solution is some kind of a compromise with Pashtun tribesmen, as Pakistan has done, to bring about peace and stability. Otherwise, Pashtun tribesmen will keep fighting the US for generations [they are too tenacious to give up] and this so-called "war" will not get anywhere.|`|SV4NxwROaa	Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Why would the President "reach out" to an organization that harbored the people who killed thousands of innocent American civilians, as well as subjugate its own? In my opinion, a Taliban is a Taliban the whole way. Like you said, it's like being "a little bit pregnant," either you are or you aren't. Whoever's idea it was for a guy with ~170 days in the Senate to run for president should be locked away in the whacky shack.|`|RQxZSvFwaa	You seriously think you are going to defeat the Taliban through military means? Ha ha ha...<br>  <br>  Radical leaders; folks that don't want to compromise anything. Mullah Omar would be a good example of this kinda thinking.<br>  <br>  Moderate leaders: Leaders that will accept a compromise, such as Mullah Fazlullah. I think if we can entice other Taliban commanders such as Jalal-ul-Haqani and Bait-ullah Mehsood to come over to our side, we could be in business.<br>  <br>  The main man to negotiate with Taliban would be Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, if we let him, he can open a lot of doors for us.<br>  <br>  From the way you are talking I doubt you even know who or what the Taliban are and I doubt you have any idea about anything I just said, probably just flew over your head.|`|lVjJcUj0aa	What is he gonna do funnel a trillion dollars to the Moderates.?So they can buy some Neutron BombsL.O.L.If we lose a large amount of troops in one attack due to this ignorant trust that Obama has for fellow Muslims then he will be in for a long haul.The Generals will never allow his misguided policies to work against our fine soldiers.|`|AA11121510	Obozo is a moron.

There is also a Fundamentalist leader Jim Wallis, he takes similar positions as Schaeffer.

Spoke to the Republicans regarding the stimulus package.  I agree it was done too late (should have happened before the bill was written), but Bush only spoke to the Democrats once in 8 years...<br>  <br>  2.)  Spoke to the Middle East concerning our relationship with that region, and how it should be changed.  Bush simply treated all of the Middle East as terrorists worthy of being feared - and perhaps creating more terrorists through indifference.<br>  <br>  3.) Spoke to the American people.  Bush reluctantly spoke to us once a year (State of the Union), and rarely made additional appearances, especially when it might make him look bad or question his policies (we heard "mission accomplished", but even the news was discouraged from speaking about his missteps).<br>  <br>  4.) Tackled the economy - made it a first priority.  The Bush administration pretty much ignored it till the **** hit the fan.  Of course Obama couldn't have ignored it, but we didn't see anyone in Congress voting for whether or not the American flag could be burned since they reconvened.<br>  <br>  5.) The fact that you pointed to - he changed the position on medical research as it involves stem cells.  Love it or hate it, some people are going to have abortions, and the fetuses can be used for medical advancement.  It shouldn't be used to encourage abortions of course, but PETA will also have us not test on animals even though one of their leaders is diabetic and therefore only alive today due to animal testing.  On a similar note, Obama also advocated that some of the funds for the stimulus plan go toward the edification of America's youth with respect to sex and child-rearing, which, in the long run would reduce unwanted pregnancies and thereby alleviate the fiscal burden on the health care system that such births disproportionately have.  However, this cannot be its own item on the list, since the same people who typically champion a "pro-life" wanted this taken out of the bill (whether it's stimulative or not is irrelevant).<br>  <br>  ULTIMATELY, the entire tone of the White House has changed, and you have issue with the fact that Congress is slow to take a note.  This is a point which I find shameful, but very little in the US changes over night, and unfortunately many Democrats are relishing the fact that they can get back at the Republican attitude that prevailed for 8 years prior to this election.  <br>  <br>  PS.  I completely agree with the people who have mentioned that he hasn't been in office very long, but there have been some changes, most of which is attitude...and attitude is certainly the beginning point of change since it was our attitudes and rhetoric that got us to a point where we desire change.|`|M961DkIjaa	The man just got into office.

How many times did you hear George Bush say that no one was above the law when he consistently violated laws.  <br>  <br>  Obama had the belief that stem cell research would eventually save the lives of hundreds if not thousands of Americans that have terminal illnesses. Obama reversed George Bush's belief that it was OK for him to ignore the Geneva Conventions. The United States was one of the signatories.of the  agreements that was believed to be a humane thing to do. Obama did not believe in torture and that torture had already been defined by the Geneva Conventions. <br>  <br>  Obama always invites the ideas of his colleagues by listening to the Democrats and Republicans and anyone else that wanted to discuss  matters with him. George Bush had the belief that he had all of the answers to the most pressing questions. Obama never thought that he was the "decider." George Bush had no intentions of allowing others to express themselves with other ideas. <br>  <br>  There are other changes that Obama has made, however I will not bother to mention them here. By the way, I did not vote for Obama because Ralph Nader and Ron Paul were more qualified.|`|B6EpHU1Waa	He shut down Guantanamo Bay. <br>  <br>  Give him a chance, it's only been a month. <br>  The economy isn't going to get better right away.

Why send more troops in a region that is rigged with heavy violence, we already have troops over-extended in the Middle east, fighting a drug war wouldn't help. Mexico has the man power and money to take care of it.<br>  <br>  If we legalized drugs, this would reduce violence, decrease the overflow of our prisons, reduce taxes, and put drug dealers out of business. This drug war is like a second Prohibition, if we ended this ridiculous and expensive war, it would definitely help states by taxing it, and this can be used to fill/balance states, or even the federal budgets. Take care.|`|AA11598520	I'm surprised Obama would considerate it even though it makes sense to the safety of our country as well since the fighting is spilling over onto our southern borders. <br>  <br>  It would be a disaster to legalize those drugs.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Obama likes the nose candy.

Y3YLObM5aa	Hoover was not a good president, but still had integrity.  Which Roosevelt?  Teddy was wonderful, an inspiration to the citizens, FDR the same--he possessed charisma and charm galore.  <br>  <br>  Obama has the charisma, but lacks integrity, morals, compassion, and a sense of justice.  He is conniving and deceitful.<br>  <br>  Hoover and the Roosevelts trusted God, the ONE Holy God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  They believed in the the American people, our country and never tried to scam them.<br>  <br>  Obama trusts his lying, cheating friends and associates and strives to make sure they get anything they ask for---all at the honest citizens' expense.  He is motivated by greed and selfishness.|`|cb1d5eb8ef6d45defc8e354f3870d037aa	Hoover passed one of the WORST peices of legislation in american history the Hawley Smoot tariff that ravaged trade and thrusted us from a recession into a great depression. FDR only propelled and exploited the conomic calamity much like Obama is doing now to cement and extend political democratic power for generations. Their policies were antithetical to free markets and wrought severe and punitive economic conditions that no doubt erased the lives of countless people and depressed many more that survived.

Mexico's drug war filters into the U.S. (I've read articals saying that every day in Nevada there is a death occuring from this alone)... Mexico's drugs constantly come into the U.S. ... if the drug lords win again the Mexican government, do you really feel safe at what else could be in Mexico in terms of future acts of terrorism, missile launches, etc... as long as the turmoil continues in Mexico and the government is undstable the U.S. can continue to expect constant illegal immigration from Mexico (that alone should give the U.S. reason to want things in Mexico to become stabalized and less hostile)<br>  <br>  At this point, I favor either war against Mexican drug lords, or against the entire country itself... besides perhaps it would think out its population... I consdider all the immigration from Mexico to be nothing short of an invasion and it has and continues to significantly impact the U.S. culture<br>  <br>  Compared to the amount of people killed in the U.S. by past acts of terrorism, the amount of people killed in the U.S. by Mexican related drug trade/lords is overwhelmingly huge|`|SvEzmp4Laa	While I agree with you I believe that the Religious Conservatives will fight against legalizing it.

When mexico's government collapses, you will have the same situation in afghanistan before the American invasion. Just look at what happedned to that country when the soviets left. We didn't help them rebuild and their government collapsed. Soon after that tribes fought for control and one of those tribes, the taliban, took over the nation. <br>  So if you want to avoid having another afghanistan next door to our country, you'll let the government or better yet, the military intervine.|`|AVQzBE0daa	Well that kinda takes the edge off drugs doesn't it?<br>  What I mean is that it is no longer a " imminent child safety issue" only the Government can handle.<br>   Heck us serfs might actually get a few rights back out of your legalize/regulate plan...<br>  Does any government act that way?<br>  I am afraid to ponder what dire straights our country might have to be in before the Fed relinquished the billions in law enforcement budgets, and the billions in foreign aid that a plan like this would eliminate.<br>  You have heard of "too big to fail" well this is "too logical for government"|`|IrLPpRiUaa	the Government should just nuke and level the damn country if another American citizen gets killed|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Because it spills over the border into America.

LBJ carried the vote nationally by more than 22 points, and that meant that even relatively conservative states like those that you'd mentioned went Dem because just about everyone nationally who wasn't a hard core Republican voted for Johnson, and that was enough to let LBJ carry UT by 10 points and NE by 5.

Americans in their ignorance call all Pashtuns who are fighting to end foreign occupation of their country "Taliban." There are many more Afghans fighting the US than just "Taliban" who were just a ragtag force of religious students created by Pakistan's ISI. Pashtuns never attacked the United States. They did harbor al-Qaida but al-Qaida is now either dead or no longer needs Afghanistan to operate from. What the US is doing is fighting the Afghan people, and no country has ever won that kind of war, unless of course the US commits genocide. So the only solution is some kind of a compromise with Pashtun tribesmen, as Pakistan has done, to bring about peace and stability. Otherwise, Pashtun tribesmen will keep fighting the US for generations [they are too tenacious to give up] and this so-called "war" will not get anywhere.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	We learned so much "reaching out" to Iraqi insurgents that this should go really, really well!|`|z7BTeUKvaa	At least two people beat you to this question.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	I don't like it.

JhC6BvPpaa	Although to many people it sounds a bit daft, some economists claim that it 'might' have the desired effect to make people spend and put a huge sum back into the economy, and therefore stimulate growth just enough to kick start things again. The USA tried a similar thing last year with a tax incentive, and the Japanese did this. I'm not sure how effective it was. But it's worth trying. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would like to see VAT removed completely off High Street buying for a 12 month  period. But Brussels and the EU forbids our own Govt from doing this. If we could remove VAT, I think it would be even better than giving everyone a grand, because it would spread the buying over a longer period and maybe benefit more people for longer.|`|g7g0j6HTaa	maybe|`|AA11900069	This is exactly what I was saying months back, and John Stewart was saying on his show in the USA...  A payment of tens of thousands to the hard-working, law-abiding tax-payer (guys, you know who you are) would see them A) pay off their expensive "secondary credit" first - credit-cards and personal loans with high annual-interest rates - and B) pay a whack off their "primary-borrowing" i.e. their mortgages.  At a stroke, a lot of credit which was in danger of going bad, is repaid in full.  These workers now have the CHANCE to actually SAVE some cash each month, and of course, all this cash goes back to the banks anyway!  The economy is revived and consolidated within a month, the electorate deeply relieved from stress, and VERY grateful to the party that did this for them! <br>       Where is this money coming from?  It is being borrowed against our future payments of income tax (which is drastically reduced in a recession, with high unemployment and low wages) so it actually BELONGS to us anyway!   Instead, the government, and the US Treasury, will do nothing more than put a band-aid on a broken-leg.  They will spend trillions, and will not solve anything.<br>       1,000 each isn't enough.  Somewhere between ten and fifteen thousand would be VERY nice, wouldn't it?  It would come with a warning not to blow it all on cocaine, vodka and girls.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	The main problem with just giving everyone a bunch of money is that there would then follow a long period of argument about how much to give and to whom.<br>  <br>  I'm a pensioner and giving me ￡1,000 might be nice, but it would not satisfy the needs of say a student, who might think more in terms of ￡10,000 to pay off some of the outstanding tuition fees etc.<br>  <br>  Then what about the crowd having mortgage problems?<br>  <br>  See what I mean?  It just gets worse and the worst state of affairs is the vast army of 'savers' in UK of which I'm one.  If UK.gov is daft enough to give me money then it goes into savings; thus the money is not going into circulation but into a savings slot where it stays doing nothing much, except earn me point 5 percent interest.<br>  <br>  Roll on raging inflation of 15% or more.  Why?  Because when that happens people's outstanding debits and their mortgages will shrink down to the size of a dot.<br>  <br>  Don't blame me, I did not vote for it.|`|08f47edd63e0224660f6c3d00e0c5830aa	At whose expense? The tax payer of course.<br>  <br>  You want to penalise the hard working productive people to reward those who want money for nothing.<br>  <br>  It is this 'money for nothing' attitude that is partly responsible for the mess we are now in.<br>  <br>  The money given to banks is given only for specific purposes, and has to be paid back at some point. Northern Rock is an example, it has paid back almost all the tax payers's money it received last year|`|AA11303083	I think a voucher would be better, one which you could only use on certain goods such as cars, cookers etc to boost the economy in the needed  areas!|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	The problem with giving a lump sum at once, is that companies embrace a spike in demand..

78z7gk7naa	Taken from <a href="http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/" rel="nofollow">http://criminal-law.freeadvice.com/</a><br>  <br>  "First-degree murder is the most serious form of murder. In most states, it is categorized as "deliberate" - that is, the defendant made a clear-headed decision to kill the victim; "premeditated" - the defendant actually thought about the killing before it occurred (the period for this can be very brief); and "with malice"- doing a harmful act without just cause or legal excuse. So if someone decides to kill a business rival who is attempting a corporate takeover, gets a gun, waits for the victim in a deserted parking garage, and shoots him, that killing would have all the elements of first-degree murder. If, on the other hand, the competitors get in a fight when the rival announces his intentions to take over the other man's business, and the second man picks up something and hits the rival with it, causing his death, that is not likely to be first-degree murder. The killer did not plan or make a decision to kill in advance.<br>  <br>  Some states consider killings committed in specific way to be first-degree murder. Although these vary by state, they can include killing by poison, by lying in wait, and by torture. States may also presume malice if the killing is done with a deadly weapon.<br>  <br>  Second-degree murder is killing another with malice - doing a harmful act without just cause or legal excuse - but without premeditation or deliberation. In other words, this means intentionally killing someone without planning to do so in advance. So, if a person becomes angry, walks over to a desk where he keeps a legal weapon for defense, takes out the gun and shoots the other, that may be second-degree murder. There was no plan or advance decision to kill, but the act of taking out the gun and shooting was intentional.<br>  <br>  Felony murder is a killing that happens during the course of the commission of a felony. Even a death that is an accident, will be considered felony murder by most states if it happens while a felony is being committed. For example, if someone becomes frightened and falls down a flight of stairs during a robbery, that would be felony murder in some states, even though the death was accidental and the robber did not mean to cause the death. If 3 people are involved in robbing a bank and one of them shoots a guard, against the wishes of the others, all 3 would be guilty of felony murder, since they willingly participated in the felony.<br>  <br>  If the killing happens during certain felonies, determined by the state, it will be considered first-degree felony murder. The felonies most often included in this category are arson, robbery, burglary, rape, mayhem and kidnapping."<br>  <br>  But simply: 1st is usually planned murder<br>  2nd is a murder out of passionate state, like a spur of the moment thing.<br>  3rd/manslaughter: accidental murder<br>  Felony murder:  Felony murder is a killing that happens during the course of the commission of a felony.

The Taliban has its fingers deep into Pakistan.  Is there anyone who doesn't feel complete horror at the thought of the Taliban with nuclear weapons at their disposal?  We have to either stop them or slow their progress down by trying to engage with them.

Shame on any American bad-mouthing a strong President who has the character to actually look problems in the face and try to do something about it.<br>  <br>  Although this may be a very big pill to swallow, the fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Free World has a very heavy obligation and responsibility to come up with solutions OTHER than slaughtering hundreds of thousands of innocent people every time there is a foreign problem.<br>  <br>  That's why they call it "diplomacy."|`|6JXrlnYsaa	He's trying to practice what he preaches.<br>  I don't know if it will be successful, but we have the obligation to try.<br>  It doesn't mean he's going to give away anything.<br>  Talk is cheap.|`|nx7QtF0paa	it means, teach me your ways, so I can institute them in America.....and by the way, we want to build a pipeline running thru your country... it's a dream we've had for years... name your price|`|4HlB7UkVaa	Will it be at American civilians' expense that Barry learns some people need killing?|`|ofP7bbX7aa	"I will stand with my Muslim brothers" From Obamas book.|`|4gyOqTqGaa	yes we can<br>  <br>  do **** like that|`|AA11212105	If that's true, then I'm glad I didn't vote for him because his policies are worse than I thought.

Americans, in their ignorance, call Pashtuns who are fighting to end foreign occupation of their country "Taliban." There are many more Afghans fighting the US than just "Taliban" who were just a ragtag force of religious students created by Pakistan's ISI. Pashtuns never attacked the United States. They did harbor al-Qaida but al-Qaida is now either dead or no longer needs Afghanistan to operate from. What the US is doing is fighting the Afghan people, and no country has ever won that kind of war, unless of course the US commits genocide. So the only solution is some kind of a compromise with Pashtun tribesmen, as Pakistan has done, to bring about peace and stability. Otherwise, Pashtun tribesmen will keep fighting the US for generations [they are too tenacious to give up] and this so-called "war" will not get anywhere.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	It's called the "Get The Fcuk Outta South Vietnam" play, right out of the Henry Kissinger playbook.... <br>  <br>  1.

Republicans were also upset at McCain for not having a spine and for voting yes to that atrocious "bailout" plan as well.   This is beyond the point of being about party lines, this is about our country.  I know this because I volunteered at McCain's Arlington office and even considered being an intern (to the point that I even interviewed for it).  This was before the proposed bailout.  When he voted yes, I went on his web-page and wrote a big complaint about it and guess what?  I wasn't the only McCain supporter angry.   In fact, every McCain "supporter" I know in real life feels the same way I do.

697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	The chart does not say that have the debt is owed to the Fed.  What it says is that in 2008, approximately $4.2 trillion were in intragovernmental holdings.  These holdings consist of...<br>  <br>  $2.1 trillion in the Social Security Trust Fund<br>  $715 billion in the Civil Service Retirement Trust Fund<br>  $319 billion in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund<br>  $216.5 billion in the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund<br>  $216 billion in the Military Retirement Fund<br>  $112.7 billion in the Military Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund<br>  $72.4 billion in the Unemployment Trust Fund.<br>  and several other funds.<br>  <br>  These funds are not owned by the Federal Reserve and the interest on the debt held by these funds is not paid to the Federal Reserve.  Instead the interest on the debt held by these funds are paid to the fund itself.<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve does not charge the U.S. interest to borrow money.  The U.S. Government borrows money by issuing U.S. Treasury securities. These securities are sold at auction where anyone can buy them, even you.  In fact, I have loaned money to the U.S. Government. The Federal Reserve does not buy the U.S. Treasury securities that it holds at this auction.  In fact, the Federal Reserve buys the securities that it holds on the secondary market.  Since the U.S. Government WILL NOT redeem a security until its maturity date, if a person or other holder of a security wishes to reclaim their money, the must sell it to another person or company.  This is what creates the secondary market.  The Federal Reserve buys and sells securities on the secondary market, aka the open market, whenever it wants to affect the interest rate or adjust the money supply.  This is done through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). BTW, while the Federal Reserve does collect interest on the approximately $1 trillion in U.S. Government debt that it holds, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, excess earnings are returned to the U.S. Treasury.  In 2007, the Federal Reserve collected approximately $40 billion in interest on the U.S. Government debt.  It returned to the U.S. Treasury approximately $36 billion.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Looks like Adam B knows what it means,  He elaborated on the true meaning of the chart so eloquently, didn't he?

Look at Bush and Palin!|`|TBvUomw7aa	You can't really answer this question.  The definition has been changed.  Theoretically, it is one who believes that in a large government that taxes "fairly" so that everyone is taken care of.  Recently, they have brought up all of these social issues which are irrelevant.  All of a sudden, a liberal is a person who isn't hateful, and thinks for themselves.  It is very backwards.  I don't think that it can be defined as it is now so mainstream and the cool thing to do.  I don't know if anyone realizes that liberalism gives more power to the government than they should have on social and fiscal matters.  We are currently (and have been for a while--even Bush is a liberal believe it or not by all definition although he preaches Christian values) under a very liberal government and I must say that things aren't that great and you would have to be crazy to be optimistic about a turn around any time soon.  However, liberals should be praising this as the NYSE is going to inevitably crash and the government will be cutting every single pay check.  Let's see how great it is when we are all living in labour camps!|`|VxpWziZnaa	A liberal has good intentions, but fails at bringing about the change he desires.  For example, their attempt to eliminate poverty by wealth redistribution (welfare) has been a failure on many levels.  It has not reduced poverty, and the unintended consequence has been the break-up of the family.  The dismal state of the black family can be directly laid at the feet of liberal policies.<br>  <br>  Conservatives believe that people, not the government, should help people.  Conservatives give more to charities to help the poor and disadvantaged than liberals.  Private charities are more efficient and more effective at helping the people in your area.<br>  <br>  You sound like a conservative.  The government will spend your money stupidly (look at the current pork-laden bill!  Do you want your tax dollars going toward "tattoo removal"?)  The smart way to spend your charitable contributions is through local charities who are directly accountable to you for how they spend their money.<br>  <br>  The key to reducing the debt is to cut this massive spending.  It is out of control.  We need to cut spending to the point where a reasonable tax level will more than cover the budget; the extra will pay down the debt.  We cannot sustain the spending -- it will bankrupt the country and our children will suffer for our stupidity.<br>  <br>  Social issues are not as important as economic issues.  A lot of conservatives have faith but do not force it on others.  Liberals seem to want to force their views on everyone though, e.g., they must have gay marriage, they must have abortion on demand, they must not have prayer in schools, etc.  Conservatives have lost a lot of ground on social issues, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I hope you see that you are basically a conservative.  Fight for our country before the liberals destroy it through socialism.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Liberals are people who mean well but unwittingly do the dirty work for Socialists.  Socialists have a term for Liberals, they call them "useful idiots".

If you do not realize you are doing it, you are a Liberal.  If you do realize it, you are a Socialist.  <br>  <br>  The difference between Liberals and Conservatives is that Conservatives want equal opportunity, Liberals want equal results.  Conservatives want as much freedom as possible, the Liberals want too much Government Control.

I am a conservative - I respect your viewpoints and wish the best in your future decisions to help determine our national officials. However, I must plug a bit - Bush became fiscally liberal at the end of his term. Obama is erratic with spending. I know you said that you were fiscally conservative - you are OK with the gov't spending as long as you think that it is good spending. Are excessive earmarks good spending? I do not think that it is fair/wise/good practice for a few to decide what is good spending. Every Republican besides three voted against the bill - this is not a true representation of the people. My point is - everyone has an opinion about social issues - everyone will always differ. But, are gay marriage or abortion or other social issues REALLY affecting the majority of the people - NO. But the spending does effect everyone - deeply. I vehemently oppose the bill, but there is nothing I can do.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	a liberal is someone that wants to save the world with everyone's money but their own.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Liberals under wholistic living.

6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	The Nobel Prize nomination committee is politically influenced.  <br>  <br>  Political correctness tends to be a theme with several winners.  How can someone like Mahatma Gandhi, who used a nonviolent method to deliver independence to India, not be awarded?  Meanwhile, Al Gore and the IPCC are handed the prize when their research is still not considered conclusive in many circles (and yes, global warming is still only a hypothesis, not a theory or fact by even their own scientific standards and definitions).  The funniest yet saddest in my opinion is when they gave it Jimmy Carter for his peacetime efforts.  The reason why I think his award is outright wrong is that the collapse of Iran to radical muslims took place under Carter's watch . . . and Jimmy did not raise a finger to prevent it from happening.  If Carter had helped the Shah of Iran, you would NOT have seen the rise of both the Ayatollah Khomeini and Saddam Hussein, the Iran-Iraq War, the invasion of Kuwait, the first Gulf War, Operation Desert Fox, the second Gulf War, etc.  In other words, it was Jimmy Carter's inaction that took us down the road that caused far more political, military, and social conflicts than anyone would care to admit.<br>  <br>  Politics play a heavy role in the awarding of this prize.  Look at the fact that Mikhail Gorbachev wins the prize because he helped bring the Cold War to an end.  The problem is that Ronald Reagan was truly instrumental in ending the Cold War by forcing Mikhail to the table.  In fact, without Reagan, the USSR would have held their course through the Cold War.  Reagan was far more responsible for the end of the Cold War than Gorbachev, but the Nobel committee honors Mikhail over Ronald completely.  Once again, take a look at Carter who was practically detrimental to America's efforts during the Cold War.  <br>  <br>  There are others who have won that have either less than stellar records or are just thrown in to enhance an agenda supported by the committee.  The list includes the IAEA with Baradei, Yasser Arafat, Kofi Annan (a.k.a. Saddam Hussein's UN backer), and the United Nations itself (a number of times).<br>  <br>  This is not to say that there are those who do deserve the honor, such as those who wholly fight for human rights and truly stand for peace.  Still, politics will remain a constant in the nomination and awarding process and that will leave a terrible mark on the institution.|`|RsDZu7iNaa	Would never happen, the Nobel Peace Prize panel consists of all liberals, Gandhi is considered a conservative.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	They felt sorry for a sixty year old guy running around in a diaper.|`|vwqjG9vfaa	He failed to hire a good PR team<br>  You know the Nobel prizes are all politics|`|dWH45KTlaa	He probably would have gotten it if he had preached global warming like that blow heart Gore.<br>  <br>  Before anyone starts name calling me.................go check the news about what scientist are saying about global warming now & what's going to happen for the next 20 - 30 years & they don't understand why.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	I don't think that the award would have meant too much to him.

3bbtzjBuaa	The basic function of the government is to enact the will of the people and ensure that sociopolitical policies do not hamper or benefit the progress of one person/group over another.  <br>  <br>  Should it play a passive or active role in the economy?  Well certainly different times call for different measures.  I think one lesson we should take from the current crises (and I'm not sure why the government was so dumb as to learn it this way), is that business looks out for business, and so regulation by the people, via the government, is absolutely necessary.  How much?  Again, depends on the time...ultimate point is that the government is supposed to look out for the people, and even though businesses are run by the people, it is hardly sufficient to say that those at the top should not be checked, and incorrect to assume that those at the bottom need no protection.<br>  <br>  Should the government be responsible for maintaining financial equality?  Of course not.  BUT again, the government is responsible for ensuring that it's policies, as well as the policies of its businesses do not preclude the advancement of an individual or group other than on factors that do not jive with American culture (laziness, for example).  There would have to be financial equality to begin with in order to maintain it, but that's irrelevant; the government is responsible for ensuring social equality (which it historically hasn't done on many levels, though to varying degrees), and this should inherently impact the potential for financial equality...notice I said potential - the government should not hand out equal sums to everyone, but shouldn't prevent - or allow the prevention of - one person from making as much as another for arbitrary reasons.  Private charity doesn't even really enter the picture here - it's a good thing, but has nothing to do with the government (other than tax benefits), and has little to do with financial equality (other than when it sets up programs that fight against social inequality to uplift those who might otherwise also face undue financial hardship).<br>  <br>  Health care?  I agree with England on this one...If we can spend as much money as we do to kill people (wars), we can certainly use it toward the betterment of our people.  Universal health care in France has shifted the focus to prevention, where we only care about people once they get sick because it seems to be more profitable.  I think health care is a right, and that you cannot justify looking anyone in the eye (children or adults) and tell them that they're not worth being helped because they simply do not make enough money, whereas people who inherit money and never work a day in their lives can take advantage of Daddy's plan.  Anyone who doesn't think health care ought to be a priority or that this country can't do something to improve the health of it's people really doesn't care much for their country in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I think the role of government has to be subjected to the time in which we are speaking, but that the government basically has the duty to look out for its people without telling us how to run our lives - accept when our choices come into direct conflict with the lives of others (crime, undue discrimination, etc.).  No one wants a government who tells you when to eat, sleep, and sh*t, but no one wants a government who just doesn't care.  That's why our system is complex and can't run off of the whims of one person (though Bush and his administration got pretty close), and that's why the system is set up such that "political will is a renewable resource".|`|YupMCYHlaa	The govt. handles national security, foreign relations, regulates interstate commerce, mints currency, etc., all that stuff.<br>  <br>  The govt. also does things that people can't do at their own level. There are a great number of services you use every day that simply wouldn't be available if the federal govt. didn't step in and provide them.  Roads and bridges, water systems, national parks and matching funds for state parks, schools, police and fire departments, sewage systems, all that stuff would be impossible in some places without federal help.  If you live outside of town, you wouldn't even have electricity except for a federal program of rural electrification started by FDR and finished later by Truman.  Standards for clean water and air, standards for workplace safety and environmental protection.  Stewardship of public resources.  I could go on and on.<br>  <br>  Polio and smallpox were wiped out by the federal govt.  There was no point in vaccinating only the 60% of people who could afford to pay for it themselves.  In fact 100 years ago only a bit more than half of children got to be teenagers.<br>  <br>  When people have a problem that they can't solve, they look to the federal govt.  We could sincerely argue about just exactly how far that should go, what the govt. should get into and stay out of. But it's clear that the fed. govt's role is much larger than just defense and regulating interstate commerce.<br>  <br>  Health care is moving into that category of things that won't get done unless the fed. govt. does them.  It is just downright shameful for the richest country in the world to have 45 million people with no official access to health care.  Most developed countries see a certain level of health care as a right of citizenship, just like police and fire protection.  Every other rich country pays half as much for the same care, and everyone gets it.<br>  <br>  Capitalism can't work without a certain amount of federal regulation.  Too much is as bad as too little, the trick is to find just the right level.  The problem we're having today happened because the fed. govt. abdicated its regulatory role, because Republicans saw deregulation as almost a religious tenet.  Without supervision, capitalism goes unstable and crashes.  Then we re-regulate until things smooth out again, and conservatives cry "Socialism!"  But they brought it on themselves!  Their way didn't work, so now the Democrats have to come in and clean up after the elephants.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Say you say me"<br>  Survival of mankind.<br>  Not only tribe of own community with non-existence rights of original descendant in time.<br>  Not glory for idol worshipping the dead Mummy who was past dirty old man like you and me with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ back in the past who was dead and buried was long gone with time when we are the Living and not the Dead yet in time.<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 3.7-9<br>  Exodus 1.5<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Genesis 11.1,6<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  Luke 16.13<br>  Leviticus 26.1<br>  Exodus 23.24,32<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  Matt 5.9,14<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	Up to the government, if that is what the people decide.<br>  <br>  FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|o35cQe3Iaa	I believe we should hardly ever hear from our national government.  The founding fathers wanted the state governments to be much more powerful than the national government to keep it in check so it didn't become tyrannical.  You can see how well that worked out.  The national government has no business in private lives, and should not make decisions for us.  Remember, the government doesn't own us or our property, but that is slipping away too.  People who want universal healthcare want to be slaves in my opinion.  They want the government to take control of their lives and direct it.  We must NEVER let this continue in America.  We have become slaves to our own currency, thanks to the international bankers, who took control of our government when the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.

5KaDHt5jaa	Too big to fail is used in reference to things like political parties.  Legally, there was no way for either Obama or McCain to be on ballots in Texas.  The Republican and Democratic parties both somehow failed to submit in time.  But, because they control our government, and are 'too big to fail' they get to be on the ballot in violation of the law.  <br>  <br>  Another example:  car companies.  There are many small start up car companies in the US.  Most of them go bust and the government does absolutely nothing.  When a major, 'too big to fail', car company is in trouble, they get taxpayer money.|`|5ZfcMc34aa	It has to do with the snowball effect. Or in the case of this particular crisis, the "house of cards effect".<br>  <br>  AIG is a good example. They are deeply invested in the risk market (being primarily an insurance company) but they branched into credit default swaps as a sideline.<br>  <br>  [Credit default swaps (CDS) are the most widely traded form of credit derivative. CDS are bets between two parties on whether or not a company will default on its bonds. In a typical default swap, the "protection buyer" gets a large payoff from the "protection seller" if the company defaults within a certain period of time, while the "protection seller" collects periodic payments from the "protection buyer" for assuming the risk of default. CDS thus resemble insurance policies, but there is no requirement to actually hold any asset or suffer any loss, so CDS are widely used just to increase profits by gambling on market changes. In one blogger’s example, a hedge fund could sit back and collect $320,000 a year in premiums just for selling "protection" on a risky BBB junk bond. The premiums are "free" money – free until the bond actually goes into default, when the hedge fund could be on the hook for $100 million in claims.<br>  <br>  And there’s the catch: what if the hedge fund doesn’t have the $100 million? The fund’s corporate shell or limited partnership is put into bankruptcy; but both parties are claiming the derivative as an asset on their books, which they now have to write down. Players who have "hedged their bets" by betting both ways cannot collect on their winning bets; and that means they cannot afford to pay their losing bets, causing other players to also default on their bets.<br>  <br>  The dominos go down in a cascade of cross-defaults that infects the whole banking industry and jeopardizes the global pyramid scheme. The potential for this sort of nuclear reaction was what prompted billionaire investor Warren Buffett to call derivatives "weapons of financial mass destruction." It is also why the banking system cannot let a major derivatives player go down, and it is the banking system that calls the shots. The Federal Reserve is literally owned by a conglomerate of banks; and Hank Paulson, who heads the U.S. Treasury, entered that position through the revolving door of investment bank Goldman Sachs, where he was formerly CEO.]<br>  <br>  In other words, when one goes down, several more go down and so on and so on.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	The Titanic was too big to fail.|`|zftm6qkKaa	Don't know.

StJGeiFyaa	what exactly is it that you need help with
esOaJoqBaa	You say that you are a healthy vegan, that night be a problem. You will need a lot more protein and calories to build the muscle that you need in the Marine Corps. You can certainly try otherwise, but I would suggest that you eat a little meat. Without that you are going to have trouble putting on muscle. If you can't even do one pull up then you will need to build a lot of muscle.<br>  <br>  Just keep up working on pull-ups and running. Try running or hiking with some weight. You could use a weight  vest or just a backpack with books or water jugs in it. Keep working and making it progressively harder.|`|rYNM67oyaa	<a href="http://www.baseops.net/basictraining/usmc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseops.net/basictraining/usm...</a><br>  <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marinejoin/a/marinebasic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marinejoi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.military.com/military-fitness/marine-corps-fitness/" rel="nofollow">http://www.military.com/military-fitness...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|CnmqbqUmaa	what you need to do is start going on long hikes. start with something like 2 miles and work your way up to about 6.  always keep a time limit and you also want to do it in rough terrain|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	run,crunches and push ups, try to do some free weights. and run some more. learn your general orders and the history of the Marine Corps. and the chain of command. good luck|`|z6IekuwSaa	Work on pull ups more than anything!!!|`|keiQO63waa	I would suggest running 2 miles or more every day. do push ups and curl ups every other day, but do them in sets. for example if your max is 20 push ups, god forbid, then you would do something like 14, 10, 6. consume a lot of calories, especially protein, since that helps build muscles. The military wants physically toned soldiers, they don't need muscle hunks. As long as you can support yourself well and endure a lot, then you should be fine. joining a competitive sport helps you get the feel of the marines too.

nwZ1ZtRbaa	Wow, some of you guys are really rude. This is a kid. Minors can't help where their parents choose for them to live. And when kids come here illegally they have no choice, they can't just stay in the country they came from by themselves without their parents.<br>  <br>  Sorry person who asked the question, I don't know how to help you. Some of these answers just made me really angry because it's not your fault you're in this situation, so I had to say something.<br>  <br>  BTW I'm not talking about the people who just said it was fair, I'm talking about the people who were criticizing you and calling you names.|`|4xpXoG5Oaa	No, I don't think it's fair. You are a good student and a god example of the people that we need in the USA. SOME Americans will envy that because their children didn't have the grades that you have and they get jealous. If you feel good, you can write your president. Start with your Congressman.|`|AA11777563	It seems to me that you are trying to do good things in life.  I agree with you that not all illegal aliens are here to do harm.  Based on your writing skills, you don't seem to be a person who just crossed the border.  Find someone who can sponsor you.  Good luck.|`|9YOXpVM0aa	So if your mom robbed a bank and got away with it, you are entitled to inherit the money because you didn't do anything wrong?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but I think you do have to blame your parents.  So they only wanted the best for you but by doing that, they have made you grow up in a country where you have no status and will always be a 2nd class citizen, doing jobs nobody else wants and looking over your shoulder all the time.<br>  <br>  You can write to your congressman and the president and whoever you want but you know why it will not get you anywhere?  Because if you got pardoned, they'd have to pardon probably another million people or more.  Not good for the economy you know.  Better for them to keep you guys down where you can stay illegal and keep being taken advantage of.  It's a harsh reality but that's the way it is.<br>  <br>  IMO, go back to your country of citizenship and immigrate somewhere legally.  Then you will not have to worry about your future anymore.  <br>  <br>  Now everybody get wild with the thumbs down :)|`|B4wody2Kaa	My ancestors came legally, they did not use that excuse " your ancestors were immigrants' to invade this nation illegally. That's for losers.<br>  <br>  Since you used that pathetic argument, I am discrediting everything you say since your probably racist.<br>  <br>  I hope you get deported, the U.S. doesn't need anymore ungrateful disrespectful immigrants looking to excuse their illegal status by discrediting and defaming legal immigrants and Americans by constantly bringing up that their ancestors were immigrants. pathetic to the core utterly gutless.<br>  <br>  Good grades don't make you a decent person, and their person asking this question is a prime example.|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	Do you think it's fair that because of your parents criminal act the the US taxpayers have to pay for your education? <br>  Who do YOU blame? It certainly isn't my fault! I didn't bring you here! Yet I am suppose to pay to educate you until you at least graduate high school! <br>  If I was to break into your house do you believe that you should make my children members of your family and feed, clothe, pay medical bills, etc. for them! Is that fair? <br>  You should study harder! You might find out that the native Americans came from Asia! Besides my ancestors came legally. <br>  It's like the difference of knocking on the door and being let in and sneaking in the window. Two totally different things! <br>  Do you realize that over 99% of illegal aliens commit a felony within 30 days of their immigration violation? And you want us to reward their children?|`|GMHERSExaa	Well your circumstances are tough, I am sorry you have this dilemma, but you must realize that what your parents did was wrong and unfortunately them being selfish and not abiding by our rules could cause your demise and deportation. Don't blame us blame your parents. They could have come over the right way and chose not to. Now you may pay the price. Im sorry but the law is the law.<br>  <br>  I have a couple of questions for you, about being fair.<br>  <br>  DO you think its fair that your parents come here illegally and don't pay taxes, use our education, roads and other infrastructures? And commit many crimes? Like possibly Identity theft, driving without a licenses or insurance and other types of fraud. Do you think that is fair? Our children's education and well being are being sacrificed as well as our neighborhoods, not to mention out taxes are getting higher every year to support more people in our community thadon'tnt pay taxes and leach off of our system. Sir is that fair? Not to mention the disrespect we get from the Illegals, they refuse to learn out language for the most part, wave the Mexican flag, and demand interrupters and official documents written in Spanish, is that fair? it just cost us Americans more money.|`|vet4adaYaa	I don't get it, why don't you have a SSN. Are you illegal? If your illegal, and not gonna blame your parents, who ya gonna blame? It's not the U.S.'s fault, that's for damn sure.<br>  <br>  BTW, I see soooo many illegals on here state how good grades they have and how they have no detentions.........nobody cares about your grades. Many criminals got good grades in school.<br>  <br>  Do the crime, do the time, no exceptions. It's not fair to people that waited, saved and sacrificed for some illegal to jump in front of the line and expect get a SSN just because the have good grades.|`|xSbTXQpRaa	Do the crime, do the time, no free passes for illegals. Dang, so funny how illegals think they should get a free pass to break the law or claim our laws are "unfair" because they don't agree with them.<br>  <br>  This new breed of immigrant really is worthless and totally selfish.|`|2RPXJ6y7aa	In the U.S., do you know what we call people that break the law to get a better life or follow the American dream, criminals. Criminal are the ones that have to break laws to get better lives. After all, if everyone broke the law to get a better life and the American dream, we all would be living in a world of crap and everything that's great about the U.S. would be gone in a flash.  Immigrant parents don't teach that to their little illegal kids for some reason, maybe to cover up their crimes.<br>  <br>  My ancestors immigrated, worked for what they wanted,but did it the legal way, not the lazy criminal illegal way.  There are right and wrong ways to do things, I have found that if you do things the right way, people respect you and have no worries, maybe some day you'll grow up and earn respect....maybe.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	You came on a visa but your mother CHOSE to stay - she CHOSE to break the law. <br>  As a minor you had no say in her decision to stay and break the law.  <br>  So yes she is directly to blame for why you cannot attend college. <br>  You are illegal which is why you cannot ever attend college<br>  This has NOTHING to do with being fair or not fair. <br>  <br>  The only way you can attend college is to go home to your own country and apply to immigrate legally to USA. This may take a few years - especially since you have no skills and no post-secondary qualifications. <br>  <br>  All illegals are required to do this if they wish to become legal.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I'm sorry, but yes it's fair.  I live here legally, my kids were born here legally and as a result we are debted the rest of our lives to this country in terms of taxes.   Something your parents never bothered to be concerned with.  In order for me to send my kids to school here, I have to pay for it in taxes.   Just like the legal citizens in your area have to pay for you to go to school.  However, being illegal, your parents aren't paying one red cent to help out the community that you are living in, in anyway shape or form.  They aren't helping anyone else get an education.  You're getting an education on everyone else's dollar, you get to live in the community and share in the benefits of the community on everyone else's money without putting in any of your own.   That's what's not fair.   <br>  <br>  People use that tired argument that our ancestors were immigrants at one time as well, but that's not the issue.  You're right half my family was immigrants (the other half is actually native american) but my immigrant ancestors came here LEGALLY.  That's the difference.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	You are either here Legally or you are not ... period. If you are here illegally, then you will need to return to your country of origin and apply for a visa on your own and as a legal resident, you can then apply for permanent residency.|`|H7SQEM4Daa	Yes,it is fair. <br>  You and your family are breaking the immigration laws of our country. Why should someone who is breaking the law be given special privileges.<br>  It is your parents fault. If they had followed the rules,you wouldn't be in this situation.|`|1928ec7437a8eb799db70cd9425e70b7aa	i don't think your situation is fair, but at the same time, you have to think of those who come here legally..they wait a looooooong time to immigrate here and payy sooo much money in the process...<br>  <br>  take my situation..i came here legally as a child but once i turned 21, i couldn't follow on my parents' visa anymore. when i went to the university, i was paying the resident fees, but once i turned 21, i had to become an international student and payed the international student tuition (which is not cheap)..  after i graduated, i had to pay extra money (thousands) to apply for a working visa (h1b visa), whihc is hard to get as it is...my parents eventually became a greencard holder and sponsored me..it took me 6 years since my parents sponsored me until i got my greencard... but all in all i had to payyy soo much tuition and sooo much money to stay legal in the u.s. throughout the 20 years i've been living in the u.s. I came here when i was 9 and now i am 29.<br>  <br>  you can try going to a junior college if a four year university is expensive. i don't know whether you would pay the resident fees or the international student fee in your situation.  (i think the resident tuition).  i know of someone who is undocumented who came here at 13 years old..went through junior high and high school and now goes to a four year..i think he pays the resident tuition.  this is in california.<br>  <br>  but you could try writing to obama but i highly doubt he'll do anything for the undocumented at this time, as he has other stuff to worry about.<br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|xagIY1Quaa	Why yes dear--I do think it is fair.<br>  <br>  You remain in this country illegally and criminally.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are 18 or over--I don't blame your mom.  I blame you.  You are now considered an adult, and you have full choice over your own actions.<br>  <br>  If you remain illegally, then you too are a criminal.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what is fair:  A swift and immediate deportation.<br>  <br>  Whatever my ancestors did or didn't do in terms of how they entered into this country is an issue a few hundred years old, and totally irrelevant in 2009.  I was born here.  I've paid taxes here.  I am a citizen.  <br>  <br>  You weren't born here.  And you aren't here legally.  That isn't fair to the others who try and do it the RIGHT way.<br>  <br>  Your cheating and breaking in line in front of them is what isn't fair.<br>  <br>  PS--if you aren't complaining, then I sure don't know what to call what you are doing.

The existing laws on the books were not enforced or not properly enforced. This is where the Bush Administration does not get a passing grade. Politics aside, the text book definition is that the Executive Office enforces the law, the Legislative branch provides oversight, ratifies the law as well as spending and the Judicial branch provides interpretation or clarity to the law based on jurisprudence. Therefore, the failure to enforce the laws falls squarely and only on the President of the United States.<br>  The Congress has oversight and they dropped the ball in this area. They have oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission which we all know ran amok. The courts had no tangible role. Our system of government failed as guardian to the public as a result our way of life is now teetering on collapse.|`|yGXKYptjaa	Well it was all his fault that bad debt loans started underill Clinton and that the regulations that might have stopped these crooks were torn down under Clinton.

3bbtzjBuaa	He uses a teleprompter for his speeches, not when he answers questions.  The questions are not filtered the way they were for Bush, so it'd be pretty impossible to script precise responses.  Ultimately that wouldn't matter anyway, since presidents are always advised as to how to answer particular topics, though the pres obviously can say what they want.<br>  <br>  Why does he use teleprompters?  All presidents have used teleprompters (or written notes) to give speeches.  It's how they stay on point, deliver the message they want, etc.  It may have seemed like Bush wasn't using these resources since he was constantly messing up his words, but that has more to do with incompetence than speaking without help.  That's why his answers to questions were more choppy and unclear than his speeches.  <br>  <br>  If Obama is simply reading off of a screen without knowing what he's talking about, then all Presidents should have sounded as good as he does.  Some of the answers to your question are just petty.  And your conclusion that he only sounds good because of a teleprompter doesn't fully describe the situation.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	David you mean the evil conservative media.<br>  <br>  He is intelligent and realizes his speeches are important and speaking to so many people so often, it is far better to have a promter than not.<br>  <br>  After eight years of Bush mangling the language and totally unable to give a decent speech, I appreciate a President that is on top of things and wants to stay that way. :)|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	He doesn't, it's just more complaints from the "evil liberal media".|`|04794ba1593c90da5968c17eb34c2329aa	He's a puppet; a carefully planned and orchestrated puppet.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	so he don't spell potato wrong ,say something  stupid, say something he is  not suppose to.

If the muslims are not happy about their conditions in Gaza or the west bank, they are free to move to any other islam state.  If israel didnt exist, then the jewish people would have no state and who could justify that?  Youre damn lucky israel even gave gaza and the west bank to the palestinians.  If israel wanted to, they could control all of the middle east, so you just need to be happy they are only interested in defending themselves.

It was given to them by the Allied nations after winning World War II. You can argue that it was not the Allied Nations right to give that land away, but don't blame it on Israel. <br>  <br>  Second, that land never belonged to the "Palestinians", they are all exiled from Egypt and other Arab nations. "Palestinians" don't really exist, they are just Arab-Israelis that refuse to recognise Israeli authority.<br>  <br>  Third, even the Qur'an says that Israel is the land of the Jewish people. Therefore, Arabs have never had any reasonable claim to it.<br>  <br>  Also, every country has the right to defend itself from those that wish to destroy it.  Arabs are attacking Israel, therefore they are justified in retaliating.|`|eu6UQElYaa	They had the right to attack because they were attacked.   They have just as much a right to defend themselves and their people as the Palestinians.   It's that simple.   Palestinians illegally stole the land from Israelis to begin with.  Launching a campaign of death and destruction.  They got it back.  No problems except Palestinians are too racist and greedy to be able to accept the fact that they need to share land mass with another race.   The West has evolved and learned to accept different groups living together in the same land, something Palestinians have yet to do and no that's not something to be proud of and systematic attacks perpetuated on the Israeli people simply because of racism and jealousy is not something the West will likely ever condone or understand.   <br>  <br>  By the way, the US has plenty of displaced Nazi war victims here and we're able to live with them peacefully.|`|7J1D1IyRaa	Western policy vis-a-vis Israel is partly based on white supremacy [Jews are seen as white and Arabs as colored folks] and partly religious bigotry [Christians mistakenly think that "God gave the land to Jews."] If Palestinians were white anglo Protestants, Jews wouldn't have dared taking that land.|`|axHyoVqGaa	"How is it justifiable for Israel to exist?"<br>  <br>  If you can question the right of a people to exist in your opening statement, I don't need to read anything else to know that I could care less what you have to say about the situation.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Sure?<br>  Are they not living human kind like you and me too?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Say you say me"<br>  "Hurting each other"<br>  What is the definition of Israel?<br>  What is the definition of the " Star of David"<br>  What does the lost generation  fighting for?<br>  Cheap-skate ghostly stories?<br>  Non-existence rights of original descendant?<br>  Who short-changed, conned and deceived the lost generation  with their self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ like the piped piper's with his tune of " My way" with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ too like themselves too in time?<br>  Why not ask the lost generation were they survivors of the past centuries with hear-say of the dead Mummy from the twilight zone in different time zone in time?<br>  If they were survivors of hear-say of the dead Mummy will they all be an old man or crumble into dust in different time zone in time?<br>  Were they not born and raised only after the Liberation of Freedom from world war two in time?<br>  Then why did they let the dead Mummy nail them all back into the coffin alive with cheap-skate ghostly stories from the graveyards of different ghostly ancestor's culture and custom from the twilight zone in different time zone in time?<br>  Who was the educated idiots with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ back in the past like themselves in kicking them all on their butts in time in hitting them all hard on the head with the Book of the Dead until his hands were all splattered red in blood in self destructing human lives of someone else little children with "My way " self prides, self rudeness, unruly behaviour, self image of standing idol in kicking the butts of God in not worshipping God but idol worshipping past dirty old man with self discrimination as people of different races of self racism in time.?<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  Luke 22.3-6<br>  Luke 4.4-7<br>  Luke 3.7-9<br>  Exodus 1.5<br>  John 8.44<br>  Luke 16.13<br>  Exodus 23.24,32<br>  Matt 23.27<br>  Matt 27.29,37<br>  Matt 7.15-27<br>  Exodus 20.1-7<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|AA10645437	You actually have asked two questions that you think are the same, but are actually quite distinct.<br>  <br>  You are asking 1) if it is justifiable for Israel to exist? and 2) if it is justifiable for Israel to attack (presumably you mean their current war in Gaza)?<br>  <br>  Let me deal with #2 first in the context of #1.<br>  The reality is, regardless of what you feel about it, is that Israel exists. That being the case, if an actual threat exists to Israel or its citizens, then yes, Israel is justified in doing something about it and that includes military options.<br>  That is independent of the question of whether you feel Israel should exist or not.<br>  <br>  Now, about question #1. The whole argument you are giving is based on the assumption that the land belonged to Muslims (or Arabs) and that Israel "stole" it.<br>  That assumption is false.<br>  The reality is that before 1948, the land in question did not belong (and by "belong" we mean "independent sovereign state") to its current inhabitants. Its current inhabitants were both Jewish AND Arab.<br>  That being the case, the UN put forth its well known partition plan to create two states, both Jewish and Arab. We all know what happened after.<br>  You complain about people based their arguments on "tales from thousands of years ago" (which BTW, is not the totality of the Zionist argument but I'll let that one pass) yet at the same time your "argument" is based on a false assumptions of historical events from a mere 60 years ago.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is the following: Please learn about the history of the area from reputable historians. Then, clearly define what you mean by "belonging to". And then present your argument.

Police patrol white neighborhoods as if the whites are handing out personal checks.  They enter minority neighborhoods seconds before the gangs, drug dealers and thugs take over...so they need riot gear.  In the white areas they're on a first name basis, while in the minority areas they'll shoot you 50 and 41 times and get handed "Get Out Of Jail Free Cards."<br>  <br>  7. Whites can go to the best schools in the country if they are rich enough, if mum or daddy built the new science lab or have the best scores or based on their skin color.

The rest of us are tired of working hard for our money while the white elite (top white guys who own the top corporations and / or inherited all the money) decide how to spend it.

I don't mean that in a derogatory sense what-so-ever. On top of generational subtle teachings that 1 thing is better than another, which is embed in the minds at a young age, there is another thing that is extremely flawed.<br>  <br>  It is very politically incorrect to say this but, discrimination is almost mandatory. For instance, when you apply for college, there is an option to check your race. Why? Because there is a x amount of Blacks, an x amount of Asians, and x amount of Latinos that are required to be in that school. It does matter if they have half as good grades as a white student. This discrimination is okay in society because it 'gives them a chance.'<br>  <br>  Well that is just no true. If for example, I grew up in a poor area, with a low-income household, I would still not qualify for certain colleges because I am white. If it was a black student, who lives in the same exact area, with the same income applies for the college, he or she CAN be accepted, because he or she is black.<br>  <br>  When we remove this type of thing in our society, that because of skin color they are automatically disadvantaged somehow, than perhaps we might be on our way to having equality. But as it stands, this will not happen, and BO has taken stances to actually increase 'disadvantaged opportune students'<br>  <br>  This is not even where it ends as well. In the job world, some corporations seek out more 'colorful' employees to make their companies look more diverse. Whether they do a better job or not is sometimes completely out of the question.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

Your mother is free to read your mail or your journal or anything else until your 18th birthday (assuming you are an American residing in the United States).  I recommend that if you want to write things in your journal that you don't want your mother to understand, that you either put it in code or write it in a foreign language that she doesn't know (keep in mind though that she could a) destroy it or b) pay for a translator.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you is to NOT put anything controversial in your journal until you are 18...and make it nice and boring....very boring...|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Simply keep it on your computer, and use encryption.|`|H7SQEM4Daa	Yes,you do deserve some privacy. <br>  When I was a teen,my mother did the same thing.

yvPA8FSsaa	Actually, the involvement Eisenhower made in Vietnam was limited to a few hundred advisers.  It was Kennedy that kicked it up a notch and then Johnson that brought it to the full scale.  Both Kennedy and Johnson could have chosen to back off because our involvement until then was mostly to rescue the French.<br>  <br>  The Republicans are not war mongers.  The difference is, once committed we insist on victory.  Few people realize that Nixon had the Vietnam war settled.  He bombed Hanoi until the North Vietnamese returned to the negotiation table. Brokered a settlement that had the North remove its troops from the South and the U.S. would pull out but stand-by to invade again if the North moved on the South.  It was the same sort of agreement as we made it Korea.  <br>  <br>  But, when Nixon began to pull out the troops, the traitorous Democrats in Congress waited until most of our troops were out and then cut all funding of the war.  When the North Vietnamese heard about that they poured back into South Vietnam and our Military was powerless to stop them.<br>  <br>  That is the record of the Democrats in Vietnam.  They pushed our troops into there, would not allow them to win then pulled them out in disgrace causing the deaths of millions of South Vietnamese and Laotian citizens. <br>  <br>  *|`|i0vcEyJtaa	We're not.

esOaJoqBaa	I agree with bonnie. The infantry trains the most for combat, and so they are better prepared for it. I think a disproportionate amount of non-infantry troops have ptsd problems because they were forced into situations that they were not prepared for emotionally or psychologically.<br>  <br>  There are those people who joined for the wrong reasons and are not prepared for what they will see and do. That happens in all MOS, and there is not much that can be done about it. That is a purely personal matter, no one else can determine if a person is truly at peace with what they will be exposed to in war. <br>  This is one of the downfalls of today's military that offers a lot of bonuses and college payments. People go there for the benefits and not out of a patriotic duty. While servicemen should be paid well for all their hardships, there is something to be said for a lower salary in the military. Low pay has a way of filtering out those who don't truly believe in the cause.|`|0szdPqI0aa	I am 15, and i want to go infantry.<br>  <br>  Its not because i want to be like RAMBO, or because i think its fun to go to war.

The infantry and combat mos's are trained with the mentality that the enemy are the enemy and with simulations of what ied hits ect is going to be like.  They don't usally get burned out and have issues until the second or thrid 12 month deployment (yet again the army taking the brunt of the deployments and being the major force).  The support roles, like medics, commo guys, engineers  any of the national guard that don't receive the tactial training ect, the ones that go outside the wire but aren't nessecarily for trained for that are the ones that are stastically having the problems.  Just because u hear a US Soldier home from Iraq just mean it was an 11B.   As for everyone going infantry, it's the easities one to get into.  The training for it isn't as long, it doesn't have the time committment of enlistment that some mos's do, and u can completely Fup the asvab and still get into infantry.  Let's face it, they need those the most.  So i think those may also play a part in a lot of kids going infantry.|`|9rhmeb7raa	I have my own take on this. For over 25 years we have developed a generation of "helicopter parents" who hover over their children to control their leisure time and their world. From Disneyland to Little League and Youth Soccer, it is adult-supervised recreation. Children cannot gather with other children out of the sight of the parents. If they are being driven in a vehicle which comes upon the scene of a car crash where all the bodies are hidden under yellow tarps, the driver of their vehicle still instructs them to close their eyes. When a piece of video comes on TV news that might be slightly graphic, there is a warning announcement so the children can be scooted out of the room. I once witnessed one boy who had been spiked in a youth soccer game and was bleeding from his lower leg. Both teams were directed to sit on their benches, facing away from the field so they wouldn't see the blood. And these were 12-14 year old boys!  In short, they are raised in a sanitized world.<br>  Now they are 18 to 24 years old. An IED just went off and 16 pieces of their buddy just got scattered all over the place. They have no sense memory to draw on when witnessing that scene!<br>  I'm 70 years old. I watched a guy get beheaded by a passing trolley car in Brooklyn when I was ten years old. I saw graphic photos of gangland killings in the NYC papers. I had a man die in my arms in the hospital and one hit the floor dead before I could get the hypodermic out of his arm after giving him a shot.<br>  So, I had sense memory of real death and gore. Not a Rambo movie. Not a video game. A great many of the current generation do not. That's my take.|`|tZqi3hwwaa	People who know nothing about the military think its what you see in the movies.

k3ZVZmBJaa	The short answer is that it all depends on the number of employees of the company at which you worked and the reason for your surgery. <br>  <br>  If, for example, the company only employed 10 people, then it would be immune from the American's with Disabilities Act (ADA) which expressly prohibits discrimination based on disability, perceived disability, or a record of disability.  <br>  <br>  This brings me to the second issue I mentioned.  If your surgery was something not associated or not reasonably considered to be associated with a disability, then you are not covered.  For example, if you went to get an ACL repair surgery or wisdom teeth taken out, then there is no association with a disability.  Conversely, if you had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, then it can be reasonably assumed that the surgery was related to either a disability/perceived disability (cancer).  <br>  <br>  So, what happened is NOT legal if the employee had over 20 employees and the surgery was related to a serious medical condition which can be associated with a disability.  IF these conditions are met, then you can talk to your local human relations/civil rights agency (probably your best bet would be the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC]).  You could also consider getting an attorney, but the court system will not allow you to pursue civil litigation until you go through the administrative process of the EEOC or the state civil rights agency.<br>  <br>  The burden of proof does fall on you to prove, if the aforementioned conditions are met, that the company fired you because of your surgery and not because of some other issue (i.e. lateness, discipline, or work performance).|`|5d9pCmjyaa	In most states, it is unfortunately yes.  They can fire you for not being able to do the work.  But they should be willing to rehire you after your recovery.<br>  <br>  If not, then you have a case for disability or a case against your former employer.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Most likely.  If you are an "at will" employee, you can be fired for any reason or no reason at all.  You can try to contest it, but I doubt you will get anywhere.  Even with the family and medical leave act protection you would have to have been there for at least 12 months.<br>  <br>  You should still be eligible for disability while recovering and unemployment while searching for a new job.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	The majority of the States in our great Nation are '' AT WILL'' employment. Which mean, that they do not need a reason to let you go, at all.<br>  That is why it is wise to get Short and Long term disability while at work, so you time off will be covered. <br>  Meanwhile, you can apply for unemployment.|`|AA11315360	No. Because there is something called family medical leave act. I think that applies to if you need surgery too. If you had sick time or vacation time left then they should not have fired you for needing surgery.

The same weight in 7.62 ammo would get that soldier about 120 rounds.<br>  <br>  The M16 line makes their cold war counterpart, the AK-47, look like carnival booth junk.<br>  <br>  They do have one problem -- operator error can mess them up.  Failure to use the forward assist is the reason behind 95% of the complaints about the weapon.|`|WXLwYANPaa	There is no easy answer to your question as it depends on the situation. You can use a sniper rifle hunting dear but it would suck for self defense. A 12 gauge shotgun will destroy anything in close range including the people in the next apartment. A 50 cal desert eagle will stop a bear but can also knock you out if you can't handle the kick. The most important part of what makes a gun best is how well you can use it to hit only what your aiming at. I saw a quote  that says it best "You won't rise to the occasion but sink to the level of your training" . I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  P.S.

(Yes cannon, the Serbs had a 20mm beast and the U.S. tinkered with a 25mm 'sniper' weapon!) Of course you could also go with a man portable ATGM such as the Milan, Javelin, Sagger, ETC ETC. Shotgun-10 to 12 gauge sized with either slug (penetration) or shot (area / grouping) or flechette (body armor penetration / velocity) and a large capacity to load rounds quickly such as a drum attachment. Then there's the whole question on how the shotgun operates (automatic, pump, lever action ETC ETC.) As for handguns depends on many factors. Are you looking for velocity (speed of the round) or mass (size of the round), Then are you looking to dump all of the rounds energy into your target (one entry wound with no exit wound for maximum internal bleeding) or does your round have to penetrate body armor first and therefore have to have a harden core such as tungsten?<br>  <br>  Really too many variables. List what your target is and what is available to get a better, more refined answer.|`|HEpBYfWWaa	The best long range rifle would be the .308 (7.62x51) bolt action, <br>  The best assault rifle would be the AR15 .223 (5.56mm)<br>  Iam not sure about a shotgun handgun, but a shotgun would be great for close range support.<br>  My personal favorite for the long range rifle is the Gew 98 7.92x57.<br>  The best bolt action rifle in the world.|`|YxpHWFpJaa	Best assault would be an ar15, try the DPMS SASS rifle platform. That could be your long range rifle too caluber is .308<br>   Shotgun you cant go wrong with a Mossberg 500 they are very customizable for your specific need. Use #4 shot<br>  Handgun. Try an FN Five-SeveN yes spelled like that. It fires a 5.7mmx28 rifle round with a 20 round magazine. FN makes great firearms, most of what our US military uses is FN make like the M249 SAW and some of the m16s. They claim its accurate and lethal at 300yards.

Long time, LavaDog, still in Hawaii?<br>  <br>  There are no longer an Amphibious Reconnaissance School, they moved the Basic Recon Course to SOI (West); and you have to have completed the rifleman course, which is the MOS 0311 field.  But that doesn't mean you have to be in the Infantry, you just have to complete the rifleman/0311 course.  Then they have this Marine Awaiting Recon Platoon (MART)...back in my day, we had the Recon Indoc Platoon (RIP)...things changed these past 7 years.<br>  <br>  The Recon candidates are required to go to the Army Airborne School, Fort Benning, GA... then to the USMC Combatant Diver Course (SCUBA school) in Panama City, FL.  Then lastly, SERE School, the one that teaches Level C.<br>  <br>  Not many Division Recon Marines become parachutist, since they aren't the ones that are needed to be inserted deep behind enemy lines.  They usually ride in humvees and conduct reconnaissance-in force.  However, Force Recon are the parachutist foremost, although none of us would never do an 'actual combat jump'; apparently, there hasn't been a real need for special entry as of yet.  We just wheel in by tactical vehicles or walk it by foot!  But all, recon Marines, division or force recon have to be combatant divers.<br>  <br>  And again...9 times out of 10, recon Marines will not utilize these insertion methods in combat.  Wierd how things are!<br>  <br>  Force Recon is now disbanded...with the exception of 3rd and 4th Force Recon Companies...they are the Reserves.<br>  <br>  Recently, 2nd Recon Battalion (the division recon unit at Camp Lejeune) has has reinstated a "Force Recon Company" to preserve the deep recon assets to the MAGTF; but will no longer provide Direct Action missions, since the MSPF has assumed the role in its stead.<br>  <br>  But remember, the Marine Infantry, the grunts, the foot soldiers of the Corps, are the "real badass mofos"!  They are the real warriors that go toe-to-toe against the enemy, lobbing grenades and dodging mortars and bullets, and bayonet-to-bayonet.  Recon Marines are only the organic support units to the Infantry.  Recon isn't designed to be a fledging force of arms.  If you fire one round, mission failed.  If the enemy is firing at you, then you and your team totally screwed up on stealth and you-be-fuct!|`|rxMHRbTzaa	You cannot enlist for Recon. You need to be a Infantry Marine first.

tROFU72waa	When I as in 3rd Amphib Recon we used to cross-train with the SEALs on occasion. Mainly during foreign operations like Thailand and the Phillipines to name a couple.  SEALs are a part of SOCOM and work with the Rangers, as well as Army SF, however MARSOC (the new Force Recon) doesn't work with the others very often.  <br>  <br>  In Iraq the Army and Marines work quite often with each other on joint raids and operations.<br>  <br>  EDIT* Yes Kojak the new MarSOC falls under SOCOM, but as per SOP the Marines still stick to themselves for the most part.  I'm on the other side of the fence now, but during my time in Recon we never saw an SF'er or Ranger unless we passed by them at a school.|`|RTx1D48paa	The composition of a special operation unit will depend on the mission.<br>  <br>  While normally various specialized units ( Force Recon, Special Forces, SEALs, etc) operate alone it is possible to mix them in any combination that will get the mission done.<br>  Often we are attached to the Embassy in what is called a "Country Team"..... (I still have my Embassy pass from Grenada) These Country Teams can be composed of almost any number of military units or government agencies..... in Grenada I worked with USAID<br>  <br>  I have had A-Teams augmented with personnel from a variety of commands ( MI Bn, civilians, Engineers,etc) <br>  <br>  Maybe some Marine can answer the second question.....to my knowledge SOCOM has liaison officers from all branches...... and I think Marine Force Recon falls under SOCOM ???|`|SeqRrVmIaa	Marine Force Recon was mostly transferred to MarSoc and operates with SOCOM (Special Operations Command.) Yes, SOCOM has special ops from all branches and they work together.<br>  <br>  Force Recon was one of two types of Recon in the Marine Corps. They were trained and equipped for deep penetration. With MarSOC manned and experienced combat veterans available, a Force Recon Company was activated last Dec. as part of the 2nd Recon Battalion at Camp Lejeune. These recon elements will provide recon for the Corps as Recon historically did. MarSOC will operate within SOCOM.|`|ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	i don't know, i would think marine recon would work with seal.  I would also think the marine expeditionary might work with seals.  Rangers typically work with green berets, delta or in some cases us paratroopers.  The branches seem to stick together sf wise becaue they are so specialized.  As far as ground troops u see a lot more branch cross over now.  Navy deploying on land with marines, air force deploying as FO's for marines and army.  My hubby's army unit actually helped run half of a marine controlled base, last tour of iraq.  60 years ago a branch was a branch, they rarely if ever mixed ect for air force/army and navy/marines.  Now everyone works together.|`|43020ac749e39e4f61d33dcafebc2d4daa	It depends on the mission, but SEALs have worked with both, and others.
tZqi3hwwaa	Here's what this guy told me. He was in both the army and marines. His name is jeff77042:<br>  <br>  <br>  I've spent time in both the army and the marines; the army is the better choice.<br>  <br>  If you're determined to go marines then if shouldn't be too hard to take some unchallenging classes at a community-college. The best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I see that three people have giving me thumbs-down. I'm guessing that its three marines. Here is why I believe that the army is the better choice (in no particular order):<br>  <br>  1. The army has more MOSes (Military Occupational Specialties) than the marines to include more high-tech MOSes.<br>  <br>  2. 90% of all of the special operations forces (SOF) of all four branches of the armed forces are in the army. This includes, Rangers, Delta Force, Special Forces (which the ignorant refer to as "the green berets"), Civil Affairs, Psychological Operations and Special Operations Aviation. This does *not* include airborne units like the 82nd Airborne Division or the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.<br>  <br>  3. The army has far more places to be stationed outside of the continental United States than the marines do to include Germany, Italy, Korea, Panama, Alaska and Hawaii. Other than Iraq and Afghanistan, which will end eventually, the only place that the marines have a significant number of troops is Okinawa. The japanese *hate* the marines there because, frankly, so many of them are so badly behaved.<br>  <br>  4. If your goal is to experience combat the army has far more troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan (and has taken far more casualites). Despite all this "first to fight" nonsense that the marines constantly spout the army has always had the main ground combat mission. In our wars up to WWII the marines were largely conspicuous by their absence.<br>  <br>  5. The army is better funded and the quality of life is generally better.<br>  <br>  6. I'm not sure but I think that the army has the best college benefits of all four branches of the service.<br>  <br>  7. I speak from experience: the marines harass their troops--needlessly--more so than any other branch of the service. Its like they all have a broomstick jammed up their rectum.<br>  <br>  8. Its my understanding that promotions come faster in the army due to how they're structured.<br>  <br>  An interesting fact: in its 234 year history the U.S. Army has conducted more amphibious assaults than the marines have. (The marines take pains to *not* advertise that fact). In the largest amphibious assault in history, D-Day, June 6th, 1944, there was not one swingin' marine corps ying-yang there!<br>  <br>  Again, I have spent time in both the army and the marines. I know what I'm talking about.|`|65Q8oMvUaa	It's all up to you but from the experiences I have had with former and current Marines I respect them more than I do soldiers.

Respect for choosing infantry.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|tZqi3hwwaa	It doesnt matter because its all on what branch you wanna join..

AA11494150	The burden of proof required for a traffic stop is "reasonable suspicion". This suspicion does not have to be traffic related.

Whenever a cop asks me why I think I was pulled over (which is a question that often leads people into incriminating themselves), I just tell him we both know he needs no reason and could come up with any bogus reason if neccessary.

A stun gun simply causes pain compliance. It will not lock up your entire body the way a Taser will. However it WILL hurt and will cause some slight burning at the point where you were stunned.

eb4134143bcb36114275325ce8dffe26aa	It depends upon where the child lives.  If he is an American residing in the United States, he has very few rights and his parents have all of them.  His parents cannot beat him (physically assault him) and they have a duty to provide basic shelter, clothing, education, and medical care...nothing else.  <br>  <br>  His parents can can control his mail, his phone calls, what subjects he takes at school, where he goes to school, if he has a job (they can seize the monies to pay for his board, (depending upon the state), what friends he sees and when, whether or not he has a driver's licence, attendance at proms or school trips.  They can also place him in a treatment facility or boot or wilderness camp too if they feel it is necessary...as long as he is under the age of 18<br>  <br>  So yes, they can "punish" him by refusing to provide privileges.  By the way, no judge will grant him "emancipation" based on the grounds that he doesn't have any privileges.<br>  <br>  Fortunately though you said he is almost 18.  On his 18th birthday, he is free to move out (check the law for your particular state in case the age is 19) and get a job and support himself.  He will be responsible then for his own actions (he won't be allowed to drink alcohol though).<br>  <br>  Now if you want my advice, I suggest you tell your friend that for his personal comfort you are going to avoid him until his 18th birthday (it won't be long) and this will give less fodder to his parent's fear...and then do so.  Also, you may wish to remind him privately (tell him not to mention this to his parents as it could be conceived as a threat) that once he is 18, he is under no obligation to ever see his parents again if they make his life miserable now...and he doesn't need to let them into his children's life either, if and when he does have them.  Although this is not the Christian thing to do, perhaps meditating on this will help him to pass the next few months in patient resignation...which is all he can do by law!|`|zqok6nJ1aa	Depends on the punishment. The fact is a parent - at least in Australia, I don't know what country your from - as the right to punish their children but to a point. You can't beat the child, you can't lock them up, or anything that is seen as assault or abuse. However if they want to ground you, make you do extra chores, deprive you of pocket mone that's fine, legally. Ethically however however depends on your on views and stand point. <br>  <br>  It's hard for me to find a source for you because the fact is there is no law regarding why you should punish a child only how you can punish them. Which you can find on any general legal site. Again this is for Australians, I can't speak for other countries. There are some coutries that have laws regarding why, but most western countries do not.|`|tqD9xUpYaa	What type of punishment are you talking about for having a friend?  What do you think they're doing?  What ages are they?<br>  <br>  Of course, you should talk with your child about their sexual feelings and try to get them to understand themselves as a way to help them mature into good human beings.  But to "punish" them for being gay will just destroy your relationship with them and not help them grow.  If that child is over 18, you have no legal say in the matter.  If they're under 18, you can withhold privileges, etc. for anything you want.  Just be careful what you want - for the sake of the child!|`|YFzprqqgaa	You can punish your child for violating ANY rule that you have set for them to follow.  If you tell them that homosexuality is forbidden in YOUR home, then they had better hide it until they are out on their own.  If you say no dating and you sneak out to do what ever, then you pay the consequences.  Your parents can punish you for being a idiot in a no idiot zone if they want too.|`|7uznrLBXaa	Parents have the right to punish them for anything they please.  They could punish their kid for being straight, for getting a 4.0 average, for smoking, etc. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, it depends on what you mean by "punish."

It was laws signed and pushed through congress that made it easier to get mortgages and laws written by republicans over the decades that deregulated wall street that caused this whole thing to happen. Bush was in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is all nothing he did caused this, and if anything his tax policies has kept everything from collapsing as early as it could have. And wars are always economically stimulating so you can't blame that either. Our country has slowly over time allowed this to happen. Bush being president didn't effect it at all. <br>  <br>  In regards to Obama, is tax hikes are never going to help the economy and his economic stimulus is just slowing the inevitable. Our system is built to correct itself, and if you prevent it from reaching rock bottom, it will never bounce up.|`|tBclx9Qcaa	You probably should get your facts straight before you open you mouth because you look like a fool when you don't.  <br>  The 80's and 90's saw unprecedented economic growth.  Since the economy is cyclical, there were two instances were recessions occurred.  The early 90's and the early 2000's.  Bush inherited the early  2000's recession which started in October of 2000.  He then faced 9/11 which made things worse, not better.  His solution was tax cuts.  The tax cut, which everybody who paid taxes got, brought us out of the recession until this latest recession which started end of last year.  <br>  Recessions are the markets way of correcting themselves.  Happens on a regular basis.  The solution should be again, tax cuts with limited government intervention.  Nope.  Obama and the socialist who run the congress can't do that.  Why?  Because they are socialist and they gotta spend, spend, spend.  <br>  No, Obama doesn't have a chance if he continues to spend like he has been.  Wall Street has just given him a vote of no confidence.  Don't' know if you bothered to read about that or not.  The market is down over 3,000 point since Obama was elected.

AA11974929	You put your complaint in writing to landlord with all the relevant W5s - who, what, where, when, why and how much - and you keep a copy. If no reply w/i reasonable period - this depends on the nature of complaint - contact residential tenancy/landlord-tenant authority to inquire how to proceed. Certain complaints, of course, are the purview of coppers - i.e. noise, violence. If you call police, be sure to tell them you fear for your safety. That's the signal.|`|ibeulrlYaa	it all depends on what the complaint is.. file with the police if its something serious, or perhaps the management of where you live has a system they have to go by, for legal purposes. does this violate someones lease or agreement? or maybe try talking to the tenant yourself?

Didn't agree with him 100% but who does anyone agree with 100%?  <br>  Some times you have to prioritize which issues are more important.  And with the mess that is going on right now, I would have to say I agree with Ron Paul on the most important issues.<br>  <br>  I hated the interview with the son of a Religious Right man.  I agreed with him on some issues, but he was so off on others that I found myself wanting to yell at the TV.  <br>  Rush did NOT say he wanted the country to fail.  He said he wanted Obama to fail at turning the country into a socialist nation.  I saw the interview Rush gave with Hannity.  I read the transcripts of the interview.  That is what he said.  For this man to act like Rush said anything else made him lose all credibilty in my eyes!<br>  I can't stand Rush, but I woudl put this into the catagory of "I agreee with WHAT he said, but hate the WAY he said it."  The man (Rush) thrives on controversy.  He is a divider!  More interested in getting more loyal conservative followers than for truly helping the conservative movement.  (He is alienating the moderatly conservative Republicans)<br>  <br>  The interview with Jamie Farr was good as well.|`|yGXKYptjaa	Have not had a chance to see yet, but comes on cNN at midnite, CST and then 10 pm on Sunday.

Read the Foxfire Books, and build a few rabbit boxes. If you have a good ammount of cash in the bank, buy gold coins. Screw the FDIC, it would break under the first ounce of pressure. It's only there to keep you from freaking out. Don't freak out, just prepare. Buy lots of rice, dried beans, etc. and do it quick. Cheap lighters are GREAT for barter, as are the .22 rds. Learn how to make things, and ask your elders, if they lived in the backwoods, how THEY lived. Many of them never held a "job", they just made what they needed, and what they couldn't make, they traded for.

Honestly, I think technology has developed to the point where we could manage without money decently. If this were to happen, online barter would replace currency transactions. Currency exists because it is needed as a medium of exchange; it's a way of communicating information, when you get right down to it. In this regard, it is still immensely useful, but I think we could now fairly easily devise methods to manage without it, as IT could now communicate this information, whereas in the not-too-distant past, this would not have been possible.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	Yeah, like get a job ; )<br>  <br>  If it gets to that I can get everything I need from some smug government dirt ball who stole it from people like me.<br>  <br>  If the government has all our resources, I'm going to get mine back and some bureaucrat *** with it cause I'll be pissed I have to go through all that just to get mine back.<br>  <br>  They take my weapons, I'll make a bow and shoot someone with guns, and there we go.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	I don't know it's illegal to own a taser where we live.<br>  <br>  We believe in War of the Words.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you know some really nice people.|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	Depending on your state, it could be illegal to OWN a taser. But, the general rule applies, you can use a weapon that is one step above the force used against you. For example, you can use a baton, if the other person was using their fist, or you can use a gun, if the other person was using a knife. This usually applies to police though.|`|U88iY2blaa	Better to call the cops and have them prosecuted for Assault and Battery. Nobody has the right to punch you, that is breaking the law.<br>  <br>  However, you may not have the legal right to taser another person because they punch you. You might be in violation of the law, especially if they only punch you once and don't press the attack further. This might be seen as an unreasonable response. You might get yourself in trouble.<br>  <br>  However (again) if they are attacking you with lethal intent (i.e. trying to kill you) and they put you in fear of your life, under those circumstances you have the right under self-defense laws to respond with deadly force (you can legally kill them), so by comparison a taser would be a much milder response than, say, shooting them.<br>  <br>  So it really depends on the situation, who you are and who is attacking you, and under what circumstances. 240 lb. guy gets punched by his 95 lb. girlfriend and tasers her in response, big problem. 240 lb. guy is attacking a 95 lb. girl and gets tasered by her, well then good for her. There are no sure-fire formulas to determine what the law dictates, and that's why there are cops and lawyers and judges. So again, better to call the cops under most circumstances and have the law come down on the other person. That is, if you are pretty sure you are going to be OK after the person stops hitting you.<br>  <br>  The bottom line, if you are in fear for your safety because someone is attacking you, and you don't know if they are going to stop and if you are going to be OK, and you have a taser at your disposal, it might be a good idea to use it on the person even if there are legal consequences for you. As the old saying goes, "It's better to be judged by twelve than carried by six." In other words, better to be alive than in a coffin.|`|AA10984198	Depends on where you are.<br>  <br>  In Texas you can pretty much shoot anyone for anything (someone robbing your home, let them have it with both barrels and call in an airstrike, not problem).<br>  <br>  Anyway, a taser is considered to be non-lethal force...in the sense that you are not using the taser to take the other person's life (but just like hitting someone, you could kill them).<br>  <br>  So the use of a taser to defend yourself is perfectly legal. You don't even have to be hit, just threatened with violence. If you fear for your life you are allowed to shoot.|`|64a896d0cf1c266ed8dd101d4d52ccf9aa	Like any other use of self defense, it's not really black and white.  The general rule is that you can use force against someone: 1) if you are not the first aggressor 2) you reasonably believe that such force is necessary to protect yourself or others and 3) the amount of force used is proportionate to what is brought to bear on you. In some situations, you have a duty to retreat, if possible, rather than fight back.<br>  <br>  So if someone has punched you, you did not start the fight, and you reasonably believe that the attack is going to continue, you would most likely be legally justified in tasering them|`|73c9d4fa33559b0b87d0a9b88bc8f2a3aa	probably not. civilians have to observe equal force.
AA10264916	1. MOST IMPORTANT.  Be true conservatives.  Lately Republicans have tried seeing the picture from the left's shoes, but it backfired on them.  Sadly, many Republicans aren't being consercatives, and conservatism is what voters like myself are really looking for.  I even considered looking into other parties because of the GOP's failure to be conservative, but I truly believe that after losing this election and taking on new leadership, the GOP has realized it's failure to keep voter confidence and is now taking steps to earn that back.<br>  2. Don't back down between now and 2010.  This sort of ties in to #1.  If Republicans decide to give up putting up a fight, however hopless it may be, against the Democrats and their ways, it will be their undoing.<br>  3. Display the true GOP attitude to the public as much as possible.  Misleading media coverage and simple lack of interest in politics makes conservatism look bad.  (i.e. we want war, we don't care about lower class, we're homophobes, anarchists, nazis, the list goes on and on.)<br>  4. Start thinking about 2012 now!  I know a lot of people are saying it's still four years away, but look what happened to the Democrats in 2008.  The majority of that year was spent by democrats bickering amongst themselves over who was their best candidate.  Meanwhile Republicans got down to business, selected a candidate, and started campaigning much earlier.<br>  5. This is a general rule.  Play it cool.  Don't get corrupt.  (Dave Vitter, great politician, name ruined because of you know what).|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	In a nutshell Obama has to be perceived as a failure--in the modern age Presidents with positive approval ratings get re-elected, period. Ford (who really annoyed the electorate by pardoning Nixon) nearly won re-election, Bush who certainly was not loved by a lot of people got re-elected, etc. The Republicans really have little control over their futures at this point--they have to hope that Obama screws something up massively, or the economy stays bad and people start blaming Obama for it.|`|9NaojLmJaa	dopes for dopes, dems, reps, dummies for dummies. if you sell it they will buy it. marketing 101 has become and has always been government at its finest.

The abortion issue is why many liberals like me have voted for Republican presidential candidates. Second, quit being a bunch of cowards and enlist in the military and fight in the wars they support. Third, realize that they do not have to be such staunch conservatives. There are some things that they can bend their views on, such as universal health care and foreign relations. As Pat Buchanan said after 9-11, instead of asking how could they attack us, ask why they attacked us, ask why did they attack us. The "religious right" is not the prolem. There are a lot of people on the "religious left" that do not believe in abortion and some that I personally know have voted for all the past Republican candidates because of their views on abortion. There are some Republicans, such as Rudy G that were for abortion, and in fact thought that abortion should be paid for by the government.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	1.

kPG2g4iSaa	Believe me, I'm all for promoting nuclear power, but reactors in cars is a bad idea at worst, an immature (as in "an immature technology" one at best.<br>  <br>  1. Shielding. You are going to have to shield people (driver, passengers, pedestrians, people in other cars) from neutrons and gamma rays. You can't effectively scale down the shielding requirements just because your reactor is smaller. A high energy neutron or gamma, for instance, requires a certain thickness of material to be attenuated to a certain degree and that thickness is largely independent of the number of those particles/rays that are actually being created. It requires 4" of lead *on all sides* to reduce a 6 MeV gamma flux by 99%, or another 2" to reduce it by 99.9% and even that will probably not be enough. Neutrons are not very effectively shielded by lead, so you would have to use a hydrogenous material such as water or polycarbonate to shield the neutrons. 48" of polycarbonate would shield 99% of the neutrons; another 24" would shield 99.9%. Again, even that may not be enough. Now we're up to 78" of total shielding. So, just the (questionably effective) shielding would be, at a minimum, a ball that is 13 feet in diameter - and that is with zero room on the inside for something such as a reactor.<br>  <br>  2. Contamination in the event of collision. Admittedly, the odds of surviving a crash in a car equipped with a liquid fuel bomb is probably less than a car equipped with a sturdy reactor - but that's only a short term advantage. What if the crash causes the release of fission products? Yeah, we can clean it up by going to the crash site and loading all of the contaminated dirt and asphalt into dump trucks and hauling it off to...Yucca Mountain. <br>  Oh, geez, now we have to<br>  1. treat the heavy equipment and dump trucks as radioactive material, <br>  2. figure out how much of radioactive dirt and asphalt might be produced annually, <br>  3. worry whether some mush-for-brains might want to grab himself a contaminated "souvenir" from the crash site before the help arrives, <br>  4. ensure the radiation workers clear the site before the EMT's can get to work<br>  5. shut down traffic to repave the road.<br>   <br>  And all of these difficulties I just mentioned don't even consider gaseous fission products which would be impossible to keep from getting into the environment, or what happens if an accident occurs when it is raining. In that last scenario, the rain would begin to uncontrollably spread the fission products the instant they were released.<br>  <br>  The biggest reason it's not a good idea? Almost no one would buy a nuclear car - certainly not in the quantities that would make them economically feasible. It would be *very* expensive and folks are so irrationally afraid of nuclear power now that the idea of a nuclear reactor in every garage would keep them up at night. (Hey, just read the answers to your question!) If people were unafraid of nuclear power enough that they would consider a nuclear powered car, we would have as many nuclear power plants as we have shopping malls. And, if we had that many nuclear power plants, we might even be able to satisfy all of our energy needs with electricity generated by splitting the atom which would, in turn,  make electric cars a lot more feasible.<br>  <br>  Only 1 kg of uranium won't work. You would need *at least* 52 kg because that's the critical mass of U-235. In reality, the core of the reactor would have to be probably twice as large as the minimum 17 cm diameter sphere a barely critical mass requires. As soon as enough U-235 has fissioned such that the total amount of U-235 in the core is below the 52 kg threshold, the reactor will no longer work. In other words, no intact core, operational regardless of its size can ever have less than 52 kg of U-235.<br>  <br>  Oh, and a couple of CAT scans of the head would net me over twice the annual ionizing exposure I received when I was a nuke in the Navy. And that's using the exposure from the CAT scan that imparts the smallest dose. Said another way, only "a couple of CAT scans" sounds like a lot of exposure to me! Also, because that couple of CAT scans would not actually be due to a medical procedure but an accident, the law concerning legal radiation doses to the general public would have been broken. The legal limit for "members of the general public" is 100 mrem in any one year. A CAT scan of the head imparts 140 mrem of exposure.<br>  <br>  If, as you claim, it actually *is* feasible to engineer a containment and shielding structure that can fit on a car and allow room for adequate shielding, I'd be thrilled to see some documentation!<br>  <br>  Way to think outside the box, but no cigar on this one. Come up with a way to significantly reduce shielding and make it much more effective, and keep dangerous fission products from being produced and the expense may just cease to be an issue. Also, I think it will take longer for them to come to market than you think it will. See the physorg link below and scroll to the last two paragraphs in the article.<br>  <br>  In the interest of full disclosure, I do not work in the nuclear industry, have no investments in the nuclear industry, nor know anyone who works in the nuclear industry. I don't want to work at a nuclear power plant for the same reason I wouldn't want to work at any sort of power plant: the hours. They're on for 24/7 and have to be fully staffed around the clock. I would have absolutely no problem living right next to any American nuclear power plant, or any sort of modern nuclear waste facility.

5vqo3XzHaa	What I've heard is that China will be able to claim "eminent domain" on land/buildings/homes in the event the U.S. defaults on what we've borrowed from China.  I really pray it doesn't happen, but with the spending spree this administration is on, it just could happen.|`|AA10057370	Why get deep in debt to a nation like China?|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Yes it is...lock, stock and barrel! Just look at the one-sided trade agreements and America's unemployment in 2009! This tells the story!|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	No ... it is more like renting with an option to buy!|`|SahUDTLnaa	Money wise yes. Thanks to Obama.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	WTF....

We've pumped billions into their economy towards export and trade. We may have drawn money from them for the stimulus allegedly but certainly we're not selling them lots on American soil in exchange.

They're fine for very short-term situations, but they don't provide any long-term security.  They can be easily cut - some people have actually been able to bite through them (I've seen it done, not by someone handcuffed by them, I admit, but not everyone is cuffed behind their back so that's not going to work really well as an excuse).  Also, as they're disposable they actually would be more expensive - you'd have to replace them every time you used them.  Even if you only had someone handcuffed for a matter of minutes, you'd need a new set.  It doesn't take long to clean a pair of metal cuffs, and they last.|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	you cant adjust zip-ties when you zip them too tight. these days you have to make sure you dont cut off the circulation of the person in handcuffs. plus they aren't reusable so what if you use all of your zip-ties in 1 night? you would have to go back and get more instead of having a better use of your time|`|AA10240450	Simple, because it would cost more to use plastic cable zip-ties everyday. Do you know how many arrests cops do per day? It would be very expensive to use rolls of plastic.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	No, cable ties don't work just as well. And they can't be applied anywhere nearly as quickly.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	Because they work.|`|b74d692feeebce552bcfcdfcb6a76acdaa	you should think about your question before you ask it, we had a guy last year pull out his lighter and burn through the plastic, a second fight ensued to resecure the suspect one officer was knocked out in the second fight, shes not that big and it broke her nose and cracked her jaw, she is a great officer the guy was under the influence and got very little time added to his sentence, i continue to think if we had treated him like every other suspect and cuffed him with metal cuffs this incident wouldnt have happened.|`|gOyLBe1laa	Cause plastic cables you can only use once, Metal handcuffs can last more than your entire career as a cop, and are also 1000x stronger.|`|AnHQbZQAaa	yeah, but if no one's looking, you can easily cut through plastic with anything, even by rubbing your hands against a wall.|`|m3UgmoHTaa	BEcause there stronger. If they need to use them though (e.g if they have to arrest more than 1 person by themselves, they will. In china they sometimes use red electrical tape.|`|d1FyCl6Yaa	Because handcuffs are much stronger then zip-ties. We had a guy cut through the zip-tie with his seat belt last year. We only use them when we are going to be doing a big round up like a bar bust.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	I carry pink ASP cuffs.  They never get mixed up with other people's cuffs and nothing screams "I'm a tough guy" more than when people see those puppies on some big dude.|`|7Mqx9VGWaa	In a shallow grave those plastic cuffs will not degrade for thousands of years.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	I've actually seen a guy break loose from them using the belt loop on his jeans...  well, I didn't actually see him do it, but I saw his hands in front of him and was like "I zipped that guy like 20 mins ago..." (I was using thin zips, it was a big, big arrest, and we ran out of the larger zips) I'd feel better having handcuffs on them because they Double-lock and I'm less likely to be sued.  They're more secure and I've never had someone actually get out of cuffs like I have with the zipties.<br>  They are also easier to apply (I was never given any 'practice and training' with ziptie use), but I have had plenty of handcuff techniques classes, and feel quite comfortable with being able to apply them without even looking.  Zipties you have to slip on, cuffs you can slap on.<br>  Also, it's more intimidating to subjects when you show them cuffs and say "you're going to end up in these in about a minute if you don't back away from the situation" (I work in a town with a lot of drunks that try to constantly get involved with fights that aren't theirs.)<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.  Also -  I bought my own cuffs because I didn't like my department-issued Smith and Wessons... I prefer blued Peerless or ASP.  I got 2 pairs of chain link cuffs (for cooperative prisoners) for 23 bucks each, and 2 pairs of hinged cuffs for like 30 bucks each.  I carry lots of cuffs on my person and in my vehicle (after the zip tie incident) and found that a 100 or so dollar expense for one time was definitely worth the added security and control you get out of handcuffs.
NeBDl4Hfaa	Wouldn't it be hilarious if Obama was the first black president and the first president ever to be impeached a couple of months after his inauguration?  That would just make my day right there|`|qWxYcea1aa	A lot of wishful thinking in this thread. Most political observers think Obama will have an easy reelection in 2012 and will expand the Democratic hold in the Senate by another 2 to 6 seats. This is why the GOP's best presidential prospects, like Charlie Crist and Jon Huntsman Jr., are sitting out and waiting for 2016, leaving 2012 for the losers and wash-ups willing to be a Mondale-like sacrificial lamb.<br>  <br>  The sort of people who attend "the black state of the union" are the same radicals who said America would never elect an African-American. Like their counterparts on the other side of the aisle, they can't stand that most Americans are over race because it's bad for their pocketbooks.|`|0WdCa5gLaa	I don't care if Obama is black, white, green, or purple.  What I do care about is taking care of my family. Food, clothing, shelter. <br>  <br>  That means having and keeping a job. Obama's stimulus plan is only putting a BandAid on a mortal wound by putting only 4.5 billion toward job creation. Three times that amount is spent on foreign aid every year. This is a slap in the face to working Americans who are the backbone of our country.<br>  <br>  It's time to cut the pork once and for all and get America back on its feet. That means focusing on business development and job creation.  This goes for Republicans and Democrats alike.|`|7XJPR10Waa	Even black leaders? Are they all supposed to support him just because of his denomination? Race and economy are 2 entirely different things that doesn't even weigh in on the topic. But I don't feel he'll even be able to absolve the current problems in 2 terms. I feel he's doing a lot of excessive spending right now but overall I have faith he's going to come up with some good long term plans but it's going to take quite a bit of time to play out.

Just pissed them off.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	The Taliban is not a formal or recognized government.  They are a group of terrorists.  Why would you negotiate with terrorists and what exactly is it that would bind them to their word?  Are you just gonna trust them because they say so?  Afghanistan has a government with elected officials.  Iraq, after the fall of a DICTATORSHIP run by Saddam, did not have an elected government in place.  It took getting the dictator loyalist under control to form the government - that is why the Sunni militias in Iraq were even considered. <br>  <br>  The Sunni's would gain the ability to run for office and stabilize the Country with the Shites.  What negotiation leverage can Obama use with the Taliban?

No matter how dangerous these people are, it will never be as dangerous as the government violating individuals rights.  But on the same token, I would have to vote yes to the patriotic act.  I am a realist and have read through it.  The monitoring without a warrant only applied to international phone calls, and personnel I know how unsecured phones are so I try to tell people not to talk about anything that would not want someone else to know.  Just because we have laws against it does not mean people do not try to gain information about you through illegal practices.  I would not have voted for the patriotic as is though, I would of stuck in a provision that required a special panel of judges to work within the CIA/FBI to insure that the organizations where not operating in a unconstitutional manner to protect individual freedoms.  Rather I would create a Judge Advocate General that same way the military has a JAG officer advising the commander before any decision is made.  I think that would instill the checks and balance needed in a intelligence community with the goal of protecting US citizens without becoming ruthless thugs themselves.|`|g34x7iKhaa	Your debate sucked, because if it were a real debate, they would have immediately called your fallacy.  You don't suppose anything in a debate.  You argument was circumstantial--immediately disqualifying it as any type of "argument".  YOU FAIL at debate.<br>  <br>  <br>  I could say, for instance.  "if a metor fell from the sky and killed your family and you lost your job, leaving you homeless, would you be here to defend the patriot act?".<br>  <br>  I mean ANYTHING could happen, but that didn't happen, so its not relavent to the dicussion.<br>  <br>  I'm not defending the patriot act in any case, I just think for 13 year olds to have a debate where the teacher allows you to get away with "what if" situations is a BAD BAD way to teach critical thinking skills.  <br>  <br>  People this is what is wrong with america in a nut shell.

AA11702773	Yeah, but I'm really glad you did because almost no one saw it when I posted it.<br>  <br>  This is worse than what you are saying.  They want to end the war powers act, pretending that would give Congress more say, but in actuallity it will reduce the number of Congressmen who have to approve the war to 1/3 plus 1 rather than 50% plus 1.<br>  <br>  The way the new system would work, the president would 'consult' with SOME members of congress then do whatever he wants.  after that Congress would HAVE to vote to approve or disaprove the war.  However, IF Congress voted to disaprove the war, THE PRESIDENT COULD VETO IT!!!!<br>  <br>  As is, it is unconstitutional already, because the Pres can go for 90 days before Congress authorizes it.  However, authorization at least takes 51%, not one third plus one, which can stop congress from overriding a veto.<br>  <br>  Baker's act would pretend there was no constituitonal power in congress other than the standard one to pass a 'determination' as they would a bill, that the President could veto.<br>  <br>  And from what Ron Paul says in that clip, Baker was saying earlier essentially that 'the courts don't seem to want to [take on the War Powers Act]' implying that he thought they could do whatever they wanted.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	I saw it, that Baker guy was annoying. It only makes sense for congress to declare war since those powers are enumerated to it from article 1 section 8 of our constitution.

The US government, mainly CIA operatives, armed Bin laden, and his band of fighters, of course to remove the Soviets from Afghanistan. We later got those guns pointed at us when we established an airfield in Afghanistan. When we armed the Sunnis in Iraq to fight al-Qaeda, we later found out those weapons were turned onto our soldiers. So, it's basically a useless and dangerous way to distribute weapons for strategic/political gains. It will only get our men killed, and only make problems worse.

GbiFRG5eaa	Your question is ambiguous. The indigenous Brit I believe, is as patriotic as ever. It is their corrupt and traitorous rulers who, in their greedy pursuit of globalisation and multiculturalism have sought to make being "British" or "patriotic" appear filthy or racist.<br>  I respectfully suggest you ask this question of the Labour party who are the present incumbents and the current driving force behind this ideology.<br>  America is the next to fall victim to this, what was once a true patriotic "melting pot", all incomers seeking freedom to be "Americans" is now imploding upon itself with each ethnic group demanding their "rights" to be regarded as a separate identity/culture. <br>  No nation can have it both ways, no individual can have it both ways nor can any culture or race. <br>  That is what politics and politicians have chosen to overlook, we are not a homogenised people, we do have differences, yet will muddle along nicely whilst we operate on a level playing field and are left to our own devices. <br>  It has worked for centuries, but when the powers that be seek to favour one over another, or denigrate the history and culture of the indigenous over the immigrant then that way leads to division and disharmony. <br>  Patriotism has become synonymous with nationalism ( Nazism being the bogeyman) rather than a genuine love of country. <br>  Politicians fear love of country because it places them under scrutiny, except in times of war of course. At such times we are all expected to defend it. What waste, what hypocrisy, and all done for whose benefit, who were/are they?  <br>  Our brave heroes in WW1 & 2 can now see that those who took their lives so cheaply have capitulated to their former enemies who now have control over the country they defended so bravely.<br>  Racist, Xenophobic? <br>  "Tommy" in the field had no concept of politics and it's machinations, he was a patriot and defended his country and it's people. As did many of the other races and cultures seeking peace.<br>  If that makes me a racist then I am proud to be one. <br>  No politician in the world will brainwash me into accepting what they deem to be right as opposed to what they deem to be "wrong". . <br>  Therein lies their problem, not yours not mine. Please wake up to what they are doing.<br>  Unpatriotic? Of course we are, when a country is divided what remains to be patriotic about?  ,   .    <br>     .<br>  .<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   .|`|cwJrCcguaa	The PC brigade make it unpopular with their constant harping about multiculturalism.|`|44AkhdRnaa	The citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.|`|c10af661d4a852c553c251b3fcd0c1fcaa	I doubt it unfortunately|`|bPYS077Raa	i wouldnt say unpatriotic..but there are few as dissollusioned as britain today!<br>  <br>  When the public wake up..they wont be happy...but the population of britain has become so mixed with the flood of immigrants..theres little sense of identity within british people....we dont live in a BRITISH isles anymore...its international!!!..thanks to Labour and the euro state!!|`|if5bmGbPaa	Britain? we don't have a country anymore, our sovereignty has been given to the EU, 75% of our laws come from our new unelected rulers at the EU, so we can be unpatriotic over something we haven't got.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Brits aren't unpatriotic.<br>  <br>  We just don't feel the need to sing country music songs about the colours on our flags.<br>  <br>  Watch BBC Proms and the footage of the Jubilee to see how proud we are to be the true masters of the world.|`|fLMCOSWdaa	It depends what you mean by unpatriotic.

xxDjV6Axaa	I felt like that a lot in college.  Burn out.  You get done with 12 years and all those courses and things to get into college, then it just intensifies.  It seems like there is no break.<br>  <br>  But you have a few things that you need to work on.  You need at least one good friend you can open up to.  Someone who will support you unconditionally.  You have to get those emotions out because if you don't, they will find their own out and usually in destructive behavior.<br>  <br>  You also need to examine your sexuality more closely.  If you are gay, then you need to admit it to yourself so you can start working on accepting who you are.  <br>  <br>  I read one thing that changed my life.  It's in that book, What Color is Your Parachute.  He says to think of what you are really passionate about, what doesn't seem like work to you.  That is what you need to do for a living.  <br>  <br>  Have you taken all the tests to determine which fields of study you have strong interests in?  If not, ask your advisor how you can take them.  That might help you get some direction.<br>  <br>  Then don't put limits on yourself.  I graduated in behavioral science and got a job at Proctor and Gamble making good money but I hated ascertaining why people will buy Tide in an orange box but not a blue one.<br>  <br>  I had seven different careers and went back to school twice.  I finally read that book and started my own business.  It was like an elephant was lifted from my chest.  Finally I found what I really wanted to do.  But it isn't a race, there is no timeline.

Plural? The BNP are a fascist party - there is only one leader.<br>  He's not especially bright and some of his followers are planks. The majority of the followers seem to be of average intelligence but fringe political groups also attract social misfits who are sometimes quite brainy (although never as bright as they think they are).  <br>  <br>  The members and supporters list was published on the Internet last year and is still out there if anyone wants to look for it . As the Daily Mail said at the time:<br>  <br>  "Its following, thank God, is pitifully small. Far from representing the broad sweep of Middle Britain, it is constituted of occasional cranks and crackpots who are as hard to spot as a flake of snow on a Blackpool beach in July  -  a phenomenon not unheard of, but pretty exceptional.<br>  <br>  Please do not think me blase about the party's possible future appeal.<br>  <br>  It won 192,850 votes at the General Election in 2005, compared with 47,129 votes in 2001.<br>  <br>  In last May's local elections, it fared well in some towns such as Stoke-on-Trent and the London Borough of Barking, though it is nowhere near controlling any single council.<br>  <br>  It has a certain appeal to a small minority of white working-class voters, many of whom feel, not unreasonably, that their concerns about large-scale immigration have been ignored by the main parties.<br>  <br>  Only a fool would write off the BNP. It has repackaged itself as a 'community champion' which no longer publicly incites racism or preaches repatriation.<br>  <br>  It pretends to be almost respectable. The other parties would be unwise to ignore it  -  or to turn a blind eye to the sense of grievance which the BNP is so adept at stirring.<br>  <br>  Nor, as I say, should we give succour to the BNP by treating its followers as pariahs who do not deserve to enjoy the same legal rights of the rest of us.<br>  <br>  But the head wagging this bedraggled tail is a very small one, as well as being pretty pea-brained.<br>  <br>  Its hard-core adherents would barely fill the average second division football ground.<br>  <br>  How many of us have personally met a member of the BNP or spoken to someone whom we even suspected of being a member?<br>  <br>  There are mercifully few of these nutcases and, crucially, they do not reflect respectable Britain.<br>  <br>  If you doubt me, look at the sidekicks who accompany the BNP's leader Nick Griffin whenever he makes a foray in public.<br>  <br>  He is not surrounded by pleasant looking doctors and nurses and civil servants, the like of whom may appear in small numbers on the BNP's membership list, but by thuggish looking men, some of them with shaven heads, others with dark glasses, whom you certainly would not invite to tea with the local vicar.<br>  <br>  These heavies represent the true soul of the BNP. They are the poisonous sect behind the re-fashioned, apparently half-respectable organisation  -  potentially dangerous, yes, but a tiny minority which represents only itself, not the tens of millions of ordinary Britons who are neither racist nor extremist, and who abhor the values and policies of the British National Party."|`|twdXT5wOaa	It's a collective of the ignorant and semi-illiterate (take a look at their posts if you doubt it) led by the insane.

VsaEOX9vaa	Well, it;s tough because there is no god! So lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors will never be held accountable. They are all part of a "closed shop" that closes whenever the heat is on.<br>  <br>  All of these legal tyrants know full well that no one will ever judge THEM ( they make you swear to god on the bible knowing that it means nothing) and they will keep their riches and fortunes and their guilt.<br>  <br>  They will never have to pay for their deceit and corruption and their exploitation. When the legal eagles die, their families inherit the riches, but not the guilt!|`|7uznrLBXaa	We are.  <br>  <br>  The legal profession is highly regulated.  Thre are many things that physicians and other types of fiduciaries can do that would get us disbarred.  To even be allowed to sit for the bar you must past (1) an ethics exam and (2) a character & fitness committee.  Things like a bad credit score, lots of debt, and, obviously, a criminal record or academic record of cheating can and do keep applicants from passing the bar.<br>  <br>  Like doctors, lawyers can be sued for malpractice.  <br>  <br>  This idea of "activist" judges was coined by the far right lobby.  There are "activist" judges all over the political spectrum.  Happily, "activist" judges are quite rare.  The mere fact that one judge *interprets* the Constitution one way does not make him an "activist."<br>  <br>  As for those who can't afford a lawyer, there are some options.  On the civil side, the rules of professional ethics lifted the prohibition against contingency fees only for personal injury cases, reasoning that the poor should not be shut out of the legal system.  On the criminal side, there are public defenders.  <br>  <br>  I believe that lay confusion/ignorance about matters of professional ethics, legal philosophy and scholarship, and attorney billing practices at least partially explains why negative views of lawyers persist. <br>  <br>  Additionally, we usually only see a lawyer when something BAD has happened or is likely to happen: we are the victim of a crime or the accused, the injured or the sued, the person about to declare bankruptcy or the creditor worried about recouping his funds, the out-of-work tenant worried about eviction and the landlord worried about missing a mortgage payment and facing foreclosure. Very few people go in for an annual legal check-up. (Though some should.) And regardless of the outcome and at least on the civil side, very few people emerge from litigation having been made whole.

AA10179458	LOL, then after the project is complete they will be laid off. Some steady job.|`|vUiUoamVaa	If they only hired 20 people, that would be the 20 supervisors every stinking Government job seems to require.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You question is a good question, but you did not reference the source of your information which makes it hard to qualify the completeness of what you are stating.  You ask: ‘Is that putting the American people back to work? That's 700,000.00 per man for the job.  At that rate we will need hundreds of trillions to put all back to work.’  The total needed for the stimulus has been discussed repeatedly in the media as totaling hundreds of trillions of dollars, so yes, we do all already seem to agree with what you are stating.  You may just be getting hung up on this small $14 million because you do not understand the magnitude of the large numbers needed in scale of government works.  Keep it in perspective that there are somewhere around 300 million souls our grand USA.<br>  <br>  …..If you are really trying to get clarification on the figure and use of funds among the value stated above for a construction project, then consider the subsequent:<br>  <br>  The following questions also need to be answered, to look closer at your question above:<br>  1-  How long is the project scheduled to last?<br>  2-  What kind of positions are the 20 that have been filled?<br>  <br>  To shed some more light on the general subject of federal construction projects, as related or unrelated to stimulus, here are some things you should consider:<br>  1-  A $14 million construction project is very very small.  If this is not obvious to you consider the average home price in a US metropolitan area just a few years ago was over $1/2 million.  Looking at it like that, you can picture 28 tract homes among 150 others in a new development.  It’s a very small amount of money.<br>  2-  $14 milion divided by 20 people is $700,000.00 per the 20 people.  But, again, what roles do these 20 people have in the job?  Are they administrators, foreman, surveyors, engineers, inspectors, equipment operators, and workers will need to be hired or contracted for all roadwork projects, anywhere and of any size.<br>  3-  And, again, how long is the project schedule to last? Is a 10 year improvement project in one locality?  We don’t know, but if it was then that would be $70,000 per year per person.  That actually does not leave a much to make for a large salary.  Public or private, all employers have administrative and overhead costs associated with employing workers.  So, if it is a ten year project that’s not enough money.  So, we should assume it’s a shorter project.  If it one year consider all the roles that need to be filled even on the smallest construction project.<br>  4-Lastly, consider the materials that are used.  Asphalt, concrete, reinforcing bar, and engineered soils are the main material ingredients in roadwork, and they are not expensive materials, but they are also not free.  Just think about how many truck loads of asphalt are used in every linear foot of highway.  There could be more then 1 truckload per foot.  That can get expensive very fast.<br>  <br>  <br>  As a side note: it is important for all of us a patriots to our nation to stand up and take the time and energy needed, especially today, to consider these important measures in front of us.  We need to look beyond the surface of the incomplete and often nonsensical information presented to us, and qualify the facts with their affect on our future in mind.  <br>  Your question, as stated above, barely begins to do that, and we need to look much deeper, and not waste time and energy on such trite restatements of obvious things as I have here.|`|AA12212403	Wow, I'll be able to recoup my retirement plan 20K worth of losses because of this, thanks for keeping me informed.

I'm sure that will help me out as well.  <br>  In the meantime, 700,000 newly unemployed just this week alone.<br>  Such a smart president and congress we've got, yup.  Oh yeah, we can't blame congress, I guess, as those who voted in favor of it didn't actually ready it.

All you do is ask questions and make your comments about it, which always seem negative.<br>  <br>  I believe the first people to be hired were the 20 you're talking about. 20 people working is better than 20 people not working. <br>  <br>  It takes alot of money to build a highway and I guarantee you those first 20 are just the beginning. Plus it will give business to companies that provide materials to build the highway. Wherever the highway is going will bring business to places along the highway, will encourage  people to open more businesses, who will need employees to run those businesses. Do you think anything through?<br>  <br>  This is exactly what Obama had planned. The Domino affect. It's going to be like that with alot of the projects he's funding. Do one thing, which leads to other things and so on. It's brilliant and a good start to get the economy going again. Stop berading Obama 10 times a day. <br>  <br>  What did Bush do for anyone, our country and its people other than the wealthy?

In addition the try to implement law about limitation of car and track carbon dioxide and diesel use. How are you going to deliver goods to the state? The airport and sea ports charges are so big that they all avoid to lend in this state and go to Oregon or Washington and use wheelers to deliver stuff here. They even want to tax cows and horses every furt.

It doesn't matter if he is 17.9 years old and you are 18.1 years old it is illegal because you are not both adults. It is a serious offense. You could have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your life. Just wait until he 18 or over to have sex with him. It is not illegal to hang out but it is to have sex. 5 to 10 years in most states is the time you will or could get.|`|eulMjLtPaa	There is no law called statutory rape in California; it is called unlawful sexual intercourse.  <br>  <br>  Here's the full description:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexlaws.org/california_statutory_rape_laws" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexlaws.org/california_statut...</a><br>  <br>  It says, in part:<br>  <br>  Any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison.<br>  <br>  Plus:<br>  <br>  An adult who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor at least three years younger than the adult is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).|`|AA10163820	Just so it's clear, the three-year difference in age only matters as to the punishment for the crime.  As noted, sexual intercourse is technically illegal even if the age difference is only a week (and one person is 17 and the other 18).<br>  <br>  As for your question, it would be much more helpful if you can bring yourself to actually tell us what you're talking about.  There's nothing illegal about "spending time" and I wouldn't worry about "something happening" until I knew what all that meant.<br>  <br>  If you are referring to sexual activity, the crimes and punishments vary depending on the sexual act.  If you can't bring yourself to tell us what you foresee doing with this child, then maybe you're not quite ready for this relationship anyway.  <br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean by "quite a bit older" but at least in my mind, if you are "quite a bit older" I think you might also want to consider what it is about a 17 year old child that you find so attractive.  <br>  <br>  There are also civil penalties associated with the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse.  You may want to go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html</a><br>  <br>  And search for section 261.5 of the Penal Code (try searching for 261, though, and then scroll down...the decimals seem to throw the search engine off).  Might also want to read through section 288a real quick while you're at it.<br>  <br>  If this kid is all that special, wait until he's 18 and then you guys can hump your brains out.  17 is just a little too risky (even without knowing your age) and if his mommy finds out and makes a big stink about it, you might find yourself really regretting it.<br>  <br>  Not looking for Best Answer, just telling you what the state of things are.

If grandma takes vicodin for pain, for instance, we would have to deny her benefits because vicodin is a drug....since most elderly people, disabled people, and seriously injured Veterans take drugs, you can see the obvious dilemma.

Notice that nothing really ever changes socially?  It just changes economically.  Republicans and Democrats are the same when they are in power.  They spend, spend, spend and they get a cut out of every contract that they give away.  Why does everyone think that politics is like WWF wrestling?  Many people need to open their eyes and see that it's more of the same.  No matter who is in charge, it's a double-edged sword.  Many thought that we were flourishing off of Clinton, the democrat, when we were actually just thriving off of credit...money that doesn't even exist.  So he really did create a bubble economy and we didn't even realize it until 2005ish.  Obviously, Bush didn't help.<br>  <br>  Realistically, none of these people care about anything but having power and money.  That's it!

They just want to keep it going as a wedge issue to get the vote out.  As much as I hate abortion, I know that it has become legal due to our inability to successfully legislate morality.

During his watch the stock market was at a all time high and doing great.  Business were booming  and the business that had gone over seas had started to come back.  No one threaten our country since 9/11 so Bush kept us safe.  Unemployment was at a low of 1 to 2%.   It was only the last few months that we found out that the banks were in trouble because the democrats made the banks loan money to low income people to buy houses.  The Freddie Mai and Freddie mac bonds were for the low income people to buy houses.  People invested in these bonds because they were Federal Insured and was suppose to be safe.  The auto industry just got greedy.  No one can blame Bush but the Democrats for the shape we are in,   If people would do their home work and just read about why the banks got in trouble they wouldn't be blaming Bush either.|`|AuWHIJPKaa	Was Bush a US Congressman or Senator?

Obama would have gone down in flames too, but of course the liberal media would have glorified his failure. People seem to forget that Congress is dominated by liberals and they're the real reason why "Bush screwed up America."<br>  <br>  Fortunately for us conservatives, since a majority of the people in the House and Senate are liberals, they will have no one else to blame but themselves when (not if) they screw up.|`|mEZpqzkMaa	It's a not so clever spin tactic to go after GWB. They figure they can cover up their mistakes by finger pointing and claiming an inherited problem. Well they didn't inherit the nearly 1 trillion dollar spending spree that Pres. Obama has ok'd. They didn't inherit an initiative to grow the government to monumental proportions, and hand out money like candy. They figure they will spend like drunken sailors, as long as they can to expand the government and social agenda then blame the disaster on GWB.|`|g34x7iKhaa	you want the truth?

AA11702773	Nothing.  A lot of people don't realize it, but they are falling into a false polarization by people who are trying to get an unconstitutional 'line item veto' for the president which would eviscerate our separation of powers.  Under our Constitution, Congress has the power of the purse. CONGRESS is directly and representatively elected, not the President.  Congress is supposed to say where money goes.  If they pass a trillion dollar bill without 'earmarking' where the money goes, it is a giant blank check to the executive office and expenditures will be decided by unelected functionaries behind closed doors.<br>  <br>  The question is whether spending is 'wasteful', not whether it is an earmark.<br>  <br>  However the stimulus bill and budget are massively, unprecedentedly wasteful at a time when we should be cutting spending.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	Yes, because under normal circumstances not only will the job not get done, the job DOESN'T NEED DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9HRkwzruaa	Earmarks in and of themselves aren't always a bad thing...but they need to be used in the right places and at the right time.  Sorry, but I really don't think that things like saving the habitat of a rodent (which can live anywhere) and investigating the reason behind the stink of pig poo are terribly stimulating to the economy - which was what this monster of a bill was supposed to do.<br>  <br>  You want to put earmarks in a stimulus bill?  Great!  Just make sure they actually fit the purpose of the bill.  Things like paying people to renovate broken down neighborhoods, pumping money into things like libraries and police/fire forces to open up employment opportunities, paying our soldiers something above minimum wage so their families don't have to go on welfare in order to survive...These would all be things that would put money back into people's hands so it can be spent.<br>  <br>  Pet projects have no place during an economic crisis.  The marsh mice have been just fine up till now, pig poo is going to stink no matter how much money we throw at it, and the Dept of Homeland Security doesn't need to be redecorated.  All we're asking for is a little common sense to be used in order to dig this country out of the pit of recession.  Instead of bringing home the bacon we get saddled with a ton of pork.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I'll agree with you that earmarks are one means of funding for projects outside of Washington/ Federal. SOMETIMES the projects have value, others don't. <br>  What I'd like to see is to stop the way they are tacked on, to unrelated bills and passed without much investigation. It gets to where they are used as barter  ("you vote for my earmark and I'll vote for yours"). <br>  If they would not stand on their own merits, they should not be anywhere.|`|AA11963685	You are right about this.  Not all earmarks are bad.  Just like not all lobbyists are devils in human skin.  Nobody even thinks about the members of Congress wasting time trying to get smaller measures through when there are bigger fish to fry.  Some people just need something to complain about for the sake of it.|`|4zijn0cgaa	too much government spending at a time where spending should be cut. It is easy to spend someone else`s money.|`|V44ARW4maa	I agree with you, and earmarks provide jobs and a job is a good thing, yes?

5gXzI5xtaa	One word can sum up the entire Republican party: Hypocritical.<br>  <br>  Well, the money was supposed to go to all those banks that are asking for more now. So that's a good question. Why are the banks asking for more? The money was NEVER regulated to who it went to and where. I would say the money was spent on filling CEO's pockets and rewarding their employees with $20,000 tropical vacations. And now they want more? Let them go bankrupt, and let another company step up to the plate to fix it.

3bbtzjBuaa	If bush was a great president and didn't make things worse, then why, after 8 years did he not right a wrongly-headed ship, no matter who's fault it is?  If every president committed himself to no action and then blamed the guy before him, our country would have collapsed long ago.<br>  <br>  The surplus was at the end of the dot.com bubble, and we should have been looking for other ways to sustain the economy rather than hoping that any one wave would be endless.  Bush refused to help the economy to look for other ways, and aided in the irresponsibility of businesses that lead us to this problem (with respect to home-owners, businesses took advantage of people who were searching for - and have been assured since this country's founding - the American Dream).  Clinton cut back on defense spending because we weren't in a war, and the attack on the US that caused us to go to war in Iraq (9/11 of course) was not a result of this cut in spending.  And the attacks he mentioned did not send us to wars we couldn't afford.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, if this is all Clinton's fault, it wouldn't have taken us 8 years to realize where we were headed - with or without a competent government.  And when was the last time "nuh uh, it wasn't me" sufficed as an argument in the United States other than as response to "who stole the cookie from the cookie jar"?|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Clinton had a surplus, that is, the national debt was finally shrinking.  Then Bush came along and doubled the debt.  And he's completely wrong about the sustained budget surplus.  Reagan and Newt NEVER had a sustained budget surplus.  He's lying.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, our defense budget is now greater than the entire rest of the planets combined, including allies.  So this guys saying that he's so scared of a bunch of low tech sand rats that he can only feel safe behind a shield bigger than the rest of the planet's combined.  The mans a coward.<br>  <br>  The fact that we are spending so much on defense and are still not safe is proof enough that the military is an inefficient tool for combatting terrorism.  How much are we spending per terrorist caught/killed?  The level is unsustainable by any measure.  Clinton reduced spending in a post cold war era.  We've moved on since then.  But to claim that he did it entirely to make his administrations numbers look good is completely disengenuous.  It assumes he knew the future.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Just admit he is correct and you have never been more wrong.|`|HZYBXwr1aa	<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A0F9qTwBOq4/R_Ke4k2M1GI/AAAAAAAAAWo/OVaIdx1ufNg/s400/BushClown.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A0F9qTwBOq4/R_...</a>|`|NtIOVAxkaa	Look    IOUSA.COM<br>  <br>  <br>  And you will see that the 8 years of bush ( was a BIG MISTAKE ).|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	The dot com bubble occurred in 1998, the budget surplus was in 2000. bush created the first recession with his corporate welfare program that squandered that surplus. It was the Republican controlled congress that chose the military bases to close. And bush's military spending bills didn't go into effect until after the U.S. had overran Afghanistan, it was Clinton's military that conquered that nation. The USS Cole bombing occured in October of 2000, was confirmed to be a strike by al Qaeda in December of that year and bush took over the Presidency a month later, what did he do again? Oh yeah, sent 43 million U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Taliban, say, how many of the hijackers bought first class tickets with that money? Then remind him 9/11 occured on bush's watch a month after he received an action brief warning of a terrorist strike. Then remind him that Bush doubled the national debt and remind him that we had a budget surplus from 1999 through Jan. 2001, sustained. And then point out how Clinton twice vetoed Gingrich's budget until the Republican congress backed down and did what Clinton wanted, and add how Gingrich had to leave congress in disgrace because of a kick back scandal.|`|RuUUPWYUaa	Simply point out the cost of the Iraq War per month being over 12 Billion US Dollars; funding hijacked to private contractors with no source of transparency; Bush's lack of regulating the banking and investment firms on Wall Street; the enabling Republicans who with blind faith enabled Bush to ruin the surplus from the previous Clinton Administration; etc. These are fact checked evidence that can easily be "Googled".|`|BQOGpma2aa	He knows what he is talking about when it comes to politics, you have absolutely no idea.

Ask him what his party has come to when they pick an entertainer to lead the GOP. Remember, the elected leader of the GOP was voted for less than two weeks ago and he is so insecure that he felt he had to make a public apology to Rush Limbaugh for some of the things he said about him.<br>  <br>  As long as Rush is alive, the GOP will have to live with their new leader. (lol)  Don't you feel sorry for them. Tell him that the Republican Party lost their Identity at the November 2006 election. Tell him that the GOP needs a new brand name. Why is he blaming Clinton for the screw-ups that the GOP made for eight years. The Republican Congress gave Bush all of the money he asked for, for his war in Iraq. In fact, Bush had to borrow money to fight his war from 9 different countries. That made the US a debtor nation for the first time in American history. The GOP supporters will never stop putting the blame onto others for their mistakes. Remember, it's very easy to accuse but when asked to prove what they say, they stop dead in their tracks.|`|QnK3ESBdaa	Well, part of his problem is it was Regan who started deregulation long before Clinton, and under GW Bush, we now have one of the lowest total number of military personnel in active duty. The dot com bubble didn't affect the whole world like this melt down has. Dot com really only affected those withing a narrow industry. The problem that we face now is a result of the Regan years of eliminating regulation, and cutting back on the controlling agencies that watched the stock markets and other investment bankers. Sorry for him, the congress was Democratic controlled under Clinton when we had a budget surplus.<br>    Also, Newt was corrupt himself, I wouldn't rely on someone like that as an example of how to run congress.|`|YJWQZFjTaa	1.

Clinton was the fortunate inheritor of a historical anomaly not likely to be repeated any time soon.  Several factors, demographic, political, technological, and economic came together to make the 1990s such a placid and successful time.<br>  <br>  Here are your comeback.  The debt under Clinton rose about 1.6 trillion dollars.  Under Bush it was about 5 trillion.  Spending went all out of control under Bush.  <br>  <br>  The Iraq war was not justified.  We were in no imminent danger from Saddam's regime.  Sure he was an odious thug, but so are a lot of other world leaders, many of whom got help from the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  Bush senselessly antagonized the Russians.  We fomented revolutions and political trouble all over the former Soviet Union.  We are putting interceptor missiles in Poland, to defend them against the Iranians, historically the people least likely to attack Poland.<br>  <br>  After 9/11 we had to maul the Taliban.  But that is where our focus should have been.  Instead we got lost in rearranging the politics of southeast Asia.  Of course most good liberals would have freaked if Bush had stated what should have been US policy goal post 9/11, which is that your government is going to murder enough people to convince the survivors never to bother us again.  <br>  <br>  As for making someone look bad, what kind of goal is that?  I'm no fan of the conservatives, but I can tell you the ignorance of economics demonstrated by liberals is truly frightening.  We are about to watch a foolish administration and an even more foolish congress turn a recession into a depression.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	hard to come up with a retort when someone throws facts at you in an argument!   darn him for doing that!!!!!|`|hcc8fq7jaa	What's really sad is that you're more concerned about making him look bad, than on determining the truth.

That's almost impossible to come back from.|`|2iAAczdyaa	You just made his point you nitwit!|`|R7Hexutqaa	Well first of all Newt's Congress ran huge deficits.  The Only Budget surpluses of the last 50 years were during the 2nd Clinton Admin.<br>  <br>  As for military bases closing - The Military has been trying to close outmoded, outdated, and unneeded bases for decades.  Congress keeps them open because it means jobs back home.  <br>  <br>  The defense budgets never decreased.  They increased more slowly under Clinton because all of our military spending of the previous 40 years was for the 'Cold War' - which by the early 90's was over.  One does not keep funding a war that no longer exists.  The Soviet union was gone and China was going capitalist (sort of)<br>  <br>  As for the debt - True, we have carried a debt for the entire history  of the nation and it always increases (but negligibly during surplus years) <br>  But when GW Bush Took Office the Debt was 5 trillion.  When he left it was 10 trillion.  Of the 10 trillion debt when Bush left office 7.5 trillion was accumulated in just 3 administrations - Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2.  Obama is going to be an even bigger debt producer.  Before his first term is up it will be another 5 trillion.  But Bush chose to take on the debt with simultaneous tax cuts and war spending - Both the choice of his party).  Obama is taking on the added debt because it is necessary to save the financial system and the economy - so say most economists.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	So he is basically saying that it's because of Clinton that the terrorists were able to attack us, which is not true, and also he has failed to mention that they were from Saudi Arabia by and large, and the "surplus that went to the war" actually went to a war in *IRAQ* which was wholly unnecessary and which I, for one, opposed from the very beginning. Bush by no means was forced to attack a country which did not attack us, or to start a war that plunged this country into atrocious debt and resulted in the deaths of thousands of our soldiers. He chose to do it because he wanted to carry out a vendetta against Saddam Hussein that originated with his father. And also for the possibility he'd wind up controlling Iraqi oil. And Clinton had NOTHING to do with that whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Sorry, this particular section of Yahoo Answers is usually overrun with flamingly ignorant conservatives.|`|dWH45KTlaa	Sorry sweetie, your friend has gotten his facts right.<br>  Do the research.   Clinton was more worried about his legacy than worried about terrorists attacking the US.<br>  Had he been concerned about the US he would have done something about OSAMA when OSAMA was offered to him & then  9/11 would never have happened.<br>  Clinton was another self centerened @ss covering jask@ss|`|lyhnHhuWaa	You can't.  He's right.  He could have brought up even more things Clinton did that have led us where we are today, like the Community Reinvestment Act that forced banks to become creative with financing to give loans to people who wouldn't ordinarily qualify.  They did it to avoid being sued for discriminatory lending practices, and several were sued during that time.  This was a huge factor in the economy boost that occurred on his watch.  The only problem was that the inflated housing market, as well as the huge budget surplus were pretty much all on paper.  Bush did have 9/11, a couple of wars and a mighty huge hurricane on his watch.  There was no way to avoid much of the spending that happened while he was in office.  Sure, Iraq was a mistake, as was expanding Medicare in the midst of it all.  He's got his own fault in it all.  But... it doesn't excuse Clinton.

I think from a political point of view, if its gets lifted it will be done in stages, perhaps first ending the ban US visitors spending dollars there. <br>  <br>  Perhaps the funniest part about the whole embargo is that if Eisenhower & then Kennedy hadn't tried to oust Castro or have him taken out, then Cuba would have been a useful ally and trading partner....but no, the US government just couldn't resist poking its nose in as usual and buggering things up as always.

Before jumping to conclusions about the first, maybe give some consideration to the second point... and also why oversight is a big deal now, but not for the previous administration or even Clinton's administration where the Commerce Secretary had previously been the head of the DNC.<br>  <br>  Congressional Quarterly updated the story, noting, "The White House took a small step back from what the senior official told CQ, releasing a statement late Thursday that couched the relationship between the Census Bureau director and the West Wing as one in which the director would work with the high-level officials rather than report directly to them."<br>  <br>  "According to several reports, Gregg, as chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Commerce Department, opposed a 1999 request by President Bill Clinton for emergency funds for the 2000 census.

Whenever I got on a bus or into a taxi or rode on an airplane or sat at a restaurant or any number of other places, there would always be a risk of people smoking, and often they were, even in theaters and hospitals, where it was already  illegal in the 1970s. <br>  <br>  My body's response has grown worse over the years, as is common in asthma victims. I can't even spend the night in a hotel room where anyone has *EVER* smoked. I found out at the front desk when I arrived there with my eyes red and bulging, my nostrils swollen shut, my chest heaving and my body quivering from repeated use of my inhaler that it had been over a year since the room I was assigned had had a smoking guest, and they couldn't figure out why febreeze and an ozone machine didn't cure the problem . . . Duh . . . <br>  <br>  I can avoid taxicabs and smoking rooms in hotels, but some people don't respect the legitimate boundaries which have been set up.<br>  <br>  The problem that still does present a real threat to my life and health is when I am outside of or near the entrance to any of these buildings or vehicles.  I don't get a filter or a smoke-free zone, and my lungs swell right up with every breath of smoke. Without my inhalers I would have been dead a long time ago .<br>  <br>  In any sheltered bus stop, during cold or inclement weather, folks like me must stand outside and well-clear of the shelter, because there are some smokers who just don't care about the law or the health of others, and they feel they have the inalienable right to smoke wherever they happen to be. Whoever doesn't like it is supposed to go somewhere else and 'quit whining.' <br>  <br>  First, I'm not whining, it's called wheezing and gasping for breath. It's not a joke or a power play. It's the sound my lungs make when they swell so tightly that I can't force air into them. Second, what happens when I run out of somewheres-else to go?!?!<br>  <br>  Smokers commonly stand close enough to the entryways of common-use buildings that the smoke billows in, and in the last five years I have yet to ever cross a parking lot with people in it where I did not have to use my rescue inhaler because of someone's smoke.<br>  <br>  Even when I am out bicycling, every time a car rolls by with people smoking in it, I get to breathe their smoke as they pass by. On the bike trails, when people are walking along, having a leisurely cigarette, and I am inhaling deeply to keep my pace, they don't realize they are forcing me to stop and take rescue measures to keep myself from lapsing into a potentially-fatal asthma attack.<br>  <br>  Even out in the wilderness, on hiking trails and in campgrounds, whenever a group of people is encountered, odds are that at least one of them is smoking.<br>  <br>  Most smokers just don't think about that. Either they feel they are enjoying something that is well-within their rights or all they want is their nicotine. They think it is all about lung cancer, and even that is irrelevant to them. They think any bans are an imposition upon their right to free expression and pursuit of happiness. They often say "You gotta die o' somethin' . . . "<br>  <br>  Well, thank you, I'd rather it be old age, for me and for them. I have a family depending upon my staying alive and well. I don't think smokers have a right to deprive me of that, especially  for a mere moment of pleasure that will most likely cut their own lives short.<br>  <br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  Yupyu... --<br>  <br>  You are who I am talking about.<br>  You don't get it.<br>  Your smoke is a real and deadly threat to people like me.<br>  Would you rather just shoot me? It'd be quicker and more humane. You do NOT have the right to deprive me of air to breathe.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  NoBAAAma --<br>  <br>  No, smoking bans and restrictions are *NOT* stupid. They are the reason I can still survive a day at work or a trip to the restaurant and the grocery store. I am all for building nice hospitals, but I don't like to spend a lot of time in them. Smokers would have me there for the rest of my life if you had your way.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  Q --<br>  <br>  No, others' smoking limits MY freedom. Without proper bans,  it would be impossible for me to live my life and earn a living to support my family -- or perhaps you'd like to foot the bill for us all? <br>  <br>  That would be the price of your ideas.<br>  <br>  Ideas do have consequences.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  "Bob - tl;dr, also you do not have the right to deprive people of smoking if they wish to do so. No one is depriving you of air. You have the right to not go around smokers. You do not have the right to always have your way. You do not have the right to not be offended. You do not have a right to control the content of the air around you. Quit playing a victim to limit the freedom of others."<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Are you a MEDICAL doctor? <br>  <br>  I  seriously doubt it.  <br>  <br>  If you are what you are holding yourself out to be, then give me your state and  license number and the contact number for your state's medical licensing commissioner so I can properly aggrieve what I am fairly confident is medical misrepresentation and fraud -- and so I can challenge your credentials with your medical school  (if you were actually a practicing physician -- which I doubt -- you would have no choice but to comply with that request).<br>  <br>  If you were a physician, you would know better than what you just said. Any respiratory or pulmonary  therapist, cardiologist, ERT or EMT would soon have your creds hanging on THEIR wall after hearing you say that. <br>  <br>  If you were MY physician, and if you actually CARED about facts, which you clearly don't, you would see my medical charts and all the health care I have had to endure because of other people's "Freedom" . . . <br>  <br>  Guess what, I'm not playing. I have asthma and a severe allergy to tobacco smoke and the additives in it. That is a real, examined, researched, documented, diagnosed medical condition, and the treatment is most definitely not placebo, but you obviously wouldn't have the slightest clue or care about that. I have reams of medical documents to prove it, and my insurers have receipts for the tens of thousands of dollars in bills they have had to pay as a result of it, but why disturb you with facts you don't care about and probably wouldn't know how to read or analyze anyway?<br>  <br>  No, it is not about being offended.  I use 4 different kinds of inhalers and have a nebulizer machine at home so I don't have to keep going to the ER all the time,  and all that is supposed to be emergency treatment but is common for me thanks to smokers, but I guess that is all just a pretentious attempt to lord my own will and ways over everyone around me . . . <br>  <br>  I just want to breathe. Is that so much to ask? <br>  <br>  Haven't you ever been swimming and come up for air after holding your breath for a long time? Multiply that a few hundred times and that is what asthma attacks are like. It's like trying to breathe through a coffee stirrer from underwater.<br>  <br>  You should try that some time, but you won't, because it's all about Y O U. Nobody else and nothing else matters.<br>  <br>  600 toxic compounds are added to cigarettes during their manufacture, and the principle drug, nicotine, is the primary ingredient in Mustard gas and is used industrially as an insecticide. In my lungs, throat, eyes, ears, sinuses  and nostrils, it all adds up to poison.<br>  <br>  You do not have the right to endanger my life by smoking near me and poisoning my air any more than you have the right to poison my food, run me over with a car, shoot me, stab me or prescribe the wrong medication -- oops, forgot, you are probably not a medical doctor anyway.<br>  <br>  This isn't about power plays or politics or having it my way. Cigarette smoke, even in small quantities, is a very real and deadly threat to me. As I said, I live on frequent use of my inhaler, which is very bad for my health. But you don't care. I should just shut up and go die so so that I don't inconvenience you any further. That IS what would happen without smoking bans.<br>  <br>  Really, where do you get off?<br>  <br>  And just WHERE am I supposed to go to "Not be around smokers" . . . ? <br>  <br>  Isn't it unreasonable in your terms to set aside places where a person can't smoke?<br>  <br>  How about a gas station? Nope. They even smoke there.<br>  <br>  You'd think people would have some common sense and decency. I guess that died with Reagan.<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  Ed J -- <br>  <br>  What ARE you talking about?|`|Vu7kCPesaa	No. It simply limits freedom.<br>  <br>  Bob - tl;dr, also you do not have the right to deprive people of smoking if they wish to do so. No one is depriving you of air. You have the right to not go around smokers. You do not have the right to always have your way. You do not have the right to not be offended. You do not have a right to control the content of the air around you. Quit playing a victim to limit the freedom of others.<br>  <br>  Hey Bob, I guess you should do the smart thing and stay away from smokers then huh? That still doesn't give you the right to tell people how they can live their lives just because you can't handle a little smoke. By the way, I never said anything medical, so you have nothing to "challenge" me on. Obviously smoking is bad for you, and I don't smoke, but if I wanted to slowly kill myself by smoking, that is MY RIGHT.  There will be extreme cases in any subject. But very rare extreme cases like yours do not warrant limiting the entire population to your standards.<br>  <br>  No matter how much you cry about it, your disability does not give you the right to dictate the lives of others.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	No there are people that smoke a pack and a half a day and live longer than many of their children, More lives are lost because of poor nutrition and poor, or lack of medical intervention, or because they were unable to afford the medications they should be taking on a regular basis.  The number of people that can not afford to eat balanced meals is much higher than many are aware of, those that can not afford their meds for elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, just to mention a few of the most common medical conditions would scare the living daylights out of any caring person. Obesity and stress are killing more people daily than tobacco is.  Tobacco is a nasty dirty addiction which is more difficult to break than alcohol, or drug dependency, so to isolate smoking is doing a disservice to all.|`|1487d1674981b6aea0adec310c43a272aa	I don't think smoking bans save lives.  I seen a thing the other day saying scientist don't know why one third of people who get lung cancer don't smoke or live around people who smoke.  They stated that they think it comes from all the other air pollution.  I think smoking increases your chances of lung cancer if your prone to family history of it.  From what i know about cancer it is where your own cells turn on themselves and mass produce improper cells.  To me that is in the genes and not outside pollutants.  Can outside pollutants cause the turn yes.  i sure it can act like a catalyst in the reaction.  but i feel that both have to be present for the cancer to develop but also there has to be other catalyst because people get cancer and don't do anything wrong to cause the cancer|`|Swmd0P2uaa	What kind of smoking bans? Banning smoking in restaurants and bars certainly does not. You are asked weather you would like to sit in the smoking or non smoking section. Furthermore, restaurants are required to have ventilation systems to prevents smoke from lingering or traveling to other areas of the facility. Working in a restaurant, I noticed when he ban on smoking was put in place there was definitely a drop in customers at the bar, and it did not bring more non smokers out. (We lost a lot of business for a short while) second hand smoke is dangerous and for that reason it is a plausible argument to put restriction on public smoking. However, I do believe banning smoking within so many feet of a building is adequate, and any further ban would infringe on smokers rights. Also, taxes are being raised (If you haven't heard the news today smoking taxes went up 200% with a new bill making its way through congress this morning). Smokers are essentially funding THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE through the high tax rates they pay on tobacco products. (It would be interesting to find out how many times over a life long smoker will pay for their treatment with such steep taxes.) I guess these higher taxes bring income in for our govt, as will the fines on establishments not observing smoking bans. Which I guess could be a good thing.... Another argument for bans is that it will encourage smokers to smoke less at home, because if they cannot smoke at work they will get used to the lower levels of nicotine and eventually crave it less, even when away from work. I think that's really stupid, I have never met anyone who smoked less overall, just because they couldn't smoke at work. <br>  My opinion, is that smoking bans are beneficial in some cases- especially when children are involved. Second hand smoke leads to ear infections and respiratory problems for young people. Smokers can also be annoying when lingering around entrance ways, or positioning themselves in such a way that they would be unavoidable to a passer- by. However, it is their right to smoke and legislation often over steps their ground. I dint think MOST bans prevents second hand smoking complications, and most certainly does not save lives. I think the over taxation is unfortunate but a GREAT way to deter smoking.|`|eYpE4bp2aa	Yes. Second-hand smoke can be just as harmful to our lungs, and kids are especially in danger of this. A ban on smoking means less smoke at our restaurants, parks, etc.|`|4263a18069edde729fc3dc47e66f1e80aa	Smokers will smoke. Banned or not.

3tV94oGMaa	Limbaugh is merely a talk show host. What makes his opinion any more important than any other celebrity? If you let someone like him control your thoughts or your actions, then you are a bigger fool than he is..........|`|kiyVz23Jaa	He would probably be considered extreme right, which in my opinion means that he is a true conservative, and he is as conservative as it gets. Which is a-ok with me!<br>  <br>  Many people seem to hate Rush, but I like him. He says it like it is, and I think that is why people don't like him. He has 20 million listeners everyday of his talk radio show. I think that Obama and many liberals are actually very scared of Rush because he has called so many people out, and with so many listeners he has and can make many movements and put out good suggestions. I mean the far left liberals have people like Rush too but no one seems to give them as hard of a time. I like Rush! Now watch how many thumbs down I will get because I just simply stated my opinion.<br>  <br>  I also think that many people just believe what they hear from others about Rush, so therefore they don't like him without even listening to him. People need to start having a mind of there own. Now if people have listened to him and still don't like him, then that's fine, but I hate it when people just go off of what someone else's opinion was and not even look into it themselves.|`|hXwqKidraa	di?ver?sion?<br>  –noun 1. the act of diverting or turning aside, as from a course or purpose: a diversion of industry into the war effort.  <br>  2. a channel made to divert the flow of water from one course to another or to direct the flow of water draining from a piece of ground. <br>  3.

f7bc20a0e0f7672dd80798d522d8fbc2aa	Alright, for starters, a citizen does not "file" or "press" charges.  If someone punches me, that doesn't mean I actually head down to the courthouse to file anything.  <br>  <br>  I call the police.  The police take a report.  The report gets forwarded to the District Attorney.  The district attorney, after reading the report, determines what charges, if any, should be filed.  Then the DA files them.<br>  <br>  The situation you describe might be a felony because stitches were required.  That means great bodily injury, i.e., more than a bruise and medical attention required.  Because of that, the statute of limitations is likely several years, I don't know specifically for New York.<br>  <br>  More important than the statute of limitations however are the actions of the victim herself.  We're talking a nearly year old crime here.  No police were called, according to you, and no report was made.  It is unlikely the police would give the reporting party much credit.  It is even less likely that the district attorney would file anything.  <br>  <br>  So, technically speaking, charges "could" be filed by the DA.  But realistically, no, there is no way in hell in a crowded town like NY would a DA ever file a loser case like this.|`|AA11765933	i know they have that statue of limitations and last Summer is not that long ago so it would not be a case of the limitations being too long for the case to be thrown out.

NwBfuUNaaa	Michael Steele the figure head and once so called leader of The Republican party has now been declared the Rush Limbaugh subordinate. He indeed had to apologize to Rush for saying Rush was just and entertainer , and not the real party leader. This is why Micheal Steele is being called Uncle Tom by his own followers, sad but true. <br>  I haven't been able to confirm the stories going around,  he gets up at 5:00am and to shine Rush's shoes and buy his drugs and have them both ready by breakfast time?|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	Let the Republicans figure themselves out.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Every time Obama announces his nonsense, the market tanks. Economic research shows his spending plan causes long-term economic damage. He’s breaking his promise to "end earmarks,” Now, with polls showing more and more Americans oppose his agenda, Barack Obama needs a distraction. He gets it by having his operatives pick a fight with Rush Limbaugh. <br>  <br>  Instead of solving our economic problems by reducing spending during a recession and granting tax relief to job creators, Obama has instead chosen to kick mud at Rush Limbaugh. That’s not change or hope. It’s a tired old political trick pulled out because he is making problems worse. The White House is busying whining about an entertainer and politicians are busy inserting their wasteful earmarks into the budget.<br>  <br>  Chicago didn’t get corrupt by having good ideas, rather it got that way by shutting up the opposition. I wish them lots of luck shutting down Rush. Rush stands for a set of core beliefs while Chicago thugs have none. This is another popcorn moment. Get ready for the entertainment! o_O|`|3tV94oGMaa	I'm not sure, but I think he has a plan to tax-and-spend us into oblivian, but it's not so secret...........
RjhzHcSuaa	Anyone can donate money to someone's campaign, like most of Obama's came from israel so even if you dont live in america you can contribute, the person's campaign group will receive the contributions

I would say that it would say that his job could only be described as a "wash" but it's early.  I have little faith.<br>  <br>  It seems to me as if anyone could do a better job.  The problem is finding someone who gives a crap.  Obama, like Bush, had to give way too much money to big business and others who financed his campaign.  People usually don't donate hundreds of millions of dollars to a campaign if they aren't going to benefit greatly from it.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul would probably do it but people would complain anyways.  His vision would work in a perfect world but there is too much corruption and way too many lazy people.

It is quite easy to create a chart and then fill in the blanks....this is a low point, people though Obama was going to win. This is a high point, people though McCain was going to win, but that not only is easily manipulated, it fails to consider other important factors. For example, if the electorate turned toward Obama when AIG failed and the stock market went down. Your chart would assign that, incorrectly to the fact that people favored Obama.|`|WXLwYANPaa	Your Dad is right.

Wall Streeters had partied for years, and when the truth started coming out, they headed for the hills. <br>      If you understood the true basics of how the stock market works, you'd understand that this meltdown didn't happen just when Obama was elected, (or even during the election campaign.) <br>     <br>   The higher you climb, the farther you have to fall.|`|FVDhYH6Baa	No<br>  and one of the key things <br>  is the fact that investors base almost everything on prediction<br>  they make a prediction and then act according to that prediction-- might as well call it an assumption---there's a term for it its called market overreaction.<br>  the investors do not always predict correctly--they don't know for sure how the market might react- or what consumers might do<br>  here's a link on it:<br>  <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=179670" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?a...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://overreaction.behaviouralfinance.net/" rel="nofollow">http://overreaction.behaviouralfinance.n...</a>|`|g34x7iKhaa	At this point, I blame every single damn one of them.

FCY3lwnoaa	How can you possibly say it wasn't because of Union wages?

Does this then mean that you are purely looking for self-affirmation?  GM, like many of the other super companies, got fed up with paying extremely high union wages and benefits while seeing a significant drop in both production and quality.  They got their lobbyists to push for NAFTA, allowing them to seek other markets that allowed them to save money.  Isn't it amazing how it is actually less expensive to export the raw materials, have them assembled, packaged and then import them back into the country than it is to just pay out to the local labor force?  The problem you run into then, is that after being allowed that maneuver, the decision makers then went to their board of trustees and said "look how much money we're saving!" patted themselves on the back and were then given huge bonus' for having done so.  What SHOULD have happened was that they should have looked at the savings, used it as an advertisement, telling everyone how concerned they were and then reduced the end cost of their product, passing the savings or at least a nice percentage of it on to the customer.<br>  <br>  The "Cheap Imports" are no longer imported.  They are now made right here.  The difference is that the quality is higher and the cost is lower -- non-union labor.  The problem there is that they feed the laborers just enough bread crumbs to keep them satified while ultimately, the money goes back to their home country instead of staying here.<br>  <br>  Both management and the labor force are guilty of greed and are the root cause of the current economic situation.  That both sides of the same coin are in such denial about their culpability goes a long way towards being a barometer as to just how long it will take to get out of this mess.<br>  <br>  In my humble estimation, Bush's tax cuts were far better for the country as a whole than is Obama's eagerness to go billions and soon trillions of dollars into debt with no end in sight and no viable means to repay the debt.<br>  <br>  I was able to start a business for $5K and now 4 years later, am employing 7 full time, one part time and one seasonal.  You do the math.  $817 BILLION to create 300 MILLION jobs?  If you thought America was drunk on credit during the Bush 43 years, you ain't seen nothin' yet!|`|c6966d0b78820379a53d653205aa5aabaa	Because they can be more competitive over seas.  <br>  <br>  Whether you want to accept it or not we are now in a global economy and people are going to take their company to wherever they can greatest profit.  "American Company" only works for mom and pops now.  Even China has to deal with this reality as they are losing manufacturing jobs to places like Vietnam, just like they took them from Taiwan.  And so it will go as every ones standard of living continues to increase.  Unless Obama completely sinks this economy and then you will be producing the toys for China's kids.|`|2bHacnMBaa	So go ahead and keep shopping at wal-mart.
irFvDZmNaa	LIFE vs DEATH<br>  <br>  Choosing death would be suicide! I'd go with Life! Who said life had to be glamourous? Think about it! Everything we've enjoyed about life was from experience. <br>  <br>  Try to understand this point I am making. We are BORN into a FIXED world where rules were already created without our opinions. <br>  <br>  Now, think about a hamster. Hamsters still enjoy a good life even though they are in a cage. Therefore, my point is this. Perhaps one can live a good life in prison! <br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, think about it like this. Suppose you were born and raised in prison. Suppose you didn't know anything else about the world. Suppose that all you ever knew was prison. Then, it would be normal to enjoy prison life, and perhaps living outside of prison would seem DREADFUL. <br>  <br>  Therefore, I think life in prison would be a far better choice than death!|`|zmSUHVqjaa	life, because you could try to escape and move to another country duh or start speaking a foreign language and get deported lol|`|LcAiHBsaaa	death penalty... i wouldn't want to sit around in jail thinking about the crime that got me into this pickle for the rest of my life... that would be way more torture than just gettin' offed.|`|K62i9b6laa	death|`|lqxCn05kaa	Where there is definite proof "not circumstancial" of 1st degree murder, I would go for the death penalty, unless there were extreme circumstances.|`|AA12308448	life sentence with out the possibility of parole then i take the death penalty if there is chance for parole i take life sentence.|`|oXfvBdNHaa	I really can't answer that...

The reason is that they are themselves a secular religion, so are in competition with other religions|`|SwojYmvdaa	funny thing is Karl Marx was Jewish|`|q7JumPqjaa	what basis do you have for that statement.<br>  they dislike orgnaised mass religion, especially fighting a war over it (israel).<br>  but there are secular jews, and non-religious jews. so they do not, and its perhaps an exxageration or generalisation to say 'hate'.|`|hbGCjDHYaa	They don't alot of them hate zionism.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	None.<br>  <br>  The TOW missile system (and the 2-man turret) were not infantry requirements.  They were pushed on the vehicle by the Cavalry.<br>  <br>  In the early 1970's the Army had seperate vehicle programs going on for a Cavalry scout vehicle and an Infantry vehicle.  The XM800 Cav vehicle would have had a 2-man turret with missile launcher and the XM723 Infantry vehicle a 1-man turret and full size 9-man infantry squad.  When it was decided to merge the two vehicle programs to save money the Infantry vehicle got stuck with the 2-man Cavalry turret.  The extra space occupied by this turret and the stowage requirements of the missiles reduced the size of the Infantry vehicles primary weapon - its dismount squad - by 33% down to just 6 men.  <br>  <br>  From a tactical point of view giving a thin-skinned vehicle like the Brad the ability to duke it out with tanks seems suicidal as well.  Against poorly trained, led and and inadequately supported conscripts the idea might be OK, but against a real enemy it seems insane.  The in-action and flight time of the TOW or any other missiles is far greater than that of a tank gun.

The fact is that the active campaign against  organized labor by the Republicans is one  major reason for our present gap in wealth. This gap in wealth which is the greatest it has been in one hundred years is a major factor in our current financial situation. Much of the GWB (I know how you Republicans hate the "B" word) economy was based on easy credit. As wages went down, benefits disappeared and energy costs soared through the GWB years our economy was propped up with artificially low interest rates in order for people to be able to continue to spend through borrowing and provide a "bubble"  economy. The bubble burst as could have been predicted.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Yes one can trace it back to the PNAC and bushco.|`|cMHxg372aa	Actually, it's exactly the opposite. The lack of fair bargaining has been a big contributor to the massive imbalance in income distribution. This imbalance has become so great that it is inhibiting the proper functioning of the financial system, and thus the economy. We've seen this movie before, circa the 1920's and 30's.<br>  <br>  It's pretty simple - when the people who buy the products of business can no longer afford to do so because the people who control business have taken a share of output larger than their contributions to production, by necessity, they stop buying. With no one buying anything, there's no reason to invest, so people lose their jobs. This leads to even more defaults on debts, and becomes a self-perpetuating downward spiral.|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	no.  i think it is partly responsible for the demise of certain companies where they refused to negotiate a reasonable package and therefore created more loss than profit for the underlying company.<br>  <br>  the disaster stems from the dishonesty, irresponsibility, greed and lack of oversight that created a giant house of cards with zero underlying value.  borrower and lender were both guilty, oversight and regulation was so spine-less it's embarrassing.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	What is wrong with people coming together and forming a political voice.

3Sr2FgRfaa	My son's a Marine, my husband in the Navy. It is NOT like a prison. Boot camp SSUUCCKKSS -- but after boot, you're all toughened up and ready to work out every day. Past that, if you're not in intensive training or in a combat unit, you should feel more like you're holding down a regular old job, just one with a unique idea of office dress code. <br>  <br>  You sound like you have the right reasons for joining, but try a cooling-off period. Don't talk to Dad about it any more at ALL, but do chat with your Marine friends from time to time. Sounds to me like Dad is part of why you lack self-confidence -- a common problem these days.<br>  <br>  When my son joined the Marines, he did it smart -- after thinking about it for a while and talking to me and his dad, he went in and signed the contract. He knew his parents would be supportive, and when everyone else in the family lost it (his grandmother - oy!) he pointed out that it was a felony to break the contract, and jail is worse than Marines.<br>  <br>  What he did NOT point out -- and you shouldn't either -- is that before you graduate boot and take your oath, you can indeed break the contract, though you may be financially liable for a couple of things. So you, personally, have an out if you get in and decide you can't hack it.<br>  <br>  If you decided to go for it, get the shortest period between your contract signing and your ship-out date possible. This will keep your dad from driving you nuts and your mother from crying all over you. And when you come back, all buff and confident (love me those marines!) they'll have gotten over it - and even if they don't you'll be much better prepared to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just talk to smart marines. You'll do just fine.|`|GsIeRKDnaa	I too am thinking about joining the marines. I've been weighing out my options and it seems like a good choice. My parents don't really want me going, but i feel that i am obligated to serve my country. I think it will make me a better person and prepare me for life. I'm in the same boat as you, and i can say that i'm most likely going to enlist.|`|YEZAa1hCaa	Is your dad a prior Marine?  If not, tell him to kiss it and do what YOU want to do. Yes, any branch of the service is a committment you must make if you decide to join. There will be tough times and there will be good times. It's what YOU make of it.<br>  <br>  SSG Mac<br>  US Army Recruiter|`|RDdSOqdnaa	I am a Marine. I love it I never felt like I was in prison or anything of the sort. Sure there are some days I hate it but that comes with everything in life. There are good jobs and there are bad ones. I love my job I get to fly all over the world and get payed money to do it. With a 70 you can get almost any job the Marines has to offer. ( KC-130J crew chief) The one thing that helped me the most is to pray about it. So if you are a praying man I recommend you do it. If you think it is the right thing for you to do the join no matter what your father says, but if not the no harm no foul. if you have questions contact me through yahoo.|`|ZamKEqHCaa	I am in the somewhat in the same boat as you.. I have had pretty much the same response from friends and my father, however it is only because I am choosing to join a Combat Arms MOS. I have many friends in different branches of the military. Some, definitely compare it, like your father said, to a lifestyle much like prison. They hate it. I have some who love what they do. I personally have not heard a good remark about Iraq or Afghanistan though. The military is not for everyone. I am 25, and doing nothing with my life. That is my main reason for enlisting into the Marine Corps. I think that I will not like it at all, but I am looking at it as a way out and a way to serve my country. There are so many pros and cons in the military. Marine Corps Basic Training will definitely challenge you physically and mentally, in my opinion more than any other branch. On top of the longer training, every non- Combat Arms Marine must attend Marine Combat Training for an extra 29 days after Basic Training. I hope this helped a little.|`|Y95TGph4aa	Think about everything joining can do for you, and don't you dare doubt yourself. Sorry, but I don't think your dad knows what he's talking about. But dude, just think about it - you could be a US Marine!|`|oPLpwKH2aa	its your life not his, how will he ever know that you wont like it. there had a be something that appealed to you about the Marine Corps, if thats the branch that you want to join then join. see you are letting people tell you what to do. you are sure you wanted to join, but your dad said you werent. (basically) do you want to go through your life wondering, what if? you already said why you wanted to join. so join,|`|65Q8oMvUaa	Just like in everything else there will be those who have a bad experience, and those are the ones who you hear about. In my opinion I would join, but that is because I have wanted to all my life. Think it over some more and if it is truly what you want to do then go for it. Good Luck.|`|pEbFh5uXaa	your father is wrong. <br>  <br>  the only thing you WILL regret is not being man enough to make that decision yourself and letting others decide for you. i know its hard but if you really want it, then you will do it. <br>  <br>  im the army; some love it, some leave it. its not for everybody but just like the corps, you wont know until you actually join. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|UCNPFSw8aa	Regardless of all, the only person who can answer that question is you. I for one find that you can always gain something out of serving your country: discipline, integrity, values, etc... If you're not too sure on the Marines, why not look at the other branches and see which one appeals to you the most?|`|6xoTZYpZaa	My question is why would you pick the marines over the airforce or the navy or Coast Guard (serioudly have you looked into CG? most people bypass that one when theyre looking for military, but its actually a nice branch to be in)  <br>  Dont join the Marines just for the sake of feeling accepted.  If you cant challenge your lack of self-confidence head on in a civilian life, what makes you think you can do it in the Marines?<br>  <br>  There are the important reasons to join the military:<br>  To serve your country and defend freedom;<br>  To serve your country and defend freedom;<br>  and also to serve your country and defend freedom.<br>  <br>  Reasons not to join the military:<br>  To get a girlfriend;<br>  to feel accepted;<br>  to meet tuition (there are other ways of making money, the military sacrifices 4 years of your life -at low pay- at least)<br>  to learn discipline (military discipline is a positive thing, but from a practical view point, youre still going to have to learn to be disciplined with or without military training, and there are other ways of doing that, like college.)<br>  <br>  It looks to me that you have romanticised the idea of being a Marine.  Joining the military is a noble thing to do, but make sure youre doing it for the right reasons.  And make sure that when you pick a job (theyre going to put you wherever they need you btw, you sign your life over to them for 4 years and if they want you cleaning toilets then thats what youre doing for 4 years - probably not but you get what I'm saying?), youre not doing it for the wrong reasons.

6QBGZHznaa	There is no truly short response, but the easiest one is that in our system, we've split the three basic functions of the government into three distinct and independent sections.<br>  The Congress is the legislative branch that creates the laws, a bill is made into a law by the congress.<br>  the President is the executive branch and enforces the law, he decides how policies are put into effect.<br>  The Judicial branch interprets the law, that's the Supreme Court deciding on whether a law is Constitutional.<br>  Of course, we also have checks and balances between these three powers, that allow the government to make sure no branch is too strong, but that is another question.|`|wtcAK31Paa	Something like: The founding fathers didnt want one preson to have total control of the government, so the they made 3 branches of government the judicial, executive and legislative. The executive is the president, judicial is the supreme court and the legislative is congress.

9tcv3TiWaa	If he was living in housing without you then he wouldn't have been getting BAH at all.  If he was living out in town then he can do whatever he wants with the place as long as it is allowed by the person who owns it.   If he was staying in housing that a friend was living in it is allowed as long as it is not longer than 14 days at a time.  You said he was living on a ship part of the time so therefore as long as he wasn't in housing for the full time of 6 months it is alright.   He could possibly get in trouble and then again he might not.  <br>  <br>  Just leave it alone and move on with your life.  It probably isn't worth the time, the effort or stress doing it.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	If you were still married and not legally separated, then he could keep the BAH.  If you were divorced at any time in those 6 months, then he defrauded the gov't and would have to pay it back.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Unless you stated in the divorce papers that you get half of the BAH until the divorce is final...no, there is nothing you can do.<br>  <br>  Usually they give they wife some sort of pay while the divorce is going on. If you didn't get that during the divorce and you didn't request it. There is nothing you can do. Sorry.<br>  <br>  He sounds like a d*ck anyway, why would you want anything more to do with him? Just smile and say "Yeah you see these boobs...well your best friend bought them!"|`|n2oEhdZiaa	It doesn't matter if you are seperated, hating each other, waiting to get a divorce, etc.  <br>  <br>  The Army considers you single or married.  If you were still legally married, he was entitled to the BAH.|`|PVnKQG8Waa	You can be single and collect BAH also, I see it all the time. He was not living in the barracks so he was entitled to the BAH. The only difference between single without dependents BAH and BAH with dependents is about 200 dollars so the total he was overpaid was about 1200 when you multiply the excess times the 6 months. He will not get in trouble because the amount was not big enough for an investigation to be warranted especially when you have to go 5 years back and he has moved locations. It would probably cost the Army more to conduct the investigation than they would get back from him so they will just let it go. I have a feeling that you are still mad at him and are looking for a way to get him in trouble. I recommend you just ignore him and his stupid remarks.|`|X8CaMCe6aa	Unfortunately, when you were separated during that six-month period, you should have went to someone to learn about your entitlements.  At that time, if he was drawing BAH at the "with dependent" rate, you probably would have received something during your 6 month separation.  At the time you were separated, he was entitled to draw BAH at the "with dependent" rate, regardless where he lived, simply because of his status of being married to you.  I would recommend you let it go and move on with your life.  I know that's not the answer you would like to hear, but, I'm fairly certain that you will get nowhere with the military based upon the length of time that you've been divorced.  It seems that you are probably "hell bent" over this situation because he got over on you.  I can understand your frustration, but, seriously, you should let it go by moving on with your own life and further avoiding your ex.|`|DEXSuqT7aa	No there is nothing you can do, BAH is entitled to all members that live off base.  Since his marital status did not change, he still gets it.<br>  <br>  BAH is entitled to the service member not the spouse. Sounds cold, but that is the fact. It is his disgression on how he spends it, sorry to hear about your situation, but he did nothing wrong.

Cb9O7ycPaa	No, to fly aircraft you have to be an officer. Officers don't get to pick their MOS. They are put where they are needed or if you finish at the top of your OCS class then you have first pick in what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Lat moves for enlisted are available, but Recon and Force Recon only let 0300 and Field Radio Operators take a crack at the indoc. Anyway, they don't just let people lat move all over the place. The Marine Corps blows a lot of money on your training and if you were in the air wing, there is no way in hell they would let you lat move to a completely different field like infantry, unless infantry was short handed, which is not the case.|`|fsjIeVpRaa	Yes and no....no officers are assigned as an MOS 0321, they will either be 0302 or 0202.  Officers may be reserved as platoon commanders of Division Recon, also with Force Recon, but no officers go out on patrol with Force Recon normally.  And there has to be a slot for an officer, they don't get to choose Recon, the Corps sticks them were they want them to be.  There are no Recon MOS designated for Officers, they can however get billeted as MOS 8654, just as the 0321s can become 8654s.  But they do not have slots for Recon Officers, they just command and control, not operate.  That is only for the enlisted.<br>  <br>  Radio Recon however has slots for Officers, but they are 0602s, and not the official 8654s.  Radio Recon are a total separate entity, set aside from Division Recon and the FMF Recon (Force Recon).
xxDjV6Axaa	It's not hard.  You write facts only as to what was said by each party.  You do not include things such as they laughed or blew their nose.  Write it in the order the deposition was taken.  It's one of the easiest papers to write.  Be concise.  Don't rewrite what was written but stick to the main points.  <br>  <br>  "The man was driving his car going north when suddenly he turned in front of me.  I don't remember if he put his turn signal on.  I hit him on the passenger side door and I think I was going about 35 miles an hour.  I was stunned when he turned and I slammed on the brakes but I still skidded into him.  It was right in front of that new restaurant.  I hit my head on the windshield and that is why they called an ambulance but I never passed out.  I was just crying."<br>  <br>  So you would write that Party A was traveling south when Party B traveling north, turned in front of her, resulting in a T-bone collision.  Party A was examined for head injuries by EMS after hitting the windshield, but was not transported to the hospital.  <br>  <br>  This is not exact but I am just giving you an example of how to write it.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Read the deposition.

As they approached the border with Azerbaijan, they came across an Armenian military post and were cruelly fired upon”.[8]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/Hojaly/" rel="nofollow">http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/...</a><br>  <br>  The Armenian side states that the killings occurred as a result of wartime military operations, and were in part caused by the prevention of the evacuation of town inhabitants by Azerbaijani forces. Armenian government officials asserted that the casualty count, though high, was due to the fact the fleeing civilians in Khojaly had mingled with the retreating defenders and when the Azeri troops shot back, Armenian forces fired upon them, killing both soldier and civilian alike. Helsinki Watch itself concluded "that the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians." [9] However, Human Rights Watch and Memorial, found this explanation of Armenian officials unconvincing, stating that the mass killing of civilians could not be justified under any circumstances. Human Rights Watch noted that “the attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. In particular, the party must suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."[10]<br>  <br>  The Armenian side refers to Ayaz Mutalibov's interview to claim that the massacre had been committed not by Armenian soldiers but by Azerbaijan Popular Front militants who allegedly shot their own civilians escaping through the corridor. In one of his interviews Mutalibov stated that the event could be a ploy by opposition to denigrate his government. In later interviews, however, Mutalibov would go on to condemn the Armenians for what he said was a blatant misinterpretation of his words.[11] Other theories proposed by the Armenian side were that Azeri Popular Front soldiers had massacred 100 Azeri and Armenian civilians and then proceeded to mix the bodies and lay blame upon the Armenians.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.human.gov.az/?sehife=etrafli&dil=en&sid=MTc0ODE4MTExMTQ5OTI5OA==" rel="nofollow">http://www.human.gov.az/?sehife=etrafli&...</a>|`|n3IoftMFaa	Muslim Nation!?<br>  <br>  Hahah!

Fine, as long as you understand that is the business of any corporation (with the exception of some non-profits; for example, credit unions perform most of the same functions as banks but their goal is not just to make as much money as possible).<br>  You ask "if the obama administration is considering using our tax dollars that are non existent anyway to establish a national bank that will buy up bad loans, how would that benefit you and i?" It would help you and I by taking unknown debts off the hands of the banks, freeing them up to lend money again. Banks make money in two ways. One, they take the money you place in their accounts and invest it. These investments are usually a mix of long and short term, high and low yield, high and low risk. The difference between the money they make investing and the money they pay you as interest on the money you let them hold is revenue for the bank. Second, they make loans and charge interest on those loans. Sometimes they sell these loans to third parties rather than waiting for the borrower to make timely payments and eventually paying off the principal. The bank must keep enough cash reserves ('liquid assets') on hand to pay off people who wish to withdraw money from their accounts. If the bank doesn't know how much money will come in from the outstanding loans it holds, then it doesn't know how much money it needs to keep liquid to pay anyone wishing to withdraw his or her money; this means it needs to play it safe and keep more money in reserves, which in turn lessens how much money it can loan out. This has caused the current credit crunch. Taking the bad loans away from the banks would free up money for them to lend again.<br>  <br>  You ask, "why is no rule put upon the banks...that they themselves put themselves into requiring that they...restructure their own lousy loans so that such loans become profitable to them...?"<br>  You seem to think this is something that can be easily done. Exactly HOW do you expect them to restructure these loans? Do you even understand these loans? In case you don't, here is an extremely simplified explanation. First, there was a housing bubble and everyone wanted to buy a house. However, not everyone could afford or qualify for a traditional mortgage, so many people instead went for the riskier types of loans like adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). The banks took some of these loans and bundled them for sales to third parties, just like banks have always sold debts that are owed them. Each mortgage was backed ('collateralized') by the property that the borrower used the money to buy. These bundles were collateralized debt obligations, aka securitized debt obligations. The banks sold some and held on to some. It became next to impossible to know who actually holds the loan for any given mortgage. Then, some institutions started selling credit default swaps, essentially an insurance policy in case the borrowers ended up defaulting on the loans.<br>  <br>  All this was fine and dandy as long as the real estate bubble continued. The collateralized debt obligations kept paying out as borrowers made their payments, and if the borrowers defaulted, the mortgage-holder could foreclose on the property, sell it, and get their money that way. Then the real estate market collapsed. People couldn't make their payments, so houses were foreclosed. As these properties hit the market, there was a glut of supply compared to demand, so values for practically all real property declined. That meant the mortgage-holders couldn't even get the money they were owed if they did end up foreclosing. <br>  <br>  The end result is what we have now: the banks can't lend because they need that money on hand in the form of liquid capital; people who took risky loans can barely make payments, while the value of their house might now be less than the value of the loan they hold on it; even though the collateralized debt obligations still pay off to some extent as borrowers make their payments, the banks can't sell them to anyone because the marketplace is so scared of them they won't pay a price near what the CDOs are worth, and the banks refuse to sell at what the market is willing to pay; and banks and institutions who offered credit default swaps when the market was strong are now going broke trying to pay them off. At the same time, people have mortgages for way more than their houses are worth; they are looking at their mortgage payments thinking, if I am lucky, and the housing market rebounds a little, and I make all my payments for the next ten years, I might finally then be at a point where my mortgage principal is equal to my house's value. Why shouldn't I just walk away from my mortgage now?<br>  <br>  You ask why banks don't just change the terms of the loans.<br>  Loans are a multi-party deal. There is both a borrower and a lender, and any changes to the loan agreement must be agreed to by all parties. A bank can't just unilaterally change the terms, even if it wanted to. And why would they want to? Why would any bank want to push off revenue from current loans for a hundred years? Haven't you ever heard of the time-value of money? The banks need capital now, not a hundred years from now. Loans that take that long to pay off are not profitable to a bank; they waste money now, which can only buy less tomorrow thanks to inflation. And why would a borrower want to accept such a deal? The borrower will be paying the loan off for a hundred years?? No sane person would accept such a deal. The payments would be tiny, but the interest would swallow the principal several times over. You would tell a person struggling to pay an ARM today that instead they have to pay for the rest of their life, and even when they die, even though they have paid back the original loan three or four times over, they still don't own the property outright and they can't leave it to an heir without the lien being paid off first by the heir. Under your 100-year loan plan, if I bought a house two years ago, and I lived to 100, I still wouldn't have paid off the mortgage when I died.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of the bad bank. It buys up all those CDOs that the banks can't sell because the market won't give them a decent price for them. Then the banks would have the capital on hand start lending again. The CDOs are not as bad as the market seems to believe, based on the prices the market is willing to pay. They still pay off to some degree, and the revenue would go to the government via the bad bank. If house prices stabilize, the loans will no longer be worth more than the collateral (i.e. the houses) so there will no longer be an incentive for borrowers to walk away from loans. House prices won't stabilize or rise until people can buy houses, and they need loans to do that. Borrowers can't get loans from banks as long as the banks are too worried about their toxic assets to lend. Also, as long as their is a glut of foreclosed houses on the market, the housing market won't stabilize or grow. The more the borrowers pay back on these toxic assets owned by the bad bank, the more money to the government. I think it's worth a shot unless some better idea is out there, which I certainly have not heard.|`|f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	You can obviously tell who is stupid when they accuse you of being stupid and find some reason not to answer your question.   <br>  Oh wait, you took your time to write an essay. LOL.<br>  <br>  Obama is not about fixing our economy, but bailing out his friends.  He is too close to Goldman Sachs.   Of what I heard abut the Housing bailout, it was more about bailing out developers.   <br>  <br>  In the old days, when banks do something stupid, they go bankrupt, and the banks lead by good presidents would grow faster  by buying up bad banks asset at cheap prices.   This is a better system, because those who are lead by the smart would aid in our recovery, rather than the stupid dragging it down.
qzfAG3ciaa	You still have to sign up, but in the unlikely event a draft is called up, he will be medically disqualified.  The Selective Service is a registration.  I suggest you do it so he could get federal benifits for his handicap.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Only to be eligible for college grant and what not. It only takes 5 minutes at the post office be a citizen|`|AA10604086	.He still must register, but you can help him.<br>  Registering is little more than a formality. Even though me may be physically disqualified for the Military, there is no classification system in effect.<br>  You can do it online. It takes but a minute or two, then it is done and out of the way.|`|K8qAniReaa	Yes. *Technically* he could go to jail if he doesn't and be fined $250,000.  They don't put people in jail for not signing up for the selective service anymore but it's still the law.<br>  <br>  Don't worry though.  Even if the draft is re-instated he won't be drafted because he would still have to go through Medical Entrance Processing. Your sons Autism and other disabilities disqualify him from military service.<br>  <br>  ETA: Can your son function without public assistance?  I posted my original comment with the idea that he is somewhat autistic but functional.  If he is so mentally or physically disabled that he cannot sign up for the selective service on his own then he doesn't have to.  If he can read and get to a computer on his own to sign up I'd still have him do it just in case.|`|rADpGLeJaa	I have the experience of one disabled person in my past years.In general,disabled persons are very intelligence due to concentration of mind in one thing. These people cannot take part in every activity of our daily life  and thus they have more concentration power than us. I can suggest that you should observe his/her interest then he/she should be free to carry on his work what he wants. You should not suggest or imposed him your own choice. For example,see,www.opmisra.com,the second person who was disabled but had very creative mind than us. Thanks to the questioner for important question for the society.|`|nZg6cubqaa	no of course not, and even if he didn't have the condition mind you the selective service is mearly a paper tiger and once the government finds out you havent signed all they will make you do is sign.|`|4t2kd03Waa	Nope|`|p0jWdSsAaa	I would think so just to be on the legal side but since we do not have the draft anymore and if the country did reinstate the draft I do not think your son would be eligible for the draft. Wikipedia has a page about the selective service process it also has links for more information.
2zym4J9xaa	NAVY!<br>  <br>  Simple answer as to why... the most fun.  Its hard work, its dangerous, its everything and more.... but what makes it the best branch to join would be the fun factor.  The Navy is a good time.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	I'm old now but wish I went air force or navy. Never meet anyone with regret that they enlisted.

You get to see the world on the government's dime.  2.  You meet a LOT of great people.  3.  You get to do meaningful and important work for your country.  4.  You are never more than 4 hours away from HOT chow - no MREs if you are on a surface boat or a sub.  5.  After you are done with your service, you get awesome jobs in the civilian sector as a government contractor.  6.  The girls love a Navy man.  <br>  <br>  BTW.  Here is something nobody tells you going in.  If you go to either Annapolis, West Point or Colorado Springs, and you want to be an officer with advancement on your mind, be prepared to deal with politics like you never have before.  The service is full of political crap that has nothing to do with how you do your job.  Just be prepared for that and you will be fine.|`|K8qAniReaa	For me personally I'm going National Guard to finish college then Navy.  I'm choosing the guard because I want to finish college and have it paid for.  Then Navy because my father and grandfather were Navy and I'll get to see the world.<br>  <br>  What do you want out of the military?  That's what will help you decide on the branch for you.|`|bHdsvFqQaa	I spent 6 years in the Army, and I was jealous the whole time because when I worked with Air Force people - they loved it. I'm actually thinking about switching to the Air Force.<br>  <br>  I would say Air Force. They have just as much variety as any other branch (including combat if thats what you're into), except they treat their people much better.|`|RWX8w35Haa	air force or navy|`|AaPyuC5faa	well they all help people so their all good but i think army for me:)|`|pss8LblLaa	I'm in the Air Force and I would choose it again if I got a do-over.  Each branch has it's pros and cons.  If you were to give grades for various things like chance to die, quality of your service mates etc., the one that the Air Force would get the worst marks for is promotion rate.  All of the other services promote faster.  Other than that, the Air Force is a pretty good choice.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Navy|`|3xTNOevjaa	Navy

It takes a little practice to get it right. Use only the very tip of your finger on the trigger. Imagine "squeezing the trigger slowly with your finger. When the gun fires it should almost be a surprise. When you pull the trigger quickly you are also moving the gun. You want to pull the trigger with the least amount of movement you can. This can be practiced without actually firing a bullet. Just practice "dry firing". That is aim at an object with the gun unloaded and squeeze the trigger until the gun clicks.|`|65Q8oMvUaa	Breathe steadily and don't flinch when you are about to fire. Squeeze the trigger slowly while breathing out steadily. Also, If you have a problem keeping the sight on the target try relaxing your grip a little. It may be that you are holding the gun too tight and every little movement you make is transferred to the gun. And practice dry firing so that you get used to firing and pulling the trigger.|`|tvh6WiBGaa	B.R.A.S.S.<br>  <br>  Breathe<br>  Relax<br>  Aim<br>  Squeeze<br>  Shoot

m6C3pgChaa	It does exist.  There are Air, Ground, and Law contracts.  An Air contract gives you a guaranteed chance to become a pilot, but you can fail out of any of the schools and then be put in another MOS.  My husband was going to try to get switched to an air contract from his ground one but it was going to take forever to make the switch and he was advised that chances were good for him to be able to pick one up at TBS.  From his TBS class there were at least five air spots to be filled and he was able to get one, now flying helos.

qkvoAYoeaa	The tests for such a position are thorough but not difficult.  It takes a rather special kind of person to work in a correctional facility.  You could expect a regular I.Q. type of exam along with a test or two to evaluate your psycological make up.  You might expect a lengthy interview with questions like, "Why do you want to become a corrections officer?"  A physical exam would necessary, also, prior to entry into training.  Candidate requirements and testing information would be available to you by contacting the Dept. of Corrections in your state.  Certainly, you would want to submit your requests and your application using proper grammar and accurate spelling...
