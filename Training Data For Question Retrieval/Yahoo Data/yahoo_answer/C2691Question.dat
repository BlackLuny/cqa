20090222154416AAKHyM3	Pets;Cats	Can a cat die from anesthesia reactions more than 48 hours after surgery?	I'm sorry, if I am a little emotional at the moment, but my wife and I just lost our kitten this morning. We dropped her off to be spayed, and the hospital called, and said she was out and awake, drinking water and fine. They said they needed to keep her 48 hours to make sure all was fine. The next evening, they said she was fine as well. We go in this morning to pick her up, and the tech guy says "she's dead", to which we are utterly shocked. He leads us back to her cage, and she is seized up, bloated, with vomit all over her. They are saying that it was a delayed reaction to the anesthesia.      My 2 questions are this-    Can anesthesia allergies happen so far after surgery?   If it did happen as a result, if someone from the vet would of been monitoring her, could they have done anything for her?      Thanks,   a saddened father      Her name was Abbey. She was 8 months.
20090222154511AAZmRNp	Pets;Horses	What size blanket................?	What size blanket(in inches) would fit my horse. He is a 16.2 hand tennessee walker. He's not that lanky, but hes not stocky either...      I want to buy uv fly sheet for him so he doesn't fade in the summer. But I don't know what size he needs, because the only blanket(heavy winter turnout) he has is size large, so I have no idea what it is in inches...      Thanks!

20090222155807AAtLlSM	Pets;Horses	I need some help with jumping?	Okay, I'm currently riding two horses for my trainer. I just got back in riding about a year ago (rode for about three years before I took the break off).      Anyways, so their names are Spotty and Gigolo. Spotty was a Western roping horse, but my trainer taught him English. I began riding him when I first met my trainer and I took it upon myself to teach him how to jump, and he's doing very well. Right now he's doing flying lead changes and 2'9 jump courses (about 8 jumps in the course).       Then, once I got a little more advanced I began riding Gigolo (he's a show horse and has been in many shows. He jumps about 4 foot, but I don't jump him that high). Gigolo hadn't been ridden in months, so I'm helping my trainer get him back in shape (she broke her knee and can't ride).      Gigolo and I have been doing really great until recently. I had to change my stirrups, but I don't think that would be the problem. Whenever I jump him about 2'6 to maybe 2'9, he either jumps it well or extremely HUGE (that's how he jumped in shows). But when he jumps big, it's rediculous. At one point, he took off a stride in a half early instead of putting in an extra stride. I kind of lost balance, but I didn't lose my stirrups or fall. But it feels horrible and I'm sure it looks horrible.      But when Spotty does this occasionally, we do fine and I don't get unbalanced. So I didn't know why it felt different? Is it because Spotty is a sixteen hand paint and gigolo is a built, 16'3 horse who really has a large stride and moves underneath himself? Does that make a difference?      Or is it because Gigolo has been through extensive training and just jumps different? I just don't get why I get unbalanced when he overjumps but not Spotty. Any ideas? Thank you so much!
20090222155216AAzO45g	Pets;Fish	Tiger Oscar Fish! - South American Cichlid?	I bought a tiger oscar fish from the pet store and he was dark black with red spots/stripes. Before leaving the store he already became a pale gray color. I assumed it was just because he was scared so anyway its been a couple days now since I put him in my tank and he still seems to be a lil more on the pale side, definitely not the color I first saw him as. He's probably about 3 inches in size with another cichlid about 2 inches and they're both in a 10 gallon tank. I don't think he should be stressed but also I've noticed him trying to swim into the glass where it seems to be reflective; as in maybe he's trying to attack himself or something like that. I'm just wondering if he needs more time to return to his dark black color or if he will probably stay this paler color? It's probably been about 3 days since I got him. Thanks!

I heard my gerbil moving around so i went to have a look, he looked fine and then he kinda lost his balance and fell on his side. He got back up though.      I panicked.      I phoned the emergency vet and they said unless it was something to do with the brain there's not much they could do.      He's drinking at eating plenty and being the little crazy so n so as he always is :)      His leg was getting better and then Thursday just gone he jumped off the top of his house and he seems to have hurt it even more.      He still gets onto his back legs to stand up but now and again he falls onto his side/back like the first time.      Again he's still eating and drinking and wanting a fuss.      I don't know if its his spine? I'm just terribly worried.      The reason i say this is because he sometimes arches his back to walk but then he wiggles his right leg (which is the one i think hes having the problem with)      Ahh i just don't know what to do.      If things don't improve i shall take him to the vet on Tuesday as our local one isn't open tomorrow.      Advice, please?

20090222053807AAx51m6	Pets;Horses	I am thinking about buying a horse with a navicular?	There is a horse at my barn and his name is george, my lesson barn got him for free, and i was the first person to ride him.. also the last, i was riding him to see if he was rideable, he turned up not to be, he had a hoof issue, and eventually the farrier came and found he had a navicular? Apparently its bad, and i have no idea what it is.. i kno he will never be rideable again, i also know its a black hole where money will go.. and also he would be my first horse, but there are plently of experienced horse people at my barn if need be, but my point is my barn owner is "selling" three horses at our barn, and one is George, but for free, and i feel like im the only person that knows him or would even consider adopting him because he was never in the lesson program, so i now have such a soft spot for him, i even made extra special trips to the barn just to groom him and give him treats.. what do you think? Should i adopt him, or should i just groom him and spend time with him? But im so afraid that my barn owner might get rid of him to an awful person.. im scared for him..

20090222161258AAmiOrX	Pets;Fish	Could i get some advice on changing water in a 2gallon tank with an under gravel filter?	i have my 2 gallon HEATED tank all ready for a betta fish to move into. i have not purchased him yet because i am still nervous on how to change the water.      i asked a question yesterday and was advised to remove 15% of the aquarium water every 2 or 3 days and replace it with new clean tap water. of course i will condition the new water and ensure that it is roughly the same temperature as the water in the tank.      i am looking for more DETAILS on the above procedure. does it simply involve scooping out water (with a cup) and replacing it? do i need to clean the sides of the tank once in a while? should i take out the little silk plant and clean it? SURELY i must clean the gravel sometimes? what other tools will i need to purchase? exactly how often should i do a more thorough cleaning instead of just my regular 15% change every 2 days?      i have never owned a fish before and names of aquarium tools are all foreign to me. i would also appreciate that if you suggest i get a certain cleaning tool, to EXPLAIN what it does for me.      yes.. i have a lot to learn and look forward to learning it! :)

20090222161308AAJyf8X	Pets;Dogs	Is a 16 week old male English Bulldog supposed to be this difficult to potty train?	He has been on the following schedule since he was 8 weeks old when we got him from a breeder. We never feed or let him drink unless he goes out afterward. He does not get any food/water after 6pm. He does go out every night around 10pm. Keep in mind he goes out almost every 30 min-45 mins between 6-10pm. Then 1am and 6am, 6;30am,7am, 7:30am ( was fed/drink 7am) everyday!, then my wife takes my girls to school.. she then gets back about 8:15am takes him out, then again at 8;45am (urinates every time).. my goes to work and is back by about 11;45am-12pm and usually he has urinated the crate. he is then fed/water around 12-12-30pm. goes out about 15 mins after. he then is out almost every 30-45mins (unless napping)until my wife picks up my girls in the pm.       He then is taken out almost every 30 mins or so until about 5-5:30 fed/water. Goes out around 15mins after. Then back to going out every 30-45 mins until 10pm (unless napping)when he is taken out and goes to bed before the cycle begins again (which he will urinate in the crate over 50% of the time).    Keep in my when he goes out he will rough house with the dogs in the yard (as well as in the house) after we praise him for doing his business in the yard *which we have treated him to help give him the idea where to go potty). He almost 98% of the time will urinate when taken out. But he still will just urinate while walking/playing in the house (no signs.. and I mean no signs). He would never make it 1 hour.. or even 2 hours (when normal people would complain). He urinates more than he drinks.   The crate is sectioned off so he cant just pee in the corner. When he does urinate he will drink it and play in it. It does not bother him.   I/we have trained several dogs including a Peke and we have never had such a problem. We are mentally exhausted and at a loss. Any help out there? Oh by the way... he was just recently at the vet to be checked for any infections which were negative. They are surprised by the situation since they know us.   He also has NEVER pooped in the house/crate. Only outside.    Please help.

First question...Do they generally keep male dogs over night after the neuter and how long is the recovery time? - any other advice for bring home a recently fixed male greatly appreciated.       Second question. I know that fixing males will help with there dominance, behavior, and the urge to piss on everything they smell...but because he is older I have heard that he may not change a whole lot, is this true? And how long after the neuter will it take before the changes take place?       I do intend to ask my vet all of these questions but I just wanted to see what experience as dog owners you all have had.       Thanks in advance       And p.s. regardless of whether or not his behavior will change i still intend on having him fixed.

( there are suggestions that this vaccine causes cancer).    A neighbor moved and left  a mother cat and 5 or 6 kittens. Another neighbor caught them, took some to the shelter, and kept 3. One will be mine. This was the last one caught( about 3 weeks ago), she is about 8 months old. She had her rabies and 4 in 1 vaccinations yesterday and will get be spayed within a few weeks.   My question is for those who have rescued a stray. Should I get my cat the leukemia vaccine before bringing her in. The stray needs to be tested, ( or do most of you do this?) but I was unable to get that done at the time of the vaccination. She is still in the neighbors house. If clear and when she does get spayed should I bring her home or should I let her get used to my house before spaying? She will be an indoor cat. She is still on the skittish side and I know it will take some time for her to calm down with me and my cat and dog.   Please let me know how you handled it. She does look and act healthy. I have rescued many cats, but circumstances did not present this scenario. Most of mine were from shelters.

20090222130049AAjx9nV	Pets;Dogs	Is it wrong to tell my husband that I don't want our pit bull puppy on the bed?	My husband sometimes puts our puppy on the bed and she's 12 weeks old. I keep asking him not to put her on there because when she gets older, she is going to jump on the bed or either whine to get on the bed. I want to keep her off the bed now as a puppy, so she will know not to get used to being on the bed when she is able to jump on it. Am I wrong for not wanting her on the bed when my husband gives her a bath to put her on there? She has got a crate with her toys and bed in there. I want her to know the crate is her bed not our bed. Am I wrong? What can I do to make my husband listen to me? He told me when I'm not at home, he'll put her on the bed when I asked him not to? How can I get it through his mind that I don't want her on our bed?

20090222163054AAPXfQ4	Pets;Birds	Is my bird dieing? im confused.?	okay, ive had my parakeet since 10/29/07. she definately isnt my first keet. when i bought her, she was about 4 months, but she was from a petstore. she was always afraid and if she was eating and i walked by she would hop up to the top perch. well today, i changed her food and she stayed down by the opening of the cage where i took the food dish. and then she even started to climb out! she NEVER does that. then i hovered my hand over her cage to see what would happen, she normally flips out, and she just sat there. today she also has fluffed out. but is she dieing? or is she FINALLY getting used to me and my surroundings after a little over a year.   thanks!  (:

20090222163128AAYFi2z	Pets;Horses	I have a problem with my horse, or me I should say.?	Any way I bought a TWH mare that is broke but hasn`t been rode in a few years due to bad cut on her which doesn`t affect her now ,and then she was bred. As you have probably already suspected I am a new horse owner, and please don`t start ridiculeing me and giving me lectures again.But me and my dad have been trying to work with the horse and for the most part she is ok she is getting better in alot of areas, but I think the main problem is me because in some ways I am really scared of her at times when she does stuff that she hasn`t done before,and  she already looks to my dad as her owner and not me because  he is not afraid of her. Let me give you an example like the other day I was trying to put the halter on her she starts throwing her head around then trots off and does this over and over again I was finally able to get the halter on,but I`m afraid of making her mad the n she might try to run over me or bite me or kick me.So my question is how do I get over my fear  and show her who is boss? I know this is long but please answer and please no lectures.        Thanks

20090222133143AAIyPAn	Pets;Dogs	The Shelter Behind Closed Doors?	This is a recent uproar in the animal community in my area, and I thought I'd share.      A shelter in our area has recently been exposed for picking up elderly dogs, giving owners 10 days to claim, and euthanizing them. Mind you, in these 10 days, the dog CAN NOT be adopted out to give the owner a chance to call/look.       The shelter manager expressed her reasoning as such: "We're saving space for dogs that are far more likely to be adopted, any animal over five years has a very low chance of being adopted. We shouldn't waste time, space, or money helping a low percentile of dogs be adopted when there are more eligible candidates."      Mind you, this is a large shelter with a very high adoption rate, very low return rate, and an even higher volunteer/foster program. There are always open kennels when you visit- and now we know why.      How would you react?

20090222162620AAOu2ov	Pets;Dogs	Is my greyhounds cancer starting to affect him?	my greyhound has had a cancerous lump on his right hind knee for more then a year now and because he has such little skin they can't really remove it   he has had 2 cancerous lumps before that have been removed and we have been through alot with those with the first one that had been on his same leg same spot  we could have cut off his leg or sent him through kemo, but knowing that with his personality we knew that he would probably not be able to handle that so we just removed the lump     3 years later here we are again. its much larger now at least an inch and 3/4 he has been weak in his hind for awhile now and about a week ago only ate half his meals but now has gotten back to eating the whole thing the choice we made with our vet is to not do anything and wait till it starts bothering him or it bursts to either put him down and maybe, probably not, amputate that leg( we know the same cancer has spread throughout his body so it may just send him through a lot of uneeded pain and stress)    and he is limping on it and tender from the lump down, the lump itself is not painful to him because we pressed on it a little and got no reaction it is very tender to touch he is limping on it but will occasionally  randomly run around. this has been going on since yesterday(we would have called the vet then but we weren't home and our dogsitter noticed it) he just turned 9 and he has trouble getting up.    we gave him Bayer aspirin which we read in greyhound for dummy's book was ok for them.   so my question was is this the cancer affecting him or could he have done it in his crate or when he was outside maybe?      wer calling the vet tomorrow  but i was just wondering

Hope you know what I mean.  I don't hear any clicking or anything. His legs aren't hurt but it's like he carries his right rear leg more than the other. He does put it down and walks all four legs equally when he's just walking slowly, but when he walks a little faster, he skips.

Hi, i have a 3 mos old shitzu pup, yesterday i brought him to the vet, i asked the vet if he could give an anti-rabies vaccine to my pup, and the vet said yes, so he gave a shot. My concern is, the vet told me that my pup should have the rabies booster shot after 3 mos. after, and its different from what I have read online that rabies vaccine is given at single dose and repeated yearly after.       Please enlighten me, because i am worried that my vet is just increasing his income.

20090222165345AAxed1f	Pets;Dogs	My pitbull has extreme seasonal allergies and has a very swollen paw....?	My 6 year pitbull has very extreme allergies seasonal as well as otherwise. I am seasoned at taking care of his allergic reactions which usually consist of slightly swollen paws and pimples on his back and belly.  However he just this evening seems to be reacting very badly to something in that he has an extremely swollen paw, it looks like a blister that is between his toe pushing them apart. Nothing has changed in his environment(my house) and he doesn't seem to extremely bothered by it unless you try to touch it and he keeps focusing his attentions on it(trying to lick etc). He needs his nails trimmed which i was making an appointment for tomorrow at which point i will speak with his doctor about it but It looks rather painful and i want to do something about it tonight. I have bathed him in medicated shampoo, wiped his feet with Genesis spray and put Ottomax lotion on his paws,(all of which are way to alleviate typical allergic reaction symtoms) is there anything else i can do? suggestions would be welcome.

20090222180928AAvQsVH	Pets;Birds	Ok, I know this is gonna sound really weird...?	But like 3 years ago I bought this 99 cent fake chicken at a flea market. It was made out of some kind of cardboard like material but it had real chicken feathers on it. Well I out it on a shelf in my room and totally forgot about it until it randomly fell the other night. I went to pick it up and noticed that there were like 4 or 5 weird little bugs on it, kinda teardrop shaped, white and sorta light brown on the edges and about the size of a grain of rice. All of them were dead. Could these be some kind of bugs that get on live chickens thinking it was actually a live chicken?      Totally weird, I know, but it's really creeped me out.   And don't ask why I bought a fake chicken, it was 99 cent, like you wouldn't do the same.   :]
20090222164330AALHHf7	Pets;Dogs	Would a Doberman Pinscher be suitable for this situation?	Family of three. Two adults (dad and step mom) and a daughter. And our own house. The daughter is 14 and home schooled, because of her modeling career that she is working on. But still has lots of free time. She just moved in with us last year from her mom's. When she was with her mom she's had a pug, a boxer and a husky/german shepherd mix. She also has a snake currently. We have frequent visitors along with her friends. Step mom works the mornings, and dad works from noon to eight. But we're a family that likes to travel, go out and do stuff. And we'll also be living on the beaches in Florida. We've all done research on the breed, but majority of the knowledge is balled up inside the teenager, she's done the most research. We feel she's responsible. And a few of our friends [the adults] have friends who have/had this breed of dog.         Ect.    Opinions or tips?

Until we adopted her, she had lived her whole life with 35 or so other dogs so she got hardly any real human contact. When we got her, she hid in the laundry room all day didn't socialize, like, EVER. Nowadays, she lets my brother and parents pet her but she still never really comes up to them on her own.   I want to get her trust. She will sniff my hand and take food out of it but shies away quickly if I try to pet her. Any ideas?

20090222180551AAEpiBd	Pets;Dogs	How do you feel about people walking their dogs on treadmills?	I'm curious because I asked HOW to do it last night and got some negative reactions, what's your opinion?   My reasons were...   1. My pup is only 10-12 weeks old and there are strays n my local area.   2. He hasn't had his last shot and as such isn't fully protected.   3. All local vets have told me to wait until he is older because the area I live in is really badly infested with ParvoVirus.   4. He needs exercise and I don't think throwing a ball or playing tug-a-war are really going to supply much.   5. My vet told me he needs to lose a little weight and since I can't  walk him he said to cut down his meals plenty, I called him this morning and he agreed it's a good idea.   6. My dog just went for a 20 minute walk on the treadmill and wagged his tail and ran to me the whole time and then we had a tumble and play after woulds. NO sadness, he enjoyed it (I still rewarded him... I gave him his lunch).      THANKS!

I had to fill out this very extensive application, so I thought they were very particular about their cats. So, I go to meet him today at his foster moms house. The stench of cat urine hit me at the front door. This was a very small house. She had over 30 cats in small cages. I noticed that my kitty had something going on with his eyes, but I didnt say anything because there was no way I would have left him there in those conditions. He smells horrible, just like a litter box. His eyes look horrible this evening, and he acts like he has never eaten! I wonder if the organization knows what kind of conditions these cats are in? He is going to my vet first thing in the morning, poor thing!

She seems happy, friendly and purrs often.  She grooms regularly. The only change was moving to a new house and changing her litter from normal gravel style to yesterdays news.  She seemed to adapt well. What can be the cause of her hair loss?

I have done some research and have found out that they are contagious. I was wondering if it is possible for horses over the age of 5 to get them. I have three other horses at my house (ages are 6, 10, and 22). Would it be possible for them to get them? Also, does anyone know of any remedies for them? I know they aren't causing her any pain but I would really like them gone soon. Help?   Thanks

20090222171918AA4iNmn	Pets;Dogs	My Boxer pup keeps spitting up?	The puppy spits up close to his feeding times. He does not act sick and he does not drink an excess, however I notice he drinks and eats extremely fast.  I took him to the vet this past week and the vet said this is normal as it is for a baby as well, However sometimes it is constant. I was just wondering if there is something I can do for him, or if anyone has experienced the same thing. How long will this last? thanks a million!

20090222172258AAe2j78	Pets;Cats	What can I feed a new born kitten? the cats milk products that exist are not available?	While leaving the neighborhood in my truck a cat jumped out the window suprising me and my wife. We were about 1/4 mile from the house. About a mile down the road we hear a kitten meowing. I stop and sure enough there was one newborn, but dry, kitten in the back of my truck.   I returned home and have left it on the porch in a shoe box with rags or insulation, in hopes that mom will find her way back.   I'd like to feed it but I read that cows milk and formula are no no's, but I live in Mexico and there are no cat formulas available.   What can I do?

20090222173226AA9fJKu	Pets;Cats	How can i get rid of our unwanted pet cat?	Our cat of 7 years has been having problems for the past few months- year. She bites wires, pees all over the carpet, poops and vomits too. We took her to the vet and she has no medical problems. She is neutered and partially declawed. Our last choice would be to kill her, so does anyone know of a website or place in New Jersey that takes in or does something with cats on a decent budget?   thank you.

20090222174204AACpVW6	Pets;Cats	Are there any better alternatives to scooping cat litter?	I am a husband of a pregnant wife.  I have now taken over the litter box cleaning duty.  We have two cats with their own litter boxes.  I must find a better way to manage their excrement.  Currently I am sifting through their litter like it is the California gold rush.  Only it is not gold, it is poop that I find.  There must be an easier, and cleaner way to handle this.  Any suggestions? We used a Litter Maid, automatic thing.  It broke however.  I am considering trying that again, just so I don't have to mess with it.  Can I use on Litter Maid for both cats?  Is there any other effective sifting method? Please help.  Thank you.

I think he was hit by a car. when he gets up it looks like his arm came apart from his shoulder and is just hanging in his skin. The side that the hurt shoulder is on feels more firm than usual. So, I don't know if maybe he has internal bleeding or maybe just an abscess. What should I do? My 7 year old is devastated.
20090222183058AAqPFwR	Pets;Rodents	Questions about hamsters and cages?	I got a Panda (Syrian) Hamster from PetSmart on Tuesday and she was sweet. Today I got a Winter White Siberian Dwarf Hamster who is also sweet, but I think she might be of the Pearl variate. I also saw about six Chinese Dwarf Hamsters that were sweet as well. So I was wondering, which would be best out of the three. They are all sweet so dont say "Dwarfs are bad, they bite". Well, my syrian has bit, but the dwarfs havent. Also could you post the pros and cons of both, it would be awesome if you could.      Also we recently got a Habitrail Ovo Pad with the Adventure Pack add-on. I noticed my winter white couldnt go up or down the tubes when going up so I had to lay it flat on the table. Should I keep this or trade it for a different cage? Which cage type is best? Any recomendations on which cage I should get?

20090222191142AASMIFc	Pets;Horses	How do you soak your hay in the summer/winter?	My gelding has heaves that is in complete remission. We have to soak his hay to keep his lungs fine.   A girl at my barn whose horses share hay with mine is worried that the hay will develop harmful mold if we soak it in the summer because of the heat. Does mold even grow that fast? Would it be a problem? Isn't a small amount of wet mold better than all the dry mold they inhale if we don't soak it?   And what do you do in the winter when the water freezes? If we just break it up is it still ok to feed it frozen? Not soaking it isn't really much of an option unless I pump him full of tri-hist and cross my fingers.      Thanks in advance!
20090222185859AA773jg	Pets;Dogs	What do you think of Contract Spay/neuter?  Do you think its always good?	I was reading something earlier that inspired this question:         I don't care if its shelter or breeder       So what do you think?      I think the contract spay/neuter is a good thing most of the time.      Saying that.....my dog was actually much younger than the shelter thought and she was just barely 5 months old when she had to be spayed.(Well when the contract was up) (They thought she was older but the vet confirmed she was much younger) So I had an issue with that but we did it anyway because we signed the contract. I don't like the idea of spaying so early.      Also I know of someone with a Frenchie that they lost because they found out the dog most likely wouldn't survive the neuter. The shelter demanded the dog back because he would not have him neutered......so he had it done but he indeed didn't make it through surgery.         I think there should be exceptions. In those cases.      BUt for the most part I think its necissary         We were given the option to have our vet do the spay or have the low cost shelter vet do it......we were going to have the shelter do it but we had had this dog since she was 10-11 weeks old. And the shelter was well....cut them open, sew them up, next dog.....and could not resesutate if something happened.      I left and took her to my vet       What do you think?   Are there any situations when you think it shouldn't be enforced?

My two Betta fish recently died this week, so I went out and got another one, though this one seems to be a baby almost as he's just a tiny little fella. So far he seems to be adapting okay, but I was wondering if he needs any special care due to his size.      I was also wondering what kind of other fish I could have in with him. Right now, I just have the Penn Plax Betta Double Tank Kit which is a small tank, I don't know the approximate size, but it is one that has a clear divider so you can allow the Betta to flare, then stop them from doing so with the blue divider that slides in.      Anyway, at the moment I just have my little Betta and was wondering if he can have a friend. And if I would need to buy more/different food and tank purifiers.
