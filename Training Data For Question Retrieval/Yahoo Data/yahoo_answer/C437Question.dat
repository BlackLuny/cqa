20090308092302AAS40WA	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Is this true about this technique to remove moles?	I have 2 moles on my face that I would like to have removed but I dont really like needles all that much to go to a dermatologist and have them remove the moles themselves (call me a chicken if you want). the moles dont rise from my face but looks like someone took a brown marker and dotted them on. I heard that if you apply apple cyder vinigar onto a mole that it will eventually go away (and I have had mine for as long as I can remember so there is a good chance that they are probably not cancerous). is the vinigat method true and how long does it take to do it before it removes the moles? thanks

I tried Ortho Max in twice in January, but now it's March and there are tons of sprouts.       Nothing will ever need to live where the alfalfa is growing (we plan to eventually put in a pool).      I researched it online, but most sites talked about waiting for a winter freeze. I live in Phoenix, so freezing is pretty much out of the equation altogether, plus, it's March now.

I bought a venus flytrap kit a couple of weeks ago, and it told me to put the baggie inside a cup of ice water and then store it in the fridge for 3 weeks. Well, i have been reading on the web that your supposed to put a piece of damp paper towel in with the seeds because the seeds need to be moist and wet. So i put tap water on the paper towel, and put it in with the seeds. Now I am finding out that your not supposed to use tap water. Well the seeds have been dampened in tap water for a couple days now. Is this going to kill my seeds or cause them not to grow?

After we put the tank on and added water, a small bit of water is coming from the left tank bolt. We took it apart, realigned the big rubber cyphon thing between the bolts, checked the rubber washer that you can see on the bolt inside the tank, and we retightened it until it was level. It still has a small leak from the bolt. I looked under the tank between the tank and the base of the toilet and could see a small bead of water forming. Am I missing parts to the bolt? Should there be a rubber washer under the tank too? The right side is set up the same way and is not leaking. What gives?      Thank you for your time!

So just now I removed the cotton mattress pad and just put my bed sheet over the foam. The problem is you can see through the sheet and see the foam and the holes it has for the temperature. It just doesn't look right. Is it supposed to be like that or should I buy a very thin pad to put on top of the foam? I'm so confused! What is the correct way to put a foam mattress pad on?

20090227114531AANLHjA	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	How do you clean a garbage disposal that doesn't work?	We just moved into a rental home and have just discovered that the garbage disposal doesn't work.  We are planning on removing it as soon as we get the cash to do so, but the people that lived in the home before didn't keep food from going down the drain. (At least we think it's food.)  But now that we have been running water down the drain and in the pipes it has started to smell a bit.  I've dumped gallons of bleach into it and boiling water and even some garbage disposal cleaner, but those don't seem to do much because you can't turn it on.  Anybody have any suggestions?

20090227115409AAjOpTQ	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Do all basements have little puddles in them?	(no flooding! just little puddles, about 12-24 inches) I am trying to buy a house in Michigan. Yes, It just rained/snowed a lot recently. I've seen 5 homes. Only 2 of the homes were dry (One was a slab/no basement!). Do all basements have a tiny wetness quality to them? or am I looking at the wrong houses? Incidentally, the dry house, was one of the least expensive ones (below SEV at $44,000 previously $60,000)!!!!  Yes, I am looking at modest houses , $69,000 or $60 ish. Is that bad?      I am in Michigan. All of the houses I viewed were actually sitting on TOP of hills! (not at the bottom of the hills!) One of the basements was probably a "Michigan basement" whatever that means. The other 3 basements were somewhat polished , with washers and dryers in the basement, elect. and such.       Thank you for your answer! I'm puzzled by the sheer number of wet basements. The houses tend to be musty. Is that bad?? I do not see mold. Just "musty" smells...
