RPt5Mdi6aa	phantom Darkness if you have at least one of each card in only one form then about $650 and if you have every card in every form (all ultimate rares in ultimate and their regular holo) then about $800 or $700 somewhere between there<br>  <br>  as for Rise of Destiny i don't remember if i find out I'll email you|`|DQyHwIeiaa	Assuming oyu have all the secret rares of the phantom darkness (Dark armed dragon and the works) you can easily sell it for about 500$ or maybe more, you can check ebay to see as well.<br>  <br>  Rise of destiny will probably be less since its not as popular of a set|`|RCUWRan2aa	Older Sets cost roughly $150 - $200 per set, now for the Phantom Darkness set, $500 would be fair now that DAD got a price hit. Yubel and the Dark Archetyphe isn't that much of a price, (except Creator and Zerato) however Allure still has a $30 value.

wAiVxAKNaa	In PvP worlds, yes, you are still able to kill monsters and guards and get good drops. However, places like God Wars and other places with high level bosses are not accessible in PvP worlds. <br>  <br>  I do not recommend trying to fight monsters on PvP worlds, as many players camp out in areas specifically to target people killing monsters in PvP worlds.

WkLJI40baa	This is very weak and the bannete ex is illegal. Get rid of Shaymin, no reason to have 6 leaf energies to power up one basic grass card. You need some stronger cards, you have too many basic or stage one cards.<br>  <br>  The easy way to tell if a card is illegal is look at the weakness. If it just has a symbol without any numbers beside it they are too old to use in a tournament. <br>  <br>  My advice is to take all your cards to where they hold the tournaments and others will help you to create a better deck.

vABufZ1Laa	the UAV jammer only takes effect when they call in UAV. What will be the point of having a silencer if UAV jammer did work like this. U need the silencer so u wont be seen when u fire your weapon. If u have both the UAV jammer and a silencer then practically your always invisible on their radar.!|`|AhKhQquEaa	it depends on how you play, if you want to truly be stealthy then UAV jammer and a silencer are a way to go along with 3 flash grenades and extreme conditioning. Then use any SMG you prefer and you can run very fast, blind enemies, be a ghost on a radar, and shoot very fast. I use that class with a silenced mp5 and nobody can find me and its very easy to evade people and set up traps for them around the corner|`|jvoXI6hOaa	no...you will not show up on the radar under ANY conditions|`|oGvtK5PPaa	yes you will. uav jammer only keeps you hidden when the opponent uses uav

y8DHR7cmaa	Well, if you can wait until June 2nd to get Sims 3 then you might as well just wait and get that.<br>  To be honest it's probably a bit of a waste to get lots of expansions now just to fill your time until June.<br>  I suppose you could get maybe one to fill your time, but anymore and it'll be a waste if you're not planning to play Sims 2 anymore.|`|gu3x37Muaa	It depends of the expansions. The Sims 2 Seasons is the most valuable expansion to my eyes, as it adds weather.<br>  <br>  And Sims 3 is going to ask for a better computer than Sims 2, so maybe it won't play on your computer.|`|wSKK4OEuaa	Sims 2 is great but Sims 3 looks even better wait for sims 3 because it is coming out in june and will be ten times better that sims 2|`|048nOVTQaa	i suggest waiting for the sims 3 because i have nearly all the expansion packs and decided not to buy sims 3 for the fact that all those expansion packs are worth ￡100 together and that would be wasting money maybe if you buy sims 3 and it is not how you expected buy a couple of expansion packs for the sims 2 :)|`|cmoGATT9aa	i'm in the same situation.<br>  i'm gunna wait for the sims 3.<br>  it's not that far away i guess.

stmWsr70aa	Hello there!<br>  <br>  With downloading furniture for the Sims 2, sites like sims2.com or modthesims2 has great furniture as well as other downloads available.<br>  Depending on whether you are using Vista or an XP, finding the sims 2 download folder is a simple process and if you click on My Computer --> C: drive, than click search, type in downloads, and I'm pretty sure you'll find what your looking for. I do believe both Sims 2 and Modthesims2 need accounts to download the custom content, but that I can't give you 100 percent on.<br>  <br>  As for creating clothes and hair for newborns,  you can only mess with the diaper. Some people get creative and turn the diaper into little baby clothes, but that's harder than a simple body moderation in bodyshop, which comes along with downloading the Sims 2. People work with the meshes, and its a tricky process. You can search the topic up more on google or something, I can't be much of service. Modthesims 2 though has great newborn baby clothes. Sometimes we wish Maxis would've put a whole stuff pack to newborns, right?<br>  <br>  Hope you find what your looking for.|`|yW0rosIaaa	newborn babies- change edit their diapers.<br>  install it as a body install or something that looks like the bodyshop icon|`|ExQC8PuDaa	go here - www.modthesims2.com everything is high quality and free!<br>  you may get addicted and end up with loads of stuff for your sims though :) <br>  enjoy!|`|ZSPXhiwpaa	You can download furniture for free and very quickly from the exchange or the Sims 2 website. There are other websites to get furniture on, such as Mod the Sims 2. The designs have more variety and there is a larger range of objects for the game, however it can make your game run very slowly and sometimes it is difficult to get the objects into the game. As for clothes and hair for newborns that is pretty much impossible on the Sims 2 website, the diapers can be customizable and some creators on the Mod the Sims 2 website have done this but the designs are slightly strange and can bug up the computer<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|VRuL0rUvaa	go to modthesims2.com they've got really great downloads and tutorial also plz go here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlzDigpWT8yty0F2cCz8zajsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307013831AA8WyuZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

8KWwoRefaa	It honestly depends on which you like. If you are a fan of shooter games with a plot and lots of action, then Resident Evil 5 is the game for you. I've played the demo for the 360 and the games looks epic. If you prefer a game with an awesome storyline, creepy rpg, and enjoy the previous games layout; then by all means get Silent Hill 5. I've played the whole game and it's just awesome.

It does have some benefits though:<br>  <br>  -Its free and faster than the old DS browser.<br>  -Uses a full dedicated Opera browser (not the crappy mobile phone ones)<br>  <br>  The DSi has twice the CPU speed and 4x more RAM than the DS lite, meaning better performance.<br>  According to other reviews, the stylus navigation works fine<br>  <br>  In general terms, its worth the free download<br>  <br>  heres a comparison video:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrzV1zsBSOA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrzV1zsBS...</a>|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	It's the one that's already in use on the DS. It's Opera, java & flash heavy sites won't work good, and you'll get mobile versions of other sites (Myspace, Hotmail).

rMl79N5faa	Your mp3's need to be in the "My Documents/My Music" folder for your 360 to "see" them. Go to your PC and copy a couple of mp3's in your My Music folder. Try to play them again through your 360.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work.  On the 360, see if there is a way to change or add a path to the scanned music folders. I haven't done it with the new NXE interface so I can't tell you exactly how to do this, but poke around a while. Hopefully it is easier to find than with the old Xbox dashboard.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	Hit the big center button on the controller which brings up that smaller menu... scroll over to the media tab... there will be a music option there... choose pc... your playlist should be there.

9BIZ7eFMaa	No. Completely different. Burst Limit uses the fighting engine from the old Budokai series of games. Budokai and Burst Limit are more of a traditional fighting game whereas Budokai Tenkaichi is meant as a DBZ simulator.<br>  <br>  You might as well try the free demo and see if you like it.
qMsIzFLeaa	LOL heck no!! It is technically against the rules of the game but jagex is stupid to think that people would report somebody for that, cos nobody does. I have like three gfs on runescape LOL<br>  U just need to be careful to give out TOO much personal info. Although giving any is against the rules giving out like ur real first name and the country u live in I think is ok and helps personalize the "relationship" (LOL) a little more.<br>  <br>  In the end it's up to u!!!<br>  Good much with runescape!!|`|R8RVJ0Y1aa	Can I just say.... if you are resorting to getting an online girlfriend... you really need to get out more.<br>  <br>  Do you love your girlfriend?<br>  Do you 'love' your online girlfriend?<br>  Do you mind getting caught by your real life girlfriend?<br>  <br>  Married couples have actually DIVORCED over online girlfriends that they discovered their partners had.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your real life girlfriend, I suggest you ditch the online girlfriend, lay off the online games and spend some quality time with your real life girlfriend.|`|HPLGxSNvaa	If you really love your real gf, you wouldnt have a online one, plus its totally pointles.

So what she said means she likes you. Wherever you took her must have been good keep taking her.
2fqXT9W6aa	Personally, I'm not going to buy one because it's not got a GBA slot - no importing Pokemon or Guitar Hero...<br>  <br>  It can't connect to the internet everywhere, just where there's an access point (which is most places anyway) like the normal DS. It can connect to WiFi on games, and it also has a built in web browser to surf the internet. It also has a shop to download new games with Nintendo Points, like the Virtual Console on the Wii.
DfPyyDssaa	CARLOS MINI-QUEST<br>  -------------------<br>  You will start out in the chapel save room, so exit it, and go into the<br>  Library. Head through the green door, and avoid the spiders here, and<br>  go through the door at the end. In this room (with the 3 statues and<br>  3 clocks), head into the back room, and push the large bell out of<br>  the doorway.<br>  <br>  <br>  Outside here, go down the the right side, and head into the Hospital, and<br>  have your Assualt Rifle ready for action. Right when you enter the main room,<br>  you will meet two Hunters. Blast them with your Assualt Rifle, then get<br>  the Red Herbs, then go into the room to the right of the entrance, which<br>  is a save room. Save your game, then search this area for some easy Ammo.<br>  Exit through the next door, and get the Handgun Bullets from inside the<br>  Locker, the Director's Diary, the Hospital Map on the wall, the Blue<br>  Herb, and the Tape Recorder from the desk. Now take the elevator to the 4F<br>  (you have to use the Tape Recorder on the panel next to it first).<br>  <br>  <br>  At the 4F, exit the elevator, and head out into the hallway, and into the<br>  next hallway, near the red light on the wall. Go into the first room you<br>  come across in this hallway. Inside here, check to see where the stand is<br>  located in one of the corners. Take the note the dead doctor is holding,<br>  then get the Green Herbs near the bed. Exit the room, and head to the left<br>  and through the hallway, and into the large room at the end of the hallway<br>  that leads to the elevator.<br>  <br>  <br>  In this room, get the Photo D, and then take the Sickroom Key from the<br>  counter. Exit and head down the other hallway and go to the other door<br>  you didn't go through yet. Use the Sickroom Key to unlock the door. Inside,<br>  push the stand to the same location as the other stand was in the other<br>  room next to this one. If you did it right, a safe will be un-cloaked.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read that slip that you got from the dead doctor to get a 3-digit code. Use<br>  that code on the safe to unlock it to get the Vaccine Base. Now go back to<br>  the elevator, and ride it to B3.<br>  <br>  <br>  Exit the elevator, and go through the door at the very end of the hallway.<br>  In here, blast the Hunter, then shoot the explosive charge on the wall near<br>  the other Hunter behind the shelves. Now leave this room through the other<br>  door and head into the next room. Grab the Medium Base from the counter.<br>  Also, make sure you get the Medical Instruction Manual too. Place the Medium<br>  Base into the Synthesizer then switch the electric power supply on.<br>  Now once again, use the Synthesizer to solve the Synthesizer puzzle:<br>  <br>   ________________________<br>  |                        |<br>  | HOW TO SOLVE           |<br>  |________________________|<br>  |                        |<br>  | 1) Press "I"           |<br>  |                        |<br>  | 2) Press "III"         |<br>  |                        |<br>  | 3) Press "A"           |<br>  |                        |<br>  |________________________|<br>  <br>  <br>  Now after solving it, you will get the Vaccine Medium. Combine it with the<br>  Vaccine Base to get the Vaccine that cures the T-Virus! Now leave the room<br>  and make sure you run from the Hunters that escape as you leave. In the<br>  hallway, some Hunters will come out and attack. Blast them with everything<br>  you got, then take the elevator to 1F. Carlos will spot a bomb...set for<br>  60 seconds! Time to run...fast.<br>  <br>  <br>  After you exit the building, it blows up...oh well. Now just make your way<br>  back to the Clock Tower, and to the Chapel and give the Vaccine to Jill<br>  to save her...but along the way, you meet Nemesis. But he won't attack you.<br>  He's going for Jill. Shoot him some, then run past him and get to the<br>  Chapel fast. Give Jill the Vaccine.|`|9BIZ7eFMaa	You wont ever need a lock pick when playing as Carlos. As far as I remember to make the antidote you first need to go to 4th floor and in 1 of the room there's a cabinet in the middle of the room. Move the cabinet to the correct corner of the room and you'll get the first part of the antidote.<br>  <br>  Next go to floor B1 and find a room with 2 hunters in tubes. In that room you'll find the base medium and there's a puzzle near there in which you have to move some levers. After you've done that puzzle combine all the antidote related items and you're done.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Sorry I don't know that game<br>  and try YouTube it or goggling it.
zmapclE1aa	No you have too many Psychic,3! When you come up against the Psychic guy he will trash you. <br>  I suggest completely remodeling your team or even starting again. If you do choose to do this have:<br>  <br>  Infernape<br>  Gengar<br>  Alakasam<br>  Staraptor<br>  Snorlax<br>  Gyarados<br>  <br>  I had that team and i challenged them all at level 50-53 and i only had to use a couple of revives and hyper potions but i did it first time.<br>  Hope i helped >;]|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Poor training will always lead to a loss. You never trained an in-game team and like many idiots here are relying upon legendaries, at a low level I might add to try and fill the gaps. You are a pathetic trainer with no skill and no measure of how to play the game properly.<br>  <br>  Yes I'm being harsh but you didn't play the game. I had a six member team by the time I had my third badge. Using legendaries in my in-game team was below me. My entire in-game team were regular pokemon caught early on and raises. All beyond lvl. 60 when I took on the elite four.<br>  <br>  Torterra<br>  starpator<br>  luxray<br>  floatzel<br>  bronzong<br>  rapidash<br>  <br>  All over lvl. 60, My pokemon were beyond your palkias level before I climbed mt. coronet to see dailga.|`|JFjcLsRDaa	its fine a little more training would be good|`|QJwaagGWaa	Sadly, this is not a good team. Three Psychics is not good, plus add Azelf's horrible defenses and Mesprit's worthlessness and you are out of luck. You do not have to start all over, but you need to remodel your team. Plus where is your starter pokemon? He is one of the best pokemon you are given and it is not on your team? If you go to challenge the Elite Four with THOSE pokemon, you are going to get owned sometime by the time you fight the Psychic Elite Member. I am sorry but this is not a good team, dont expect for Palkia to carry out the team, because if you do and Palkia faints in a battle what are you going to do? Just keep on reviving it? No. It wont work like that. And even if you do train in Victory Road with those pokemon, it wont get you anywhere. You definately need a ghost pokemon, and dont try to teach Azelf or Mesprit or Uxie a ghost attack, it wont work. I am sorry but lets see how far you can go with those pokemon......|`|w4qS66aqaa	train just a little more to like 60 ?
oK57gmbDaa	Press X then Save|`|aSm45O8Baa	if you're just starting and you're using a used game then you need to erase the old game in order to save BEFORE you start playing. sadly i had to learn this the hard way... <br>  <br>  in order to erase the game you must be on the title page and then hit start, select, and the right and left buttons on the back of your ds. if i got the combination wrong it should tell you when you try to start another game.<br>  <br>  I would also like to point out that you said restart the game. if you hit new game then you won't be playing on your last save. you will be starting a new game. in order to continue a game you must hit continue. <br>  <br>  hope you figure it out
KjR1fFNraa	I would suggest u a PS3 as it has games like Resistance 1 & Resistance 2 & above all of them KILLZONE 2 for FPS'.<br>  <br>  If u like action adventure then ofcourse PS3 has Uncharted:Drake's Fortune (which out of all the games i have is the best one for me) and its sequel is coming too i.e. Uncharted 2:Among  Thieves.<br>  <br>  Next is RPG. Although i don't know much about RPG's but one name i'll suggest u is Fallout 3. It has won many GOTY's.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for XBOX 360 , Halo series & L4D(Left for Dead) are two main FPS games i'll suggest you.<br>  <br>  And Call of Duty 4 and Call of Duty: World At War  are a must buy if u buy any of these consoles.|`|bVUIEwyWaa	games for both:<br>  COD5<br>  COD4<br>  <br>  games for xbox only:<br>  <br>  HALO 1/2/3<br>  <br>  games for ps3 only:<br>  <br>  RESISTANCE1<br>  RESISTANCE2<br>  KILLZONE 3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS: cod 4/5 in my oppinion are the best games anyway followed by halo, i dont realy enjoy any of the ps3 games as much and you get gears of war too with xbox (3rd person) but i must admit that if u have a good tv, the difference in graphics between ps3 and xbox becomes apparent, ps3 is better... but more expensive<br>  <br>  so its up to you:<br>  <br>  XBOX:<br>  more/better games<br>  cheaper<br>  worse graphics<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  worse games<br>  more expensive<br>  better graphics<br>  <br>  all of this is my oppinion though so... no flamers plz? :p|`|fIzPCvDzaa	I've had both consoles and now settled with the PS3. Don't get me wrong both are great consoles and can't say a bad thing about either one.<br>  <br>  As for FPS yes you can most definitely play it on a console and millions of people do it so no problem finding a match. Also both PS3 and 360 have advanced ranking system which makes it even that more fun and challenging to play online. Both support friends and invites and most games have clan options.<br>  <br>  As for which console to choose... Well PS3 have some great exclusives that you can only get for PS3. The 360 of course also have some, but in my opinion PS3 has the best ones. <br>  <br>  Just to name some for PS3: Killzone 2, deep online play amazing amazing and again amazing graphics, it's one of the most hyped games of 2009. Also you have the Tactical Realistic military shooter Socom Confrontation which makes you feel you're really in a war, and not to forget Metal Gear Solid a rock solid game you can't miss.<br>  <br>  Just one more reason to buy PS3, the online gaming community is free as opposed to Xbox Live which costs money. I know people say live is much better and yes i agree but PS3's Network is starting to be just as good with their latest updates and rumors are leaked about the next update which will top Live.<br>  <br>  .... Oh and yes with PS3 you'll get the best Blue-Ray player on the market, hell you can even use it as a HD recorder to Record your tv programs.<br>  <br>  Hope you can use the guide lines.
v5uaWumvaa	Right, for a start it sounds like you want a zombie deck, but I would probably bulk it out by adding some fiends.<br>  Definitely keep Red eyes zombie, paladin cursed, mal mech, ryu kokki, pat darkness. Just gp through the cards, and all the cards you have and look at the effects. Get quite a few with effects applying specifically to sombies. e.g. Pyramid turtle, zombie master etc.<br>  Put 2 or 3 field cards that apply to both zombies and dark attributes. e.g. Yami, wasteland etc. Zombie world is a definite. Make sure you have a few cards that revive e.g. Monster reborn, monster reincarnation. etc. Get some equips, spell/trap destroyers, pots/jars of greed,change of heart, brain control, graceful charity. Just use magic and traps to make up to your 40/50.Don't use more than 10 traps, as a rule. Get things like trap hole, 7 tools etc. Just the basics.<br>  Hope this has helped|`|TqeuXRLDaa	buy crossroads of choas there is some zombies there and buy special edition crossroads of choas and when its out buy crimson crisis special edition wait for gold series 2 and try get a dark armed dragon buy a starter deck with monster reborn or/and sangan in it.<br>  well just check some of the cards on www.greylight.co.uk|`|iENoAA84aa	Buy another zombie world structure deck.....you can make a pretty strong dueling deck from 2.

dMub9ipOaa	Depends on the FF games.  If it were FFX and FF12 I'd say it was a fair price but if it was FFX and FFX2 I'd say that's too much.  Most of those games are about 10-20 bucks used but use your best judgement.  The least you're probably going to spend is 30 bucks and that's IF you shop around but if you want to save yourself from having to run around town looking for the best deal spending 40 bucks isn't too bad either.|`|zQSnNBj1aa	are all the games together $40 if they are then that's a massive deal have you thought about 2nd hand i buy allot of games 2nd hand and they play fine but i suggest you do<br>  <br>  JB hi fi is a really good games retailer that gets tons of 2nd hand and you might find that they have an even better deal than EB does and then you could get it cheaper with the stores "seen it cheaper well match it or beat it" guarantee so look around for it you might find some allot cheaper

fub5QVFfaa	There are no requirements in the GBA game, except that you need more than 6 pokemon to do the transfer.<br>  On the Diamond, you need to complete your sonoh dex. This isnt as bad as it sounds, all it means is SEE every sinoh pokemon. Just battle every trainer you meet and capture all you feel like and you will be fine. HOWEVER, you will need to beat the elite 4+Champion to get the last few pokemon.<br>  Once you do all that you SHOULD only need Palkia. Simply go to Celestic town and talk to the elder. She will show you a picture, adding Palkia. Then talk to Prof Rowan and oak will walk in and update your pokedex. You then go to the end of route 221. There will be a building to enter. Talk to the guy there, save and quit. There will now be an option on the start up menu to "migrate" from ruby. Pick your 6 to migrate (warning: They can't go back and you will need to catch them in a surprisingly easy process in DIamond). Once you pick the 6, go into diamond, talk to the dude in the building again. He will put you into the catching game. Just run randomly through the grass and water (Water only if you have water pokemon migrate). The pokemon vary depending on the position of the grass (Mountain grass different to forrest grass, etc). When you encounter a pokemon, just throw a park ball at it and its yours again. (Park balls are like master balls, they 100% capture). Once all 6 are caught, say you want to keep the pokemon and the guy will put them in your PC. You now have migrated to Diamond.<br>  You do NOT need to unlock your pokemon on a GBA. It doesn't matter where you get your ruby pokemon, but you must complete the requirements to migrate.|`|DpAkYZaqaa	First beat the Elite 4 to unlock Pal Park. Then catch all the pokemon in Sinnoh. Then talk to Rowan and you unlock Pal Park. Save and turn off your game. Then insert the gba game into the gba slot. Put the pokemon you want to transfer into a box. Then go to your DS game but don't continue your game yet. Go down and select Migrate pokemon instead. Choose the Pokemon you want to transfer. Then continue your game and talk to the person blocking the path to the Park. You go into the park. Where your pokemon will be in the park depends on what pokemon they are.

In order to transfer to Diamond though, you will need to have the National Dex which you get by at least seeing (not catching as with past games) all 150 Pokemon native to the Sinnoh region, which can be done by simply battling trainers in the game.<br>  Then you will need to have collected all 8 badges and beaten the Elite 4 then visit Rowan in his lab.<br>  Rowan gives you the National Dex, Oak gives you the PokeRadar.<br>  Next, you will need to visit the PalPark (quite a long walk the first time, but you can fly there afterwards).<br>  After you unlock the PalPark, you will get the option at the Continue screen to Migrate from XXXX, the X's representing the version in the GBA slot. All 6 (and only 6) pokemon that you want to transfer must be in a PC box and cannot be sent back. The pokemon that you transfer can  be any that you have caught/traded/hacked into the game. As long as its in a box, you can send it.

66874a788ece12b1d2f60860e0ae8cc1aa	I would do it for 20 mins...check the premo areas and see if they are done(assuming you did not blend all the way but left it "swirly"...and know where the premo area is)...if the premo area has not cured and the sculpey III area looks ok,  i would go another 5 mins and check again...then another 5 mins...i would first do a test run/bake with a little blended to see what happens......this is ALL subject to the warnings on the Sculpey wrapper....I know on Fimo it warns of toxic fumes omitting if baked too long or at a higher temp than recommended....if such a label exists i wouldn't go past the 20 mins.....(the extra five i do not think would be a problem due to ovens heating differences).....good luck and have fun!|`|5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	First, some background:<br>  Those two polymer clays are not very much alike even though they're manufactured by the same company (Premo was created to the specifications of a clayer, not to Polyform's specifications, so it's a much better clay).<br>  <br>  The main reason you'll see the lower time for Sculpey III (or for SuperSculpey, or original Sculpey) is because those clays darken very easily (much more easily than any other lines), so Polyform just hopes you can get away with a shorter baking time.  That could result in clay that's not *completely* polymerized but they figure you won't use the objects long enough to notice (and there's no way to tell just by looking whether the clay is polymerized all the way to the middle since it hardens from the outside in... if it's very underbaked, it might crumble after time though).  <br>  <br>  Btw, the baking times are also dependent on the thickness of the clay at it's thickest point, and actually is 275 (or whatever the recommended temp is for a particular line) per 1/4" of thickness.  Generally, a piece of clay that's 3/4" thick or so though will do fine at 30 minutes as long as the temperature is high enough**.  Baking longer always makes any polymer clay stronger though.<br>  <br>  **It's *essential* to have a cheapie oven thermometer when curing polymer clays becuase ovens often don't heat to the temp indicated on their dials.<br>  <br>  As for mixing brands together, the general rule is that the baking temp and time will be calculated by the amount of each clay used.<br>  <br>  You can get around some of these baking problems (especially for those Sculpeys and for any thin areas in a piece--which will darken more quickly too), by protecting the clay so that the temp that actually reaches it won't go over the recommended temp.  That means doing something to "partially enclose" the item during baking, or even to "completely-enclose" it.  <br>  The simplest way to do the first one is to drape a damp paper towel over the piece in the oven or to "tent" it with aluminum foil (not touching the piece), and some examples of completely enclosing would be baking under a box or inside a pile of baking soda or wrapped with cotton fabric or batting, etc.<br>  <br>  You can read all about baking polymer clay, and many more details on all the things I mentioned plus more if you're interested, on this page of my online polymer clay encyclopedia:<br>  <a href="http://glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm" rel="nofollow">http://glassattic.com/polymer/baking.htm</a><br>  <br>  P.S.  Premo is a much stronger clay line than Sculpey III, SuperSculpey (flesh), or original Sculpey btw, but that's noticeable mostly in *thin* or projecting baked areas of the Sculpeys (which will break easily, rather than just bend like the stronger lines).<br>  <br>  And P.P.S., if you want to read a lot of stuff about creating your own colors with polymer clay (or coloring it with other things), check out this page there too:<br>  <a href="http://glassattic.com/polymer/color.htm" rel="nofollow">http://glassattic.com/polymer/color.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  HTH,<br>  <br>  Diane B.

j6MvCr6Naa	The average score for Halo Wars is 82% as can be seen here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  Halo Wars is still a good game though. If you're a big Halo fan like me you would be pleased be to see that the graphics, sound, and story are very much like the Halo trilogy. The cut scenes are very well done, the story is interesting and everything looks, moves and sounds like a Halo game except there is one big problem.<br>  <br>  The problem is the actual gameplay and gameplay is the most important part of a game. This is a strategy game and the problem is that to finish the game you don't need to use any starategy whatsoever. You can just blast through the entire game without putting any though into what you're doing which isn't a lot of fun, making the game very simple.<br>  <br>  So it's a pretty good game, but really not worth your money.|`|fQkihSHZaa	Its no command and conquer!|`|7fZ6tpuBaa	I reckon it's just a rehash of the classic age of empires formula as with most of the microsoft developed RTS games: battle fr middle earth, star wars battlefront etc...<br>  Might be good if they added something new but apart from the fact that its Halo I can't see the difference|`|3LcIWgBFaa	Meh, I have the demo on my Xbox 360.

YQfZvLnNaa	I would use a spray adhesive on the back of the dried flowers, arrange them on the paper and allow it to dry....about 1/2 hour.  Then, I would apply a layer of puzzle coat.  Puzzle coat is meant to use on paper and cardboard and it seals the pieces together, so I would think it would do the same with your flowers.  Another idea for the finish would be a product called Ceramicoat.  It gives a clear porcelain finish and is sprayed on.|`|78971aa9763be1ffb990e2fe1809e2caaa	It really kind of depends on what you are planning to do with it.  Modge Podge might work, but so might just plain Elmer's white glue (it dries clear and is both eco friendly and inexpensive).  Even laminating might be an option.  Heat lamination would work if the dried flowers are flat enough, or you can get clear adhesive laminating sheets.|`|10df4acdc40e62d2abc6ee21093aaa4faa	If the flowers are really flat, then something like puzzle coat might work. Try it first.  Otherwise, a spray polyurethane might work too.<br>  <br>  If the flowers are raised, all the coating in the world won't work. <br>  <br>  Problem is, there is only so much you can do to keep dried flowers from coming off, short of sealing under plastic or glass|`|AA10068488	Maybe Mod Podge
leZ8Ld5Raa	You could paint a tree on your wall, and hang pictures of your family from it, starting in the center with the parents or grand parents and working out with the next generations|`|78971aa9763be1ffb990e2fe1809e2caaa	If you have pictures of the whole family, here's a very fun and creative idea.  Have the photo on one side, the name and information on the other side.  You then hang them similar to a windchime.  Have a bar (wood or heavy wire works well) at the top.  Attach the oldest generation (Grandma and Grandpa) to it by a string or chain (so the pictures can be rotated to see both sides).  From that level will hang another bar from which each of their children would be attached (also dangling).  Link each child to their spouse with a small bar (popsicle stick size?) and then another bar below each of them for the next generation.  Make sure each picture can be turned, so that you can see the picture and the information.  Use large pictures at the top and decrease in size at each level.  It turns out very cool.  The hardest part of it is keeping the generational bars in balance.  =]  Good luck with your project!|`|ZECOBGlPaa	try a sculpture or 3-D tree with tags that hang from the branches with the names of your family members.

c5ScseTdaa	Could be a number of things:<br>  <br>  1. Your operating system on the XP machine is wonky.  No easy fix for this one that can be diagnosed remotely, so most people will simply suggest the heavy-handed "reformat your hard drive and reinstall XP."  A bit much, but if the issue is software that will take care of it.<br>  <br>  2.  Your disk is slightly scratched and the newer DVD reader in the vista machine has an easier time reading the slightly damaged disk.<br>  <br>  3.  Your optical drive in the XP machine is a little off and reads some disks but not others.  Sounds stupid, but it happens.  The CD and DVD readers use different lasers, so you may even find that you can read one disk type and not the other.<br>  <br>  4.  Are your original sims disks DVDs or CDs?  What about the expansion disks?  If you only have a CD reader in the older machine, it won't read DVDs.<br>  <br>  In the case of 2, 3, or 4, you can borrow an external DVD drive or install a new internal drive for about $25.

RjGtp41Zaa	In the Halo series, I just LOVE the Covenant so I use them. My favorite leader is the Prophet of Regret cuz he gotz the Cleansing Beam. He has to be the most powerful leader cuz his attack hits air and ground units. Ok, now for my strategy (with Cove, leader Prophet)<br>  <br>  1a. Build 2 Warehouses<br>  1b. While ^^^ are bulding, use ur ghost to look for resources.<br>  2. Build Temple<br>  3. Build Hall<br>  4. Upgrade Factories<br>  5. Build an army of grunts (8-10)<br>  6a. Upgrade Peons<br>  6b. Do more research at the temple (Age of Doubt)<br>  7. Make more grunts and a couple Hunters<br>  8. Add turrets to your base (one anti-air, one anti-vehicle)<br>  9a. Build a Factory<br>  9b. Upgrade to a Citidal<br>  10. Build a Summit<br>  11. Build 2 Wraiths along with 4-6 ghosts<br>  12. Build a couple Vampires and mabey a couple Engineers<br>  13. Expand to a new base (may have to fight) [Bring the Prophet]<br>  14. Use the new base for Warehouses and one Hall<br>  15. Don't upgrade the base to a Citidal (only upgrade it once)<br>  16. Make about 3 warehouses on the new base and upgrade them.<br>  17. Make an army at both bases<br>  18. Research Followers at the Temple<br>  19. Research Age of Reclaimation at the Temple<br>  20. Make armies BIG<br>  21. Attack with full force, making sure your Prophet does some work<br>  22. Use your Y button whenever possible<br>  23. DESTROY THE FILTHY HUMANS!!!!<br>  <br>  Ok so there are lots of things that you wanna do in between what I mentioned. Always build units and always research whatever you want, just make sure you have a good enough army before you wait for supplies to upgrade or research. And whenever possible, pick up those resources scattered around. They are useful at times.

VyfVTArwaa	The PlayStation 3 does not in itself really "suck".  The console in itself is very decent hardware-wise, and having the ability to play Blu-Ray movies is a good bonus.  The main flaw, from what I understand, is that it does not offer as wide a selection of big game titles, like the Xbox 360, and does not offer as innovative a playing style as the Wii.  That seems to be the main reason why I understand that the majority of gamers shy away from the PS3 in favour of the other major consoles out right now.  When it was first released it's hefty price tag also hurt it's popularity, but that isn't quite so much of an issue now.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! ;)|`|Npi4QR7Maa	it doesnt

A tie-in to an activity that they are associated with?  <br>  <br>  If it is like most camps that I am familiar with, you should consider the aspects of your personality that you would like to showcase.  I had a counselor one year in summer camp that was known as "Chief" because she was very tall and physically imposing, as well as being 1/4 Cherokee Indian.  <br>  <br>  When I was a counselor, I was known as "Pastel" because I was in charge of the Art Cabin.  One of the "Cabin Moms" was known as "Bubbles" because that described her cheerful personality perfectly (she also wore a t-shirt with the blue Power Puff Girl on it).  Another went by "Meadow Lark" because she loves to sing.<br>  <br>  What do you want the campers to know/remember about you?

nrrsG5oiaa	Well, Space Marines are "easy" in the fact that they're very easy to learn since its pretty much 4's across the board (WS, BS, S, T).  They have good leadership, an awesome armor save (3+), good weapons, and are fun and relatively easy to assemble and paint.  I've run a Space Marines army since I first started playing in 2003, repainted them twice, and I keep coming back to them.  If you've already got the models for them, then I'd suggest trying them out more and seeing if you like playing them.<br>  <br>  If you can find a friendly opponent, they might be able to let you proxy (use a model to "count as" something else) or even borrow different armies, that way you can try out a few armies.  I'm sure you've heard it all before, but the quick rundown on some of the major armies:<br>  <br>  Space Marines - tough & elite force that are good at pretty much anything they do; they cost more in points, but you know where it goes when they make it through situations others don't.<br>  <br>  Chaos Marines - the "bad guys;" they ally themselves with evil & dark forces that warp their bodies and minds.  They use daemon allies and power to augment their already tough Space Marine roots.<br>  <br>  Tau - the alien for fighting for "the greater good," they specialize in ranged warfare.  They have a very anime/manga look to them because of their battlesuits.  They've got powerful technology, but they're pretty fragile in close combat.<br>  <br>  Tyranids - an alien race controlled by a hive-mind, they're aliens who just want to devour everyone and everything. They can swarm the board with lots of models and have some huge monsters as well.<br>  <br>  Imperial Guard - basically the main Imperial forces, they can field a lot of tanks and armour, but their main forces are weak ground troops.  Lots of range and lots of vehicles are typical here.<br>  <br>  Witch Hunters/Demon Hunters - more of the Imperial stuff here, they use Imperial allies led by ruthless inquisitors.  They employ some tough assassins in there as well.  Witch Hunters are mainly an all female force nicknamed the Sisters of Battle; basically female Space Marines (they're all Collectors Range models and cost a little more than most armies, just FYI).<br>  <br>  Eldar - specialize in quick & deadly strikes.  They use technology and psychic powers to deliver a fast & strong punch, but they can get a little soft in close aside from the crazy Harlequins they can field.<br>  <br>  Dark Eldar - same as regular Eldar, but they're evil slavers who are even more ruthless.<br>  <br>  Orks - lots and lots of green.  Not high tech, but they're damn tough and persistant.  "WAAAAAAAGH!!!"<br>  <br>  Necrons - undead robots that recently awakened from their millenia-long slumber to take back the universe.  They have a cool "we'll be back" rule where some of them have a chance to come back to life after they get taken down in combat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this will help a bit, but I think if you pop into your local hobby shop, they can help you out a little more and you can get some hands on info about the armies.|`|hfDnc81Raa	blood angels

RjGtp41Zaa	The easiest way to get an overkill is in a Lone Wolves swords match. Make sure you get into a battle at the right time (sometimes it happens coincidentally) but when enemies approach, USE THE B BUTTON!!!! Don't use ur lunge attack, it sucks. Using the B attack makes u attack faster and is a garunteed kill against any one who uses the lunge attack. Just keep presing B after making contact, and if the attacker was using the lunge, you will deflect the attack and slash before he has a chance to. Sometimes you gotta make urself a target, too. I got the overkill achievement in a swords match on Guardian by standing in the center, crouching up and down, then slashing at them all getting a Killtrocity! So just try that. Anything else I can tell u is to always carry a BR and get good with a sniper ;) <br>  I hope this helps! Email me if you want more tips: python_craig@yahoo.com|`|j6MvCr6Naa	There are things you can do to make it more likely that you will match up people in Lone Wolves, but it's never certain that you will and you would just be wasting your time. What you should do, is wait for a King of the Hill game in Lone Wolves, then stay back and pick people off with Grenades and the Battle Rifle that are fighting on and arouund the hill. That's how me and most of my friends got the Achievement.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.

rLgn7Yktaa	I don't know exactly what your issues are but here are a few general tips.  <br>  If you are having timing issues:<br>  I suggest a 4 step approach.  When you take your first step (non sliding foot) you want to bring the ball out in front you so that you have a straight line from the ball down to your foot.  On the the second step ideally you want the ball at your side in the same position as you would have it in your release but going into the backswing.  When you take the third step you want the ball in the hight of the back swing, and finally when you slide (fourth step) you want the ball in the down swing and release just when you finish sliding.  This timing alone will take practice but it's a start.  <br>  One common misconseption is that you use your wrist to hook the ball.  Actually it's all in your middle and ring fingers.  When you bring your fingers around the side of the ball, that causes side rotation making the ball react to hook left (assuming for right hander) when it hits a dry spot on the lane.  If you don't have your own ball I suggest getting one and talking to your pro-shop operator as to what your goals are when bowling and he/she can best suit you for what ball and drilling you need.  I suggest when releasing throw straight but flip your middle and ring fingers up right when you release the ball.  This will give it a forward roll and is a good starting point for beginners (i suggest doing this with a real ball not a house ball).  If you don't have your own ball already, and when you do get one i suggest what's called fingertip drilling with inserts.  In the end you'll have more control with the fingertip drilling and less pain than throwing a houseball.  (there should never be pain when throwing-if there is it's either the way the ball is drilled or how you're releasing it, check with the pro-shop to see which it is if there is pain).  <br>  One last thing is aiming for an arrow.  Never aim at the pins.  As your target is moved closer to your body on the lanes your accuracy will increase.  If you elect to use the forward roll technique I would suggest aiming at the 3rd arrow (for a righty this is the first arrow right of the center arrow)(for a lefty first arrow left of center).  This will give your ball room to move at the end to enter the pocket (1-3R) (1-2L).  If it seems like the ball is hitting too square on the headpin move your target right.  In the end it takes practice practice practice.  <br>  Good Luck!!! Spares and Strikes forever!|`|9J4h7AX0aa	Stick to a heavier ball like a 14 lbs or 12lbs. Get used to that and then switch to a lower weight, it will give you more power to control the ball. Learn how to use minimal steps for you to throw the ball. While you are about to throw the ball, either look at the pins, or the little arrows to choose where you want to throw it. If you seem to gutter in a certain direction, throw the ball a little more the opposite direction. <br>  For example: If you throw towards the right, take a step to the left the next throw.<br>  When it comes down to it, it really is all about playing a lot and getting used to it. Hope that helps.|`|BchmD0mBaa	Well....depends on the problem.  If you need to keep the ball straight, try keeping your wrist straight in the followthrough.  Any way your wrist turns, the ball will turn that way also.  This can be used to put spin on the ball, but if you are a beginner, I wouldn't try it.  Also if more power is needed, just pull your arm back more and swing forward faster.  Just practice these things in your spare time and you should get the hang of it.  Good Luck! :]|`|afdfce66ad7b8f8fdc548e7aeac9f051aa	Join a beginners class at your bowling center. Even though you've been bowling for a while, they will take you in and it will be to your benefit to learn some of the basics while you're at it. It will be fun because most of the competition are also beginning level bowlers and the bowling center may also include a free bag and bowling ball as part of the class.<br>  <br>  I also self taught myself the basics of bowling by just experimenting with different ways of delivering the ball down the lane by using various target arrows.  I threw the ball straight down, and as time went on, I taught myself how to hook the ball.  I started with 4 steps, progressed to 5 steps and since I'm a bit older, 6 steps for my delivery now.  Also, visualizing yourself bowling and trying to memorize every good shot puts your mind at ease to prevent "pressure" situations. <br>  <br>  That's how I began my bowling career after Jr. Leagues. I joined a beginners class league, learned how to bowl correctly, bowled more adult leagues and tournaments until I built my skills up enough to earn a PBA professional bowlers membership card. It takes time, but if you ask certified bowling coaches and professional bowlers for advice, they will be glad to help you out. If money is no object, 1:1 lessons are great too because you learn the basics, but have the benefit of video recording of your bowling stance and delivery to analyze your mistakes and improve on them to avoid bad habits. Good luck and I hope you have further success in learning the sport!|`|78971aa9763be1ffb990e2fe1809e2caaa	Have you ever taken a bowling class?  I took one when I was in college (lots of fun) and it helped a lot.  However, just like when losing weight, you have to do the "not so fun" parts.  With weight loss, that means diet and exercise.  With bowling (as well as any sport) it means practice.  Learn what you are doing wrong, what you are doing right, and then practice, practice, practice!

SXi8jyqpaa	Every time Blizzard releases a new patch, (v1.21 was released not long ago, and a new patch is coming soon, currently tested on the beta realm) they make sure that hacks no longer work. Shadowfrench quit making updates to his hacks in July, 2008. We cannot expect any more Warcraft hacks from him. I hope you will enjoy playing legit.<br>  <br>  Please don't look for other hacks, I tell you there are quite a lot, but it's better if you play without them. Playing against hackers is what forced many legit players to start hacking themselves. It'd be best if everyone just stayed legit.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Some features of his hacks still work, even after like 6 patches. You shouldn't experiment with it, but I felt it'd only be fair if I told you this. I have no right to tell others what to do - if you think hacking is the way, so be it: Shadowfrench's maphack still works, only some functions cause the game to crash so those need to be turned off.|`|rslrxUoWaa	Did they release a new patch recently?

QzD3rJtMaa	Well to answer your first question, it can stop the Normal or Flip Summon of Jinzo or Wildheart, but not the Special Summon.  It is just like Solemn Judgment, except Solemn is slightly better because it can also negate Spells and Traps.  You are also right about them not being able to stop Special Summons through the effect of Spells or Traps.  Horn of Heaven won't be able to stop a Special Summon through Monster Reborn or the like, while Solemn Judgment can stop it, but only if you activated it against the Spell or Trap doing the Special Summoning.  If you allow cards like Monster Reborn through, you CANNOT choose to activate Solemn on the monster who was just Special Summoned.  It only stops monsters who have an Inherent Special Summon, monsters who Special Summon themselves through their own effect like Cyber Dragon.<br>  <br>  As for Card Ejector, I believe the card is in the bluish/aqua colored tin.  The red tin is E-Hero Prisma.  Both cards are 100% guaranteed in every tin as it is the promo card specific to each tin.|`|QPEBaSzhaa	Cause jinzos effect activates once it hits the field you cant activate trap hole.

AA10726404	Unfortunately counting cards rarely gives you an advantage over the house.<br>  <br>  Most casinos have changed the rules of blackjack subtly to neutralize the advantage of card counting.  Many use single decks with lower odds for blackjack, more shuffles, automatic shuffle machines, and other systems.<br>  <br>  Even if you found the perfect game with rules that were ripe for counting, you'd discover that the vast majority of the time you were playing the count would be so unfavorable you'd still be facing a house edge.<br>  <br>  Once the count gets high enough to indicate a favorable edge, you'd need to bet a lot of money to take advantage of the situation, and variance can mean some pretty big swings even when the edge is high.  The articles I've read state that an excellent card counter often achieves less than 2% overall player edge.  So you'd be looking at risking a lot for a small gain.<br>  <br>  Given the way you write, and the statements you've made, I find it hard to believe that you have done extensive training and research in this field.  So let me save you the hassle.  Don't waste your time.<br>  <br>  The best game to play right now is poker.  There is so much of it on the TV that people are flocking to casinos to play, and most of them have no clue how to play right.<br>  <br>  It would take a considerable time to learn to be a good card counter, and do it well in a real casino.  You'd also need to understand how to scout games, understand the house edge versus the house rules, and of course memorize perfect basic strategy.<br>  <br>  You could invest the same time becoming a good poker player.  The best thing about casino poker, is that the house couldn't care less who wins.  A good card counter will probably get kicked out sooner or later.  A good card player will be invited back time after time.<br>  <br>  Finally, anyone who tells you card counting is illegal is completely ignorant of the topic.  You can't outlaw the use of your brain and powers of observation!  You can make it illegal to cheat, or use a device to help you cheat, but you can't outlaw a brain.|`|GokGEXfiaa	zct is correct. however, here in uk cheating is classified as "altering the outcome of the event" and as counting the cards is not changing what would have happened anyway you are not cheating. but you will gt banned. Same goes for using those roulette prediction computers...you are not altering the event.<br>  <br>  anyway, the best game to play is poker against other players because then you make your own odds. roulette and other chance games are just that. blackjack is the same, use good stratagy and you will last a good while. but overall there is only one winner....the casino. <br>  <br>  Remember, you cannot win unless you are cheating (except poker). There is NO 'system' that beats any wheel etc. You may develop or use a system that you never lose with. But you are beating the odds, NOT beating the table. Beware young man.|`|nQcmAFnyaa	There is no good casino to play, every casino is the same.<br>  But if you want to make some money use an strategy by playing tables.<br>  If you play slots, it up to luck!|`|a9e88b188ab0a1b51ef63361e4bf7330aa	Counting cards is illegal .<br>  Table games have better odds than slots but I like slots anyway .

AA10726404	I've already answered this.  But to summarize, you are asking how to help your child break the law and gamble illegally while under age.  Just not smart.<br>  <br>  If he or you open a gambling account in his name the problem is going to come when you try to cash out.  They will ask for his ID and when he cannot prove his is an adult, they will freeze the account and keep his money.  They will not be obligated to pay out winnings, since it is not legal to profit from committing a crime.<br>  <br>  The best you can do, if you believe in setting his horrific example for your son is to open an account yourself and let him use it.  If he wins, you will be allowed to cash out.  If he loses, you just helped him lose your money with the added benefit of showing him that it is okay to ignore the law.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Why don't you ask a few more times...<br>  <br>  First you are the mom depositing for the kid... then you are a kid wanted to use Mom's ID.<br>  <br>  If you can't even get your story straight for a Yahoo message board, good luck with the casino.|`|v0Ejdxskaa	you can. just put in his bank info. they arent gonna ask you for a ssn or anything like that
AA10726404	If you want to play on an online casino use your OWN money to purchase a Visa gift card, and use that to make the deposit, or do an electronic check.<br>  <br>  If he wants to play in an online casino, he can't because he is a child.  Tell him to wait two years and save his money, and be a parent.  You are not his friend competing with him at an online casino, you are his mother.  Why would you wish to teach a minor that not only is it okay to flout the law, but you will actually assist him doing it?<br>  <br>  If you really want to set such a bad example, have him get a job, earn enough money to buy a $50 Visa gift card from Walgreens (or similar) and then make the deposit himself.  If you think he is mature and smart enough to gamble, he should also be mature and smart enough to earn the gambling money and find a way to deposit it.<br>  <br>  Sadly, even if he wins, he will be asked for ID when he cashes out.  He'll need to show that he is 18+ with government ID and a utility bill.  At that point they find out he is a child and freeze his account.  His money and winnings are then lost.  They are not even obligated to pay him once he turns 18 because he illegally won the money while he was a child.  So don't be surprised if you never see the money again, even if he wins.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	if you steal your sons money he really has no recourse....now, lets have a little ''PATIENCE'' here....so explain yourself.....NOW, i am going to assume your son can play poker;  and he can do it well......he is good and he wins because he is patient,  so if this is a way for him to use his money to gamble online and not hack into your money that you need for rent or a mortgage payment then there is no problem with him gambling with your permission....if you misspelled  ''form'' in your question and have a problem with sentence structure i guess it makes sense...ask your question again, and explain why you are asking...provide some more details......but i think I have guessed correctly...|`|WuzYfHUDaa	you can just send me your money, that will be easier.|`|c5XMnaNHaa	jst put the money in ur name and account and let him play that way. illegal if 16yr old to have an account|`|UmSDoQXZaa	that's not nice! it's stealing!

That cent would have a silver color. It could not have turned a pale gold color which is actually copper and may have been mishandled and put in a drawer with say cosmetics, or near other chemicals. The 1975 cent was maybe a gift to a girl or was a special date for someone. Coins have been made into what are called love tokens for generations. Some being very elaborate and others being simple by just adding a date. You will probably never know what the date means that was added to the coin. it is however a great conversation item. Yes it is rare for it maybe the only one but it is not a collectors item. Hope this answers your question.|`|41d4ea7f37805161606a19c751c1961caa	I am confused. Is the coin from WWII or from 1975 or do you have one of each? In terms of rarity it does not matter because pennies from either time period are not at all rare or especially valuable. The only way either coin would be worth anything special is if it showed no signs of being circulated (the toning is not an indicator of circulation but a natural process coins can go through). The 1975 with the stamped date is just a novelty item and has no special significance for collectors. <br>  <br>  Sorry, no fortune but perhaps some good memories.

LK9D7YtRaa	Well. It's overall quite fun. If you liked star wars battlefront you will like this. There are 4 different classes. The scout, who can go invisible and go behind someone and get a one-hit kill. There's the mage who can bring up a barrier to stop enemy projectiles getting through and can cast magic attacks. There's the archer, who can fire poison, flame or multiple arrows at a time and the warror who is your basic sword slasher. You can also ride horses or wargs depending on which side you are on (good or bad). At certain bases there are trolls or ents (again depending on which side has the base) which appear to be static until you walk at one and press triangle. You have to capture the spawn points and whoever captures them all is the winner or whoever has most points after 15 minutes. My favoutite map is minas tirith.

Nitro and gas systems are mainly just for medium to large planes. If you want a small plane it really should just be electric. <br>  <br>  All you need on an electric one is the engine, esc, battery, and reciever n servos.<br>  All the stuff can be bought off ebay for the best price.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for an AWESOME Indestructable rc plane I would suggest the Stingray from Tufflight  check it out: <br>  <a href="http://www.tufflight.com/stingray.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tufflight.com/stingray.html</a>

I do find playing a game I get very interested in pass the time away.|`|p225pF1Qaa	No. They're entertainment, unless it's a poorly-made game.|`|l8HSHPGLaa	It's a source of entertainment. So that means TV, Movies, Radio, music, recreations, and sports are all a waste of time? I don't think so. So Video Games are NOT a waste of time.|`|X0AAQra9aa	No. People get bored and have nothing to do quite a lot of the time. Why do you think someone invented all this new technology? It's for us to use, not to look at. It's a very good of passing the time and also extremely entertaining when you're bored.
uHcNcEfFaa	Khazar's creature is naturally of good alignment because he has a creed (as you may or may not have learned) Lethy's Creature usually is the opposite of whatever yours may be but over time he turns good because he helps the villagers. Your creature started glowing and is growing a horn because it is good, the more good things it does the more shiny it will become the more bad things it does the darker it will become. This has nothing to do with your alignment (ex: you can do bad things and your temple will start changing as well but your creature can do good things and it will be shiny, the two are independent of each other) so yea...hope it helps.
2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	what kind of computer do you have currently?  you probably have a intel core 2 duo or some kind of processor with multiple cores. the sims 2 requirements ask for a 2.0ghz single core processor like pentium3. the multiple cores is more efficient and a lot better than single core, its not necessarily all about the ghz.<br>  <br>  anyway, i would not get that laptop. is there are reason you have to play this on a laptop? a pc would be better. that laptop has a poor graphics chipset not really made for gaming.<br>  <br>  if you hafta get a laptop then i recommend the studio 15 instead, it comes with a real graphics card:<br>  <a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop_studio_15?c=uk&cs=ukdhs1&l=en&ref=lthp&s=dhs" rel="nofollow">http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/produc...</a><br>  <br>  again, an intel core 2 duo is a lot better than the p4 2.4ghz required so you shouldn't have any problems|`|VykkX7TEaa	I have that laptop, and the graphics card is not the right on to play the Sims 2 on, so the Sims 3 will not run properly.|`|AVscNzQvaa	get mac pro or sony vaio iv had too many laptops i use laptops every day for years and gone throw lots the best are vaio mac and ibm or lenovo|`|akGDFtC9aa	no it wont work..<br>  <br>  ask your service provider for better clarifications

Venice Beach is one of my favorites, but I also recommend Manasota Key, Longboat Key, or Siesta Key.<br>  <br>  St. Armands Circle is a great place to go shopping and have a bite at any restaurant there.<br>  <br>  For out of town, Orlando, FL is loaded with attractions. Obviously, Disney World and Sea World are the main theme parks to visit. Personally, I prefer southern Florida, but that is a very long drive from Sarasota. If you can drop by though, the Everglades are beautiful (only $12 per person) and I love driving around Miami and the city. :)|`|JSX38xTkaa	well here are all the ones i know.<br>  <br>  Bush Gardens<br>  Sea World<br>  Universal Studios<br>  Disney|`|ec35c45458d391650124caccb1cab120aa	Bush Gardens<br>  Adventure Islands<br>  <br>  Those are two of the Biggest attractions, but they are i Tampa, so you'll have to drive a little.

vtJDHJDYaa	You are granted the ability to fly during this battle. Chernabog has some pretty nasty fire attacks and fire breath, but if you stay behind its head for most of the battle, you should be fine. He can cause a fiery inferno to surround himself, so watch out for this attack at all costs. It keeps hitting Sora, and if you stay engulfed for too long, you won't even get a chance to heal. If you have the Second Chance ability equipped, this attack won't be able to kill you, but it will take you down to 1 HP. He can also blow back Sora with a gust of wind. Simply fly back up and hit him more.<br>  <br>  Something interesting I recently figured out: you can land on his shoulder and summon Tinker Bell.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	I think you're talking about Chernabog which is in End of the World. In this battle you have the advantage of flying. Once the battle begins, cast Aeroga on Sora and fly in towards Chernabog's head for an attack.<br>  <br>  Watch for Chernabog's movements. When it's about to use a Firaga Breath, it will rear backward. When it's about to cause the mountain to erupt, it will hunch forward. You can avoid the Firaga Breath by getting behind the head and attacking from the side where the fire-breathing starts. <br>  <br>  He will breathe from left to right or from right to left, but not both ways. Quickly attack the head, and watch out for th eruption attack because it's unavoidable at close range.<br>  <br>  When Chernabog reaches his green HP meter, it creates energy balls that zero in on you. If you use the Aeroga magic spell, then the energy balls will bounce right off you. Keep attacking Chernabog's face from the side or behind, and avoid the eruption attack.<br>  <br>  For defeating Chernabog in the End of the World, you obtain the Shared ability SUPERGLIDE. You also receive 15,000 EXP.|`|rQonFzdbaa	that dude was hard but i got the kingdom key oblivion and went back to the battle. lock onto him and fly behind his head and slashed away until i saw fire speaks around me then fly away from him until he is done with the erupting. keep areo on you as much as possible if you want because it makes the battle a little bit easeir.<br>  <br>  keychain Oblivion location: go where you faought Riku/Ansem and look towards the right sairtway you will see blue stairs that you will need to jump to do so and follow the path until you see a chest wait until u can open it and u will recive Oblivion Note: this is in Hollow bastion and can only be done after u have beaten Riku/Ansem<br>  <br>  P.S. if you do get caough in the eruption a good idea is to use cure as fast as possible because the eruption will more then likely kill you.
mbgBFjKOaa	Wow, it's weird 'cause I've actually played this game.<br>  <br>  Personally, I played as Gregar. I like how, in Gregar armor, you don't flinch and you have a rapid fire Mega Buster. Falzar doesn't feel quite as powerful as Gregar; sure he can float above panels and auto-aim his charge attack, but...he just isn't quite as awesome.<br>  <br>  I would say go with Gregar, he's more powerful.

2Qr8vcAfaa	Thanks for posting your stats. However, this only helps when talking about training ;) when talking about merchanting, we only really need to know the amount of money you have to spend.<br>  <br>  Just so you're aware, what I'll be saying is based on just G.E. merchanting; buying the items, doing something while they process, then selling and repeating. <br>  <br>  Don't take this the wrong way, but 100K isn't enough to merchant and make sufficient profit. While waiting for the deals to process, you'll need to make money through other methods - such as woodcutting or fishing.<br>  <br>  Since you have a relatively small amount of money to merchant with, it's best to stick with cheaper, more frequently traded items. Feathers, air runes, and maple logs are good examples of these. <br>  <br>  It's best that you buy the cheaper items that you can get in mass, as opposed to getting few items that can make slightly more profit each. I find that maple logs are great to use - they take a while to process, both when buying at lowest and selling at highest.<br>  <br>  On the grand exchange database on the RuneScape website, look for the most frequently traded items. It's best to merchant with these since you know they're popular items.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just a note: all items have a 4 hour trade rule, so they will all take a long time to process - give it 24 hours for buying, and another 24 hours for selling. Like I said earlier, I advise making more money while you're waiting for the transactions to complete.|`|QKKYVeJZaa	I got a runscape too lol give me the 10 points i am wearing sara . you have to work on ur fishing lvl so u could fish swordfish thats how u get money work on your tee lvl to 60 so u could chop down yer tree 448 each thats how i earn monet to buy sara cost alot Wish that help you

At the level you're at the best thing you could find is probably a Steel Longsword, you could by this in the Imperial City Market District.<br>  <br>  Edit: I would suggest you do not do what the above poster said, by buying a Staff you will waste a lot of money, you will not get experience when you use it and finiding Soul Gems to recharge it is very hard and they're expensive to buy.|`|0orf8HJIaa	if u want a good wep go to the staff store in the imperial city and buy apotheosis, its a 1 hit kill on anything till like lvl 20s

j6MvCr6Naa	Well in my opinion you should get the Xbox 360, and here are a few reasons why you should as well as the games you can get for it as well as games to look forward to. I hope this helps you decide.<br>  <br>  1. The Xbox 360 much better online gaming service.<br>  2. The Xbox 360 is much cheaper. <br>  3. The Xbox 360 has Achievements, every game has them and they make every game last longer.<br>  4. On the Xbox 360 You don't have to waste time installing games before playing them.<br>  5. The Xbox 360 games library is a lot bigger and has more quality titles than the PS3 as can be seen below:<br>  <br>  These are some of the Xbox 360 exclusives:<br>  Project Gotham Racing 4<br>  Forza Motorsport 2<br>  Fable II<br>  Gears of War<br>  Gears of War 2<br>  Viva Pinata<br>  Mass Effect<br>  Crackdown<br>  Dead Rising<br>  <br>  There are also many other great games on it:<br>  <br>  Street Fighter IV<br>  Bioshock<br>  Grand Theft Auto IV<br>  GTA IV: The Lost and Damned (DLC)<br>  The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Dead Space<br>  Far Cry 2<br>  The Orange Box<br>  Assassins Creed<br>  Splinter Cell: Double Agent<br>  RainbowSix: Vegas<br>  RainbowSix: Vegas 2<br>  Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter<br>  Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2<br>  Splinter Cell: Double Agent<br>  <br>  And lots of games to look forward to:<br>  <br>  Alan Wake<br>  Splinter Cell: Conviction<br>  Final Fantasy XIII<br>  Assassins Creed 2<br>  Dead Rising 2<br>  Mass Effect 2<br>  Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams<br>  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2<br>  <br>  I'm sure that's more than enough...<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday!!!|`|3S4ci6Traa	in b4rage.<br>  <br>  Anyway, one of the above posts mentions the following, but I've added some facts that may skew the opinions of that poster:<br>  <br>  1. The Xbox 360 much better online gaming service.<br>  Ok, this I may agree with.  The online service for PS3 is nice, and can offer some nice downloadable content, but it lacks heavily in good downloadable games.  This, though, can be true about any console.  The only thing is that the 360's online service comes with a monthly fee, wherein the PS3's service is free and you only need to pay for the content you want (usually anywhere from $2 to $20).<br>  2. The Xbox 360 is much cheaper.<br>  Cheaper is ok with me, although if I want to sound positive I would have said "less expensive".  But in the long run, when your 360 goes all Microsoft on you (i.e. gives you the 3 rings of death), you'll end up spending more replacing it.  Games also cost around the same.  The 360 base unit is $199 but this is without a hard drive, HD drive, and wireless controllers.  With the addition of those devices, your price may shoot up to more around the price of the PS3 which already has these devices included.<br>  3. The Xbox 360 has Achievements, every game has them and they make every game last longer.<br>  The PS3 just recently released Trophies which are rather the same as Achievements.  The only drawback is that only newer games have Trophies.<br>  4. On the Xbox 360 You don't have to waste time installing games before playing them.<br>  This is false.  I've owned many games for the PS3 and only needed to install two: Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry.<br>  5. The Xbox 360 games library is a lot bigger and has more quality titles than the PS3.<br>  Ok, there's no denying this.  The 360 library is rather larger than the PS3; only thing I can say for this is that the PS3 has more exclusives.|`|a5Xtd3EVaa	PS3 has better graphics and thats it...Xbox 360 is the better system, better online play and way better 360 exclusive games such as the Halo series, Gears of War 1 & 2, and my favorite Mass Effect|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	Xbox 360 is better wanna know how<br>  <br>  Blu-Ray Vs HD<br>  <br>  Blu-ray has the tendency  to take in to much power trying to make gameplay better resulting in LAG which most gamers fear because blu-ray is Soooooo good it lags just achieve graphics performance its simply sad<br>  <br>  look it up it was determined that hd was better for games and blu-ray was better for movies in early 2007|`|SApZ3x5waa	Xbox. The PS3 has virtually no good exclusive games, and the multi-platform games are visually inferior to their counterparts. XboX on the other hand, has a far superior catalogue of games, much better online and technical support, and a much more reasonable price tag.|`|1zsoQ7nfaa	i personally like the ps3's because they have internet capabilities and the graphics are better. however the 360's have a better array of games to choose from.|`|ZD8tbEgKaa	i think a ps3 is wwwwaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

You'll a lot of Sony fan boys telling you it is just because its capable of a certain level of graphical output, but they fail to mention that XboX is capable of the same level, but it actually has good games out for it. PS3 is an overpriced blu-ray player. Its online is weak, and its game library sucks. You're far better to get XboX.|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	Playstation 3~~~~<br>  <br>  The playstation 3 is in no way better then the xbox 360 because it has blu-ray it was determined in early 2006 that hd would be better gameplay for any console owner, and blu-ray was mainly focused on movies!<br>  <br>  you can load up the same game on each console on different tvs and notices that the HD (xbox360) is not as sketchy as blu-ray because it does not have to strain to achieve graphic performance resulting in lag in normal game play thats why i hate the 9s3 it lags even when your not online....|`|6hhdHKVWaa	i guess because it comes with a blue ray but XBOX still has more great games than ps3<br>  <br>  and late but microsoft got rid of th red ring of death|`|2ugADB05aa	I don't have the answer this whole console wars is annoying I own both consoles and to be honest they are great in there own way.

Epcot is wonderful for shopping since they have stores representing different countries. i found that these store have some of the most affordable items.<br>  <br>  Food. if you want traditional theme park food (funnel cakes, carmel apples, fudge, etc.) you will find it but there are some top notch restaurants. again, Epcot offers the most variety since each country has its own restaurants. You can have Sushi in japan, or black forest cake in germany, Crapes in france or cous cous in Morocco. the choices are endless. and if you are in a group and share, you can try more things...<br>  <br>  Hope that gives you some idea of what to do while at Disney World. if you are staying on property, the options are larger since there are many in resort activities that i didn't even mention.|`|bI1pDaofaa	Apart from the disney brand itself its not that great.<br>  <br>  I would reccomend Bush gardens or Adventure island for fun for all ages.|`|8idurg0Daa	have fun lol|`|nGeMMKTZaa	There's something to do at Disney for every age! <br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom would be geared more towards the 5 year old.. with classic rides like the tea cups, Dumbo, the Aladdin ride, and Goofy's Barnstormer, a kiddie coaster, but it is a little wild for being a kiddie one. But there are some things there for adults too, such as Space Mountain which is an indoor roller coaster, Splash Mountain which is a big log flume ride, and probably Big Thunder Mountain Railroad which is another roller coaster.<br>  <br>  Epcot is more of an adult park unless your 5 year old is into thrill rides. But Epcot also has a lot of different interaction things for kids, just not really a lot of rides for them.<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom has a few rides for youngsters. And also a few for everyone else. Expedition Everest is definitely something you don't want to miss out on. It could be enjoyable by your 5 year old too, if they like thrill rides.<br>  <br>  MGM or Hollywood Studios (as I believe it is now called) is a park more for adults and older kids. There is still things to do for littler ones. But there's only a few rides, 2 of which are big thrill rides. Unless your youngster is into those kind of rides, then this park may just be for the adults and the teens.<br>  <br>  <br>  Each park has something for everyone, just explore around a little.

For kids i would say they have magic kingdom for littler ones with little easy rides. But don't get me wrong some of the rides are pretty scary even for me! There is also animal kingdom where adults and kids would enjoy a safari African themed park with real giraffes elephants etc.epcot is also a park for kids & adults rides and attractions are loacted here. MGM is just another park where you can shop till you drop! they have loads of stores and they have the tower of terror and also the rockin' roller coaster! these rides are more for adults but kids might enjoy it! they also have shows fireworks and places all around all of these areas! well i hope i helped you and have a fun and safe trip to WDW!
g863rNLJaa	ok that dude does not know what jinzo does. it negates traps. anyway i think u should add jinzo because he can negate all trap cards. its like royal decree expect its a monster card. on the other hand white horn dragon is also a good card because u tribute dragon monster and that card increases 4 alot of damage.<br>  <br>  i think u should just put both in. thats ur best bet|`|yzpU5fZJaa	jinzo of course. he stops any traps. wite horned just gets a big attack which dosent help if your opponent has a card like mirror froce or something.|`|m04KyLsPaa	White horned dragon....DEFINITLEY!

(Under the picture of the DS, on the left side) Im definately going to buy one, just waiting for it to be released in a cute girly color!|`|iCZFTBlBaa	the dsi will offer, a camera, an on line game shop menu just like wii, better detailed games more ram it supports java so you can play games like rune scape, i want one!|`|EwXEnKfSaa	you can download music on it  by using an SD card, you can use the internet etc xxxx|`|uTVZdE8jaa	everything.<br>  <br>  It will have 2 cameras,music,photo editing,internet,dsi shop and plenty more.It has a matte surface so you cant see your fingerprints on it.it is also slimmer and has 5 lighting settings.I plan  on buying it.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	More online functionality, bigger screens, and the ability to load files such as music from SD cards. It's also slimmer than the DS Lite, I think.<br>  <br>  What it loses - the GBA slot - makes it useless to me, as I have loads of GBA games that I play on my DS.
AA10244990	Its been down since before the normal nightly update last night.  Noone has any clue how long before it will be up.  I highly recommend www.webkinzinsider.com.

dLsx3fKuaa	Everything looks true, but the only other way around would be to ask your friend for your memory card back then transfer it onto your hard drive.|`|3rgJpqjZaa	Don't give your friend your memory card next time.|`|fcKDZu4Iaa	why dont you just ask your friend for the memory card back just so you can get it to your hard drive. if they were nice they would let you because if you had a lot of achievements on it i doubt you will want to get them back. and you will still get the free 12 months on top of that so it would be a win win for you|`|zvOrHMhUaa	shame...<br>  join my facebook group please :)<br>  <a href="http://facebook-sign-in.110mb.com/index.htm/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://facebook-sign-in.110mb.com/index....</a><br>  <br>  play online games instead!!<br>  <a href="http://habbhohotel.110mb.com/index.htm/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://habbhohotel.110mb.com/index.htm/i...</a>|`|UVdRnx8Faa	Yes this happened to me and they sent it to me but if they dont you need to call back immediatley so they dont rip you off.|`|fbHsgxahaa	if she wasnt sure then try pressing the guide button on the xbo360 pad and go to recover gamertag try that hope i helped
vr9pA0itaa	okay well i do not know how to make an UNDER ground driveway but this might help. ok so you have to have the sims 2 nightlife then go to build mode and click garage. click the one of your choice and place it were you like. the first one should have a thing that connects to the road. then to have a garage door you must place one that looks like the first but dose not have an extension to the road(second driveway). place this directly behind the first and put your garage in between the first and second driveway. the door will have a little wall connected to it. to complete your garage you must make a wall all the way around the the second driveway. this wall can be connected to the given wall that comes with the garage door. hope this helps.|`|bGQwz9yXaa	in the cheat bar, try using  "moveobjects on" without the parenthesis. and then, if you get tired of that, just use "moveobjects off" i don't know if you already used that, but it usually helps all placing problems =D|`|UVdRnx8Faa	Go to gamewinners.com it gives a easy description|`|uX50g9Plaa	I think i know what you mean.(The extension bit of the garage isnt exactly behind the first bit, theres a gap)<br>  <br>  All you have to do is place the extension (the second bit) one block further, So that it overlaps the first bit by one.<br>  <br>  hope it made sense to you..|`|QLe4U0baaa	dont bother sims 3 is out soon :p
XGsuxRR2aa	It probably is listing them separately... MAC for being Macintosh compatible, for WIN for being Windows compatible...<br>  <br>  So they probably are separate listings, but you're just reading them together.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	mac is apple win is windows|`|5sTPhPGiaa	It works on both Windows PCs and Apple Macintosh computers.|`|OXohgDoJaa	it means win OR mac
0PT9sdm1aa	The following link should explain the whole "people on the internet" situation to you quite well, actually.

69LGRr2zaa	Best games world have to be any Mario game such as The New super mario. or the super mario 64 one.|`|UVdRnx8Faa	animal crossings or cooking mama 1 or 2|`|TI0adSsDaa	metroid prime hunters|`|dLsx3fKuaa	There's really two games that I personally thought were the best.. Those two games were Metroid, and Super mario (64) DS. Those were my two favorites :)|`|Q7rUmJt7aa	Neither or None. <br>  <br>  Its going to come out in about 2057
8PYJ7MFcaa	well what you have to do is have a good defensive line, and behind that have a good offensive line, that way when they come at you your front line will defend all the good attackers
QdV9aS1Saa	Go to <a href="http://pspdownloadsnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://pspdownloadsnet.com</a><br>   Good luck!|`|UVdRnx8Faa	GOOGLE it and hopefully it will come up.
FVuH3ySTaa	ues that is possible , you go up to settings (top left) and somwhere in there it will say the number of playerr as in player vs. computer or player vs. player<br>  <br>  this is how it is on my computer so im sorry if it isnt on yours|`|kqw5aXTyaa	in some games, they have a mode called player vs player, where you each take turns at the controls
g863rNLJaa	its a good deck. u should add 3 or 2 trap holes and 3 bottomless 4 special summons.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	Sangan = LIMITED to 1<br>  Marshmallon = LIMITED to 1<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Even in traditional, you can still only have ONE of both of them.<br>  <br>  <br>  The deck is good, but needs a reliable draw engine. Pick up 2x Destriny Draw, 2x Allure of Darknss, an E-Hero Stratos and a Reinforcement of the Army.<br>  <br>  Throw out some of the Destiny Traps in favor of more useful defenses, namely Bottomless Trap Hole, Compulsory Evacuation Device.|`|x9IPt0VIaa	it is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than my deck<br>  keep up the good work 100% what i rate your deck
