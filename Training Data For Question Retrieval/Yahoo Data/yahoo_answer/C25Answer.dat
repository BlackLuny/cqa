But all of these negative comments toward him, as if he was responsible, is really a mask for people's real objections to Barack Obama. <br>  <br>  Methinks they doth protest too much.

So far, his biggest screw ups have been in not properly vetting his Cabinet appointees, but otherwise I would say he is off to a very good start.|`|u93eagkqaa	If if if if if if..

Well, gee, obama has been taking blame for stuff that happened even before he was sworn into office, so it looks like your guys are not playing on a level field here. No matter, as an independent, i'll be all over obama if he screws up his oath of office to defend the constitution, or if he condones the use of torture, or if he thumbs his nose at congress or if he stonewalls justice department investigations or if he operates a secret government or if he sends troops into battle ill-equipped to carry out the mission or if he cuts funding for wounded vets. He does anything that puke bush did (all the aforementioned stuff) then yeah, i'm all over obama. But it won't happen. Obama and bush have different belief systems--one was secretive and snarky and will be judged by history as america's worst and the other will be given a fair shot at greatness--by historians, if not by republikans.|`|xACwWEXHaa	DJ Kevin, if you really face the facts, then you are rare among political partisans of any sort.<br>  <br>  Yes, if Obama steps in it, I'll agree.  I agreed that as much as I admired him, Carter did not play well with others, and many opportunities in his administration were wasted in bickering.  I liked most of what Bill Clinton did, but I have not forgiven him for looking into the camera and lying to me.  That act put much of what he did that was good in shadow, and his not keeping "it" in his pants allowed the division and moral outrage that brought us 8 years of GWB.<br>  <br>  I don't expect Obama to be perfect.  I'll admit it when I agree that he is not.  But I don't by any stretch believe that he'll run us into the ditch as badly as Bush did, and have great hope that he'll pull us out of the one we are in now as a result of the train wreck of the past 8 years.<br>  <br>  I'm politically somewhat libertarian, fiscally (and personally financially) conservative, and socially liberal.  I'm not sure that the stimulus bill will stimulate nearly as much as it should, but I think we have to start somewhere.  I'm worried about the potential for waste.|`|AA12341057	NOW you'll admit Bush was a terrible President?! Bit late now buddy.

If he were to somehow royally screw up, I would have no problems admitting it- I just have higher hopes for him than that.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	If he fails half as much as Bush I sure will.|`|AA10757358	I am tired of hearing how rotten the last 8 years were under the watch of President Bush.  I do not think this is a winning strategy. Considering the circumstances President Bush was forced to govern under, I think he did a pretty good job.  Even the Democrats blame our current financial crisis on a bill President Clinton signed in 2000.  His policies got us through the shaky times right after 9/11 and the .com bubble bursting.  We have not had a terrorist attack in the last 7 years.  In Iraq, things are turning around and Al Qaeda has been defeated and humiliated.  His administration was one of the most ethical and least corrupt in history.  I don’t think a Democrat would have done better considering some of the circumstances encountered by our country in this period.  Could you imagine if Kerry was elected?  Al Qaeda would have been setting up shop in Iraq and be expanding their power base throughout the Middle East.  Now that is truly scary.  We need to defend these accomplishments of President Bush. <br>   <br>  I will admit that President Bush did a very poor job in certain areas — e.g., ILLEGAL ALIENS — By the way, the government lends money to ILLEGAL ALIENS to buy houses.   <br>  <br>   History will be kind to to President George W. Bush   He is more than a decent man ....who never wavered regarding the duty of the office....defending the country and the constitution. <br>  <br>  A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.<br>  <br>  -Milton Friedman <br>    <br>  <br>     I agree with you about spending and the immigration policy, across the aisle. He did, and they made him pay for it, just as they did to his father.  You can't compare Bushs spending to what Obama has done to future generations. <br>  <br>  After Clinton cut our military in half, he promised to restore our military. He did. <br>  <br>  He promised in the October 12, 2000 debate to deal with Saddam once and for all. Ironically Gore sounded very Obamaesque with statements like “unacceptable” and “get tough”. Gore criticized Bush 41 for not invading Baghdad and said under his administration he would deal with Saddam once and for all. One of them was telling the truth. <br>  <br>  He promised he would stick his neck out and deal with Social Security with warnings similar to the recent remarks about impending disaster in the credit crisis. Bush tried to reach across the aisle and they clubbed him over the head. <br>  <br>  I may not agree with the way he went about Immigration reform, but like Social Security, something has to be done and he stuck his neck out again, and they clubbed him over the head with it for their own political gain. Obama was the deciding vote that torpedoed the deal. <br>  <br>  He put two great Justices on the Supreme court. In fact, Roberts as Chief has the left reluctantly admitting that he is imminently qualified. <br>  <br>  He cut taxes upon entering office and continued to cut taxes resulting in an increase in government revenues, just as he promised it would. Yes, Supply side economics does produce more government revenue, ask JFK. His economic recovery plan to pull us out of the Clinton recession, has resulted in continued growth for the entire remaining years of his Presidency. No other President has ever created and maintained such a long economic period of growth as GWB. For most of that time, for years, the Democrats have continually claimed we are in a recession or on the edge of a recession and when it didn’t arrive Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid and his Democrat doomsayers turned wishful thinking into action when they intentionally torpedoed the economy and pushed the economy over the edge. <br>  <br>  He withstood withering attacks as a result of his dedication and commitment to stay true to his promise to finish the job in Iraq and continue to vigorously fight the war on terror. He did not waver. Neither LBJ, Truman, or Nixon suffered the amount of attacks for his commitment to save us from destruction. No President since Nixon has suffered so much for a cause so just. Clinton was the most likely to cynically follow polls and to have Bush show such courage is a sign of true greatness. <br>  <br>  Most conservatives, myself included, fault him for the out of control spending. I think historians will put this into context too. Ronald Reagan doubled government revenues with his economic polices and as the money rolled in Congressmen of both parties doled it out to their constituents, because they knew that Reagan’s military spending and economic policies could be used to hold him hostage. He made a bargain to win the cold war and tolerate a deficit. When during his successors administration, the so called Peace dividend arrived, did the Democrats use it to pay back this debt, no way, they spent that too, but with Bush 41’s spending caps in place and the small business and IT boom in full swing he left behind a legacy of 19 years of peacetime growth. GWB did propose some healthcare programs and other big ticket items

I think Pres. Obama has his work cut out for him. It will be necessary for him to somehow convince Iran that it is not in their best interest to continue seeking nuclear capability. That is going to be a very hard sell considering their leadership (government and clerics) believe that martyrdom is a desired outcome.

They were going off of credit scores which at the time predicted if someone could pay back a loan.

Everything just happend very fast.  Honestly, everyine is equally to blame in the economic issue.

gasquENMaa	Hello Jenga. When a person accepts probation over serving their sentence in jail/prison, they are given a set of written rules ( called sanctions) by their probation officer. <br>  <br>  Each case can be tailored according to the specific crime the person was convicted of, but certain sanctions are considered standard.<br>  <br>  Maintain steady employment. Report when ordered. Do not break any laws or get any tickets for infractions. Report any contact with police immediately. Remain drug and alcohol free for the length of the probationary period. Do not associate with other persons on probation or parole. <br>  <br>  In your question, I see two different scenarios that are related. First, having been convicted of providing alcohol for minors, he is being flagrant abusive about the law in drinking with minors. Second, maintaining  drug and alcohol free for his probation. <br>  <br>  If his PO finds out about drinking with or around minors, he would more than likely face another criminal charge as well as violate himself. If he tests dirty for alcohol ( and yes, they will be doing UA's for it), he will have a VOP. <br>  <br>  Probation is a method where a person is given the opportunity to "rehabilitate" themselves by following very strict rules which is closely monitored. If the person cannot abide by those sanctions, then the court will have no trouble in remanding the individual to jail/prison to serve out their time instead. <br>  <br>  From the sound of your friend, he is on his way back to jail. It is just a matter of time until he gets caught again.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Yes, it is a violation.|`|Jteqao3zaa	if you have to ask, then its probably a violation.  idk the laws where you are, but i would imagine that would definetely!!!  be a violation of his probation.   he's not too bright is he?
AA11626745	You mean...do they work, no they sponge off everyone else.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	Agreed. Though people are going to have a hard time "reexamining" while they're busy fawning over Obama.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	The idea of small government sounds good, but it never has worked in a big country.   True, the philosophy itself should be reexamined to make sure that the separation of powers is kept intact.  It's the only way to avoid tyranny.  <br>  <br>  But when the government gets too 'small' and stops being the government, then the power struggles are magnified and eventually the gulf between the wealthy and the poor becomes even wider - the middle class starts to disappear and merges with the poorer class, not the wealthy class.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the best way to create a better government is for everyone to pay attention to what is going on in their own neighborhoods, their own states and their own country - if we all get involved, then we'll create a better government.|`|63ff1e2e36a5822cdda3d11750463689aa	I think that the govt. should be reexamined too. things haven't been working out well lately right?? too many different class also, I can attest to that!!|`|BUGuJIk9aa	No it never has and never will.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I don't think it ever worked.

Plus, they have payment plans and accessibility to loans/grants.   I know other bases offer the same. I really suggest you avoid online colleges.

c07v7O80aa	It lawful for CPS to act on a risk to children. But a Safety Plan is the lowest level of control. I actually think you didn't understand completely. It's true that you must be warned of the general possible consequences of violating a Safety Plan, but that doesn't mean a violation will lead to removal. The Safety Plan can only exist while the CPS investigation is open, and it won't be open that long. Their internal rules say 30 days, extendable to 60, before a determination has to be made to close or pass it to FBS for long-term services, and your deal doesn't sound like one of those. I'm not going to second guess the CPS investigator, because I've been one, and I know parents often misrepresent the situation. But I'd say go with the flow for now.

Mortgage loans refer to a loan secured by residential property, often for the purpose of securing real estate. Mortgage loans are priced lower than other loan structures because the value of the property risk for the lender. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/Mortgage%20Loan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/Mortgage%2...</a><br>  <br>  A fixed rate mortgage loan has its own benefit.

I thought that it was stupid of the government to do that.  Obviously it was.  And wouldn't you think that a "bailout" would actually help those who received the funds.  It didn't, banks are still floundering, AIG stock is in the toilet, and everyone know the car makers need a few more billion to fully develop a "plan".  It doesn't work to throw money at these problems.  It is obvious that these previous examples did not work, why does our government keep insisting throwing money at problems that don't have an easy fiscal answer will work.  Bailing out bad mortgages may be a six month band-aid, but unless these people have a DRAMATIC reduction in their monthy payment, it will still be a bad mortgage in short order.

I don't even now what you mean by "should we move faster towards destruction?", why would any country or person want to do that. What we are is a mixed economy even though we lean more toward capitalism. Socialism is government system or economic system that strives toward social equality and justice. There more milder and extreme versions. Currently Spain has democratically elected socialist governmen, as do many other countries around the world. A key idea of socialism is universal health-care and has worked in many countries from from Europe to Latin America. The thing about socialism is when it is so extreme it is communism.

Keep on message and convince the people that you are right. And look at the media blitz that followed Obama everywhere. And look at both how Bush and Obama led the American people into things by declaring it an emergency situation. This includes Iraq and the stimulus bills.

Sometimes we get lucky and actually get some benefit from it...but sometimes it is the other side that gets the benefit from it. But all in all, politicians have their own agenda. It is just a matter of which one can convince the people that they need him.

I knew a guy in the Air Force here in Vegas years ago, and it was said he worked at area 51.

" And he would just smile and say 'I have no idea what you are talking about'. What's funny is, even though the poster below named 'archangel' says area 51 is now abandoned, go on one of the earth map websites and see if you can see it.

acHnMNr2aa	Short answer - do I think we have a right to privacy? Yes, I do.<br>  <br>  Longer answer - I believe there is a right to freedom of action implicit in the social contract that has held in the United States since long before we became a nation. As a legal matter (I'm no legal scholar), I think it has been a part of English common law since long before the Magna Carta, parts of it included in Viking 'common law.' I think the right to privacy is a part of that right to freedom of action. <br>  <br>  Other aspects of this right to freedom of action include the right of free assembly, the right of free speech, the right to vote, the right not to be subject to arbitrary search and seizure, the right to not have troops quartered in our houses, and habeas corpus. Obviously, these are enumerated in the Constitution, while 'privacy' is not. <br>  <br>  Also not enumerated, though widely recognized, are rights like the right to move to any part of the country and the right to buy what we want in any retail establishment (including a lunch counter). I'd contend that the right to privacy is one of these implied but not enumerated rights contained in the American social contract, part of the right to freedom of action. <br>  <br>  Like the rights to live where we want, of assembly, of speech, and of voting, these rights aren't absolute. If you are a convicted sex offender, you may be prohibited from living next to a school. You may need a permit to assemble in large numbers if it's truly a challenge to public order (though I'd contend that this permit system is often abused). You can't say false things about other people (libel), or yell "fire" in a crowded theater. If you're a convicted felon, you can lose the right to vote, for a time or permanently (this is abused too, I'd contend.) Similarly, if there's a well-founded, justifiable reason, the government (only) can invade your privacy, but they should have to prove the need before a skeptical judge.<br>  <br>  I'd also contend that we have a right to privacy within our own bodies, or at least control over what is done to our own bodies, as found by the Supreme Court in Roe. Habeas corpus, at least, does seem to imply this.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure "privacy" is the best word for this. I'm not sure what word would be better, though - perhaps a right to "independence?" I think "freedom of action" is at least as accurate.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Yes.  Of course, that privacy is subject to many, many laws that have been passed over the last 200 years that reduce the original rights.<br>  <br>  The meaning of 'privacy' has changed considerably.|`|AA11858035	Yes I do,|`|RgO3Sn38aa	Yes.  I read the Constitution.  Did you?<br>  <br>  Amendment IV<br>  <br>  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.|`|SHJ2wC5Daa	Nah, of course not.  What would ever give you THAT silly idea??|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	You bet I do.|`|Hdv4jiSFaa	if you are over age 18, yes.|`|AA11703652	The right to privacy turns on the agreed-upon expectation of privacy.  If you can reasonably expect that your activity/conversation is private, then the state should protect your right.  These days, however, thanks to the Bush administration, there are a lot fewer circumstances in which you can reasonably expect that you are not being surveilled....In answer to your Q, YES!!!|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	hope not, because the government is taking it away a little at a time . big Brother is watching you in more places everyday.. sooner or later they will be cameras in the restrooms. as well as other places you think your have privacy.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	I feel that i SHOULD.<br>  but in reality..i DONT. =/<br>  <br>  which is scary to think about.<br>  theres the government<br>  identity theft<br>  and all that other jazz.|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	I would think so.

I thought he'd come out with a starightforward bad bank solution, ala RTC which actually worked pretty well, but instead he confused everyone.  I understand he doesn't want the govt to end up owning the banks, and therefore wants private capital to come in and buy the bad assets, but this is really not playing out very well.  I hope he and Summers are going to be proved smarter than they seem right now.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Why? I did not think it was wrong.  He was just stating the way most of us feel.  And did you hear how many agreed with him?  Here are the facts of why we are where we are today:<br>  1. NAFTA-signed into law by Bill Clinton.  (The No Job Here Law, in other words.)<br>  2.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed.  Another democratic program.  Run by a crook that was paid millions.  These were the largest home mortgage institutions in the country.  And when they tanked, it took everything down with it.  McCain actually tried to find out two years ago what was going on with these programs and he was told everything was fine!  He hit a brick wall.  These programs were to enable the very poor to have houses.  Problem was employment and income were not verified and bad news pushed under the table so they could qualify.  Of course, the ones that were able to pay that were given these mortgages were brought down by the ones that could not pay.<br>  3.  The stock market has no faith in the Obama Administration.  As soon as it looked like he was going to win in Sept, 08 the market started dropping and continues to today.  It will not recover until Obama changes the path he has chosen, or we get a new President. (lowering taxes or keeping the tax laws we have today, which he cannot do because of this hugh spending spree he is on)<br>  4.  Nixon took us off the gold standard.

It actually requires an act of Congress to authorize your commission. There is no requirement to be prior-enlisted to become an officer. <br>  <br>  There are different ways, to include a couple if you are already enlisted. The best way is to talk to your local Officer Selection Officer (OSO) and you can visit the official Marine Corps website for commissioning:  <a href="http://marineofficer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://marineofficer.com/</a> <br>  <br>  For prior or current enlisted Marines, you can read more about commissioning programs here <a href="http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=194" rel="nofollow">http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/Stor...</a> or talk to your career counselor.|`|3xTNOevjaa	1. Yes, you can become an Officer enlisting as an enlisted person. Theres somethign called limited Officer duty and some other program that I do not clearly remember, but it is possible. <br>  <br>  2.

An enlisted man may put in for certain programs where he can become an officer, but other than that they will remain enlisted their whole career.

Sometimes family member buy the sword to give their loved ones, there is nothing wrong with that.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	1. Nope, you have to have a 4 year degree and apply for OCS to be an officer.<br>  <br>  The enlisted promotion track is E-1 thru E-9<br>  <br>  2. Anyone can buy a Marine Corps sword.<br>  <br>  Just like anyone can buy a bronze star on the internet, that doesn't mean they earned it or could wear it.

One historian, Catherine Allgor, has suggested that they were at the peak of their extra-official power. The great irony is that in 1829 they used this power to crush the influence of a woman they deemed harmful to the body politic; they used their political power to perpetuate, rather than to deny, the old belief that women tended to seduce men away from the virtuous performance of their duties.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Gender/Jacksonian Era
hwbtEVFHaa	First of all, different paygrades, year-in-service, get paid differently. Housing also pays differently depends on your paygrade,  <br>  <br>  Let assume that you do not speak foreign language, single, no dependent, live off-base in San Diego, do not eat the Navy food, not out at sea or oversea, are not in a hostile area or War Zone, do not engage in combat, do not fly in an aircraft (for that, you won't be landing on the flight deck either), enlisted in the Navy at 18 years old and go Seal right away (not prior sailor), and just finished the pipeline (I hope I listed them all). <br>  <br>  Example (currently): Once you made through the pipeline, you will be an E-4 with less than 2 yrs. Your "Base Salary" (taxable) is $1699.50/ mo. But on top of that, you will also get Special Duty Pay $450, Dive Pay $150, Jump Pay $150; total $750/ mo. (no tax).  (housing)$1105 (no tax) and BAS (food) $323.87 ( no tax). <br>  <br>  That is the total of about $3975/ mo before tax, not bad for a 19 year old (about a year of pipeline). But if you are at sea/overseas, engaged in combat, in hostile areas etc... Then, it will be different. You will get paid more as you move up in paygrade/ year-in-service, qualification. By the time you are old enough, your pay will be more, but other things will cost more as well.

You get half of that on your next pay check and the rest in 94 incruments along with your pay.|`|ej9zu4eJaa	Pay in the military is based on rank and time in service. An E-4 with one month in service makes more than an E-1 with one month in. Similarly, an E-4 with four years service makes more than an E-4 with one month in service. Along with basic pay comes all sorts of other bonuses...housing, food, uniform (enlisted only) allowances, combat pay, bilingual pay, etc.

u1bFsnCPaa	Communism, simply put, means a community puts all their goods together to make the community stronger. <br>  <br>  Think of a small rural town, that is filled with mom and pop type stores and farms surrounding it. The farmers of the town bring in their crops, and the ranchers contribute their meat. The people in the town may provide services like butcher or seamstress, or maybe even doctor. All the goods are divided up evenly, so everyone has what they need, but no one prospers. Every in this fictional town pulls their own weight, and everybody is happy having exactly the same as each other. <br>  <br>  Now, this model begins to break down once you introduce human nature. Boys will try to outdo other boys, a stronger horse or a faster buggy; and don't rule out girls, they will also become competitive. If everyone has exactly the same resources, then there is no competition. So one person, and elder usually, has to rule with an iron fist to keep jealousy and competition out of the commune. The elder decides who's horse is stronger, and which buggy is faster. The best looking girl gets the best looking boy, and the elder decides who gets whom.  <br>  <br>  So, communism works when kept small and simple, but only when you have one person with complete control. This is why it worked the longest in China, where the people appear to be happy to have no rights or life. The Chinese government controls everything on TV and radio. Newscasts must be approved before read. The internet goes through multiple filters before it is finally seen, and Google type search engines are forbidden. Uprises are quelled immediately, by any force necessary. The Chinese government would not hesitate to to either imprison or kill someone that we would call nothing speech. However, China has begun to allow some western influence and culture in, and they have begun to look more to capitalism in this failing economy.<br>  <br>  It failed in Russia when simple things like make up and blue jeans were introduced on the black market. Russia was unable to keep it's peasants happy, the food supply dwindled because people would only work as hard as they needed to.

If someone comes at you with anything other than a firearm( knife, club, syringe etc) and you shoot them with a glock, they may keep coming( especially those junkies) , shoot them with a shot gun, they'll be knocked across the room. the principle applies moreso if they happen to have a gun you didn't see... you want them to be incapacitated fast, the Pump-action does this with ease. <br>  I know you say you have experience hunting, but when dealing with people the dynamics are different, you may not have the composure to aim well, and the spread of a shot gun will cover you. And on top of everything, they're big and scary. Someone comes at you it's simple, aim low, pull trigger, take very large step back, repeat if necessary... <br>  I recommend a Remington 870 Express pump, you can get them at any wall-mart. they're cheap and Reliable in the extreme.

I have a weapon for self defense, so i think you are doing the right thing, you never do know about the crazies out there.  I'd rather have one and not need it, than need one and not have it.  <br>  <br>  I'd recommend a Beretta 9mm, specifically model 92 FS.  The reason is that it is a double action semi, which is good for quick action.  It also has good safeties on it which are good for new gun owners, and in the house as they are somewhat safer.  The gun shoots well right out of the box with good sights.  I'd tell you to get a .40 caliber Beretta, but that has a lot more kick to it, and its hard with our smallish hands to to stay on target, and also with we women having smaller hands, the .40 might physically be a bit too large for you.  <br>  <br>  Even though you are a hunter take a gun safety course, cause as you know a handgun is substantially different than a hunting rifle.  I go to the range a couple times a year to maintain my proficiency, and I recommend that to you too.  It kinda turns guys on too when they find out I can take care of myself, which is a cool side effect....<br>  <br>  I feel safer and am safer with my gun.  Some nut comes into my house and I'll double tap him in the kill zone.  F-em if they try to hurt me.  Best wishes to you sweetie.  :)   kisses.....|`|ALM0J9Wlaa	If recoil is no problem.

He had some sort of semi-automatic, but then he said that he practiced with it every day, and jammed it on purpose to learn how to quickly unjam it. And he cleaned it frequently - very important for some guns.<br>  <br>  Then he said if he was buying a gun for his girlfriend who doesn't shoot much, he would get her a .38 revolver. It's easy to load, easy to shoot, very effective at stopping an attacker, especially if you buy special ammo, and it will always shoot - even if it's all rusty and unused.<br>  <br>  I got the revolver. Luckily, I have never needed to use it, but I am pleased with the choice I made. I'm just not the sort of person to take good care of a more delicate gun.<br>  <br>  It was also recommended to me by my Dad to get a shotgun, but I wanted something small I could keep in my bedside table and pull out in a hurry if I needed it.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Living in an Apartment complex, I would not use a anything more than a 25acp, but You should look into maybe a tazer or mace.|`|pxuDr2T4aa	my best bet wood be a nice smith and wesson but have lik sprays in convience places and a wicked knife can do the job also get german shepard they r good protectors

He identified a problem and brought it to the attention of the Congress to fix. Unfortunately the Communist infiltration was not stopped in the 1950s and the affects can be seen today. Communism = socialism = liberal = progessive. They're all the same.<br>  <br>  Here's a somewhat humerous way to explain it: <a href="http://keepandbeararms.com/information/X..." rel="nofollow">http://keepandbeararms.com/information/X...</a><br>  Here is a somewhat less humorous way to explain it, using the Communist's own words: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYX7fhuWX..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYX7fhuWX...</a><br>  <br>  How many Americans support these goals today?

There was much personal antagonism between the parties in the dispute.  Neither side wore halos.  McCarthy was a man's man, but on the rough side.  He was the kind of person that who was not afraid get in a disagreement in a tavern, and then step out side for a fist fight about it.  The people other side were just the opposite.  McCarthy described them as a bunch of sissies,  coughing into their perfumed handkerchiefs.  McCarthy was a brawler and his opponents were a bunch of pansies.  McCarthy was correct in that the people he was attacking thought Communists were merely social reformers, rather than insidious liars and murders.  In his final days, McCarthy became careless and reckless.  He was stabbed in the back by staff members in his own committee, who often deliberately served subpoenas on the wrong people.  In the end he was dying of cancer, and lacked the prudence and judgment to be effective.|`|uWZXR0gbaa	Back in the 1954, it was ok to agree with McCarthy's methods because many people were afraid of th"Red Scare".<br>  Since people had seen the effects of Communism in Soviet Union, people were afraid of Communism spreading throughout the world, which would cause global oppression to the people.

Illegals flooding across our borders and taking American jobs, the ones they don't take, corporations ship overseas to cheap foreign labor. We're losing American lives in Iraq for our President and his minions and god only knows the true reason why. Our debt and trade deficits are at record levels.

NEEReaRuaa	Bonjour Colonel, pour moi c'est évident et ma réponse est NON.

Bernard.<br>  <br>  N.B : J'entends "identité" au même sens que opinion, sensibilité politique etc .<br>  <br>  @ Mme de Stael : vos propos sont difficile à suivre, admettez ! ...|`|6ce3b1a8cfbd4eb4b4f5e78161a24f8eaa	Parfois, je me pose la question ? mais en France, notre "identité" n'est-elle pas multiple, suivant nos régions ???<br>  Vous ne vous sentez pas "agressé", si dans Paris, vous voyez un Ecossais se promener en kilt ???<br>  Pourquoi dans ce cas l'êtes vous par une femme musulmanne portant le hidjab ????<br>  ROBIN = j'ai pris le hidjab comme exemple, je suis la première à m'élever contre le port du voile, mais alors, comment considérez vous le port du "boubou africain, très coloré" comme en porte les femmes africaines ???<br>  J'en ai un, qu'il m'arrive de porter pendant les vacances, pourquoi n'ai-je jamais entendu de réflexions désobligeantes ? alors que cela s'avère différent pour une femme d'une autre culture ? c'est du style "elle ne pourrait pas s'habiller comme tout le monde" ???<br>  Non BERNARD, mais propos ne sont pas difficile à suivre, je crois que nous acceptons plus facilement, ce qui se rapporte à notre culture occidentale qu'aux autres cultures, le port du voile, était un mauvais exemple,  mais pour ce qui est d'autres attributs vestimentaires , je suis désolée, n'êtes vous jamais allés dans certains pays du Sud de l'Europe, toutes les femmes agées portent un foulard sur la tête, cela ne choque personne ????<br>  Ma grand-mère, bien que communiste, est croyante et quand elle va à l'église, porte un foulard sur sa tête, comme en Espagne, vous en pensez quoi ?? personne ne se sent choquée !!! et malgré son age, elle est très féministe !!!|`|01a96229a80c1c74d3056030318c5febaa	Non, tant que l'on impose pas aux autres d'adopter cette "identité" que l'on cultive !|`|b5f7ffe6a57219548e4de1afe456296aaa	Si cultiver son identité revient à imposer cette idée aux autre, oui, mais si c'est juste s'affirmer comme on est, je ne vois pas en quoi c'est agresser celle des autres.|`|cfWkn2pZaa	Cultiver son identité est une bonne chose, car en connaissant son histoire, ou ses racines, on peut construire son futur.<br>  <br>  Par contre si cultiver son identité consiste à se recroqueviller sur sa communauté et ses valeurs en refusant de prendre en compte son environnement ou la réalité, cela peut devenir très dangereux.<br>  <br>  Mme de Stael, les "valeurs" véhiculées par le kilt et le hijab sont bien différentes. Vous le savez bien. Le hijab coupe du monde les femmes, les raméne au rang de fantomes car on ne peut plus les identifier, et en tant que féministe, vous me surprenez. Le kilt lui est un habit de commémoration et de fête...|`|f3364b1ca21284fae506af47b6fc7981aa	Je pense plut?t que c'est savoir ne pas se faire agresser.

Je pense que le métissage, la france poly je ne sais quoi, c'est un désastre mondial. On a oublié, nos milliers d'années d'histoire. Si on est organisé en nation, en ethnie, en groupe, en pays, c'est pour de bonnes raisons. Nous pouvons être en compétition, dans des groupes solidaires. L'individu fait parti d'un groupe qui le protège, qui l'aime et que lui même aime. Il a des repères, une famille, une éducation, c'est ce qui fait les civilisations.<br>  <br>  Or le système fran?ais et américains qui datent de 1787 consistent à nous individualisuer et à nous faire oublier qui on est. Depuis l'après guerre, on a mis le paquet pour nous transformer en individualiste consummériste. C'est le modèle Américain, fran?ais, car quand on s'y penche philsophiquement et historiquement, c'est comme dire droite gauche, c'est du marketing car fondamentalement les diférences restent des distinctions d'une même dimension.<br>  <br>  Un vrai monde polyculturel, diverses etc.. c'est un monde, ou on ne se métisse pas, on reste qui on est, tout en sachant d'où on vient, qui on aime, et qui nous aime. Les couples ne doivent pas se former en fonction de modes, mais basées sur des relations traditionnelles, et de feeling structurante pour chaque individu. Car nous pouvons pas dissocié l'individu de son ensemble et de son environnement qu'il soit familial, culturel, racial, naturel. Les fran?ais et particulièrment  les socialistes ont voulu nier la nature. Alors qu'ils sont issus des celtes qui en étaient de fervent défenseurs. C'est donc la vision romaine qui l'a emporté, celle du colonialisme et de l'empire comme dans la guerre des étoiles.<br>  <br>  C'est l'idée vendue à la télé, aux show buisness, à l'école et dans les idées de la FRANCE :<br>  <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville" rel="nofollow">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_T...</a><br>  <br>  Comme l'empire de la guerre des étoiles. Certes très puissant, mais pas très AMOUR. C'est le coté obscur de la force.<br>  <br>  Un monde différent peut être batti, un monde Celte, qui est cosmique. Car c'est un modèle transposable avec des civilisations extra terrestre, alors que le métissage avec des planctons même douées semblent une aberration. Les celtes, ce n'était pas une race, c'était une civilisation battit, sur une confédération de tribus de races européennes, ils avaient les mêmes valeurs, quand à l'organisation de leurs sociétés, avaient des culture proche, et des traditions cousines. Ils étaient compatibles, mais cultivaient leurs différences, ce qui créait un synergie. Or aussi des divisions qui face à rome, ont couté notre ame.<br>  <br>  Mais cette civilisation a réussi avec des peuples différents à ce qui vivent en concurrence, tout en restant pacifique et solidaire. Hier, c'était plus dur, car nous n'avions pas les mêmes moyens technologiques, de communication, de croyances, et de connaissances. Aujourd'hui, nous pouvons admettre un savoir universel, sur le cosmos, les étoiles, la planète, et de notre place par rapport à tout ?a, ce qui devrait donner une orientation commune à notre destiné. Or pour ce faire, il faudrait admettre qu'il n'y a pas 1 modèle mais des milliers de modèles, comme dans l'univers et le cosmos.<br>  <br>  LA FRANCE a détruit la GAULE, car elle a uniformisé, elle a humilié, et martyrisé les identités, elle a commencé par la métropole et avec la post révolution, elle a étendu ce concept avec ses colonies. Aujourd'hui le résultat, c'est PARIS, c'est Rome, les nouveaux gladiateurs, les plus costauds, comme du bétail mais bien payé, comme sous Rome c'est les footballers. Dans un système égalitarisme et homogénisant comme la France, tout ce qui ne va pas dans le sens des idées, de la pensée dite unique et pour cause, on est donc raciste, non pas par xénophobie, mais car on n'accepte pas ce modèle et que nos territoires, notre espace vitale est menacée. Alors, ce n'est pas vrai, si on est totalement individualisé, et consommateurs. Mais devenir ce type d'humain est ce une bonne chose?<br>  <br>  Non, car les américains et les européens qui répondent à ce modèle, comme des machines engendrent une polution colossale, un déséquélibre planétaire détestable et bouleverse non seulement leurs sociétés, leurs ames mais aussi notre écosystème, communs à toutes les espèces vivantes. Je ne pense pas que le modèle socialiste et bonapartiste de M sarkozy soit le bon!<br>  <br>  Il est temps que les régions réagissent, que ceux qui savent qu'ils sont ce qu'ils sont, africains, corse, alsacien, arabe, algérien, Kabyle enfin etc.. en reprennent conscience, et refusent l'empire. L'empire a tué, a massacré, la révolution fran?aise, et tout ce qui s'en est suivi, ont été très lourdement taché de sangs. <br>  <br>  Le top serait de dissoudre la France et de convevoir une gaule et une france, la gaule serait une confédération d'un espace culturel commun, france d'avant les années 60, et qui baserait son économie sur le codéveloppement basé sur des technologies environnementales. La France, Paris, sa région et quelques métropoles répondant aux critère du nouvel ordre mondial, n'ont pas besoin de toutes les régions, et nous nous n'avons pas besoin d'être intégré pour vivre en paix et protégé. Nous serons ainsi plus libre de créer nos transports, nos énergies, et nos économies.<br>  <br>  Rien n'est irréversible, absolument rien, stopper la télé qui vous lobotomise et vous transforme en machine, voyager et imprégner vous de la culture des autres et ainsi vous serez qui vous êtes et ou est la réalité, et vous comprendrez que respecter son identité c'est avant tout respecter celle des autres. Tout le contraire, de la FRANCE métissé et homogénisée.|`|d875dcf8e3aee8bbdf8c44a1297228a9aa	Non. Sauf quand cette identité entre en conflit avec les règles de vie en communauté. Mais comme le socle commun des droits et devoirs n'existe pas, chaque groupe essaie de faire valoir les siens. En ce sens l'Europe - avec tous ses défauts et toutes les réserves d'usage- est un très bon laboratoire. Si les 25 / 35 pays d'Europe -qui ne sont pas les plus sauvages de la planète- n'y arrivent pas, c'est que c'est assez difficile à obtenir par la négociation. <br>  Une dictature éclairée peut-être?  ;)))|`|dKDaB3Kaaa	il faut toujours revenir  a l'histoire de la creation de l'humanité|`|dxdVfzsBaa	Je pense que ce sont les autres qui nous révèlent progressivement  notre propre identité.

AA11273424	Yes, i believe that is their plan, they have become slightly more elaborate since the bullshit they concocted to Invade Iraq.<br>  <br>  "basically the current stage of what's going on -- there's a lot more -- begins with the Hamas election, back the end of January. Israel and the United States at once announced that they were going to punish the people of Palestine for voting the wrong way in a free election. And the punishment has been severe.<br>  <br>  At the same time, it's partly in Gaza, and sort of hidden in a way, but even more extreme in the West Bank, where Olmert announced his annexation program, what’s euphemistically called “convergence” and described here often as a “withdrawal,” but in fact it’s a formalization of the program of annexing the valuable lands, most of the resources, including water, of the West Bank and cantonizing the rest and imprisoning it, since he also announced that Israel would take over the Jordan Valley. Well, that proceeds without extreme violence or nothing much said about it.<br>  <br>  Gaza, itself, the latest phase, began on June 24. It was when Israel abducted two Gaza civilians, a doctor and his brother. We don't know their names. You don’t know the names of victims. They were taken to Israel, presumably, and nobody knows their fate. The next day, something happened, which we do know about, a lot. Militants in Gaza, probably Islamic Jihad, abducted an Israeli soldier across the border. That’s Corporal Gilad Shalit. And that's well known; first abduction is not. Then followed the escalation of Israeli attacks on Gaza, which I don’t have to repeat. It’s reported on adequately.<br>  <br>  The next stage was Hezbollah's abduction of two Israeli soldiers, they say on the border. Their official reason for this is that they are aiming for prisoner release. There are a few, nobody knows how many. Officially, there are three Lebanese prisoners in Israel. There's allegedly a couple hundred people missing. Who knows where they are?<br>  <br>  But the real reason, I think it's generally agreed by analysts, is that -- I’ll read from the Financial Times, which happens to be right in front of me. “The timing and scale of its attack suggest it was partly intended to reduce the pressure on Palestinians by forcing Israel to fight on two fronts simultaneously.” David Hearst, who knows this area well, describes it, I think this morning, as a display of solidarity with suffering people, the clinching impulse.<br>  <br>  It's a very -- mind you -- very irresponsible act. It subjects Lebanese to possible -- certainly to plenty of terror and possible extreme disaster. Whether it can achieve any result, either in the secondary question of freeing prisoners or the primary question of some form of solidarity with the people of Gaza, I hope so, but I wouldn't rank the probabilities very high."<br>  Noam chomsky - Democracy now interview 7/14/06<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=20060714103454851" rel="nofollow">http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.ph...</a>|`|12a8efe9ad8fd4e71c395f19aeb29304aa	How often do they let you out.

Incluso llegó a forcejear riesgosamente con elementos de seguridad del presidente Miguel de la Madrid en un acto oficial frente al Palacio de Bellas Artes, en que unos soldados cortaron cartucho enfrente de él, a lo cual un oficial se opuso violentamente al levantar el arma de sus subalternos y reprenderlos.<br>  <br>  El 12 de febrero de 1989 presentó a su “gabinete alternativo (un "gabinete en la sombra", al estilo inglés, para vigilar las acciones gubernamentales en áreas importantes)” en el que participaron Diego Fernández de Cevallos, Jesús González Schmall, Fernando Canales Clariond, Francisco Villarreal Torres, Rogelio Sada Zambrano, María Elena álvarez Bernal, Moisés Canales, Vicente Fox, Carlos Castillo Peraza y Luis Felipe Bravo Mena. Clouthier fue el coordinador del gabinete el resto de su vida.<br>  <br>  Clouthier falleció, junto con el diputado Javier Calvo, el 1o de octubre de 1989, en un accidente automovilístico en el kilómetro 158 de la carretera México-Nogales, en el municipio de Culiacán.

Era una bandera que se autoadjudicaron las tropas nacionales, en cuyas filas frente a la corrupta II República no sólo había fachas, sino monárquicos, requetés, católicos, y gente del pueblo llano, que se cansaron de ver una badera con menos de 5 a?os de antigüedad ondeando burlonamente en los balcones de la Administración como símbolo de un cambio y una libertad que nunca llegó, y que quedó claro molestaba a los insurrectos del 34, esa primera guerra civil espa?ola del siglo XX, en que los socialistas mineros no ondeaban ni siquiera la bandera re′publicana, sino la de la "libre" URSS.<br>  <br>  Judith, puede que haya miembros del PP con carné de falange espa?ola de las JONS, aunque a día de hoy no he visto una prueba documental de ello.

Es decir, facha es el de la Falange. Lo que pasa es que después de la Transición, muchos fascistas se metieron en el PP. O votan al PP. Yo conozco a unos cuantos, la primera mi abuela. Y mira que le he informado de que existe la Falange, pero dice que no le vota nadie y voto útil es el PP.<br>  <br>  Esto no quiere decir que todos los del PP seáis fachas, e imagino que si tú te ofendes no lo serás. Pero entiende que con tanto facha dentro del PP, es lógica la confusión.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la bandera... me parece un trozo de tela. Y ya lo cantaba Drexler con respecto a otro símbolo de la patria: "no hay una piedra en el mundo que valga lo que una vida". Me da igual que la bandera sea espa?ola, catalana, vasca o riojana... no merece la pena pelearse por ellas. Toda patria, nacional o autonómica, es una construcción mental de un conjunto de seres humanos, que está bien que exista si se quiere (por ejemplo, yo no tengo ningún problema en reconocer que soy espa?ola y aragonesa) pero que no conviene tomar demasiado en serio hasta el punto de enfrentarse con otras personas por ella y de utilizarla para crear división y decidir quién es el bueno y el malo.<br>  <br>  Muchos idiotas llaman facha a todo el que sea de derechas, igual que otros tantos idiotas llaman comunista a todos los que somos de izquierdas<br>  <br>  ____________<br>  <br>  Jaime: la bandera que "oficialmente" defiende el PP no es la del aguilucho (aunque es imborrable la imagen de Zaplana con ella, y hay muchos que la idolatran) sino la monárquica. La misma que defiende el PSOE (desde que se bajó los pantalones y renegó de la República) e incluso IU (el PCE aceptó también la monarquía para no armar jaleo).

Why are you so concerned about the top one percent anyway?  Are you jealous?|`|i4jp4FuNaa	Ahhhh....is that the aroma of coffee I smell?  I invite you to also wake up and take a test whiff.  <br>       Wealth (property, cash, real estate, stocks, intellectual property etc, etc, etc) is not, contrary to the socialistic view, a large pie that everyone has a "right" to have a piece of.  Quite the opposite.  Wealth, by whatever definition you choose to define it is something that is "CREATED".  It is not god given nor does it grow on trees.  The rightful OWNER of wealth are those that have made good choices in life (got an education, didn't turn into a "baby farm", worked, worked harder still etc) and created wealth.  <br>       Yes, I know there are those that have won the lottery or who have inherited their wealth.  But, the vast majority of those that own wealth are people like you and I who create, operate, own (and receive the benefit of) various "small businesses".  Paving companies, hair salons, used clothing stores, lawn maintenance, painters, and the list goes on and on.  Those are the people who own the VAST MAJORITY of the 32% of the wealth in the country and YES, they DO WORK (and work very hard) TO EARN THAT WEALTH.  It is theirs and they own it. <br>       You didn't create it, therefore you have ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO IT WHATSOEVER.  And as an aside, neither does the US Government OWN that wealth, regardless of whether or not they think they own it or not.  <br>       Contrary to popular belief, we are most definately NOT all created EQUAL.  Some are smarter, some are less smart than you or I.  Some work harder, some work less hard.  The point is that the fact of our existance does not give us a god given right to success or wealth, even with good choices and hard work.      <br>       Here in America, we have the right to Life, Liberty and the PURSUIT of Happiness.  If we draw breath, we have achieved the first "right".  It is not lawful for anyone to deprive us of that life once attained.  If we are lucky enough to live in a place like America, we still have at least some of our Liberties still in place, but we are Free.  As to the "pursuit of happiness"?  Well that is ENTIRELY up to you and I.  If we aren't happy, we can do something about it and can pursue happiness in any legal way we CHOOSE.  <br>       Stealing someone else's wealth or worse, using the power of Government to steal it for us is reprehensible.  In fact, I state in the most direct and unquestionable manner, there is absolutely NO moral argument anyone could make that would absolve someone of the self loathing that must be inherently part of any judgment that would justify the taking of wealth from someone else and giving it to someone that hasn't earned it in full.  Morality demands that any individual who desires wealth must earn it and the commodity most used to achieve that success is man's logic and reason.  That you "need" sustinance is of no consequence.  Sustinance will come to you only after you earn it.  That you "need" shelter...not part of the equation.  No roof will magically appear over your head unless you do something effective to put one there.  The universe only recognizes accomplishment.  If your wealth is achieved through inheritance or the luck of the lottery, it still does not relieve you of that universal obligation.  If you reach the end of your life and you have not achieved something of value (No, it doesn't have to be only money; wealth comes in many forms) whether you are "rich" or "poor", your life has been in vain and wasted.  <br>       Please note that we are not speaking of charity here.  Charity has a place in society.  If you are in need of charity, you then admit that you depend on the awareness and care of another that is in a position to help you.  Any person of character would accept the charity (which benefits only the giver in fact) and use it to raise his own condition to a higher plane where he would be able to provide for his own needs and desires, and hopefully to be successful and the owner of wealth himself.  But should you hold a person up at gun point to obtain what you "need"?  Is that charity or theft?  <br>  If you feel that it is a function of governement to weild the gun for you in order to take some part of another's wealth, then you are no better than the thief stalking in shadows with a gun or knife.  <br>       Stop worring about the achievements (and wealth) of others.  Get out there and achieve your own greatness.  It is there within you and believe it or not, the only thing keeping in inside is you.  <br>       Lastly, to finally and categorically answer your question...It is MOST fair that 1% of Americans own 32% of the wealth.  For the most part, they worked for it and deserve it.|`|yzrUJTNUaa	Why not?  The top 1% of Americans pay about 90% of the taxes, so your right, the top 1% of Americans should have a lot more wealth than that.|`|4d4ad126cb9f6297171d0aa263e7d425aa	Is it fair that Americans control 80% of the global wealth?<br>  On a global scale, anyone who owns more than $4000 in assets is among the top 20% of the wealthiest people on the planet.<br>  Most people on the planet would see your question as a rich person complaining about other rich people.|`|AA11828783	Get a job, work hard, and stop crying about people having money.

Que le puedo contestar a mi sobrina de tan solo 8 a?os, que pregunta, por que matan a 11 personas inocentes, porque las privan de su libertad, luego, verla interesada en esas noticias y verlas llorar por ese sentimiento de tristeza al ver a los familiares de las victimas sufrir. Cuanto mas tenemos que aguantar los colombianos, escenas como las ocurridas en estos días y que esperamos nosotros para hacer algo, esperamos a que nos toque encarne propia, para sentar nuestra voz al unísono, porque cada uno de nosotros no manifiesta de la manera mas humana posible nuestra angustia y nuestro inconformismo ante esta situación, somos mayoría no es posible que una minoría nos angustien tanto, y como es posible que le dejemos esa gran carga a un gobierno que por lo visto esta impotente, que no sabe que hacer, si defender la soberanía o acceder a un acuerdo bajo las condiciones de quienes no tienen autoridad para pedirlas, las únicos que manejamos la verdad, somos los colombianos victimas de la barbarie e inconciencia, que defendemos el derecho que todo ser humano tiene, el derecho a vivir y ser libres siempre y cuando respetemos esos mismos derechos hacia los demás.<br>  Quiero invitar a mis compatriotas a no permitir desensibilizarse ante esto a no acostumbrase, y de alguna manera manifestar su inconformidad y unidos en una sola voz a lucha simbólica de amor y paz, quisiera que todos los medios, artistas y personas  influyentes, puedan sensibilizar a las masas promuevan la mas grande voz contra la inconciencia y criminalidad que hay en este pueblo amado.<br>  <br>  Atentamente,<br>  <br>  <br>  Un colombiano dolido|`|61e4080a53df6b3836ab67e6cffea435aa	Es una gran pena en sentido general lo que esta pasando en el mundo,  en un país por una cosa y en otros por otras cosas pero la verdad es que hay muchísima violencia en cualquier parte del planeta, las nuevas generaciones están creciendo dentro de esa violencia y al pasar el tiempo no sabremos que sera de la vida humana, todos los factores favorecen a la destrucción entre nosotros mismos, de verdad siento mucha pena cada vez que oigo esas noticias desgarradoras, porque la violencia va en aumento y sin que nadie la detenga.|`|7eb82a3fef97474d99640ce8ce3049aeaa	me da verguenza a veces pertenecer a la raza humana,sabiendo que hay gentuza capaz de eso y mas,con esto creo que lo he dixo todo|`|UDg113IOaa	Creo que a pesar de lo triste que nos sintamos por este tipo de situaciones, nunca podremos ponernos en el lugar de los familiares que han vivido una dolorosa agonía por el secuestro de un ser querido  y que finalmente terminaron muertos de la peor manera, pero sobre todo por la impotencia de no poder hacer nada frente a actos como estos.|`|WUDTuEvPaa	Pues que es una pena que pasen estas cosas en el mundo y que deberían de parar esto como sea.|`|cd5a46ed986967f894b5eccc1310a768aa	Vane seis corazones.......porque no mejor esperamos a que aparezcan nuevas versiones o al menos rastros de los cadaveres....para asi definir quienes son mas asesinos, las farc, el gobierno o el sensasionalismo amarillista de nuestros medios........<br>  <br>  Recuerda que las evidencias hablan por si solas y desafortunadamente en este caso la evidencia son 11 patriotas, ?ah! y recuerda que fue el mismo presidente quien en dias pasado lanzo la frase de "rescate militar" a nuestros secuestrados y el tambien es un humano y se equivoca, es decir si el o quien haya dado la orden, directa o por debajo de la mesa, pertenece a los altos mandos de nuestro pais, ellos jamas, jamas van a aceptar su participacion.<br>  <br>  De lo contrario te imaginas el conflicto social que desencadenaria esto.......?|`|d7e8ee1404415f88719ca70f80b87d10aa	Aberrante deberìan detener a todos esos terroristas de porquerìa de una vez.

No es raro ver eso saludos chavos.?|`|fogpEvABaa	Pienso que muchas veces, se mata por callar a la gente que sabe mucho o que no esta de acuerdo con tus ideas, pero en este caso creo que es una estrategia para provocar la guerra civil, a veces matas para echarle la culpa al otro y que el pueblo te apoye para terminar con tus contrincantes. Es lucha por poder a fin de cuentas, no les importa a quien se lleven entre las patas.<br>  Eso es lo que pienso y es una tristeza.|`|l29LaTywaa	es muy malo|`|umVArAOwaa	No sé cómo esté exactamente la situación en Colombia, pero que lástima que el gobierno permita ese tipo de barbaridades; nunca se debe negociar con ese tipo de organizaciones, simplemente hay que destruirlas.

Un ejemplo de ello es Amnistía Internacional y algunos Estados europeos, que hablan de "violación a los DDHH" cuando el Ejército Colombiano realiza actos de soberanía en relación a territorios usurpados. Los terroristas y guerrilleros son considerados "jóvenes idealistas", promotores de una "verdad diferente".<br>  <br>  Creo que el gobierno colombiano debe tomar cartas en el asunto y liquidar a los terroristas, sin contemplaciones. El futuro de los colombianos está en juego: pueden ser un país modelo o un país esclavo. La elección es de ustedes, las cartas están sobre la mesa. <br>  <br>  ?Negociaciones? ?Se puede negociar con asesinos, torturadores y narcotraficantes?<br>  <a href="http://lta.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2007-06-28T131153Z_01_N28235289_RTRIDST_0_LATINOAMERICA-COLOMBIA-DIPUTADOS-SOL.XML" rel="nofollow">http://lta.today.reuters.com/news/newsAr...</a><br>  <br>  Muerte a la guerrilla!!!<br>  <br>  Gonzalo.

For civilian ownership, you can buy an AR-15 or any US made variant of the AR-15 and supplement it with a civilian-legal 37mm flare launcher, available from Firequest.com.

The launcher kicks like a 12-gauge shotgun (you have to brace and lean into it), while the M-16 has no kick and can actually be fired with one hand.

Needing my library records? Thinking God speaks through him? Destroying the already fragile environment?  Raising the National Debt so that the next three generations will be paying for a war based(charitably) on flawed intelligence, over 2,600 of our best dead and thousands more maimed in body and spirit? Ignoring science as if he were Galileo's judges? Destroying alliances with countries that were forged years ago?  I just don't understand why he has such a core group of diehards who think he walks on water just because he doesn't have a mistress (that we know of...yet) OK I'll be fair, I like the doesn't have a mistress part.

And trust me I would gamble on all of the other what ifs before a put a dime on a bet of President Bush's what if! I lived in Texas for 6 years! That's long enough to know how they (Republicans)think, how they walk, how they talk, what they eat. They're like soldiers and their not even enlisted! You have to walk to the beat of their music. And I'm not going to just say that about Texas the entire south is like that! And especially for black people! You would think after all the hangings that they seen from history that would change their tune about even being a Republican! They are the most brainwashed people I have ever been around. That's why I hurried my a*s back to the North where I was born and raised and I'm never moving below Washington DC ever again! And that's simply my opinion. Don't feel insulted if you're from the South.

inYm8AjTaa	No... on pretty much all counts except one:<br>  <br>  "Have we reached another time in history where the name of each political party is getting away from the "intent" of the party?"<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe we have... <br>  <br>  Although Republicans tend to be more conservative, I've met/seen MANY who we "right-wingers" would term as "RINO"s (Republicans in Name Only).<br>  A true Republican should be fiscally responsible with the people's money and work to make sure that government is only involved in areas where government is the BEST and most efficient choice to manage things (tax collection, minting currency, and military/national defense would be examples of those).<br>  <br>  Similarly, there are some very conservative Democrats--Lieberman and Zell Miller come to mind (but then, the the "left-wingers" call them "DINO"s), though the majority of the current flock of Dems seem to be FAAAAR more liberal than the original intent of the party.<br>  In addition to being more "liberal minded" and supporting more SOCIAL (not necessarily personal) freedoms, the Democrats think they know better how to use your money, so they take more of it and want to give it to others who are "less fortunate" or "less able." This grows government to a massive extent and involves it in MANY areas where it shouldn't be--school, housing, business restrictions, etc..|`|XEcj6iZnaa	The terms Liberal and Conservative have changed since the 60s.

People have melded them together to mean the same thing but right wing doesnt mean conservative per say and left wing doesnt mean liberal either but the language has changed so oh well. Think of the difference between a liberal and a leftist- they are vast.

"Anti Big Government" was part of the liberal platform in 1800.<br>  <br>  I read an article from 1846 in the Liberty Tribune (Clay County MO Historical Society) which quoted a Senator from Michigan who said, "The only problem with education is, it turns right thinking young men in Whigs!" (Whigs became the Democratic Party we know today).|`|0RvtrkYOaa	NO, but it seems like many either wish them to be or are trying to force others into thinking that they are.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being Conservative and having liberal ideas and being liberal and having Conservative idea.|`|kq08dAxqaa	I consider myself conservative but I don't really feel as though I fall into the right wing category. as for political parties both the Dem's and Repubs seem to be left of center and more lib than con.

AA10577893	You may file a report through your local law enforcement agency to seek criminal action.  <br>  <br>  Due to the fact your information was not stolen, you probably do not have a civil case against the individual.<br>  <br>  More than likely a local law enforcement agency will not have any luck catching the criminal if the criminal is in another country.  This is due to compact agreements and extridition.<br>  <br>  If the suspect is in the USA, you might have some luck.  But it depends on your local law enforcement's budget and experience in the field of cyber crimes.<br>  <br>  It's all a 50/50 chance.  At least file a report then you will have a paper trail.|`|zjroys7Oaa	The best way to prevent identity theft is by subscribing to a service that will lock your personal information.

I generally forward every one I get to the ISP address. They generally prefer that you expand the message to include full headers, so they can see the path that the message took from the sender. I don't know how effective they are, but there are Federal agencies that do investigate the worst and most active ones. It is hard to do, since a lot of them originate in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa, and it's nearly impossible to track down the crooks. But some are occasionally busted here. It's a relatively new field in law enforcement, and it will be a while before the investigative skills and budgets catch up to the problem.|`|f67cf9dd7e085591697d5754aa6c1be2aa	Don't you think it's a bad idea to send OTHER people to the site where they tried to steal your identity?

The little brat disobeyed direct orders from an officer to produce ID and then tried to incite a crowd of other students.  It may have been a tad extreme, but he deserved what he got.  If he showed his ID as requested, he would have entered the library and life would have gone on as normal.  He is responsible for the decisions he made and should have no case.

Robert C. Dynes and Chancellor Norman Abrams know that you will withhold all contributions until the police officers are fired.<br>  <br>  A university is usually far more tolerant and respectful of students' rights, and far more restrictive on police brutality, than outside the university gates. Having worked in universities for the past 20 years, I can safely say the behavior of the UCLA PD as exhibited in the 6-minute video (not 10 seconds) is inexcusable. They could have dragged the guy out, let him scream all he wants. If he resisted phsycially, they could have handcuffed him -- for 200 years our police did not need tasers or pepper spray to handcuff people. (Maybe he was already handcuffed when they Tasered him, which is even less excusable.)<br>  <br>  There is a big difference between being tased once (often by a low-voltage) in a test situation and having it done to you multiple times in a row in a hostile situation. There have been 73 deaths associated with tasers between 1999 and 2004. Even police officers in five states have sued Taser International claiming they "suffered serious injuries after being shocked with the device during training classes."<br>  <a href="http://orlando.injuryboard.com/defective-products/an-alternative-to-the-defective-and-deadly-taser.php" rel="nofollow">http://orlando.injuryboard.com/defective...</a>|`|ea3a490d2c89842b64761c0fe0839818aa	To be fair, the student precipitated the incident by refusing to show his I.D.  Instead, he should have complied with the request and complained later to the administration if he thought he was being singled out because of his ethnicity.  On the other hand, here one has a student working quietly on the computer bothering noone who ends up tasered by police up to five times and then arrested.  Clearly the university and police policies directly resulted in this student's brutalization.  Should the officers be sued?  No.  But the university policies should be changed to reflect the fact that the presence of police and troops on campus has a history of inciting violence that would not have otherwise occurred.  Students by their very nature can be oppositional - they are often young and full of themselves and not deserving of being brutalized for that.

436bea1ef9b1da9ab0d52490d7878b4eaa	Le droit fran?ais prévoit dans certaines hypothèses la perte ou la déchéance de la nationalité fran?aise (articles 23 à 25-1 du code civil). <br>  <br>  - La perte peut être volontaire et demandée par l'intéressé: c'est par exemple le cas de la répudiation d'une nationalité qu'on ne souhaite pas conserver.<br>  - Elle peut être automatique: C'est la sanction d'un défaut de loyalisme de l'intéressé. Ex: fran?ais qui se comporte comme le national d'un pays étranger dont il possède la nationalité. <br>  - Elle peut être décidée unilatéralement par l'Etat: l'individu qui a acquis la nationalité fran?aise peut être déchu de la nationalité fran?aise en cas de condamnation pour un acte qualifié de crime ou délit contre la s?reté de l'Etat, condamnation pour atteinte à l'administration publique commise par une personne exer?ant une fonction publique, actes au profit d'un autre Etat étranger préjudiciables aux intérêts de la France. Elle ne concerne que les individus devenus fran?ais. Le fran?ais d'origine ne peut pas quant à lui être déchu de sa nationalité. <br>   <br>  Dans tous les cas, la perte ou la déchéance n'est possible que si l'intéressé bénéficie ou peut bénéficier d'une autre nationalité.|`|8DJW6wDRaa	Je ne comprends pas vraiment en quoi la double nationalité crée des fran?ais à deux vitesses.<br>  <br>  Le fait d'être fran?ais n'entra?ne pas plus de droits quand on a une autre nationalité que quand on n'en a pas d'autres !!!<br>  <br>  En plus, ce n'était pas la question !!!<br>  <br>  Merci pour le lien qui, lui, était la réponse parfaite !!!|`|SWU4XFmeaa	on le peut par décret, car c'est par décret qu'on le devient (parallélisme des formes).<br>  sinon, en ce qui concerne les doubles nationalités, c'est s?r que ?a crée des problèmes. Si vous ne savez pas ce qu'est le droit international privé, alors je m'explique : le fait par exemple d'être franco belge permet de se soustraire à la justice fran?aise, au droit fran?ais, car on est en partie belge, et qu'on peut de ce fait contester la compétence d'une juge fran?ais en faveur d'un juge belge!|`|XQqHCW6maa	On peut perdre la nationalité fran?aise si on a une autre nationalité (la France ne fait pas d'apatride).<br>  Le lien du gouvernement répondra certainement à ta question de fa?on plus pertinente.|`|ba5794afd7fb6c3e90acd0fc64c0cc35aa	Après en avoir obtenu une autre!|`|e01542fa74afe5bac7ad5ad3d1222df5aa	pour te dire franchement on ne perd jamais sa nationalité, l'origine de quelqu'un et son éthique est absolue.<br>  on peut-être exclu d'un état a un autre ou adopter un autre statut mais d'où vous venez reste concrète.|`|xR1W3xJiaa	Cette double nationalité est scandaleuse ,cela veut dire qu'il y a des fran?ais à 2 vitesses,où est l'égalité là dedans.<br>  Il faut absolument abolir ce système de double nationalité.|`|RVr3K5CTaa	Un principe fondamental est qu'on ne peut rendre une personne apatride (sans nationalité).<br>  Donc l'Etat ne peut retirer une nationalité si une personne n'en a pas, ou n'en retrouve pas une autre.<br>  <br>  Il y a plusieurs fa?ons de perdre sa nationalité fran?aise<br>  <br>  1) demander à la perdre parce qu'on en a acquis ou qu'on a demandé à obtenir une autre. ?a peut arriver quand on veut une nationalité d'un pays qui n'accepte pas la double-nationalité (Article 23 du code civil)<br>  <br>  2) s'être retrouvé fran?ais à sa majorité du fait de sa naissance en France et de sa résidence en France, alors  qu'on ne le voulait pas, et si on a une autre nationalité. On peut le faire 6 mois avant la majorité et  12 mois après (Article 21-8)<br>  <br>  3) Etre déchu de la nationalité si on l'a depuis moins de 10 ans (naturalisation) et qu'on peut retrouver son ancienne nationalité et si on a été reconnu coupable de certains crimes et délit (Articles 25 et 25-1) du code civil. ?a doit être un décret<br>  <br>  4) Etre déchu parce qu'on se comporte comme le national d'un autre pays, ou servir dans l'armée, un service étranger, une organisation internationale dont la France ne fait pas partie (si dans les 15 jours suivant l'injonction du gouvernement, il ne cesse pas son activité). Là aussi c'est un décret en Conseil d'Etat donc ?a ne se passe pas facilement, et tous les jours (Articles 23-7 et 23-8 du code civil)<br>  <br>  5) On peut aussi perdre sa nationalité, si on ne s'est jamais comporté comme Fran?ais et ceux dont on tient la nationalité non plus<br>  Article 23-6 du code civil<br>     La perte de la nationalité fran?aise peut être constatée par jugement lorsque l'intéressé, fran?ais d'origine par filiation, n'en a point la possession d'état et n'a jamais eu sa résidence habituelle en France, si les ascendants, dont il tenait la nationalité fran?aise, n'ont eux-mêmes ni possession d'état de Fran?ais, ni résidence en France depuis un demi-siècle.<br>     Le jugement détermine la date à laquelle la nationalité fran?aise a été perdue. Il peut décider que cette nationalité avait été perdue par les auteurs de l'intéressé et que ce dernier n'a jamais été fran?ais.<br>  <br>  Enfin, par traité, c'est ce qui s'est passé avec l'Algérie et toutes les anciennes colonies, à condition d'avoir acquis la nationalité du pays devenu indépendant, et c'est souvent le cas, car la nationalité fut une décision collective (il y a juste une exemption pour des élus de l'époque)<br>  <br>  L'insulte de l'Etat Fran?ais n'est pas un délit engendrant une perte de nationalité, quel que soit le cas de figure<br>  <br>  Si on veut résumer<br>  - perte volontaire en la demandant si on a une autre nationalité<br>  - déchéance par décret pour des motifs graves<br>  - perte de la possession d'état

The rules should be written that a part time job is allowed as long as it does not interfer with the ability to perform the job.  So, technically, they could win an election and be an Orphans' Court Judge and a Deputy - if the schedules permit.|`|7d1929a2f50c9f51c8689ee13003f427aa	I live in Maryland, as well have been workingin the legal field for a very long time here, and I have never heard of this occuring. I am not exactly sure what the requirements are for becoming a judge of the Orphan's Court, but my guess is that this situation that you are describing is not going to be optimal. At the same time though, you have to be elected to the Orphan's Court, if you are qualified to take the position and would quit your deputy sheriff job once elected, then maybe there should not be any problem.
bb06ab89a15a6eea5306f8b8eea22af7aa	The physical aspects are beyond your comprehension.  You can be a elite athlete with a HIGH fitness level and you may Charlie Bravo (crash and burn).  The fitness will get you through boot if you ADAPT to the Program.  Do exactly as you are told for starters.  You may have spent your life being told how wonderful you are, but to the DI you are just another "maggot" that he is teaching to survive in combat.<br>  <br>  Now step it UP a S#$^load OF NOTCHES! RECON, RANGERS or SEALS and expect something "SPECIAL"<br>  <br>  Think about boot and how you would have done on 1-2 hours sleep in 24 for an extended point of time.<br>  <br>  Get dumped in the woods with a granola bar and be expected to be at a designated LZ (maybe 20 clicks away) by a certain time.  When you crash for a nap guys come out of the bushes and beat the CRAP out of you and your TEAM.  Oh, I forgot the booby traps along the way that can actually kill you if you aren't quick and smart.  Keep in mind that you have maybe snuck a little nap in three days, eaten off the land and got water where you could.  You will probably hallucinate but have learned how to CONTROL it over time.  If you complete your mission and get to the LZ under time, it will NOT be GOOD enough!<br>  <br>  The whole point is to teach you, your body and your mind to function PERFECTLY under HUGE disadvantages; sleep, food and water.  This would include decision making, orientation, marksmanship and hand to hand combat.<br>  <br>  As FMR you will be a OGS (on ground spotter) and if you screw up you will call a large round in on yourself, your TEAM, or friendlies.<br>  <br>  Are you mentally capable of "dispatching a target" and then holding them against your body for maybe 5 hours without moving while they do what "casualties" do? Then silently running for 12 clicks?<br>  <br>  There is a saying, "IT ain't pain BOY unless it KILLS you!  The good news is that it goes away right before you die".  PAIN tolerance is pushed to the HAIRY EDGE so that you can learn to deal with it and complete your mission.<br>  <br>  So if you are still interested BE PREPARED MENTALLY.<br>  <br>  You will NOT get medals because you weren't really there and the MISSION  never really happened; that is the whole point.<br>  <br>  The "stories" will live in YOUR mind because if you make it and get out you will probably be debriefed and placed under the National Security Act for 30 YEARS.

There is no other unit in the armed forces that is like SF. Dependant on wether they are batt level or Force, they may be akin to a cav scout. They may have similar roles to other special operations units though. What the Recon guys all want to get into is Det 1. And those guys, are more akin to a cross between Rangers and Seals. Very good group of guys to be deployed with.  <br>  <br>  <br>  "what is US Marine Reconnaissance & who are these "Recon Marines"?<br>  US Marine Reconnaissance units are tasked with providing the commander of a larger force of Marines with information about his operational area. Their missions usually focus on specific information requirements which, due to their changing or unique nature, cannot be obtained by means other than putting a man on the ground to observe and report. Recon Marines are, by nature, capable of independent action in support of the larger unit's mission. We also are, as an additional and entirely separate focus, tasked with a wide variety of "direct action" missions which provide a Marine Amphibious Ready Group with a limited special operations capability."|`|3fe7974bb9c912299ec9067c773b806eaa	Marine Force Recon is the Marine equivalent of Army Special Forces and Navy Seals.

It is very hard to get in Recon.  Most drop out after 3 days. Good luck,|`|bc1ef004083388909cb33ade6c7971fdaa	Rich that is not true at all. Force recon is like the Army  Cavalry Scouts. Yes more elite than the common Infantry or tanker but they are Not Special forces or Navy Seal like trained. Not at All. Force recon isn't even all RECON alto of them Guard Missile Silos and A vast majority are truck drivers or convey guards.<br>  <br>  As far as how hard it is. I dint know from first hand experience but I do know X-Marines that converted to Army. 2 commented how much harder OSUT was than there entire basic. I myself didn't have Basic in the army Scouts got to OSUT at Ft Knox that's 18 weeks instead of the normal basic of 9 weeks.  He complained all the time on how much more running we did. He also said the training was alot harder. The biggest difference was the discipline and Marching/DNC drills that they did that we didn't waste time doing. We did it but they focused us on being a (dick) DEDICATED INFANTRY COMBAT KILLER vs a SIDEWALK RIDER.

If you are referring to the academy, then it is possibly the military structured training and the increased learning curve. The entire program is military based (Army style programs) which require the strictest of discipline; such as not looking around at anytime, never questioning an order, using perfect speech and grammar, maintaining the highest level of appearance.<br>  <br>  Sounds simple but it is not since the course is designed to test these aspects. For instance, you may acquire a piece of lint on your uniform throughout the day and that is an infraction for which you will be punished physically (usually a lot of push-ups) and through the use of a merit system. Should you use a slang term such as "ain't" you are very likely to be punished in the same manner as above. Also there is the use of corporal punishment, meaning that when you or a class mate make a mistake you are all punished equally while the instructors let the class know the punishment is your fault since this builds tension between you, the class, and the instructors.<br>  <br>  Don't worry though, all this is for a reason. It builds a person while testing they're fortitude. In the long run it does pay off.<br>  <br>  As for the classroom portion, it is a little more intense then a local academy since State Police are required to service in any locality in the state. Due to this a trooper must know ALL laws applicable to every locality, how they vary, and how to enforce them properly. So the amount of knowledge required is a little bit more intense. However, the classroom portion is very similar to that of all the other academies since they must be accredited.

I think for the people that are against the war, it's the politicians that are actually sending them there that they don't support. I personally don't think keeping them there is right at all for many reasons - but of course that is my opinion.

UYOMlOHOaa	Any violent crime is a hate crime.|`|2e3L5i5waa	First off, a hate crime does not have to have a black victim.  Race is not the only criteria that constitutes whether or not it is a hate crime, it can be a bias based on race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.<br>  <br>  Scenario A would be a hate crime if the suspect killed the victim solely because he was black.  That is not specifically mentioned in your question.<br>  <br>  I see nothing in Scenario B that would indicate a hate crime.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, I say all of this as it relates to the laws in my state.|`|GCweK9Zxaa	Hate crimes (also known as bias crimes) are crimes motivated by bias against an identifiable social group, usually groups defined by race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, gender identity, or political affiliation.  Using this definition, the answer is A|`|inYm8AjTaa	It's A.<br>  <br>  RP--I typically agree with you, but even if B is a "hate crime," it's reverse racism and would never be recognized as such.<br>  <br>  To me, the crime of killing a woman and her nearly full-term baby is the REALLY serious issue here. I don't think he's any worse than Scott Peterson just 'cause he's not white.<br>  <br>  If you want to make an issue out of something, how about that he was a cop? Or that he presumably killed her in front of their toddler? Or that he killed her just 2 weeks before her due date, and that the baby could have survived if allowed to be born?<br>  <br>  Why the need to make this into a hate crime--it's already horrid enough without trying to swing that angle on it?<br>  <br>  Not to mention that if he liked her enough to have a lengthy affair and father 2 kids, I don't think it can qualify as a hate crime--those are typically committed by an indivual or gang against another individual or group PRIMARILY because of their skin color, sexual preferences, religious beliefs, etc.. So you think after 2 years he suddenly stopped liking white chicks? <br>  <br>  Don't you think it had a LOT more behind it than the color of her skin? Like that he was about to be responsible for ANOTHER illigitimate child? Or that he thought he could do it and get away with it because of his police officer training and/or status?<br>  <br>  His reasons for killing her and their unborn child are far more twisted, sick, and complex than your average "hate crime."<br>  <br>  So I ask again, why the need to make this a hate crime?|`|GTz4xQy7aa	It's only a hate crime when the victim is black. Once in a while - like every thousand years - a white victim gets recognized, only then they call it a "bias" crime.|`|HUtfaOPpaa	The first one more because a hate crime involves killing someone of another race like a black person for example the other police officer killed a white lady and because of a personal problem and the first scene also the guys kills the black guy with out any reason.|`|JfDtOvJAaa	Well he has got it made hes black, and a cop. He will go to pen for 5 years and probably get promoted at work.|`|nVBpTsEjaa	Both probably. However, the skinhead vs. black would really be publicized. As for Senario B, what we have is something that ought to be prevented socially. You know it used to be - when I was growing up and until my mid 20's. Where I lived it was NOT OK to befriend someone of a different race than of your own. People think that it is OK because of those being racist and all, but it is more than that. Races and cultures are different and no matter how angry you may get, it's the truth. You can put up a huge fight and say that we have discrimination laws and all of that, but it still FAILS TO sort out the real and hidden problem we have in America today. What we have is a very quiet war between the races. Truth hurts doesn't it????|`|rUrGp33Laa	Scenario A is definitely a hate crime due to the direct killing of an innocent black man. However, it's important you go deeper into the case because the fact that the victim was black and the offender was a nazi may in fact have little to do with the killing. it may have to do with an personal situation that enveloped between the two. However, if even a distinct hint of racism reinforced the nazi's decision to attack, then yes it is a hate crime. And with scenario B, once again go deeper. Yes it has great potential for being a hate crime, but then it has great potential for being something you see gone totally wrong on Jerry Springer.|`|xVRSnrrbaa	scenario A is a hate crime.  Hate crimes are crimes motivated by bias against an identifiable social group (wikipedia).

What a dumb mother f'r!|`|tvNkizDraa	People are 'thin skinned' due to conditioning and collective cultural history.  Basically if someone is 'thin skinned', scratch the surface and the underlying experience of racism/bigotry is exposed.  The only fair way to ask, and to answer, this question is to acknowledge that 'thin skins' are found in all races, thus the racism.  For example:<br>  <br>  If racism didn't exist, the focus on Rev. Wright wouldn't have been a caricature but would have pointed out that the infamous "GD America, Chickens have come home to roost" sound bites were from sermons where he was repeating the words of a white UN Ambassador concerning US foreign policy.  And we all could have laughed because he was right, many of us white folks do not know how to clap on the downbeat.  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/042520...</a><br>  <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9RT65h1cQJ:www.press.org/members/transcript/20080428_wright.pdf+national+press+club+breakfast+transcript+%22Jeremiah+Wright%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9R...</a><br>  <br>  If Holder is wrong, and there is no racism... then all the fuss over some Inauguration speakers was simply because some folks just don't like poetry, whether it rhymes or not.  In all fairness, the question must be asked... why are Whites so thin skinned?  When both of these questions no longer need to be asked, then and only then are we really a 'post-racial' society.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Here's a better question: Why are so many people thick-headed?|`|AA11819105	Sharpton loves to stir up sh@t since B.H.O.s has no use for him he,ll do or say anything to get on t.v.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I guess you never heard of a black person being compared to a monkey before? and i also assume that you don't realize that when people refer to the stimulus bill they also refer to Obama as the creator/writer (true or not). So i guess that people putting those two things together wouldn't have them come to that conclusion. You don't  have to see things the way a black person does because you don't have to. Its not about being thinned skinned its about people realizing what they are saying and doing and how it is offensive to others. Lets  not be naive please.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	NO NO NO!!!<br>  The cartoon was aimed at the CHIMP in Connecticut that got SHOT on Monday by police after mauling his owner...<br>  <br>  It just happen to come shortly after someone (in an editorial published by the New York Post) stated that bill was so convoluted it could have been written by a monkey... I mean COME ON!!!<br>  <br>  Thin skinned? Looks to me like Americans are still very eager to use the race card... whether it applies or not!|`|LJ2OqF1saa	You all will soon learn that we will not be able to say anything negative regarding Obama, because it will offend some.  I have come to realize that America is full of wimps.<br>  <br>  I think that someone if not a lot of people should file a law suit on those waynans brothers, for when they dressed up like white chicks, and make all white girls look stupid......that was racist and sexist.  I also think that you should be able to file a suite against a black, hispanic, asian who puts white paint on their face and dresses up like a clown.......do you see where I am going with this......all this crap is silly, but if all these other groups can grip and complain, and file law suites....so should white people be able to do it against them.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	It's funny to me that when you want to complain about the stimulus bill, you call it "Obama's," but when an obviously racist cartoon is published, you try to pin the bill on Congress, not Obama.<br>  <br>  Rank hypocrisy, I think.|`|ed3479cd30aa26d0499c9236b905e198aa	I'm not Black,and I thought it was incredibly tasteless.<br>  There isn't a person on earth-EXCEPT YOU that hasn't heard the derogatory comparison to Blacks as Monkey's or Chimp's.<br>  I would bet if you walked a "mile" in a black man's shoe you'd think differently. . .|`|i5F2jwvhaa	If mere words offend people they are insecure about themselves<br>  <br>  I do not care what anyone calls me.<br>  <br>  Call me a honky,cracker or any other name you want<br>  <br>  I will just smile and walk away<br>  <br>  Because I am secure with who I am and others opinions of me are meaningless|`|Hb7TW09saa	maybe if you walk in someone else's shoes for sometime, you wouldn't be so quick to judge.|`|lr74sHPLaa	its the same mindset that has been passed down from generation to generation that has and will continue to hold them back.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Not only that, this generation of white folks were not the ones calling them monkeys

But we don't know how it will work.  Many people have wanted that for years.|`|GuD2dFdNaa	No 99% of Americans will be going to clinics and getting sub standard care because there is no such thing as Affordable Health Care. The cost of Health Care will remain the same. The difference will be that there will not be enough money to subsidize the Government plan. So the Government will have to either reduce the services available or raise taxes or premiums to pay for the plan. To think that all of Americans are gonna have free or cheap Heath Care is what Obama's pushing, but it really is not possible in a Capitalist Society|`|fc39cc49e3cbe7f2c2c8ca85b2f59291aa	If Obama is elected taxpayers who pay for their health care through their employer will also have to shoulder a much bigger financial burden to provide health care to Obama's hand out programs!|`|GgXNAMkYaa	The plan is to give the American people universal health care, that is how Richard Nixon deceived the American people by making profit for less health care.|`|870ca89216d8f8c4caeec3d9c90bd88eaa	I highly doubt it.

Unfortunately for liberals, that means lower taxes for corporations.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	They may well find themselves in a position to get a better job and move up into the middle class - and that's a damned sight better than increasing the taxes on the employers that will provide these jobs. |`|AA11598520	Sadly, nothing. They'll still get their welfare and food stamps without having to lift a finger. At least he won't be spreading more of "the wealth" than the socialist, racist Obama would do if he were elected. I'm shocked you support him. (Not really.)|`|1f5717dd20b5e0c84f453019e13c20c3aa	They will continue working just like the rest of Americans.  <br>  <br>  Obama would pay them not to work, but that would ruin our country.|`|3uH441n3aa	They're more likely to get a job than a handout.|`|WZXboi4Xaa	$5,000,000 if you ask me, we will all go broke way before that|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	Whatever they work for, just like the rest of us middle classers.  You know, having a low-paying job is not an incurable disease, nor a guarantee of insolvency.  That comes from spending beyond your means.  So the answer is that if they apply themselves and do something besides complain about how they don't make enough, they can get ahead just like the rest of us.  All it takes is commitment.<br>  Now, if Obama institutes his plan, they may get more money for a time, but its highly unlikely that will last, or that their final condition will be far more dismal than they think it is now.<br>  Wise up, people!  In forty years of watching the Democrats, the one absolute has been that they talk a lot about tax cuts, but the taxes always go up.  And if you think that's the Republicans' doing,  think again.  The Dems have had the majority in Congress for all but 8 years since the 1950's.|`|60x7RSebaa	Are you OK now?

He'll make sure my hard-earned money doesn't go right into the pockets of the deadbeats that think that the reason theyre poor is because theyre "discriminated" against.  No, im afriad its because you just dont wanna work.  Im sure as hell not rich, but i bust my *** everyday and im sick and tired of 1/3 of my paycheck goin to deadbeats.

"Change" was left as an open-ended slogan. It serves to stimulate the imagination of the hopeful because the specifics would never allow him to win the presidency. But first he must get himself into the Oval Office, by any means necessary.. |`|ouEix2a2aa	I am quite sure that you know what "unite" is...No more of ths division between Americans...Why is so hard that people don't understand America needs a change (makeover) the way government has been shifting blame.  We need to get rid of the "old" and bring in the "new".  When our troops are out in Iraq no one complains about "unite" because they are united fighting for this country.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	The only way COMPLETE unification is possible is to silence the people involved, this is what Obama is doing.<br>  <br>  Freedom of Speech will be eliminated to "unite" the country.|`|fc39cc49e3cbe7f2c2c8ca85b2f59291aa	That is exactly what he means! Why do you think Obama will not answer any questions or do interviews with Fox News or any conservative Radio hosts? One of the first things Obama will do is shut down AM talk radio.  Any one who does not blindly trust Obam and support him will be silenced.|`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	No, it means that he doesn't go around characterizing his political opponents as the enemy like McCain does.|`|NwaPbaMSaa	I'd like to believe him that he'd unite, but he shows no evidence of doing this politically.  He has done nothing but the opposite.  I don't trust that claim.|`|gg1PcvE6aa	Cuz he listen every people and no one part |`|CUVYxMF1aa	He's just spewing more hot air.|`|4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	I don't see how he would.

abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	This is exactly what im doing!  But i wouldn't call it taking advantage, I call it surviving.<br>  I left my baby's abusive father and had to get on welfare.  My baby was only 5 months old.  I was a stay at home mom going to college and when I left it was either quit school and work and barely make ends meet for the rest of my life if that or get welfare, struggle but stay in school and better my life.  There was no question.  <br>  I a in college for nursing and I still have many years ahead of me.  I am in the process of getting my phlebotomy (venipuncture) license so i can put MYSELF through school and live a little nicer.  I have 3.8 GPA and am taking care of my baby all on my own.  <br>  The thing about what you say though is people dont care what you are doing or who you are.  They hear nothing past being on welfare.  Even me telling them all this they still call me lazy.  do you know I told some one I was in fulltime nursing school and doinga full time unpaid internship for phlebotomy and was a single mother on welfare and they still called me lazy.  80 hrs a week and a single mom but I am lazy.  At least there are some people out there that understand welfare, etc is needed sometimes.<br>  But i totally agree with you.  There are many on welfare that just work some hours and thats it and they will never be off because they dont better themselves.  You only get 5 years here, then make the most of it.  I couldn't imagine not going to school or getting career training.  It is very nice there is that kind of help out there and i do wish too more people would take advantage of it.<br>  I may have been born poor and I may still be poor, but I'll be damned if I stay poor!!!|`|tDZMJue9aa	cause it is so much easier to expect it in a check in your mailbox every month..we took the shame out of welfare...give them some colorful papermoney and you wont have so many up there trying to buty their cheetos and cokes with it...those things should be banned its that simple..we arent giving people help so they eat junk food and weigh 700 lbs....yet this is our great system...it needs to end..nothing given is ever worth having..you work for it to get it yourself..it means more to you|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Not everyone has the capabilities either physically or mentally that you have been blessed with. How about the mentally challenged mother ( not retarded but learning disabled) that's only capable of waiting on tables while raising a child. Too many variables to make a broad statement as you did. Car accidents, illness, etc.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I agree.  And no, it isn't easy, but it's called adulthood.  Oh, and I think we forget those children do have fathers.|`|c3vPZfghaa	One big flaw with your advice....<br>  it shows you have never had to worry about where your next meal is coming from.<br>  Those who do day after day, worry more about survival, then worrying about how to get ahead. Then it doesn't help when they try to go back to college, and are cut off welfare, on the first day of classes.<br>  <br>  People who already know where their next meal is coming from are the people who worry about getting ahead.<br>  <br>  Maybe you'll get to experience the Character builder if McCain is elected.<br>  <br>  yeah, if only I knew.... Why don't you tell me how you lived on a park bench while working two jobs, having a $20 a month health club membership so you could have some place to shower for work.... just so self-righteous right-wingers who have never had the same experience could call you too lazy to work, when you didn't have health coverage.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	Because not all do.  Many are poor for good reasons e.g. mental or emotional problems or they have physical handicaps, parents who do not value education & so children drop out of school.  Parents who are too drugged out or alcoholics who are not there for their children period!  <br>  <br>  My sister teaches 8th graders and one of her assignments was to write about a current event which was in the first 3 pages of a newspaper.  She didn't stop to think that poor people can't afford to get the daily newspaper and so there were kids in her class who were unable to do the assignment.<br>  <br>  It is a rare and driven person who stays in school & goes on the higher learning where they can earn more.  The odds are definitely against them.  I'm not so sure that under those circumstances I would do as well.|`|fc39cc49e3cbe7f2c2c8ca85b2f59291aa	I think I am in love!  I could not have said it any better! The problem is people like to live on sympathy and hand outs.  I have seen many women and men as single parents struggle to better themselves. At the end they are proud, wonderful parents whose children will respect them more then they ever know.  The reason Obama is "winning" right now is because he preys on the people with no pride or self worth, who hear they will get more money and free health care and want to live like that forever!|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Because the Liberal mentality of class warfare is embedded in their brains. It's the powerful rich people's fault.<br>  I was very poor, but I worked hard right out of high school.<br>  I worked SO hard that I got promotion after promotion, after promotion.<br>  <br>  By age 25, I was a district manager with a company car, laptop, and cell phone.<br>  <br>  I never complained, I never felt sorry for myself, and I always told myself that if I want to succeed - I gotta go for it.|`|V48H3aWQaa	This is what kills me with some McCain supporters. They simply do not have the ability to compartmentalize any situation. Everything is either black or white. I'm sorry, but that is just not the way the world works. "My life went this way and so should everybody else's". That is just not reality. |`|alKMvKvWaa	Why don't you interview a few trailer park dwellers for this answer.|`|DQVze71raa	The problem is many people do not understand that they have that power.  When government (democrats) constantly play the class card blaming all the problems on the rich and the race card blaming all the problems on the whites and the gender card blaming all the problems on (sarah palin now LOL) men or women, people start to believe in he conspiracy.  It is a cycle of abuse.  That is the part that is difficult.  If the poor were truly educated (which is unlikley because educators in universities proote socialist views also) they would realize that they do have the power.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunatley this country is turnig a hard left.  Even the republicans have turned left.  What good was a stimulus package.  Did it change the life of any one.  NO  It was a socialist hand out.  Now they are talking about another one.  Why not just get loudspeakers and yell at the entire country, "You are all idiots and unless we hand you some money you are not smart rnough to survive."  Next is free health care.  Get the loudspeakers "Hey Americans, you are so stupid that unless you let us provide you with health care you will all die".<br>  <br>  With this type of reinforcement how do you expect people to do anyhing fo rthemselves.  Most of them have had there self esteem smashed by the very government that they look to for protection; You know like a child looks to their parents for protection.<br>  <br>  What we need is a government that works towards helping our citizen out of poverty instead of trying to keep them there by enableing them.|`|R8GQZCInaa	Well, your beloved McCain and the Republican tyranny would like to get rid of all of those above named programs (and that means your job). I think these programs are great. They shouldn't be abused by any stretch, but they have a place and do great things. I am not of the mind that if you are poor you deserve to be and that you bring it on yourselves. You don't know if someone may have been on track and then had a loved one die and left them with a heavy burden. You don't know if they have had a medical condition come up that hinders their abilities. You don't know the lives of others. There are a few that really do work hard and put in the time and get it done. When I was in school to become a nurse, I went to school full time, worked 36 hours a week, had my two girls (my husband was working in Arizona) to take care of, I was on my Parish Council, I was the President of the Student Nursing Organization, and I kept my grades up and was on the Deans List every semester. I get that hard work pays off, but cut some people some slack.|`|i6kgDVdPaa	subjected by too many what nots-live too much in gosips.. have no time to think for themsleves- they let others  do that thinkin for them ( and so  many trun out to be opportunists-poverty is a market to be exploited at will-goo deep at the financial problem we see NOW.Once Bush said all must have a home- they went beyond that taking as many credit cards ( as they knew they could not honour).What is that behaviour?

516f7cb451efc573818d385c9d56f4d9aa	il y a beaucoup de points communs entre la situation de 1789 et celle que nous vivons aujourd'hui: <br>  1. Citoyens surimposés, surtaxés, culpablisés, climat de guerre civile entretenu savamment par les dirigeants. ..<br>  2. Nommenklatura aux commandes d'une république désuète, aux réformes inefficaces, faisant à présent joujou avec la constit pour l'arranger à sa guise...<br>  3. privilèges de naissance pour l'accès à certaines carrières, certaines fonctions, passes-droits...<br>  4. Fausse élite déconnectée des réalités de terrain, détruisant le travail...vraie élite mise à l'écart ou obligée de partir travailler à l'étranger...<br>  Oui, il faudrait des cahiers de doléance, mais ils ne serviraient à rien: nos dirigeants sont des pourrisseurs de situation qui roulent pour le mondialisme et des intérêts financiers qui ne sont pas les notres. Ce que les citoyens vivent est voulu, provoqué. On saigne à présent le malade, jusqu'à ce qu'il meure guéri.<br>  En vérité, il y a cependant une différence entre 1789 et aujourd'hui: en 1789, les gens n'avaient pas le choix de leurs dirigeants; aujourd'hui ils l'ont. C'est à dire que les fran?ais sont responsables de leur vote: le système, apparemment ils l'aiment, puisqu'ils continuent à plébisciter ses responsables..Alors, pourquoi rédigeraient-ils des cahiers de doléance?|`|60Ly18Apaa	On ne vit pas dans une société démocratique au sens où les Politiques se prennent davantage pour des chefs que des représentants.|`|9orSDhmnaa	Un DVD de doléances, c'est plus moderne.|`|JzE5PcK8aa	Excellente idée.<br>  Cela permettrait de faire un lien entre les réalités d'un peuple qui"se lève t?t" travail dure et galère à chaque fin de mois pour les courses et les factures et un gouvernement décomplxé qui jette l'argent par les fenêtres.<br>  De plus ?a rappellerais à  nos élus que nous sommes CONTRE les OGM, contre des manipulations génétiques visant à créer des clones....nous serions en quelques sorte la morale de nos élus puisque visiblement, ces derniers s'égarent.|`|xkPQMOPyaa	Très bonne idée !

A l'age de 35 ans il fut élu député de la Guyane puis maire de Cayenne. Il s'engagea dans la marine jusqu'en mai 1940, puis résistant devint commandant F.F.I dans le maquis du Massif Central sous le pseudonyme de commandant "Saint Just". En 1948 (voir son discours pour la commémoration du centenaire de l'abolition de l'esclavage) le sénateur de la Guyanne devint le sénateur du Lot. Il fut président du Conseil de la République (1947-1958 ce qui équivaux à la présidence de la répubique d'aujourd'hui) , puis du Sénat (1958-1968 2ème personnage de l'état) <br>  Certains dans les réponses semblent ignorer que ce ne sont pas les citoyens américains qui élisent le président des états unis mais les grands électeurs, entre autres les gouverneurs des états et autres sous fifres...et que les abstentions sont cosidérables 20 point de moins qu'en France, Donc 40 % de d'électeurs qui ne se prononce pas.<br>  Conclusion/ historiquement nous sommes en avance sur les USA depuis 50 ans, donc pas complexe citoyens...<br>  Signé un mec normal BLANC comme disait coluche, toutefois non raciste breton progressiste...<br>  Bon si les gens de couleur sont malgré tout sous représenté c'est sans doute à cause de Le Pen pas son activisme nationnaliste, ses thèses raciste nous a fait faire un grand pas en arrière, mais ce borgne merdeux étant désormais sénile, son parti se dissout lentement mais s?rement, donc les fran?ais ne sont pas plus racistes que d'autres, mais au fait que de question sur les hommes de couleur pourquoi un black, un magrébin, ou un chinois serait-il meilleur qu'un auvergnat...Voyons voir ce que fera cet Obama ...<br>  <br>  |`|fd702409f751b531f4f7cf1c8a37211daa	"Faut arrêter de rêver, POUR LE MOMENT, un africain même né en France n'a pas vraiment sa place en tant que président de la France" : et après ?a, tu dis n'être pas raciste ? Ben voyons... Techniquement, rien ne l'en empêche, il a donc "sa place" comme n'importe quel autre citoyen fran?ais qui remplirait les conditions minimales requises (nationalité, age, casier judiciaire, etc.). Roger Dupond, qui ne sait pas aligner trois phrases et passe ses journées à dilapider son ch?mage au café du coin serait donc un meilleur président, puisque lui est franchouillard pur beurre depuis 15 générations au moins ? Parce que ce que tu dis, ?a revient à ?a. <br>  <br>  Tu vois, pour moi, un noir président (ou un maghrébin, un asiatique, etc.), je me dis pourquoi pas ? L'important étant qu'il soit élu pour ses compétences et non pour ses origines. Je me fous pas mal de sa couleur de peau et du pays dans lequel ses grands-parents, ses parents ou lui-même sont nés. S'il n'y a pas plus d'immigrés dans les "élites", ce n'est pas parce qu'ils sont moins bons, c'est juste que les "élites" verrouillent le pouvoir. Sans réseau, sans copinage, sans magouillage entre amis, rien de possible. Même moi, qui suis fran?aise depuis aussi loin que les archives peuvent me le dire, je ne fais pas partie du "cercle des initiés", je ne suis pas une "fille de". Si je voulais me lancer dans la politique, j'aurais énormément de mal à me faire connaitre. Alors imagine, un noir super intelligent, très qualifié, mais qui ne sort pas du serail, que peut-il faire ? Il n'a pas le réseau requis et en plus, il faut qu'il se farcisse des racistes dans ton genre qui n'osent même pas se l'avouer. Le handicap est lourd à porter.<br>  Du coup, un immigré qui arriverait tout en haut de manière légitime (et non en étant nommé pour donner le change et l'impression d'une représentativité quelconque des minorités), je me dirais au contraire : la vache, arriver jusqu'ici en partant d'aussi bas, le gars doit être un cador dans son genre...<br>  <br>  PS : des tas de racistes ont des amis noirs, ils font toujours des "exceptions" pour les gens qu'ils connaissent, mais les autres sont des parasites, bizarre non ? et des tas de gens disent : "je ne suis pas raciste, mais si ma fille ou mon fils me ramène un noir à la maison..." C'est ?a le racisme larvé, il est "sélectif" et veut se donner bonne figure.|`|bffabeb29a0401885d7d5e44e5f1a132aa	c'est juste nous n'avons pas la même histoire, nous ne vivons pas depuis assez longtemps ensemble pour que la situation américaine se projette en France...en esperant que ca ne prenne pas autant de temps qu'eux pour accepter les différences même aux sein du gouvernement...je suis d'accord avec toi ca n'a rien à voir avec le racisme!|`|WXiimKcRaa	Tu as oublié les antilles il me semble, au passage le président actuel Nicolas Sarkozy est un fils d'immigré et ?a n'a choqué personne qu'il le soit alors ton histoire de 2 ou 3 générations ne tient pas la route<br>  <br>  <br>  @FreeYoMind VeRepartir en Corse! <br>  <br>  "ethniquement parlant, je me sens plus proche d'un hongrois que d'un africain"<br>  <br>  Pourquoi faudrait il que le président te ressemble ethniquement au juste?

Les personnes issus de culture différent ou de couleur, ne demande pas un président d'origine asiatique, africaine ou maghrébine, cela serai renduir le discours qui se tient en ce moment. Non les revendications sont bien différentes. <br>  L'élèction d'Obama  permet de donner un nouveau souffle, un nouvelle espoir pour une partie de la population immigrés de 4ème géneration et + , n'oublions pas les italiens, les flamands, nos cousins du nord divers et variés, les polonais, ceux  a qui la France a fait appel faute de main d'oeuvres,les immigrés souvent issus de nos anciennes colonnies, ou des DOM TOM -qui ne sont pas tous sur une ile(la Guyanne) - et qui se trouvent bien dans la métropole pour certains depuis plus de 4 ou 5 générations. Tous ceux qui ont aujourd'hui envie d'être reconnu pour leurs capacités propres,leurs potentiels et leurs formations. Ceux qui ont envie de s'intégrer, de travail mais qui ne peuvent pas fautes de préjugés. Ceux qu'ils demandent, être entendus, être reconnus par la France comme citoyens a part entier et de pouvoir accéder a des postes diverses et variés, autres que ceux qui leurs sont proposés d'office comme: éboueurs, vigile ou femme de ménage. Ils veulent le droit de postuler a des fonctions d'agent d'accueil, de professeurs, créateurs d'entreprises, cadres, etc. <br>  Et si un jour cela s'avère être de se présenter comme maire, députés et oui, pourquoi pas président- Bien qu'on ai encore beaucoup de chemin a faire. <br>  <br>  Mais une question en France on élit pour des idées, le sexe de la personne, la couleur ou parce que l'on aime la rhétorique, le costume et la jolie cravate qui vont avec ?|`|DBoDSlktaa	D'accord avec le 1er paragraphe sauf que Obama n'est pas un descendant d'esclaves mais un fils d'immigré (temporaire si j'ai bien compris), seule sa femme est une vraie "afro-américaine" dans le sens que vous donnez à ce mot (et qui est effectivement le sens habituel aux USA).<br>  Pas d'accord avec le 2d paragraphe : la France a aussi "ses noirs descendants d'esclaves" en particulier aux Antilles et en Guyanne, des territoires fran?ais depuis le début du XVIIe siècle (donc bien avant l'Alsace, la Lorraine, la Corse, la Savoie, Nice... et bien avant l'arrivée en France des Sarkozy).|`|MPxwXvPzaa	et les colonies ... tu connais ???<br>  l'immigration n'a pas 50 ans en France comme tu peux le croire ...<br>  en 14 18 il y avait déjà des immigrés dans rangs de l'armée fran?aise ...<br>  pour répondre a ta question... en fait sarko s'est pris un rateau d'Obama ... il n'a pas voulu le rencontrer... alors pour se faire un mini coup de pub.. ils ont mis en place un prefet black en corse...<br>  pour créer un effet OBAMA made in France ...<br>  de la connerie en barre ... pourquoi n'y a t-il aucun ministre de couleur ??? |`|Ydx34S3Aaa	Si je confirme t'est raciste....et en plus tes idées me deplaisent,<br>  <br>  Tu te sens plus proche d'un Hongrois que d'un Africain????? j'aimerais savoir combien de Hongrois tu connais réellement!!! quelle connerie t'en tiens une sacrée couche.....<br>  <br>  T'est pas realiste, t'est arrierée, c'est sur qu'avec une majorité de gens comme toi il n'y a aucune chance qu'un Noir soit élu Président en France...<br>  <br>  "je suis pas raciste" MDR regarde la verité en face<br>  <br>  On s'en fout que t'ais des amis Noirs Le Pen aussi il a des amis Noirs, ca empeche pas que tes idées soit racistes, tes arguments sont racistes  Point barre tu veut pas l'admettre , arrete de te justifier, t'as des idées de merde et c'est tout....|`|MCycG9cZaa	Je suis aussi d'accord  pour dire que les noirs ne sont pas encore représentatifs de ce que représente la France.<br>  Il est donc normal que nous continuions à élire un Président qui nous ressemble.

C'est très pertinent. Effectivement, je pense qu'il y a des absences plus choquantes dans le pouvoir politique. La plupart des politiques viennent du même milieu socio-culturel. Ils ont pratiquement tous fait l'ENA ou des hautes écoles et sont pour la plupart issus de la haute bourgeoisie. Si tu regardes la dernière présidentielle, les 3 grands postulants étaient tous soumis à l'ISF (Sarkozy, Royal, Bayrou). Il n'y a pas de mixité sociale en politique. Je pense que cela est beaucoup plus génant que le fait qu'il n'y ait pas de noirs. Je suis optimiste sur le fait qu'il y aura de plus en plus de gens de couleurs à l'avenir. Par contre, je suis beaucoup plus pessimiste sur un progrès en matière de mixité sociale.

U.S. intelligence stated there was a high probability of WMD in Iraq.  There was a vote, among those voting yes to invade Iraq were prominent democrats Hillary and Kerry, google it if you don't believe me.  After we invaded no WMD's were found obviously.  Saddam was found however and tried, found guilty for his crimes and sentenced to death.<br>  <br>  Terrorist camps were found, young children were found imprisoned along with older adults.  Torture chambers were found, bodies were found and the USA made a decision to stay in Iraq to help those poor people and they have made a huge difference in Iraq.<br>  <br>  The victory will be when we pull out of Iraq we leave a country whose citizens lives will be free from terrorism, torture, and cruelty.  <br>  <br>  If you havent seen this video you really need to, it is an American Soldier talking about the war in Iraq, coming from him the reasons we are there make a lot of sense.  This was played before the election on some of the news stations.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4fe9GlWS8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4fe9GlW...</a>|`|aSuLnvoSaa	Well, Bush lied to the country and said the terrorists were in iraq but they really werent, he just wanted iraq oil. <br>  <br>  <br>  So far over 4,000 american soldiers have died. over a lie. and oil. |`|AfaFCiKxaa	Oil.

We got into it for several reasons, the fact that ONE of those reasons did not pan out as suspected is not a reasonable basis for condemning the whole war.  Of course, as we are dealing with liberal Democrats and radical leftists, what is intelligent and rational is not a concern for them.<br>  <br>  The facts are this:  Saddam Hussein had been supporting terrorism long before 9/11, the fact that he was not directly involved in 9/11 doesn't mean that there was no terrorism before 9/11/01.  He was violating the terms of the 1991 cease-fire, that ALONE was justification for removing him.  He was as brutal a dictator as you could find in the middle east, again, that is justification alone.<br>  <br>  What we are waiting for is the certainty that Iraq will be able to defend itself from within without collapsing into civil war.|`|0fe1e211304d6a14d6b5189ec13c82cfaa	I just heard a guest speaker in my PoliSci class who specializes in military policy who said that we went into Iraq for the wrong reasons (money/oil) but we are staying for the right reasons in that if we suddenly withdraw all our troops, Iraq will collapse on itself.

La respuesta inequívoca es sí. Una lucha cultural está en curso en América Latina entre aquellos que desean colocar a la región en el firmamento global y verla surgir como un contribuyente importante a la cultura occidental a la cual su destino ha estado ligado durante siglos, y aquellos que no pueden reconciliarse con la idea y se resisten a ella. A pesar de algunos avances en a?os recientes, esta tensión está retrasando el desarrollo de América Latina en comparación con otras regiones del mundo –como el este de Asia, la península ibérica o Europa central—que hasta no hace mucho eran ejemplos de tercermundismo. El crecimiento anual del PBI de América Latina ha promediado el 2,8 por ciento en las últimas tres décadas, cifra bastante inferior al 5,5 por ciento del sudeste asiático o al promedio mundial del 3,6 por ciento.<br>  <br>  Este lento desempe?o explica por qué cerca del 45 por ciento de la población todavía es pobre y por qué, tras un cuarto de siglo de gobiernos democráticos, las encuestas aún dejan traslucir una profunda insatisfacción con las instituciones democráticas y los partidos tradicionales.

4b15104e65726856d9bf3e31ee05e220aa	Creo que eres de Costa Rica. Tu país se ha caracterizado por tener el mayor desarrollo democrático de América Latina y su vocación pacifista. Creo que no tiene problemas pendientes de fronteras ni con Nicaragua ni con Panamá, sus vecinos. Y que bueno porque esos recursos le permiten desarrollar algunas cosas que de lo contrario no serían atendidas y estarían en un nivel d epobreza similar a la de sus vecinos: Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras.<br>  En Perú tenemos ejército. A veces yo también me cuestiono que exista, porque los militares buscarán cualquier excusa para justificar su existencia. Lamentablemnet nuestros vecinos  (Ecuador y Chile sobre todo) sufren de lo mismo y estamos constantemente en escaramuzas. Si no encontramos una paridad de hecho seríamos atacados por los militares de alguno de estos países (para justificar aun más su existencia).<br>  por otro lado el Peru ha tenido una guerra interna en donde los maoístas de Sendero Luminoso trataron d tomar el poder  a la fuerza. La sociedad tuvo que enfrentarlos mediante el ejército. A esto le sumamos los narcotraficantes.

TFBXJxuKaa	Por supuesto que me preocupa, ya que por unos locos pueden creace injusticias, muertes de inosente excetera.<br>  De hecho a mi me tiene preocupada lo siguiente:<br>  Elpresidente iraní, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, : en los últimos 12 meses, se ha pasado más tiempo en América Latina que el presidente norteamericano George W. Bush. La visita de Ahmadinejad a Venezuela y Bolivia fue su tercer viaje a la región desde septiembre de 2006. <br>  Lo que es más, Ahmadinejad –cuyo apoyo a grupos terroristas y promesas de “aniquilar” al Estado de Israel, han generado alarma en Estados Unidos y Europa en torno al programa nuclear de Irán– difícilmente podría estar firmando más acuerdos de cooperación con Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador y Nicaragua.<br>  El presidente iraní prometió US$1,100 millones en ayuda a Bolivia en los próximos cinco a?os. Poco después, en Venezuela, Ahmadinejad confirmó un reciente compromiso para crear un fondo de inversión conjunto de $2 mil millones.<br>  Irán ya se ha convertido en el segundo mayor inversionista en Venezuela.<br>  Además de abrir una embajada en Bolivia, Irán esta aumentando su personal diplomático en toda la región. Tras asistir a la toma de posesión del presidente nicaragüense, Daniel Ortega, y recibir dos medallas del nuevo mandatario en enero, Ahmadinejad destinó unos 20 funcionarios a su embajada en Nicaragua, que actualmente es una de las más grandes en ese país, según fuentes diplomáticas.<br>  A principios de este a?o, asimismo, la cancillería iraní organizó su “Primer Seminario Internacional sobre América Latina”, en Teherán.<br>  <br>  ?Qué está buscando Ahmadinejad en América Latina?|`|4b15104e65726856d9bf3e31ee05e220aa	Pues claro que son peligrosos. Peligrosos porque pueden colocarnos al nivel de Cuba o Haití (muy retrasados en cuanto a bienestar económico)...porque es retroceder 30 a?os ( a la década de los 70) en que muchos países latinoamericanos hicimos ensayos de socialismo y el resultado fue mayor aislamiento, poca competitividad, mayor pobreza, mayor diferencia entre los que tienen y no tienen, menos personas incluidas en la sociedad moderna (bajo el disfraz  de respetar la cultura local) y si vamos al campo de las libertades individuales...mejor ni hablar.<br>  A la persona que se?ala que Fujimori, Menem, etc, le hicieron da?o a su país...es cierto...fueron corruptos...como lo fueron Velasco y otros Presidentes de los 70 que abrazaron la izquierda "revolucionaria" en los 70 ?sino de dónde crees que viene tanta deuda externa que no se sabe en que se invirtió?...Hay que repasar la historia...Da la casualidad que en estos momentos los países con Economía más estable y con mayores posibilidades de salir adelante son Chile, México, Perú, Colombia y Brasil, en ese orden.

Como ya lo mencionaron, paises de tendencia derechista como Colombia, México y Perú, o de tendencia izquierdista como Chile y Brasil, estas cinco naciones con una posición mas cercana al centrismo, moderados, son los más prósperos en este momento. No obstante, los paises que han radicalizados sus posiciones estan al borde levantamientos sociales y han llegado a puntos de intolerancia sumamente graves, como Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua, ... y se han convertido en un verdadero peligro. Un ejemplo de esto, no es ningún misterio que Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia y Nicaragua están buscando imponer bloqueos de todo tipo a Colombia: Venezuela con peleas a todo momento y cerramiento de fronteras; Ecuador calumniandonos de entrometernos en sus territorios, cuando solo perseguimos a los terroristas y narcos que se refugian en ese pais; Bolivia apoya ciegamente a sus dos aliados, correa y chavez; y nicaragua no acepta que no es due?o de nuestro archipielago de San Andrés y Providencia, y esos paises se han coalicionado. Ademas, bolivia y ecuador estan tambien provocando lios con perú, ′Chavez y correa con los argentinos se la pasan molestando contra el presidente de mexico, y asi, como vemos no es un slo peligro, sino que ademas al abundar en la region, son una fuerza unida con algo de fuerza y que pueden hacerle mucho da?o a america latina|`|m312CYPfaa	he pensado...que hay que quitar el poder...a unos cuantos..que se enriquecen...en base a la pobreza de millones.|`|yR2ZU9x0aa	HE PENSADO QUE QUIEN BORRARIA MI PREGUNTA<br>  En Tamaulipas lo de siempre en las elecciones, SOBRES AMARILLOS CON $500 Y $700 para votar por el PRI?<br>  En Política|`|J9wuWtBDaa	El peligro para nuestros paises seria la continuidad de las politicas ultraliberales llevadas adelante por los Menem, Salinas de Gortari, Fujimori<br>  todos ellos Chorros procesados<br>  Populismo es un calificativo que se mete a diestra y siniestra sin analizar siquiera de que se trata|`|BI1Bdkl3aa	si pero pregunto que pasa que están borrando todas las preguntas de los de aquí

o7Zr7YgMaa	J'avoue que non, n'ayant plus d'enfants étudiants !|`|8d119ee6dda7014f0de00a9f8333ac1baa	Posez-vous la question de savoir pourquoi on envoie les élèves en "difficuté" en BEP alors que les évèles plus "intelligents" poursuivent une scolarité générale pour finir à la fac avec les conséquences que l'on connait ...<br>  <br>  Savez-vous qu'il y a des élèves qui vont volontairement en lycée professionel pour apprendre un métier (boulanger, coiffeur...) afin d'être plus ou moins certains de travailler et que parmis ces élèves bon nombre d'entre eux sont fils ou fille d'enseignants, de commer?ants ...<br>  <br>  <br>  Rajout: En faite, le BEP ainsi que sa branche bachelière (le bac pro) a pendant une vingtaine d'année servit de de défouloir à l'enseignement général. Tout élève qui ne pouvait suivre une formation "générale" était envoyé en "métier". Celà a donné une image tellement négative de l'enseignement professionel que même l'élève en echec ne voulait pas aller en lycée professionel et préférait tenter des concours.<br>  Ce qui nous a donné pendant plusieurs années des élèves en sentiment déchec et de culpabilité qui prenait fin lorsqu'il quittait l'enseignement pour le marché du travail. Marché qui les attendait finalement les bras grands ouverts.<br>  <br>  Le problème de la disparition du bep touchera une certaine habitude ou tolérence envers des métiers dit traditionnel. Les métiers de la mode, la boucherie, l'artisanat où il était admis qu'avec un bep on pouvait être à son compte. Cette tolérence a même été légiférée. Aujourd'hui on ne peut ouvrir un salon de coiffure, une boulangerie ... sans ce dipl?me.<br>  <br>  Or, la technicité, la compétence demandé, pas seulement au niveau de son propre métier, mais des activités annexes (compta, gestion ,marketing de proximitié ...) font qu'il faut inciter les élèves à poursuivre leur études. De plus cette mesure rétablit une injustice, il faut 6 ans pour former un technicien dans le professionel (bep, bac pro/techno, bts) alors qu'il en faut 5 pour le général (bac/ dut)|`|LAZRQ86uaa	C'est pas nouveau ?a !!

THAT'S why it's called "gotcha".<br>  <br>  Palin could've said something like , "well last month Katie Couric asked this same question and I don't see what it has to do with the issues the Americans face today"...OR...she could've said something like "as a reporter, you should know I've already answered questions like this, and I have decided labeling oneself doesn't solve anything, and can actually hurt themself, so I would rather not 'label myself one way or another".<br>  <br>  She could've said anything.  The words she chooses are her own.  Again, that's why it's called 'gotcha'.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER!...a question like this is, would be considered neither a 'gotcha' or significant because it's not a big deal...it was a softball question that no one will remember or care about.<br>  <br>  But your own statement calling reporters "stupid terrorists" just because they ask questions???...well, that's just acting ignorant.  People have to stop throwing the word 'terrorist' around like its the new "it' word and insult, because you forget there are REAL terrorists out there trying to hurt us, and all you are doing is diminishing the word for the real harm it represents.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Because the liberal media is part of the factanista. Liberals believe in logic, reason and facts and feel they can force their elitist ways on the rest of us.<br>  I actually read this before and some liberal claimed it was ironic Palin complained about labeling after calling Obama a socialist over and over or calling the media elitist or liberal for that matter.

McCain and his camp looked real ignorant when many experts agree that Obama was right.<br>  <br>  There is nothing funny about saving money and unnecessarily using oil. I guess if I was rich like McCain I would be laughing also. But, many who laughed at Obama checked their tire pressure after he made that statement about check your tire pressure.<br>  <br>  Would McCain be laughing if Obama also said that a good way to save extra money is to keep your care tuned and maintained?

3fOk27Wqaa	A President can make Executive Orders without consulting Congress or the Senate.  One of his first Executive Orders is going to be to once again provide federal money for fetal stem cell research. Adult stem cells have already performed better in the lab than fetal stem cells so why the rush to overturn this and use federal dollars? There is a great deal of money to be made in fetal tissue and the abortion industry. Look at the money. And of course, since the abortion clinics "donate" those cells/tissues to research labs now they can use our federal tax dollars instead of concentrating on where the result lies with adult stem cells. We have to have one more reason to keep abortion legal. Abortion is big business.<br>  <br>  However, one of the worst things Obama can and has promised to do is to only nominate Supreme Court Justices that fully support abortion. Since those judges are appointed for life, many generations will feel the impact of their decisions just as we still kill our unborn on the altar of convenience from the 1973 Supreme Court decision. How many unborn babies have been murdered since 1973? This is not a religious issue. This is a matter of life and death. Check out Feminists for Life. There are women from all walks of life and with different religions and no religion who support life. <br>  <br>  The so-called Fairness Doctrine is aimed at talk radio and not at TV or print. Obama and extreme liberals want this passed so they can stop Christian Talk Radio. They don't want NBC or CBS or ABC or CNN to have to give conservatives equal time just talk radio because it is very effective and the liberal radio stations have not been able to stay in business overall. So they can add their poison to the Christian stations. It is an attempt to take away our right to freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  Yes, if you are a Christian or if you are Jewish and support Israel or even non-religious but conservative you have much to fear from Obama and an extreme left Congress and Senate. The checks and balances have been removed. <br>  <br>  Now if you are poor, you have reason to fear as well. By taxing businesses, we will only increase the cost of goods and services. Obama will have to tax and tax more if he plans to keep his promises. More jobs will be lost because more businesses will go out of business. The unemployment rate will go up. And the really sad thing is Obama does not have a plan to give universal health care to everyone. He said lots of things to make you think he did, but he doesn't and if he does how will it be paid for? More taxes on all of us. <br>  <br>  I support health care for everyone and wish Hillary could have won because she had a real plan and said how it would be paid for but people were blinded by the media blitz and Hollywood. <br>  <br>  I have not even touched on the issues regarding being energy independent or the war in the Middle East. <sigh> Obama along with the extreme left in Congress and the Senate have a free ticket to make very broad sweeps in America. We need to pray for Obama to have Godly wisdom in all he does. God is still in charge even of Obama and the extreme liberals. Change the chant from "Drill, Baby, Drill" to "Pray, Baby, Pray".|`|wOg1gVpCaa	Since it takes more than just the president to make the final decision, he can't really do too bad.

Also, he wants to ration gun control ... why? And, everyone thinks he is going to help the poor with raising taxes for the rich... FYI the rich got rich for a reason (b/c they're SMART).  Raise  their taxes and they'll fire POOR employees to make up for the difference... they're not going to let in effect their wallets!!<br>  As far as what he can do in damage... <br>  Luckily, our government is built on a system of "checks and balance"... meaning that one party cannot do anything (drastic or non) without the approval of another party.  HOWEVER, the President is privy to information that a "typical citizen" is not.  He is told about nuclear weapons that we would not know about and things of this nature. I certainly dont want a flag burning (and yes, he admitted to doing this too) radical knowing things like this. |`|94c5e6e052ef88878fe022073682f002aa	The only power the president has is the power to veto.  Congress is who make all the decisons.  He can make suggestions and ideas but thats it.  Thats why I can't stand it when everything is blamed on Bush and his policies and such.  First off they were policies that started in the Clinton administration.  Im not saying maybe the Bush Amin.  didn't handle them the way they should but it was not Bush's fault.  Its our congress and all of governments fault.  So theres not really anything to work about.  We hope!|`|Tz4N1fpvaa	ok, most of the people that answer this are wrong about what a president can and can't do.<br>  <br>  While many things take congress, the president does not need congress to send troops into a conflict for a period of time not over 60 days <br>  The President can also declare marshal law in the united states with out Congress. <br>  The President, can put in judges with out congress, if congress isn't in session, or if congress leaves session with out confirming the judge, untill the time a new president is elected. <br>  The President can use military force, up to using a nuke, with out Congress.<br>  The President can do pardons.<br>  *the president can veto bills that he feels are not just* (congress can overturn a presidential veto with enough votes)<br>  <br>  the thing that Obama can do that would be in Americas worst is by pardoning people that are terrorist. I don't think he will, but that would be the most damage he could do.<br>  <br>  The second worse, is to pull out of Iraq, with out helping keep iran out. <br>  <br>  the third worst is giving in to iran and nuclear weapons.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Alone, a president's powers are minimal.  However, with the support of the congress and senate, a president can do a lot.  When Obama was elected, both the congress and the senate had new members voted in that were Democrats.  Now all three branches of our government are the same political party.  There won't be any significant checks and balances.  As a rule, both the congress and the senate will agree with the president and he will agree with them.<br>  <br>  With enough supporters in congress and the senate, a president can even change the constitution of the US, which is what our government is founded on!<br>  <br>  A president can appoint judges to the supreme court.  These judges interpret our laws and they are appointed for life.  If a president appoints judges to the supreme court that think that the second amendment does NOT give the individual the right to own guns, that right will cease to exist.<br>  <br>  A president appoints federal judges.  He could appoint judges that do not have the best interests of the US at heart.<br>  <br>  A president can tax people and worsen class warfare which divides our nation.<br>  <br>  A president is privy to many governmental secrets---he may leak them to our enemies.<br>  <br>  A president can agree with congress to significantly raise taxes on businesses---and then the businesses could simply find another country for their business.<br>  <br>  A president is the leader of our nation.  He could insult our allies and cause our relationships with other countries to sour.<br>  <br>  A president with the help of congress and the senate can give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants---and give them all of the benefits that we have.  Everyone knows that Social Security is going broke.  This will only make things worse.  We don't have enough money to give all of these illegal immigrants benefits.  We barely have enough to give them to our own citizens.<br>  <br>  The congress, with the support of the president, can pass many laws and regulations.  One of these regulations is called the "Fairness Doctrine" and they will try to push it through again once Obama is in office.  The "Fairness Doctrine" is a regulation that censors media like radio stations and forces them to air opposing views to issues.  For example, if a privately-owned Christian radio station wants to tell it's listeners that abortion is wrong, they would be forced to air the opinion that abortion is right also.|`|2LSx5ru4aa	to see what is the worst thing a president can do ....well just look at Bush. got us into a war that had nothing to de with 9/11.

Regardless of the stereotypes, this election year has been monumental in far more ways than one (ie. voter turnout, first female GOP VP selection, first Black DEM Pres. nominee, and more) -- starting in the Primaries.

There is no question of your courage under fire nor your unbelievable endurance. I watched with awe when you told of how in spite of knowing that you would be beaten you still would not sacrifice your Honor by being released ahead of others who had been there longer. Most of those who have never served  under fire do not understand the need for Honor in our fighting forces. Honor is the glue that binds us one to another that makes us look out for each other. Without a Code of Honor it would be everyone for themselves. Without Honor our military would fall into anarchy. When one member violates the Military Code of Conduct we all suffer. That is why the code says that prisoners must be released in the same order as captured. <br>   I cried when you told of being broken by the brutal beating. And when you told of how the prisoner in the next cell forgave you and said that no one of us can do it alone. And like 50 million other Americans I forgave you too. It must have been an awful beating to get you to violate that same Code of Honor you took the beating for. But I did not hear you admit that you signed a confession saying that we, our troops were “black criminals” and targeted civilians. The same Code of Honor makes it wrong to take an early release also forbids us from signing anything against America and our fighting troops.<br>   We all know that the Vietnam war was not lost on the battlefields and bases of Vietnam but in the streets of America. How many new recruits do you think joined William Ayers' Weather Underground when the news reported that a Naval Pilot, the son of the Admiral in charge of the entire SEA fleets said that we targeted schools and hospital? While 8,000,000 of us came home to the scorn of disdain of the nation in part because of you. Did you ever ask yourself if you should apologize to those of us who felt pain of your dishonorable act? While You came home as a hero the bus the rest of us came home to cries of “Murders”. When I arrived from 18 months fighting for my country hundreds of angry communist lead protesters rushed our bus. I tried to convince my wife returning home with me that they were just glad we are home. But even Hien, whose english was poor knew what FU and the middle finger meant. <br>   Without Honor our military will deteriorate and victory will elude us. There is no one promise that we make when we swear to death before dishonor more important than another. How can You expect our brave troops to follow you into battle knowing that when it came to where the rubber hit the road you traded honor for life. The Code of Honor begins with, “I am an American fighting man I am prepared to give my life for my country”. Many have called me cruel for even bring this up. They say you deserve our honor for what You went through. You and I know that honor is doing the right thing for the right reason regardless of personal pain.<br>    Your friend was not totally right when he said that no one could stand alone because there is a time when s/he has listened to the generals, admirals and advisers the Commander in Chief must stand alone.|`|B7qO5CsYaa	YOU ARE ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE FOR WHY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO PASS AN INTELLIGENCE TEST TO VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY.<br>  LOOK UP HERO IN THE DICTIONARY, FIND OUT WHAT JOHN MCCAIN WENT THROUGH THEN THANK GOD FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR STUPID PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY THE STUPID THINGS YOU SAY. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!!!|`|k1jwNKbgaa	You're a disgusting human being. What he went through....you wouldn't last 5 minutes. <br>  Questions like these just further the stereotype that Obama supporters are ruthless traitors.|`|dseGQ1Jlaa	ya, you are a complete moron.  Maybe before posting idiotic questions you should do a little research.  Are you seriously asking this?  Have you ever been captured and tortured in a P.O.W camp? Do you know what he actually went through in that camp? I highly doubt it.  What makes him a war hero is the fact that he was so brutally tortured and yet he said nothing and then once they found out who his father was they offered to set him free.  And guess what? He didn't accept it because other soldiers had been held in the camp longer than he had and he wouldn't leave until they were set free.  Im sure you can sit behind your computer and show all this disrespect for someone who was tortured FOR YOU and yet your ungrateful *** can only insult him.  Judging from your lack of respect for McCain I can honestly say that you would have never done what he did and you would have jumped at the first chance to get out of that camp.  You coward.|`|i8MX7Opbaa	This is a stupid question. He was a hero because he remained loyal to America during his time in captivity and torture. He would gladly die for America and that makes him a hero. Before he was captured, he had a lot of successful sorties as a pilot, he was an effective soldier.<br>  <br>  You, however, are a sad uninformed liberal with no regards for the sacrifices of your fore fathers. Obama will be embarassed if he read your question. |`|DQVze71raa	McCain is a war hero because of the sacrifices he made for his country during his service in the military.<br>  <br>  It is disgusting that people like you do not appreciate the horror and the sacrifice he went through which allows you to ask stupid questions like this.|`|ekTNJFijaa	you are one of the most idiotic, most uninformed, most stupid, unintelligent, and you are leech on humanity. you fool, you dont know what its like. you are stupid. simple one word discription of u STUPID<br>  People who think (using the word "think" loosely) like u are going to elect someone who is obviously not a good choice if u compare the two.

I think he has maintained a steady lead.  There were a couple of outlier polls that showed him up by 12 and 15.  Other than those 2, practically all of the polls have shown him in the 4-6 point range.  The averages were thrown off by those 2.  Now as they get older, they are coming out and the avg is falling.  This is statistical noise and not a real change.<br>  <br>  I think Obama is holding a fairly steady and consistent 5 point lead. <br>  <br>  I also question whether he is really "moving" to the center.  I don't think he has changed any of his policies.  What he is doing is changing the emphasis and the policies he talks about most.  He is emphasizing the centrist ones and that is just smart politics.|`|l2uj1bDBaa	i don't make my decisions based on what i hear from the political commentators on cable news.

i5F2jwvhaa	Neither should have to register<br>  <br>  A tombstone with their name would suffice|`|Gem96NQyaa	Many sex offenders are highly likely to re-offend.  Murderers are less likely (doesn't mean that it never happens with murderers, but it's far more likely with sex offenders).<br>  <br>  If a child molester, with a high chance of doing the same thing again, were released and moved into your neighborhood, wouldn't you want to know about it?|`|DP0AjzJ2aa	Sex offenders, especially level 3, cannot ever be "cured."  They are always at risk of reoffending.  Murderers usually get life in jail.  Some could be self defense.  Once both serve their sentences, they are free to get out of jail.  A murderer may kill again; a sex offender will offend again.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Sex offenders have a very high rate of recidivism (doing it again), much higher than other serious offenses.|`|RrmO1xkuaa	First of all, victims of any serious crime receive counseling. Murder victims are obviously dead so your question makes  no sense. As far as murderers being registered - there's a big difference here. You've heard the phrase "once a sex offender, always a sex offender", they're considered pretty much incurable. Most murderers, however, do not kill more than once on average (unless it's a serial killer but they end up getting life or the death penalty). Most murderers are commited for personal reasons, i.e. the killer has had a motif and the victim is very often someone in their family or social circles.

You are at fault because you turned into oncoming traffic.  If you could show that the person was speeding, that person would share the fault with you, but that does not mean that you have zero fault.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I am afraid so. It is your responsibilty to make sure you clear the intersetion of highway of traffic before turning across opposing traffic. The other car needs to be far enough away as to not pose a threat of hitting you. You need to take into account the other vehicles speed and how long it is going to to take to clear their path.<br>  <br>  Hope no one was hurt.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	You were at fault. You pulled in front of somebody that had the right of way. Doesn't matter if they were speeding.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If there is an investigation that can prove that the other car was speeding, or if they admit to speeding, or if witnesses say that the other car ran a red light and you had a green arrow, then you may have a case. <br>  <br>  But, based on what you describe, you were at fault. If you are making a left turn across opposing traffic, you have to yield and you can only proceed when you can safely turn without forcing oncoming cars to slow down for you. You misjudged how much time you had, and the result was that you got hit. <br>  <br>  A similar thing happened to my brother in law, except he was driving the oncoming car that hit someone else who turned in front of him. The turning car was declared 100% at fault.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Take pictures and get a good investigator. Any investigator worth spit could determine if they were speeding or not.. Simple physics. Without that you're on the hook. When some nitwit says youre at fault even if the other person was speeding are plain crazy.<br>  If the other person is driving at 90MPH in a 30 MPH zone they are doing triple the legal speed limit and their reaction time is 3 times longer, stopping distance the same and so on plus they are obviously in the wrong because they are breaking every law in that case. At 90MPH you couldn't tell how fast they would be going from the given distance. On the other hand at 90 they would probably completely demolish your car and you would be extremely lucky to be alive let alone walk away with a ticket.<br>  I would demand they reconstruct the scene with a licensed investigator if your insurance won't cover it, but chances are your insurance company might just demand the same thing. It's also very easy to have a lapse of judgment as well all have them every day. The only difference is most people don't get involved in wrecks every day.<br>  You might have to eat this one though. They go by what's referred to as assured clear distance, the distance you can safely turn, stop and so on. Even moving at 10mph people have been killed so without actually having anything but your word nobody here can legitimately declare you guilty nor innocent.. In other words here you're wasting processor space asking most of these bone heads. ;)|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	You struck a nerve with me with this question because my husband was just recently injured in an accident where someone pulled out in front of him (making a left) --- YOU are at fault!  Obviously you did not have enough room to make a "clear turn" because you caused an accident!  The other driver had the right of way, and you as the left turning driver had the duty to make sure that you had enough room to make the turn safely without causing an accident!!<br>  <br>  The other person HIT you (since you felt the need to capitalize it) because YOU turned in front of them!  You could have cause the death of the other driver - you could have killed your friend.......suck it up and realize you were in the wrong!   "She really did a number on your car"......gee I can't imagine it was a picnic for her car either (or her body!) and SHE was doing nothing more than driving in a straight line, in a lane she had every right to be.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	If she hit you she wasn't far enough away whether she was speeding or not. So ya I'd say you were at fault.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	If you entered the intersection for your turn without leaving enough room for traffic to pass, then you were at fault.  If it can be proven that the other vehicle was speeding (good luck with that) and that you would have otherwise safely cleared the intersection, then that would be enough to at the least place some blame on the other car.<br>  <br>  But fundamentally, you made a misjudgement and are at fault.  You entered into the path of other vehicles without providing sufficient time to leave their path.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps I am biased here.  When I was a teenager, a lady turned in front of us and we hit her (I was not driving).  Myface went through the windshield, and after wakening from the shock outside the car, while I was spitting out pieces of my teeth that I thought was glass, the lady came over and told us "THAT will serve you boys right", because somehow in her head it was our fault.<br>  <br>  Your story sounds an awful lot like her view.<br>  <br>  You made the mistake, if not the sole mistake, it was the primary one.  Your decision was the direct cause of the accident.<br>  <br>  Accept responsibility for your error.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	It is considered a swing state because it is fairly evenly divided between republicans and democrats.  It's too close to know whether a majority will be republican or democratic in their choices.  In general, our rural areas usually vote republican and our urban areas (Cincinnati, Columbus, Akron, Cleveland, Toledo, and Dayton) usually vote democratic.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons that more people are voting democratic in Ohio is that our economy in the state has been horrible.  There was a lot of business in the auto industry here which is now gone. In the city that I live in, we used to have seven large GM plants and lots of smaller plants that supplied them.  Our last GM plant will be closing on December 23rd.  Thousands have lost their jobs.<br>  <br>  Ohio was always a strong manufacturing state.  But the manufacturing industries is doing awful and many businesses have closed or moved to a better location or perhaps overseas.   I work in manufacturing and my company will close on October 31st.<br>  <br>  Many people want the government to do something about our loss of jobs and they are turning to the democrats.  They are wanting more handouts to help them through this rough time.  Due to all of the job losses, foreclosures are high.  People are looking for help.<br>  <br>  I'm not a Democrat though.  I don't want a handout.  I think there are other ways to help without raising taxes.

Although those who commit extortion (or any other crime) may also be subject to a civil suit for damages.  A good example of extortion is the case of former Milwaukee Alderman Michael McGee, recently convicted of extortion for threatening to revoke the liquor licenses of store owners who refused to pay bribes.<br>  <br>  BTW, blackmail is "the extortion of money or something else of value from a person by the threat of exposing a criminal act or discreditable information."  So, while blackmail is a kind of extortion, the person blackmailing doesn't need any sort of social power.

Grace à la destruction des Twin Towers de NY en 2001, les USA ont prit position en Afghanistan et en Irak, deux pays qui encadrent géographiquement et stratégiquement l'Iran (regardez une carte). De très nombreuses bases militaires US ont donc été installées dans ces régions afin de protéger et contr?ler la distribution du pétrole.<br>  <br>  Et dans tout ceci il y a la question caché du pic pétrolier. On entend par cette expression la période de rendement maximum pour les puits de pétrole. En effet dans une proche période entre 2010 et 2015 la production planétaire va cesser inexorablement. Elle diminue déjà globalement de 6% par an (production mondiale en barils) mais le grand public est mal informé de cette terrible question. Bien s?r les pompages en eaux profondes ou proche des p?les peuvent retarder l'échéance de quelques années mais sans plus... <br>  <br>  Or tous les pays sont dépendants du pétrole et les USA sont encore plus dépendants du "pétrole à bas prix" que tous les autres ! C'est grace à ces prix incroyablement bas que les USA sont devenus la première puissance mondiale : n'oubliez pas que le dollars est basé sur le pétrole, justement ! Alors, jusqu'où seriez vous prêt à aller pour que votre pays ne connaisse pas une crise pire que celle de 1930 ? Tuer quelques milliers de vos citoyens aujourd'hui pour éviter des millions de morts demain ?<br>  <br>  Maintenant ne pas laisser l'Iran se doter de l'énergie nucléaire est tout simplement une manière de se protéger pour un futur proche. Non pas de protéger uniquement Israel comme il est faussement annoncé. Car d'ici dix ans les stocks de pétrole vont devenir l'enjeux d'une guerre totale à laquelle les USA et Israél se préparent depuis plusieures années déjà et dont nous observons les premiers conflits aujourd'hui. Les dernières guerres en Afghanistan et en Irak ont été totalement fabriquées grace à d'énormes mensonges ; il est à craindre qu'il n'en soit de même bient?t pour l'Iran vu les forces armées US qui stationnent en ce moment même dans les régions alentours :(<br>  <br>  Comprennez que sans pétrole la nourriture n'arrive plus dans nos hyper-marchés, que les bien de consommation courante ne sont plus fabriqués, que les voyages deviennent impossible et les armées sont tout aussi immobilisées que toutes les structures civiles... Les solution pour des alternatives energétiques sont à l'étude mais c'est encore bien trop timide compte tenu de l'échéance du pic pétrolier. Les politiques n'ont pas de réponses ni assez de courage pour se saisir de la question publiquement ! Alors en attendant le chaos planétaire de la fin de cet age, on se fait la guerre pour ce qui reste...|`|A45Wbu4Daa	parce qu'israel est toujours en guerre et a des voisins belliqueux donc, elle a besoin de se defendre et entre nous, ce ne sont pas les juifs qui foutent la merde dans le monde.|`|WhxEuGrzaa	israel est également un état religieux<br>  <br>  malheureusement les états unis aussi, et on voit le désastre|`|ZvI79SXmaa	Et le Pakistan alors ...

VQW4uRt4aa	Mio padre è Maresciallo Aiutante Luogotenente dei Carabinieri e quindi posso rispondere alle tue domande perchè ne so qualcosa..... ogni mese vengono date un tot di ore (da straordinario) da assegnare ai carabinieri della caserma che hanno svolte ore straordinarie, queste ore vengono amministrate e divise dal responsabile della caserma (nella stazione dove comanda mio padre il responsabile è lui perchè ha il grado più alto della carriera degl'ispettori!!!) quindi il limite di ore da assegnare dipende tutto dal responsabile!!! La vita nell'arma dei Carabinieri non è una vita alquanto facile!!! perchè per fare la cosidetta "carriera" ne devi passare di cotte e di crude!!! tra trasferimenti, responsabilità e tanti rischi!!! quindi non credere che sia una vita facile!!! (anche per la tua famiglia!)Se vuoi passare ad un reparto speciale come i ros, devi prima arruolarti nell'arma e poi una volta dentro puoi fare il concorso,dovrai fare varie visite mediche e dovrai fare anche alcune prove per soddisfare tutti i requisiti richiesti (ad esempio se voglio far parte dei Corazzieri però sono alto 1,70 non ci provo proprio!!!! perchè i corazzieri partono da un'altezza minima di 1,90 mi sembra!!!oppure se voglio far parte dei paracadutisti però ho le vertigini non ci penso prorpio!!!) Spero di esserti stato utile (per quel poco che so) ciao ciao<br>  <br>  P.s" Se sei un carabiniere non sposato puoi stare tranquillamente nelle camerate della caserma (sempre in base hai posti che ci sono!), se sei un carabiniere sposato ti devi pagare l'affitto per conto tuo o compri casa!! se sei brigadiere, maresciallo ecc ti spetta l'alloggio di servizio presente di norma nella caserma e se questo non è presente ti paga l'affitto l'Arma, insomma più sali di grado e più privilegi e responsabilità hai!!! riguardo le promozioni sono solo carte scritte e medaglie!!! lo stipendio aumenta poco e niente!!!!|`|539092666d4e4398d6b300451aab4d88aa	per ogni questura, commissariato, ecc. esiste un "monte ore" di straordinari che non si deve superare. il monte ore naturalmente è da dividere per tutti gli impiegati in quel commissariato, quindi, di straordinari, se ne fanno davvero pochi. (oltretutto son pagati una miseria, 6,50 euro all'ora e 7,50 se sono festivi) <br>  in polizia nessuno può fare "quello che vuole". vige una gerarchia severissima. per qualsiasi cosa devi chiedere il permesso e per qualsiasi cosa devi avere l'autorizzazione.<br>  le possibilità di fare carriera esistono...certo, in polizia si fa la gavetta. e non è velocissima. si parte dai bassi gradi e poi, per meriti, si sale. ogni anno viene stilato un "rapporto" su ogni poliziotto e in base ai punti ottenuti si decidono eventuali promozioni. (ogni 2 anni)<br>  <br>  se vieni alloggiato lontano da casa e sei solo (senza famiglia) ti danno loro una stanzetta per dormire, ma per mangiare devi arrangiarti. i punti vengono dati in base al merito e basta una piccola stupidata per fartene prendere 0.<br>  per quanto riguarda lo stipendio...mio padre è commissario, è in polizia da quasi 30 anni e prende 1800 euro al mese. ti ho detto tutto. arriva a 1900 giustappunto quando riesce a fare qualche straordinario.|`|9YwsyzpKaa	Spero che riesci nel tuo intento e ti auguro di fare anche carriera auguri in bocca al lupo|`|G0n62vCmaa	Gli Agenti/Carabinieri di solito hanno pochissima discrezionalità su straordinari, nei reparti con maggiori ristrettezze economiche. Ci sono dei limiti entro i quali gli straordinari vengono pagati (ricordo 30 ore/mese).<br>  Maggiore il grado, maggiore la possibilità che vengano pagati gli straordinari oltre quella soglia.<br>  Per quanto riguarda funzioni ed incarichi:<br>  Come Truppa/categoria agenti e assistenti, vale il principio della libera scelta in rapporto alle attitudini. <br>  Se entri con un grado differente vale il principio seguente: maggiore il grado e le attitudini maggiori gli incarichi e la responsabilità.|`|qbq1zJ1Saa	dipende/dipende..ciao|`|ug1mDe78aa	Per gli straordinari dipende dal lavoro che fai , se sei in volante e arresti una persona non puoi smontare quando finisce il tuo orario , farai obbligatoriamente straordinario. Cè un tetto massimo per ogni ufficio , reparto o commissariato. Se sei in un ufficio ,ad esmpio passaporti lo straordinario deve essere autorizzato dal Commissario prima di svolgerlo.<br>  <br>  Per essere trasferito da un ufficio all'altro devi fare domanda e aspettare che ci siano i trasferimenti , non è difficile, bisogna avere buona volontà e essere svegli , dipende da quale ufficio chiedi.... <br>   <br>  Quando si viene trasferiti fuori si alloggia in caserme per tutta la durata della tua permanenza fuori, mesi o anni...

DWcLYA9maa	Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (Nacio en Mayarí, Cuba, 13 de agosto de 1926) es el Comandante en Jefe del Ejército de Cuba desde el 8 de enero de 1959, tras encabezar la Revolución Cubana triunfante el 1 de enero, que derrocó al gobierno de Fulgencio Batista. Fue nombrado Primer Ministro el 27 de febrero del mismo a?o por el Presidente Urrutia. Lideró en 1961 la adopción del marxismo por el gobierno revolucionario, estableciendo el primer régimen socialista de toda América. Tras las reformas de 1976, fue designado presidente del Consejo de Estado y del Consejo de Ministros. Desde la fundación del Partido Comunista de Cuba en 1965 desempe?a el primer secretariado del mismo.<br>  <br>  Castro trascendió a la vida pública cubana por su participación en la vida política, y especialmente tras el asalto al Cuartel Moncada en 1953, por lo que fue condenado a prisión. Tras ser indultado por la presión de la opinión pública,[sin referencias] se exilió en México, donde planeó la invasión guerrillera de 1956, que obtuvo el triunfo el 1 de enero de 1959. Su gestión como gobernante de Cuba ha sido la causa de un polémico e intenso debate entre sus opositores y sus partidarios.<br>  <br>  Internacionalmente trascendió al intentar obtener buenas relaciones con EE.UU. y, al no conseguirlo, con la Unión Soviética. Luego de una serie de expropiaciones de propiedades estadounidenses que resultaron en el embargo de EE. UU., su relación con la superpotencia se volvió abiertamente antagónica, lo que quedó confirmado tras la invasión de Bahía de Cochinos en 1961.<br>  <br>  Pese a su avanzada edad, siguió personalmente al frente del gobierno hasta julio del 2006, fecha en que dejó provisionalmente su cargo mientras se recupera de sus problemas de salud. Se estima que su hermano Raúl Castro es el candidato más firme a su sucesión.<br>  <br>  Fidel Castro es además uno de los múltiples condecorados por la Unión Soviética con la Orden de Lenin.|`|04d716acab5135279acfd007d08fae0baa	Entonces, ?Por que no lo reclamaron para Honduras? así el pueblo cubano no estaría sufriendo por culpa de ese dictador.|`|72ed40201323bf7b84f6eb315df1daf2aa	hay claro que no|`|1bff45cd60df76f3e5e85ee3fdf74f98aa	FIDEL ALEJANDRO CASTRO RUZ, nació en la finca Manacas, en Birán, Mayarí, antigua provincia de Oriente, hoy provincia de Holguin, Cuba.  el dia 13 de agosto de 1926; hijo de espa?oles residentes en Cuba, pertenecientes a la burguesia de la clase media.<br>  Abogado de profesión, estudió en los colegios para ni?os 'ricos"  La Salle y Belén, posteriormente en la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de La Habana.  <br>  Toma el poder en Cuba, el 1ro. de enero de 1959, después de una guerra civil en las monta?as de la Sierra Maestra, desde el 2 de diciembre de 1956 hasta el 31 diciembre de 1958 en que derroca al entonces dictador Fulgencio Batista Zaldivar (otro asesino en potencia) que estaba en el poder en Cuba, por un golpe de estado, llevado a cabo el 10 de marzo de 1952 y unas elecciones fraudulentas en 1954.  <br>  El golpe de estado de 1952, llevado a cabo por los militares encabezados por Batista, derrocó al entonces presidente de Cuba, Dr. Carlos Prio Socarrás, quien fungia como presidente desde 1948, elegido constitucionalemnte por votación, aunque, como siempre, se decia que las elecciones habian sido fraudulentas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mis saludos de siempre,.|`|2eb432f93966d8ab441af415d9706292aa	Pues si asi fuese, Enhorabuena, te lo regalamos quedense con el, MUCHAS GRACIAS!!!!

AbBmAn5Faa	Yes, he really could be that busy! I am soon to me married to the Corps and so far the past 2 1/2 years that we have been together I am on the back burner. He does not do it on purpose but it happens. Like they say he is married to the Marine Corps and I am his mistress. It can be really hard at times. And my hunny does not let me know anything. He calls when we cans and sometimes does not even do that...only because sometimes it's too hard. and I expect that. At first I was like how are you and over time it gets easier. You just need to remember that he is also missing you and thinking of you. and support is always here for you! we girls have to stick together! <br>  But, YES the Marine Corps can really keep him that busy. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you some,<br>  Angela|`|sajB6Eftaa	I'm a prior service us marine.

Hunting is a good way to reduce the overpopulation of many species, including deer.  If we let their populations run wild, they will eat a lot of the native plants and cause massive crop damage.  Many large animals do not have any natural predators left or the predators can't keep up the with birth rate of their prey.  Hunting is a way of keeping this predator-prey relationship in check.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to have a license to hunt any animal and once you kill one, you have to register it.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	She's an animal murderer.

So, while my son is at his Permanent Duty Station, which is stateside, he pays taxes on his military income (and all other income he might receive, just like the rest of us).  When he was deployed to a combat zone in the middle east for 7 months, he did not pay income taxes during that 7 month period of time, and that income was not taxed, when he completed his tax forms.  <br>  <br>  Our servicemen and servicewomen do not receive much of anything for free.  Reduced cost for some things, like items at the commissary, and other services on base.  (Movies are $3-$5, but not always current)  But they pay for all their meals, uniforms (although they're given a uniform allowance that pays for some of it)  shoes and boots.  They do receive off-base housing allowance, if they live off base, but I'd bet that is taxed as income.  Also, there is a tuition reimbursement program in the militiary, and the GI Bill, which is now only able to be used for school expenses.   Finally, if a married serviceman is deployed, his spouse will receive "separation pay" so compensation for the extra cost of living in two different places, and for the stateside spouse to pay for things like hiring someone to watch the kids or mow the lawn.|`|rYNM67oyaa	Yes. You pay tax on your base pay and special pay and .. not on BAH and BAS whether you're stationed in the U.S. or overseas, unless you're in a combat area.

There is also a .50 deduction for the retirement homes.  <br>  <br>  In addition to base pay, military personnel may receive housing allowance (BAH) and food allowance (BAS).  Some specialty jobs also get other pay based on skills (linguists).  Overseas assignments entitles cost of living expense (COLA).  There is also extra pay for deployments.|`|DbU6PtS6aa	Yes, they pay Federal Taxes on their base pay and depending on their home-of-record they might even have to pay State Taxes.  However, they are not taxed if serving in a combat zone.  <br>  <br>  If they are receiving BAH or BAS then that is not taxed.<br>  <br>  The benefits they get is that only their base pay is taxed...anything extra is not.  |`|mNxHFOd4aa	Yes, military service members (including his/her spouse) stationed CONUS and OCONUS are still required by law to pay state and federal taxes. <br>  <br>  They only time service members do not pay taxes is when they are deployed.|`|6RqkMf5uaa	yes the military pays taxes like the previous posters have said.

They are not worried about the cost of attending college this semester or even if you are going to have money to by your own children gifts for Christmas. Getting sick!

Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. *(This sentence was referred to in a recent untruthful attack ad by Barack Obama.? Click here to read the facts.) Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts. <br>  <br>  Obama wants to add more tax and more laws and more penalties. while McCain (Who would not have been my first choice) wants to give the people freedom of choice.

It isn't healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|T1L70ZgEaa	well? if Obama looses will there be riots? if McCain looses, will there be riots ???  there will be no, yes, none, no riots if McCain looses. but???? there will be riots of obama looses. think, just think,,,, for a minute about that. who are his supporters??? what is their moral values??? it is yet to be seen. but in seven days you will all see ,, who your man,,, really is. and what he stands for. god bless us all. god, save us.

I remember Bush saying "I want to take this country in a new direction" and "we're gonna create jobs and cut taxes" " blah bla blah bla blah......<br>  <br>  He didn't do those things. He destroyed our country and our economy. He got us into an immoral war, too. Oh yeah, he did give tax cuts for the wealthy...that's right. Now it's all about fear and "security"|`|9c3d57b781184db8448192ff51aafff6aa	It's not ethical, but it's all they've got and it's worked before.

Your leader is the one who said it, not ours.  |`|GliL1jbTaa	1) I've not called him a Muslim.  I've never claimed it.  I've never believed it.

He hangs out with Ayers and religious fanatics, wants to pull out of iraq, giving the terrorists a set victory day, and yes, he does want to spread the wealth. I'm not so sure about the whole Muslim thing. That's kinda irrelevant, and i dont think it's true.|`|OQ4OrWP9aa	because McCain hired the same Rove guys to run his campaign. It's what they do.

Plenty of posters on Yahoo have strong Republican feelings and are informed about them (fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, etc.).

cWfpkzGQaa	A security force funded and manned as well as the military does not sound like border patrol or community service.

(Just Google it if you doubt it.) So why cant this happen in America? It is happening.<br>  <br>  Now, this document, An Examination of Obama's Use of Hidden Hypnosis Techniques in His Speeches is really spreading. Many people, including young people, are starting to wake up.<br>  <br>  Young people have come up with a saying, "Don't drink the kool-aid Obama is pushing on you."<br>  <br>  Obama has no accomplishments, we don't know him, he wrote a memoir, he has racist connections, he is using hypnosis, and he thinks he's the Messiah and that he should be in control of the world. We've seen this story before in Germany in the 1930's, haven't we? We know what happened there.<br>  <br>  Obama's use of hypnosis in speeches is why:<br>  -nothing sticks to him<br>  -the huge crowds<br>  -the huge money contributions<br>  -the mesmerized effect, especially in young people, who, because of their imaginations are more susceptible to hypnosis (read the document)<br>  -the exorbitant election fraud, rule-breaking and bias in the media<br>  -he gets away with changing every position<br>  -people are calling him the "greatest leader of a generation" with no accomplishments<br>  <br>  You have to read this document to understand how his hypnosis works.

Does the average person want to be put on a stand, and have everyone look up to them. No, so we look for people to do it for us. Then we can put the blame on them for messing up our lives or applaud them for making it better. <br>  <br>  This is the same reason that so many people don't vote. It is easier to let everyone else do things. <br>  <br>  Most people don't care what happens, as long as what happens doesn't effect them directly.<br>  <br>  We look to the people who we think are crazy enough to put themselves on a 12-24 month long race to see who can stand tallest, preach the loudest, and spend the most money, then we expect him/her to not only do everything right, but to not look bad, because we elected him. <br>  <br>  *yes it was a little bit of a circle, but the answer isn't just a certain way its perception*<br>  <br>  A dem for McCain.|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	Because the new young voters are basically uninformed, and uneducated...I didn't want to be uncouth and say stupid, so I used intelligent words to express what they are.|`|mp1hh7dMaa	Hello,  Nothings changed!, still have the people that sit and dream, and them who make a dream come true.

It is only necessary when you are in custody, and when you are being questioned about the crime you are in custody for. <br>  <br>  Miranda applies to any statements you gave while in custody. If your rights are not read, the answers you give to questions are not admissible in court. <br>  <br>  It does not affect the original charge, it does not mean the case will be thrown out, it just means your answers will not be used against you. <br>  <br>  As far as the phone, a police officer is allowed to restrict someone from using a phone while they are being investigated, or while they are in custody. They can not look at the contents, but they can take it from you so you can't use it. This is for safety reasons only, not for investigative purposes.|`|dHjjLozcaa	okay i took a criminal law class, i love this subject. if you were not read your miranda rights, than that just mean that anything that you may have said or you admitted to during your arrest cannot be used against you in the court. i hope you have a lawyer for the whole phone thing.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	The supreme court has ruled that a US citizen could reasonably be expected to know his or her rights by now.  Miranda is not required.<br>  <br>  As for the rest get a lawyer.|`|d8W6HRCraa	Get a good lawyer because your case could get canceled because you have to get your miranda rights read to you.|`|98a5c705254e76745e000a1bd7e067edaa	What were you arrested for|`|5aKUV5afaa	There is a subtle transition and difference between being arrested and interrogated or questioned.  Your case is simple.  You got bullied into giving the Police what they wanted.  You were not aware of your rights, and at that point they had no reason to give you Miranda.  The second they told you that "they were going through an investigation" was when they should have given you Miranda.   You do have a case against them.  You at least have a defense.<br>  <br>  And to all reading this, you can give me a thumbs down all you want.  DO NOT TALK TO THE COPS!  Ask for a lawyer immediately.   A lot of people have this theory that if you have nothing to hide, you don't need a lawyer.  HA!  Get into that interogation room or a jail cell without one.  <br>  <br>  All your answers should be, "I want a lawyer."  "I want representation"  "Where's my lawyer?" |`|wPbXzJhdaa	As others have said, a police officer isn't under ANY obligation to read you your miranda rights. This is a common misconception. |`|ZczRJSqPaa	That means you could admit any thing you did and they can use it against you atall in court...|`|7T2ebqUNaa	To answer the first part of your question let me clarify the law regarding Miranda warnings. Miranda warnings are triggered by two things that both must be present to require Miranda- Custody AND Interrogation. If an officer simply arrests you they do not have to read you your miranda rights, they simply need to advise you of your right to an attorney. If an officer arrests you AND is questioning you they do not need to read you your Miranda rights. If an officer is questioning you but you are not in custody they do at have to read your your Miranda rights. Only when both elements are present are Police required to read you your miranda warnings.<br>  <br>  If you are in custody and start making statements without being prompted by police they can be used against you. If, however, you are in custody and the Police are asking you the questions without reading you your Miranda warnings the statements you make cannot be used in trial. If the Police were still investigating the crime and you were not in custody then they were not required to read you your Miranda warnings. <br>  <br>  For your second question, The Police cannot legally force you to unlock your phone to show them anything without a search warrant, or possibly some sort of exigent circumstances such as a persons life being in immediate danger and the information on your phone was needed to find them. If your phone was locked and they told you you had to open it without a warrant then they are violating your fourth amendment rights. I am pretty sure about this but you may want to consult a lawyer and explain the circumstances to be absolutely sure.
AK4Iw118aa	Because the media has a tendency to have smart people in it, and Democrats are way smarter than Republicans. That is in fact the answer. Harsh but true. Deal with it.|`|ebrlN6TXaa	Did you happen to notice the lies and mud slinging the Republicans were slinging.  The Republican media panders to a different class of people.  The Democrats are a more intellectual and want the truth from the media.  |`|hMLmrPbgaa	I guess you didn't live through the last 8 years of the media giving Bush a pass.|`|aTAUOI8caa	It doesn't.<br>  <br>  <br>  The media has a bias, but its not political.  Its based on popularity.<br>  <br>  In truth, George W. Bush got better coverage in both 2000 and in 2004 over both Gore and Kerry.  Why?  Because George W. Bush, for all his faults, has a personality.  The same cannot be said for Gore and Kerry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The idea that the media is liberal came from studies done that found that the majority of journalists lean to the political left.  What that study also found, but is rarely discussed, is that editors (the ones who decide what gets into the paper or on the air) lean to the political right.<br>  <br>  What usually happens is that the left-leaning journalist turns in a left-leaning report.  But then the right-leaning editor makes him take it back and do it again.  The journalist keeps doing it over again until the two reach a point where the editor feels its fair to his side, but the journalist does not feel he sacrificed his own integrity.  And that point is almost always in the center, not too far left or too far right.<br>  <br>  It doesn't always work, like for the left-leaning New York Times or the right-leaning New York Post.  But overall, it usually works and makes most papers and TV shows center.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But the media favors the popular candidate, not the left candidate or the right candidate.  Just the popular one that sells papers or gets ratings.|`|AA12020119	there must be 200 Conservative talk shows and many right leaning newspapers like the Post, Enquirer, the Boston Herald, Manchester Union Leader, Fosters Daily Democrat!<br>  <br>  I just think you probably believe all should be a station that lies all the time, like Fox!<br>  <br>  Simple answer is they don't.

RuUUPWYUaa	A Gore Presidency would not have continued reading "My Pet Goat", when advised of a national crises or attack. A Gore Presidency would have attacked those responsible for the 9/11 attack and left Iraq along. Our concentration would have focus on Al Quida in Afghanistan; and perhaps prevailed without the lingering 7 years of wasted revenues, causing a severe negative impact on our nations economy.  |`|3UTlASavaa	I don't believe that the Taliban would have been directly attacked but I do believe that he would have tried to go after bin Laden directly rather than using the Northern Alliance to topple the Taliban and remove the state support the bin Laden was using.  Since we would have had more exposure Pakistan would not have been able to support us and likely the former Soviet Republics would not have been able to support us either.  <br>  <br>  As a result our troops would be dependent on a very long supply line and would have been isolated in hostile territory.  It would have been expensive, extremely dangerous and more like Desert One (Carter's military adventure) than anyone would have been comfortable with.<br>  <br>  The possibility of a military reverse to US troops directly deployed in a hostile Islamic extremist country would have brought significant increases in attempts to attack us here (since we appeared so darn weak).  Given the incredible lack of preparedness some of these attempts would have been successful.  Where we went from there would have been hard to determine but let's be clear that Gore would have been a one term President.  I don't know if Bush would have been the nominee, Probably more likely Powell, and he would have been our first black President.<br>  <br>  I do agree that he would not have gone after Iraq.  I do not feel that there would be any negative consequences to us from that change.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	The first thing Al Gore would have done is fine the terrorists who destroyed the WTC, for putting so much smoke in the air, because the contribution to "global warming" and he'd be upset that he didn't get a cut from the cap and trade.  Then he'd fine the builders of the WTC for not forseeing a "greener" collapse.  <br>  <br>  After that, Osama bin-Laden would have laughed himself into a heart attack at the back-asswards way our "leaders" had reacted to a terrorist attack on such a scale.  We'd have a better economy, but our infrastructure would have been trashed by the stupid terrorists we let into this country, and their penchant for blowing things up.  |`|9rhmeb7raa	Be checked into the psychiatric unit of the Bethesda National Naval Medical Center in a catatonic state. Then, under the provisions of the 25th Amendment, John Edwards would have assumed the duties of President and filed a contingency fee law suit against Al Queda. <br>  Mister Gore served as Vice President in an administration that considered the attack on the Khobar Towers barracks, the USS Cole, two of our embassies and the original terrorist attack on the World Trade Center as "law enforcement problems".  |`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	He would have surrendered to someone.

We would have locked up all funds for the Terrorist families.<br>  <br>  His vice president wouldn't have shot a friend in Texas, thats for sure.<br>  <br>  alot of what happend would have happend under any president, the housing collapse would have happend, how it would have been handled would have been diffrent. Republicans would have held congress by now, and they would have not passed the 700 billion though.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace|`|1ca97aeb1adb840d4eb477bdf71f8911aa	Doubtfull the same place. Like the 93 Bombings gore would have probably treated 9/1 like a criminal offense not like a terrorist strike. <br>  <br>  We would not be in Afganistan or iraq but we would have had much more terrorist attacks since he wouldn't have been stopping them.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	AlGore would have gone to court to get an order to force the islamofascist terrorists to buy carbon credits to offset the CO2 that was produced by the attack.|`|MDFqos60aa	911 would have been called off because the cabal wouldn't have had their man in the whitehouse to begin the setup to turn us into a fascist state. |`|L7BSLB6faa	Al Gore would have paid attention to the intelligence available to him, and he would have been paying attention to Al Qaeda all along, thus 9/11 would not have happened at all.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	tuck his tail and give in.<br>  <br>  We wouldnt be in the M.E.  economicly better but laughed at by the world. he wouldnt go into war.|`|bf4757f4f354855ce33fb48482a8ccb5aa	We would all be holding hands and riding bicycles.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Except for Gore, he would still be flying on his private jet.|`|KWa9vPVQaa	I do not think the powers that be in this country, would have let it be any different than it was!!! bet me!!!|`|P342KClHaa	He would have curled up into a tiny ball, sucked his thumb, and cried for his mommy. And I don't mean that as uninformed and inflammatory. I seriously don't think that he would have surrounded himself with the right people. We wouldn't have gone to war at all, and we would have suffered a lot more attacks as the rest of the terrorists in the world saw the yellow stripe running down our backs. <br>  <br>  Not that Bush did any better. He probably did cry for his mama, but Cheney ran the show in the background.  And I sure as hell don't think that Obama will do any better, either. And mark my words (though I pray that I am wrong), an attack will happen by May. God help us.<br>  <br>  |`|rvX7Wgtyaa	Al Gore would have responded more diplomatically. He'd have use surgical strikes to take out less than key targets. He would have economically caused us to be paralyzed for rather longer.

Such as closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility without having any plan (no exit strategy - LOL) on what to do with the detainees currently there, or future detainees.

Then there's the economic non-stimulus pork barrel spending act. It will not stimulate the economy, it will not create jobs.

dGlhYAmVaa	Bush was leaving the White House and didn't have time to continue comprehensive plans that had kept us from complete disaster for the past 6 years.<br>  <br>  By doing the bank bailout, he was essentially "kicking the can down the road" for the next administration to take it and run with it.<br>  <br>  Now we're seeing how the new administration wants to handle it.  We know that the markets haven't responded the way Obama hoped they would.  The better question is, would Bush have done the same thing?  If not, would we have a better result from his plan?  The last 8 years show that he wouldn't have done the same thing and we would have had a better result.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Bush's original stimulus was about 1/10 the size of this one... and it was primarily written against the tax code...|`|35ZJauLkaa	Yes Bush's socialist side opened this can of worms.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	He did, but it didn't pass so were using the dollars he would have spent had Bush's passed.
HlD9dRF2aa	Give $9500 to every person that filed taxes last year.  Then let the American taxpayer decide who they want to bailout in a free market system.      The pro-government argument is that people won't spend it all on the economy.  The fact of the matter is, the government wants to spend 95% of it on themselves so their argument doesn't make any sense when you put H.R.1. under scrutiny.|`|of66Qs9Jaa	I have a way to solve the economic crisis in a very short time.  It would stop the foreclosures, heal the car makers, fix the credit card mess and the banks.     All the government needs to do is give everyone that filed tax returns last year $100,000.  It would be way less money than this bail out.    People would pay down their mortgage for much lower payments, pay off their credit cards, and many people would buy a new car.     The economy would roar back to life as the money being spent went all through the economy.  The mortgage crisis comes to screaming stop.  The banks get the money they need so bad from all the loans getting and the deposits.  The new cars sale would heal the car makers.    It's so simple!  And it's far less money spent than the bail out!|`|XYTUAzzgaa	a new government|`|1a4e05cd9090b31f9dae582382c7541baa	IN THE BUSH YEARS HARDLY NEW JOBS WERE CREATED AND THE ONE WHO DID WERE JUST P/T, TEMP, CONTRACTS, ETC     NOW ALL US ARE SCREAMING OUR LUNGS OUT, WE WANT BETTER PAY IN THE NEW JOBS CREATED,     WHY ARE WE DEMANDING SO MUCH THIS TIME AND WE ALL STAY QUIET IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION?|`|riaugApoaa	all but the first 6 sounds good to me

JcqB8VfLaa	Isn't it obvious? Because their purpose for doing so is out of office and their guy is in. They worked very hard to put any negative on a republican, but now that it's a democrat it really doesn't matter, because their feigned concern for the troops was nothing but a front for helping democrats win the elections at all costs, and it cost them ALL of their possible pretexts of integrity. <br>  <br>  I find the whole thing pretty sorted and disgusting myself. I am done as a democrat, they make me sick. This election has showed me so much that independents and republicans were saying has been right on. I am really sorry for some of the things I said, because I was so sure that if all the people I knew said things were one way, they couldn't all be wrong. That is the wrong way to think. I think it's the way the Germans who supported Hitler got sucked in. My eyes are opened now, and Never again.<br>  <br>  It's all about fooling us voters, and they did a great job. Now Obama is going to make us pay for it, and I guess we deserve it. I'm sorry to all those who really don't deserve this for my stupidity.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	The reason is because Obama now owns both wars.  They are on his watch and negative press about that is not permitted in the liberal biased media world.

NkEHCHsOaa	Yeah, you are right. Most of them running around are worse than those 2 and deals were made that were much worse. <br>  <br>  I have to bet that the democrats there, maybe even Obama, had plans with someone else. Maybe Obama owes someone else. The way to get ahead in Obama circles is for those who you owe to know they are gettiing paid no matter what, like A-Corn and others who cheated for him are getting paid now.  <br>  <br>  I bet they have someone else in mind. No way all of this stuff is at face value. They probably had people searching feverishly for a reason to get Burris out, and if he doesn't go he is over in the democrat party, like Blago is now.<br>  <br>  The Godfather Mayor Daily has to be paid too, this could be about something he wants.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	I could be very wrong about this and it is only a guess, but Illinois has direct ties to the White House now, if you know what I mean and the last thing they need is more corruption exposure coming out of Obamas former state.

Also the 'buy America' policy wouldn't work if it was only consumers doing it.

If you just received a citation they could wrap it up in one day.     We can't really answer this question without specifics of the type of offense.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Your first court appearance is known as a "Preliminary."     This is where the court insures there is probable cause to hear the case.    The next hearing is called an arraignment. This is where you enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.    If you already have legal counsel...the "wheels of justice" can be "greased" to settle the case without further action. Your attorney can guide you to pleading to avoid further court appearances.

What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.  The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.  When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.  You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.”|`|AA11581903	Human life...<br>  <br>     Human life actually equals a paycheck....somewhat like the chicken equals the egg...so you have to start with what will give you the other.<br>  <br>    The more people who are making a decent wage means there are more people paying taxes, which means more revenue to spread around.

The line can get tricky.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Its tough to generalize everyone into one category.<br>  <br>  Of course I put human life above money, but that still doesn't provide a catch all answer to your question.<br>  <br>  I have no problem helping people who need it.  I have no problem with a portion of our money going to someone who cannot work due to a physical or mental issue, but who would otherwise work and contribute to the overall good of society if they were able to.<br>  <br>  I do take issue with the people who see the aid, and take advantage of it by getting what they can for free when they could be working like the rest of us. <br>  <br>  Problem is, it is difficult (apparently, at least, based on past gov't management) to sort out the two categories. If there was a system that would somehow get our money to those who truly NEED it, and keep it out of the hands of those who take it out of laziness, I think a vast majority of people would be for it.<br>  <br>  In recent times it's gotten even worse. So many people are now complaining about this stimulus package, because it is money going to individuals who didn't work but are getting money. Yes, I do have a problem with this. But what I have an exponentially greater problem with is the money for which I worked for going to bail out huge corporations, who took huge risks and know that in business a simple principle is that greater risk translates to greater potential for loss. So these corporations took our money too! <br>  <br>  I can't stand how I hear so many conservatives irate about this new stimulus plans because it is going to the people. I share the frustration, but it becomes 10 fold when I think about the last $700 billion that was given to companies who made stupid choices - I can't believe people are letting that last one get swept under the rug.<br>  <br>  Theres a popular radio show around here that mocks the stimulus package by saying its just a bunch of people going "Yo, wheres my free stuff?" I share this frustration too, but the major corporations of this country did the EXACT same thing a few months ago, i.e. GM, Ford, and Chrysler execs. just flew to Washington and also procliamed "Yo, wheres our free stuff".|`|QuERBTkzaa	When I read how nasty and selfish people are, I can't stand it.

You may be pleasantly surprised.<br>  <br>  Since this is the politics section, you could ask what political party people belong to also.  It might be interesting.  You could also ask this in the elections section.|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	The problem is people who can work to support themselves, and their family, don't. They use the system by taking "loans" from banks the government forced them to loan to people who can't afford the home. Recently, the woman who had octuplets, is on welfare, had 6 other children she can't pay for, so her parents cared for, and now their house is being foreclosed because they couldn't pay their mortgage anymore because of taking care of her 6 previous children, is now looking to buy a $2,000,000 home because some media joker paid her money for photos of her 8 intentionally emplanted embryo's, who will have medical disabilities for the rest of their lives. You want to pay her mortgage? You want to pay over $5,000,000 in Liberals idea of charity tax to pay for her and her kids' hospital stays. If you're a California taxpayer and don't want to, tough. The Government is making them.<br>  <br>  Buying food for the poor lasts until its eaten, but if they never learn to work to survive, you pay them until they die. Thats using the taxpayer, not borrowing until you're able to live without support from others' hard work.<br>  <br>  The paycheck, and hard work is more important than giving it away to support for life people who refuse to become better with FREE education we already pay for. You're supporting the LAZY, and intentional uneducated with your taxes, and the Government isn't giving you a choice. Forced taxes for the poor is not charity, it's theft. Period.<br>  <br>  Charity is a choice of an individual to help another get by until they can do it alone, not the Government sucking the life out of a person to give it to a lifetime welfare recipient.

Their website boasts:    Whatever your origins, nationality or religion might be, whatever qualifications you may or may not have, whatever your social or professional status might be, whether you are married or single, the French Foreign Legion offers you a chance to start a new life...     Join the 7699 legionnaires and non-commissioned officers hailing from 136 different countries, including France. Build yourself an exceptional future in which "honour" and "fidelity" are fundamental values.     There are steps in joining:    - Make your way to one of the 11 information offices in France. These offices are located in Paris, Lille, Nantes, Strasbourg, Aubagne, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseilles, Nice, Perpignan and Toulouse.     - Present yourself to the recruiting officer and decide if you will use your real name or a declared identity. This last option is for those who wish to make a brand new start in life or for the French citizens who choose to join. Only foreigners are allowed to join the Legion.     - Submit to a preliminary background check. Although the Legion has a reputation for taking all who enlist, felons will not be permitted to join and will be turned away at this point.     - Report to either Paris or Aubagne for a medical check-up. Afterwards, finalize your recruitment dossier and sign an initial five-year service contract. This will take anywhere from one to three days.     - Complete a series of tests in Aubagne that can last anywhere from one to ten days. These tests cover medical examinations, physical agility assessments, personality and psycho-technical questionnaires, a security interview and an investigation into your motivation to join the Legion.     - Sign an unconditional five-year contract and begin training for the 4th Foreign Regiment in Castelnaudary. Your 15 weeks of instruction will include everything from Legion traditions to mountain training.     - Show up for duty in one of the ten different regiments scattered throughout the world. Six are in France, one in Corsica, two in Africa and one in South America to begin your contracted service.    Here are some things to know:    Although it is not necessary to know French before joining the Foreign Legion, the early days of your career will be much easier if you know a little bit before enlisting.     After you have completed one five-year tour of duty, you are eligible to apply for French citizenship, if you choose to do so.     Indications that your application to join is going well include: changing the color tab you are wearing (from the original yellow to green and finally to red), getting a haircut courtesy of the Legion, being ordered to memorize a six-digit identification code, an interview about exactly why you want to join and getting gear for basic training purposes.     Contrary to some published reports, only physically fit males between the ages of 17 and 40 years are allowed to enlist in the French Foreign Legion. Women are not accepted, and there are no plans to accept them at this time.     You cannot bring your wife with you if you join the Legion. All men, regardless of actual marital status, are considered unmarried during their first five-year tour of duty.     There are no recruitment offices for the French Foreign Legion anywhere but in France, and any expenses for travel to one of the recruitment offices may not be reimbursed.    There is also the Spanish Foreign Legion, but I can't find that much (English) information on it.  Their website is: http://www.soldados.com/como_ingresar/ib...

While he struggles to handle the economic mess here at home and to insert government control over the banking, healthcare and automobile industries things are going to hell overseas. North Korea is now testing missiles that can reach Alaska and Iran put a satellite into space (why not a nuke into Israel? Obama backs down from the Russians on the missile defense shield for the Eastern European countries, opening the way for resumed Russian bullying of countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia. The only thing Obama has done right is to have sent 17,000 troops into Afghanistan to fight the Taliban.|`|dGlhYAmVaa	They don't want to risk upsetting anyone, even if it is our enemy.

Last year I went through a local free clinic waiting room.  I was so disgusted to see that almost every single person was talking on a cell phone.

I pay for my health care but do not have a cell phone.<br>  <br>  Unlike others, I see a "slight" difference between an able-bodied person collecting aid without being required to contribute to our society and our brave military who WORK 12 to 16 hours a day risking their lives for our freedoms.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	No.  I think our military personnel (all of whom receive federal aid) should have the right to watch television.|`|AA10164318	cable provides internet access in many homes.

el8yX5q3aa	Honey...they should have set you down and talked to you before they took children in.  Meaning mom and dad.  They should have explained what FOSTER parenting is.  It is taking in children who need a home and it is temporary...someone to love them and give them a normal home life so they are not institutionalized.        Listen...it is hard.  I worked with foster parents for 16 years and they are such special people.  They open their hearts and homes and risk a lot of saddness .  It is difficult because you can't open your heart and not fall in love with children when you want to help them all the time.  God bless your family for being so loving and giving so much.    They are not taking those children to make them miserable...    I don't know why the court says they can't stay.  Maybe something is going on you don't know...or maybe they feel the mom and grandma are too close to YOUR family and it is a risk for the children.  IT is you know....sometimes parents get close to foster parents and kidnap the children or get unapproved visiting etc. because the parents or grandparents said they like them and allow it.      It isn't that foster parents mean harm..but some rules must be broken here or the court wouldn't uproot the children.  I don't know if that is the case....but I don't think you know everything either.    Your family is God sent as far as I am concerned.  But if I were social services and the court and knew the foster parents weren't following all the rules or a red flag was up....I would wonder and question too.  Not the love....or the intention..but for the safety of the children.    However if something wasn't right...social services should have said something and told them....and gone on from there.    Regardless of the reasons and what is happening...the children's BEST INTERESTS are in place.  NO ONE would do anything if they weren't.    With that said....have your mom and dad talk to an attorney to look into it.  I did have a case where social services said no and as a Guardian Ad Litem I helped the foster parents fight it and they won.  It was in the best interest of the child to be where she was....today she is in college and so happy and doing so well.  It WAS the perfect choice !        good luck...and don't be angry at social services for doing their job.  If they come in it is because the COURT said to do that!  They are in their jobs because they love children and want to protect them...your opinons on how that happens differ...but when you love someone you want the best for them.!  Don't be angry at them honey....    I don't know where you live..but in the U.S. parents have one year to get straightened out or the children are adopted out .     It is not fair to keep a child in limbo and make their lives hell because parents can't get it together. IF they don't attempt and make a good effort in one year...they aren't going to do it.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	They always give the natural parents many chances to reform their lives and get the children back.  Only after this has been exhausted without success do they then give an okay for adoption.  It can take years sometimes.      I know it is heartbreaking.  I knew a woman who fostered three children.  They had been living in squalor, abused, left alone with no food, etc.  She had them for 3 years and wanted to adopt but instead they put the kids back with the parents!  She drove 6 hours to go check on them and found them eating burnt rice and they had been left alone for 6 days.  She took them back to her house and that time the court finally gave her permission to adopt them.    But those kids had to suffer while the court came to the conclusion that the "parents" didn't care about them.|`|umPQv5LLaa	right you capture them

While<br>  the popular media and some political figures have simplified this issue into “state<br>  versus market”, in practice the issues are substantially more complicated. There is<br>  not a single, simple concept of the market that can be adopted for use within a<br>  health system. Rather, market-style mechanisms include a number of different<br>  specific instruments such as consumer sovereignty (patient choice), negotiated<br>  contracts and open bidding. These can be adopted within markets that are<br>  organized according to different principles: price, quality and market share. Markets<br>  can, in turn, be introduced within different sectors of the health system: in the<br>  financing of health care, in one or more subsets of the production of health services<br>  (among and/or between hospitals, nursing homes, physicians and social service<br>  personnel) and/or in the allocation instruments that distribute financing to service<br>  providers. Competitive incentives can be brought to bear on the behaviour of<br>  doctors, nurses, support personnel or home care personnel. In practice, then, there<br>  is not one but a series of decisions to make. Rather than a monolithic commitment<br>  to one of two abstractions – state or market – health systems in both the western<br>  and eastern parts of the European Region confront a range of smaller decisions.<br>  The decision-making process must be not only strategic but also practical in nature,<br>  and as a result typically involves a multitude of approximations if not compromises.<br>  <br>  In some instances, the decision has been to combine elements of both models – to<br>  mix an increased use of market-style incentives with continued ownership and<br>  operation of facilities by the public sector. This hybrid approach has been given a<br>  number of different names: internal market, public competition, provider market<br>  and quasi-market. The design and implementation of this type of planned market<br>  has played an important role in health reform in Finland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and<br>  the United Kingdom, as well as in various CEE and CIS countries.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I cant post all 35 pages of a report by WHO (which you use as your source for healthcare equalization) maybe if you really want to learn something you would read the report which is titled "HEALTH CARE REFORMS"  THAT MEANS CHANGING OF THE HEALTHCARE WHICH YOUR QUESTION ASKS "WHY ARENT THEY CHANGING".  but ofcourse that isnt the point is it?  its all about making a point even when your point is not valid.  Shows the intellectual lacking you have.  thanks for letting us know

CBx6qHztaa	If you pay me enough Mr. president I will behave.|`|zjpB2GARaa	There is no such thing as "poverty" in America or any other developed country.  If you want to see what poverty actually looks like, go visit one of those 3rd world countries where liberals keep doing everything they can to prevent jobs from being created (with the campaigns against "sweatshops," the Environmental religion, with foreign aid, and by misrepresenting socialism).  "Poor" people in America have TVs, more than enough food to eat (obesity is actually worst among the poor), and other luxuries that people who actually live in poverty don't have.<br>  <br>  Of course, crime is a problem that is created by the high time preferences in our society (a high time preference refers to excessive value on consuming in the present as opposed to the future; basically, a lack of concern for the future and concern only for the here and now, a problem which has been rampant in our society for about a century) and a lack of respect for the sanctity of life and private property (which is caused by constant wars, abortion, and government wealth redistribution policies).  Crime rates can be increased further by leaving the potential victims unarmed (via gun control laws).  Criminals, by nature of their high time preferences, do not really care about being locked away in jail, but are scared that their victim may be capable of defending himself or herself.<br>  <br>  Of course, the liberals are right when they say that we need to focus on eliminating the causes of crime, but unfortunately they misinterpret the actual causes of crime.|`|ttNa7fVhaa	If you look at the demographics of the average criminal in the US you'll see that a lot are not of the middle and upper class.  The one true way out of poverty in this country is through education and we have a lot of educational opprotunities in this country for the lower class, but as the saying goes "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink."|`|Z03zgM0maa	Poor people can't afford good education, therefore are prone to crime. Why would rich people steal? They have money already.<br>  <br>  It's common sense. People in poverty also deal drugs because it is a lucrative business. They cannot survive on minimum wage so they resort to crime. Don't be ridiculous. People don't commit crimes just for fun. They do it because of the circumstances they are put into. Not saying it is right, nor excuses their behavior. It is just the way it is.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Do you know the difference between poor and living in poverty?<br>  <br>  There is more than a passing correlation between the two, but that doesn't mean all people living in poverty are criminals and all criminals come from poverty.|`|AA11540917	"insist"  ??<br>  No, that's YOUR word.<br>  <br>  and forget about blame.<br>  <br>  the truth : there is a real and self-evident Link between crime and poverty.<br>  <br>  and that's all.|`|7c4bb7da4f07da63eb46db5edf0e73a7aa	I'm sure there is a very strong correlation.

For another, even if they believe this, so what?  Whether crime increses with poverty is an evidentiary issue, not a belief one.<br>  <br>  And lastly, what does you never commiting a crime have to do with anything?   We're talking about a nation of 300 million.  That you do one thing or another has nothing to do with everyone else.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	I will answer if you can prove your case, i.e. "liberals insist on blaming crime on poverty" these facts are not in evidence. Personally I don't think you have any idea what a liberal or conservative is. <br>   I'm sure you think that the Republicans who spent us into a 5 trillion dollar debt while cutting taxes are conservative. If so that proves my point. These Republicans are NOT conservative.|`|B9tHjHqLaa	in the world of the liberals on top they think that no one can be poor and everyone must be wealthy in order to have a succesfull economy and if everyone was rich then no one would ever lose their shiiit and decide that their neighbors dog told them to kill everyone in mcdonalds because they are evil.......when will people realize that not everyone is a product of society and some poeple are just nuts|`|AA11450062	Not sure what Liberals you are talking about.

There are just as many good poor people as there are good rich.<br>  <br>  Still, as the economy goes down, crime goes up.   More crimes are committed by the poor our of necessity and the poor are more often punished, and punished more harshly.<br>  <br>  To say there is no direct relation between POVERTY and someone being labeled a criminal (punished for a crime).....is to completely ignore the facts.    It's plain as day.<br>  <br>  I'd add....Freakonomics (the book) made a great case that Roe vs Wade....the return of abortions....was a major factor in crime reduction.   (They didn't take a stance on the issue and either do I here....just pointing out the facts).  They pinned it right to the MONTH abortion laws were dropped, and it's hard to refute.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	Well, I am a conservative, but on this one I agree with the liberals.<br>  <br>  The facts are the facts.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	Liberals...

That's obvious. But you cannot deny there is a BIG link between the two. <br>  <br>    Hmmm, what kind of generalizations do Conservatives make......|`|YupMCYHlaa	Statistically there is a very strong relationship between crime and poverty.  Street crime, that is, not white-collar crime.  When unemployment goes up, there's a lot more crime.  It's not a liberal thing, it's a statistical fact.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Well, good for you.<br>  <br>  The fact remains that, depending on what type of crime, poverty is a factor.  <br>  <br>  When unemployment is up, crime is up.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that.
e0c51b39028498ec82e61c51a9b0b0e5aa	From others I've spoken to I think it's his expressed desire to completely change, well, just about everything.  For better or worse most people, even liberals, fear change.  If change must come they want to see it in tiny little steps, with the ability to go back and have "do-overs" if the change makes things worse.  Ron Paul doesn't want to take baby steps.  He wants to completely overhaul what our government is and how it functions.  Abolition of the IRS, implementation of some sort of "FairTax", getting rid of the Federal Reserve, a half return to a gold standard, these are all changes that would have massive repercussions for everyone in the country.  If he were wrong, and a lot of his proposals flaunt conventional wisdom, then we would be in a hole too deep to climb out of.  We'd be stuck. And not leaving yourself options is crazy.<br>  <br>  For the record I'm a Libertarian who likes Ron Paul but doesn't worship him.  He's got some good ideas, some bad ones, and generally seems to closest we're gonna get to a decent politician.  But he wants to swing a mean axe, and that makes people a little restless.|`|ss3QPHKIaa	Ron Paul stands for Freedom.<br>  I don't know how "I have 1" proved that he was a nut job by saying that fewer then 20,00 Americans voted for him. <br>  He works for limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies.<br>  That's what freedom really means.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	I know this about Ron Paul.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul only got 19,800 votes in the general election for president.<br>  <br>  Did you know that fewer than 20,000 Americans actually voted for Paul?<br>  <br>  Anybody who does not like that answer is offended by the facts about Ron Paul|`|DXXpHKupaa	The simple truth is that those who yell the loudest have the least to say.<br>  <br>  People are sheep in general-flocking to one gate or another-it doesn't matter which one really.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul was the best choice, followed by Bob Barr.|`|AA11813034	too many people are too afraid of true freedom.|`|t82AcQT1aa	What he represents truly scares the the hell out of politicians.

Bush spent about $2.5 for every $1 collected in taxes. Economics 101: you will lose money doing this<br>  <br>  3) "a job can't be created" is a very microeconomic concept, and does not apply on a global level. Increasing confidence in our economy and closing the wealth gap actually DO create jobs, but you don't learn this until economics 301.<br>  <br>  4) Who is more corporatist than Dick Cheney?|`|rWdYBmPmaa	obama should be in front of a war crimes tribunal.

Either you're married, or you aren't, and as long as you're married, you can file. When to file depends entirely on your personal circumstances and your intentions.

Nobody goes into a marriage thinking they will get divorced, but looking at statistics it is common, and even more common when it comes to partners from different countries. I know 2 people who married Filipinos who are stuck because they cannot get divorced, and have not been granted annulments.
LGidAYDwaa	If you want to be reserve and not active, then you need to wait until our troops are home from Iraq. Anyone in the reserves can be called up at any time after boot camp (plus, many people who left the military after their time was up have been called back in to fight in Iraq.) There is a shortage of military personnel, and most soldiers serving over in Iraq are on their second or even third tour of duty.     The army is very demanding physically, highly stressful, and it doesn't pay very well compared to other jobs. BUT you do get special treatment when it comes to credit and you also can get the GI bill to pay for your education. (As a side note, if you're not good at taking criticism, the military is not for you. They expect perfection, and some people end up not being able to handle the pressure - and that's just boot camp. Imagine how much more stress you'd have under fire from an enemy!)

There is reams of documentation on women being poorer than men as a result of discriminatory employment practices, undoubtedly related to the general persistence of sexism in society. As any thinking person can clearly realize and see, we live in a patriarchal society that does not treat women fairly, does not give them the same opportunities as men, that objectifies them more than men and that yes, pays them less for the same work. Look into the recent legislation that Obama signed about the woman that was paid unfairly at the Goodyear company.

However you may find that if you extend you stay to many months each time, you may end up being refused entry by the immigration officer as they may suspect you of being an illegal immigrant.    In addition, you are liable to be taxed by the IRS if you have stayed more in the US more than 4 months per year on average over the last 3 years, regardless of your immigration status.
1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	If you can document use of the names prior to the trademark registration, then you'll be generally immune from legal action from the trademark holder.    I would suggest either ignoring the guy, or figuring out what you'd be willing to sell the domains for.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	That reminds me, I have one of those I need to respond to this morning.    The best place to learn what is going on is to review the FAQs and examples at chillingeffects.org.    Each case is different. maybe your domains infringe, maybe they don't. Just because someone claims they do does not mean they actually do,  because the person who wrote the letter does not represent your interest.    Without the specific claims and domain names, we can;t give you more advice than that.    edit - First two answers are wrong. Your best claim may be that your use is non-commercial. Even if that is not the case, offering to sell the name is going to be seen as commercial activity and/or intent to profit from infringement.    you don't need to hire an attorney for common cases. the site I listed is for real, by experts, who want to help you and me in this situation.    Most letters like this are bluster given the situation. Review the site I listed, and respond intelligently, and they will probably drop it.    Edit 2 - I still disagree with the 2nd poster. I haven't listed all my qualifications, and no, I am not an attorney, but managing IP issues for internet products is my career.     I have answered this question probably dozens of times on here (check my profile) and no one has ever even quibbled before.    I suggest I know more about the practical state of the law in my chosen specialized field then a random attorney in Nevada or wherever does.    Maybe he should review the actual site I listed and see the content there and exactly what the qualifications are of who wrote it and why before he suggest that my sending people there is going to cause them trouble.    Next thing you know, this guy is going to tell people that they can't understand the terms in their leases either, or any other fine print without engaging an attorney. Sheesh.    This matter is not that complicated. The asker got a routine nastygram. The trademark holder is obligated to send it or risk losing their mark.    But that doesn't mean that it is going to take an attorney to persuade them that their claim is not valid. The internet is full of actual examples, I gave the best source in my opinion, but I am sure google will turn up countless others.    There is no suit here to respond to, only a claim of infringement, probably with no supporting evidence. I think attorneys call them "fishing expeditions" :)    The site I listed will explain the different levels and scopes of trademark protections in layman's terms so a proper response can be written.    I'd also add that there is no evidence the 2nd poster is an actual attorney just because he claims he is one, and he is too ashamed of his own answers to allow them to be seen in his profile, and he does not allow email contact to followup - all of which I do.    Combine that with his admission that he knows NOTHING about this area of law, and decide if my answer is better then his ;)  In the worst case, there may be a suit or more likely a procedural hearing with the agency that manages domain names. There will be plenty of time to negotiate a settlement later if necessary. The world does not stop because some random person sent you a trademark dispute letter for a domain.    And courts and the agencies find for the domain name holder against the claimant plenty often enough that going beyond a fishing expedition is a risky move and not taken lightly. No one ever *wants* to litigate, and as the site I listed explain, the chances of needing to worry about it may not be high, depending on the circumstances.    Note that there is no evidence that the 2nd answer comes from a real attorney other then he claims it. He hides his past answers, so we can't see the quality of his work, and he does not allow email contact. All of that is available  from me.    Combine that with his admission that he knows NOTHING about this area of law, and decide if my answer is better informed and more on point or not.|`|OiAl6w48aa	That's a variation on cyber-squatting.  It happens a fair amount with larger companies, although in reverse.  Companies like IBM, etc., frequently have people coming out of the woodwork and making these kinds of claims.  Likewise, this person with the "trademark" is now attempting to shake you down.  You need to see an intellectual property attorney for guidance; preferably one certified by the Patent & Trademark bar.    Edit: Barry C's advice could easily land you in trouble.  By his own admission, he is NOT an attorney.  Follow his advice at your own risk, but be warned: if you start creating a paper trail, you could EASILY shoot yourself in the foot.  A competent attorney licensed by the Trademark & Patent bar can tell you whether this is bluster or worth fighting.      Past that, just ask yourself if you would take advice from a Starbucks barista on how to fix your car, or if you'd go to someone that knows what they're talking about.  I wouldn't even try to deal with this on my own if I received such a letter and I'm a licensed attorney.  I would get someone who specializes in this area of the law.    Edit2: So to follow Barry's reasoning to its conclusion: if you go to your doctor (a general practicioner) for a medical isue and he tells you to see a specialist because he feels you need surgery, then you should disregard that advice in favor of the fact that your neighbor told you that your condition could be cleared up by eating more fruit.  His source?  The internet.      Barry - I never stated that I don't know anything about this area of the law.  Quite the opposite actually as this was area of the law that required extensive coursework while I was in law school.  However, this is an area that requires a special license among attorneys for a reason.  You make a number of assumptions about this letter sender and the strength of their position.  I am more than willing to admit you may ultimately be correct.  However, I would never advise anyone to engage in self-representation in such a technical area of the law.  Just as I would never advise someone to deal with the SEC on their own.  There are simply too many ways that a person can negate their own position without realizing it.
9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	They definitely can.  On most job applications it will have a line that says do not contact your current employer.  If you did not check this box they would assume it was okay to call and verify that you are currently employed where you say you are.  My guess is you didn't check the box.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	Of course they can call. First Amendment and all.    Etiquette is on the applicant to say if it is OK to contact each employer or not, especially the current employer. Otherwise new company is going to feel free to check if they want to.    Not sure how you could not have given them sufficient contact information - a company name and city is enough to look up the phone number. 4 seconds with a search engine to do that.    Another good phrase for you to know for the future: "references provided on request". Then, to avoid pestering your references with too many calls, verbally tell the hiring manager you want to avoid them getting too many calls as each one is a favor to you, you'd like to provide them when that is the only thing standing between you and the job.    Lots of books and web sites on negotiating for a good new job, btw. this is all standard advice.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Are you absolutely sure it didn't say that somewhere on the application?  Or maybe they just thought since you didn't say anything that you didn't mind.  Make sure you tell them from now on that you don't want your employer contacted right now.

You might be taking out a loan for all they know.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Yes, absolutely... although it's common practice to ask whether or not they can contact your current employer.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	If you signed an application, most if not all have in the small print that you are giving permission to verify the data you provided.

The government shouldn't dictate how we spend our time nor should it mandate what we do with our money.

Socialism has been tried and it failed. Capitalism was tried and it worked, at least until the socialist started tinkering with it. <br>  <br>  Darwinism is the survival of the fittest, those that evolve will thrive. We have a president and a congress that is taking us backwards 70 years, and trying a remedy that failed 70 years ago. The work program went on for 6 years, and things were worse, not better. When the war began, American citizens banded together, roll up their sleeves, and unleashed American capitalism. American ingenuity left the rest of the world shaking in their boots. <br>  <br>  After the war, the prosparity continued until government agencies began to try to regulate and legislate. Congress wanted more power, and took it by playing life warfare, and they still do it today. Instead of telling poor people they can be rich and live a good life also, they tell them the rich man keeps them down. Instead of educating the poor, they give them handouts. <br>  <br>  So, your right, change is inevitable. Unfortunately, we can't improve this country until we get rid of the dinosaurs that have fought off good change for the last 50 years. They are not all liberals, and they are not all conservatives. They are the lawyers, or parasites as their called around here, that keep sucking the lifeblood out of honest Americans, feeding them full of crap, and refusing to step out of power because of some egotistical reason.|`|1W8OHMWfaa	Wow, you are so delusional.

I have a much larger concern that our former Treasury secretary gave away BILLIONs of dollars with no strings attached.  A direct violation of the law creating that pool of money.  They the recipients used it to pay themselves obscene amounts of money, $35,000 toilets.  Geez that is simply wrong.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	People can spend their own money on anything, including dope and cigarettes and beer.  You can't buy that with food stamps, but you don't really know if they were married, or not, and whose money it was, or if they were buying it for someone else.  Poverty isn't slavery.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I would hope that we have not reached the point in our society where we feel we have the right to tell someone else what they can or cannot buy. A lot of people who get food stamps also work at low income jobs. Sure, you could say that they shouldn't waste their money on cigs or beer, but do you really have the right to judge how another spends the money they have earned? Can you justify every cent you spend? Getting food stamps is based on gross income and family size. Maybe they work a heck of a lot harder at their menial jobs than you do. You are someone who obviously thinks that poor somehow means you don't deserve to do anymore than merely exist. Being poor is not always a choice. With our current crisis, you may find out what it is like. I wouldn't be so quick to judge others unless you have walked in their shoes.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	Heck yes.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	I guess that is their choice.  They can't use the food stamps on those things, so what's it to you?    The person below me says she's paying for it?  No, she is paying for the food stamps, which they can't use for alcohol and cigarettes.  And the last time I checked, we live in a free country.  It isn't up to me to decide how another spends his/her money.  I may not approve, but it's not up to me.  Just like it's not up to me if my neighbor buys a big gas guzzling SUV to drive solo to and from work.  You wouldn't like it if someone told you what you could or couldn't buy, right?|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	It's not for you or the state to police how one spends their cash.  Those people have made their decision on how to spend their funds and if that is their priority, so be it.  Fortunately, the welfare allotment does not pay for these things, so who are we to say?  I mean really?|`|6AgnCKCPaa	As much as I feel they shouldn't buy that stuff I am not in favor of passing legislation prohibiting it.  It would be an enforcement nightmare anyway..|`|IlOjhe9Xaa	Oh I have seen this plenty of times. Crazy huh? We are all busting our asses to put food in our kids mouth and there are people out there whipping out extra money to buy alcohol and cigs...right after they blow about $200 in food stamps on junk food.     And I'm white..and yes...they come in white, black, brown, yellow, green, purple. It's sickening really....weren't they taught pride?

These are people who put in an honest day like you an I, however thier employer only pays $6/hr and they work that job becuase there isn't much out there at the time.    Before being so quick to assume, the working poor should be able to absolutely have a beer and a smoke if they wish.  They are working schmucks just like us, however they just don't make a living wage, thus get subsidies.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	The last I heard, people cannot pay for those things with government aid.  At least your tax dollars didn't pay for them.  You should be glad about that.  I get your point though,  why didn't they use their own money to buy their food...everybody has a vice...|`|NkEHCHsOaa	Yes absolutely, and they should also be drug tested and banned for years if not life, if they come up positive.|`|R5XtTuHfaa	No!  We need something to keep the proletariat sedated and happy! If you take away the alcohol and tobacco you are encouraging the masses to be sober, and think about how society is structuted - and that could be very, very bad.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	no I don't.  They have a right to buy what they wish with their money.  God forbid if YOU need help like FS, you can't have a beer!  Also, mind you own damn business when in line at the store, are you there with binoculars reading what type of card they have???|`|BCebZRu3aa	I think that is a great idea. Be careful though.

About all such a law could accomplish is to keep them from doing both at the same time.  They'd just make two trips to accomplish the same result.|`|G6yyceAxaa	no, next you will want to stop executives from spending a million dollars redecorating there offices.  or spending money on luxury jets.  suppose you stop everybody from buying smokes and beer, what happens to the workers that produce these products?  they are out of a job and they are collecting welfare also.  besides foodstamps only account for 13% of the total welfare budget. the biggest amount is spent on old people who collect medicare.|`|fEnKOqJvaa	the answer is yes. one of the reason the usa administration have this program is to help mom's and dad to keep going in life. tabaco and alcohol is like a person with a  nices car cry the is no money. kids come 1ft.|`|19qsNnHqaa	yes|`|Qh5sXlDcaa	Government needs lessing the SSI check on individual to atleast $600 a month or less teach this spoiled nation how to get their hands dirty and work maybe the Unemployment would decrease.

And it is my business because it is my tax dollars.**|`|T3k7gjBmaa	Yes.  And Cadillacs or any other new vehicle!    EDIT:  Slykitty:  What it is to me is that they COULD use that money to buy their food, not take the food stamps, and hence save me a little money on my freaking taxes!    And, no, I don't mind lending a helping hand to someone who has come upon hard times.  We all falter.  What I do mind is people who work the system!    And since I seem to be ticking people off anyway, I'll go a step further and say that anyone ALREADY on public assistance should be kept on manditory birth control!  I'd like to have a couple more kids, but I can't afford it--especially since I'm paying for their illegitimate brats!    EDIT:  To Slykitty:  If I were asking others to buy my bread and milk while I paid to fill up my SUV, then you might have a point.  Since that is not the case, everything you say is moot.  What you are missing is that these wastrils are able to CHOOSE to buy these items because we, the taxpayers, are footing the bill for their necessities.  Get it?!|`|MEReSvZeaa	Not in a free country.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Then you are treading on dangerous ground.  Restricting the rights of one segment.  If you do that, you have to restrict the rights of all and we don't want that.  It's unfair I know.  I worked at a food bank and I can't count the number of times I loaded bags of groceries in cars and saw cigarettes.  One time I saw 4 cartons!  Can't buy food but can buy 4 cartons.  I don't know the prices but I imagine that would buy at least a week's worth of food.|`|44IT2kmNaa	See this is where critical thinking skills would come in handy. How much would we spend attempting to enforce this policy, would it cost us more or less money? I am going to let you try and figure this one out for yourself.|`|rulCYZXkaa	It's sort of like those people that pull up to the welfare office in new cadillacs and such.    I don't think that they should be prohibited really.  It is a free country as a previous user pointed out.  I do think they should be required to fill out an income and expense sheet though.  This is not only sensible, but completely within reason seeing as the government is subsidizing their lives.  Make them provide pay stubs and bank records to verify income and then have them fill out an expense sheet on what they spent their money on.

Saving these big corporations are "to make the economy better" but people still lose their houses and didn't get their jobs back.  White collard workers expect free money off the blue collar workers so why can't blue collar workers get good benefits in return.

The dumb are still blinded by the light!|`|o7E9LxV8aa	Thom the last 2 didn't work so this one is a long shot so I say yes|`|SSLekPAnaa	Yes. There are now polls showing Obama's rating in the low 40's, and Congressional approval has not risen.     The Dems are failing, hopefully for the last time. I believe this is the final nail in the coffin for the party. From now on, we will only elect Republicans, as they know what they are doing.|`|otYOxmnuaa	All except for the 11 that voted against it.    2/3 spending and 1/3 "stimulus" = Spending bill.    First off, call it what it is. It's not a "Stimulus" -- as that's the marketing they use to secure budgetary spending w/o going through traditional channels.    Second -- FDR tried deficit-financed spending and it failed miserably. He was chasing down a runaway unemployment rate by spending 10% of GDP. Clinton tried a balance-budget spending increase and it failed to increase tax-revenue. Reagan tried a deficit-funded tax-cut and it worked great.  http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-comm...    Thirdly -- When we create a deficit-financed tax-cut, we take a hit in tax-revenue for the first two years, as one would expect when you cut taxes -- less tax-revenue. However, after the two years, the added growth in the market allows for increased tax-revenues to match the loss of that tax-revenue and is followed by a greater increase in tax-revenue after year 3 or 4. This accounts for the growth in the economy where production increases and more people are getting jobs -- paying income tax, paying consumer tax, investing and paying cap. gains taxes, etc.. The outcome? The government has more money in terms of tax-revenue, the consumers/business owners have more money because of the tax-cut and economic activity between the two increases.    -We need to find a balance between tax cuts and a position which allows consumers to fore go the cost of spending. If we cut consumer taxes for a 6-month period, people's purchasing power just increased by 8%. That's a good incentive for people to get out and buy consumer products/services. Everyone loves a sale.    Logistically -- we're throwing 300 billion spread out over 4 to 5 years at a GDP that straddles 13 Trillion dollars annually. Will that make a dent? For some people? yes - (unless you're highly skilled and white). Will it "jump start" anything? no, since none of the projects will be initiated until 2010.    So the question is -- is it worth the 1.3 trillion dollar price tag given the fact the strategy has failed before and the minimal amount of money used for direct stimulus won't reach citizens until 2010?  ======================================...  Mustagme:  "Yes. There are now polls showing Obama's rating in the low 40's, and Congressional approval has not risen."    Is it a coincidence that people oppose this bill by 59% against, to 41% in favor?    For the bill = 41%  Approval   = 43%|`|FIXKYCIGaa	No.  The package that passed in the house isn't the ultimate version of the bill.  The Obama administration knew that before the vote.  The senate will pass their own version then the house and the senate will meet in committee to reconcile the two bills.  I'm certain that the bill that emerges from committee will have more bipartisan support in both the house and the senate.  It's a negotiating tactic and a face saving maneuver for the republicans.  They don't want to be seen as being too accommodating with the new administration so they were tough on this first vote.  It happens all the time.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	After spending all that time complaining about the Republican spending, they pull something like this.  That's where they lost credibility with me.  And not only do we have one tax fraud in the White House, we have two.|`|6jErufVYaa	FYI. it's still early to tell.|`|goHKCuyraa	I would think you would have to have some credibility in order to lose some.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	In order to lose credibility, you have to have some to begin with.|`|AA10339824	NO...I THINK OBAMA DID.   If you look at the wording that he is using to push this bill and compare it to Bush's wording, it's astonishingly similar....and ridiculous.   Why do we have to SHOVE this bill down congress and the house's throat without paying it the due process it needs to be paid in order to make sure it's right.       it's like "stupid decision with NO transparency for the @ssholes that got us in this mess; take TWO."|`|AA11916920	No, and this is why.  Democrats have been in control of Congress for the past 2 and a half years.  This is simply a continuation of things they did while Bush was in office.  The difference is, Bush would get blamed for the Democratic Congress mess ups (finger pointing because they don't want to admit wrong doing by their own party)  Now that they are able to continue destroying America, the Democrats will now play the "blame game" and continue to point the finger at Bush and his administration, though they had nothing to do with this.  What's even better is Bush got criticized for his Stimulus Package and his Bail Out plans.  Now, under Obama, he is some kind of genius who is going to help America by talking and doing nothing else.|`|fEnKOqJvaa	life have a catch for everything the 2009 people will get that money but in the same time the (irs) is taking money away from people.

If it is a crime to lie to a government official, such as to the Congress, to I.R.S., the police authorities, etc.  then why not make the same apply the other way.  Even more so, when we believe in, and give force to the foundation of the Constitution that creates government as "of, by and for the people."   If we hold that foundation with integrity, then it follows, that just as the citizens, the owners and creators of government, are prosecuted, then even more so the governing officials should be liable for their lies.|`|MEReSvZeaa	If you can demonstrate an intentional lie and something gained from the lie, it's called fraud.

Gordon Brown is obsessed with "Global Government" and a "New World Order".

3BhXf5MYaa	Generally, when a visa is canceled due to employment being terminated it is considered that the visa converts to a B2 for 30 days.    If you have a firm departure date (with plane tickets), that indicate that you would be leaving within 40 days of the employment ending, I doubt that you would have problems.      You would have no problems leaving, the only issue you might have would be if you were applying for admission after departing the US.

Advanced release could be for a number of reasons. For example, good behavior, etc. Hope I helped.
xhyRWBZDaa	Yes, once you are done with your basic and AIT, she will be moving with you.  For example, my husband left two weeks ago for basic (Army).  He joined to become an MP . His boot camp is 9 weeks, and his AIT is 9 weeks.  If you join to become an MP, you will be going to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  She will not be able to go with you there, but once you get your duty station, then she will be able to go with you. The military is very supportive of Military families.  They will make sure she is taken care of while you are in training.  My husband has been gone almost two weeks and I have allready recieved letters from his commander welcoming me into the military, and paperwork for me to get my military Id, as well as a letter informing me that I may now use tricare.    I hope this helps.  If you have any questions, I will be more than happy to help you, if I can.  Like I said, i have only been a military wife for 2 weeks, but i am also a military brat, so ive been around the military my whole life.|`|AA10709853	most likely NOT until you finish all your schooling and report to your first permanent duty station.   and even then.. there is a risk that you will get unaccompanied orders.      as for getting base housing: wait lists vary,are based on paygrade and bedroom entitlement and can be a year long or longer.|`|xjb72SOpaa	If you joined the Air Force as an SP (MP), you would have a total of 7-8 weeks for "Boot Camp" and then 6 weeks minimum of tech training. After that, you would get your first duty assignment and your family can join you. I believe the Air Force has the shortest training time overall for that job.    Overall, no matter what service you joined, you would have to complete your job training before you would get a chance to live with your family. While in training you're stuck in dorms, no matter how old you are.     All I can say is make the choice for the future, not to make a quick fix for the present. Once you join, you don't want to be stuck  in a service or job that you don't feel is the best fit for you, just so you can pay for your family and their immediate needs. Best of luck to you and your family.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, after you finish your training and get your assignment, she and your child can come to live with you.  Make sure you get your wife registered in DEERS right away after you enlist.  So she can have the health benefits.    She can't come with you while you are in tech school though.  Depending on what career field you choose, the length of time can be pretty short though.|`|jfcrxSSBaa	As long as you aren't sent to a post that has a restriction, families are welcome to come with you.  They should provide housing, as well as money to buy food with your family.    Just be wary...no matter how long your schooling is, you will not be able to bring your family with you until boot and your job training are done.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Spouse cannot join you for basic or for tech school (AIT).  But, after that, she'll be able to join you.  There are a few places where spouses are not allowed, but it is not job specific.  (Lots of folks in a lot of different career fields get remote orders to Korea.)    Now, if you deploy, obviously she cannot accompany you.  She will stay behind with the rest of the spouses.  Then there are the TDY's (temporary duty, schools, etc.) that spouses cannot go on.    In 20+ years, hubby has been gone for about 1/3 of our marriage, and he's an aircraft maintainer.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	If you are married, you will get a whole lotta stuff from the Army. A recruiter would able to help you out on that front. Remember that it is after training (Including AIT)

Bush stands for Walker, Prescott Bush's racist bigot partner and his maternal grandfather.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Despite having seized control of the national socialist party, Hitler and his thugs were fiscal conservatives and their political movement was fascism.  They also partnered with Barons Krupp, Daimler, Bosch, and others to focus the industrial output toward military equipment.  He removed government oversight on business. He also banned abortion, arrested and executed homosexuals, outlawed protest marches, etc.<br>  <br>  Mussolini was also a fascist.  Right wing conservative capitalist.

Except Mussolini did not hate jews.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Both Hitler and Mussolini where both Socialists that embraced nationalism and not international movements favored by most other socialist.  The governments of both Hitler and Mussolini took over all business in their respective countries, that must defiantly was not capitalism. Most people on the modern political left disown both of these men because of the atrocities they committed but if you actually look at both of them historically their movements where offshoots of socialism. I do not know of any website but the book Liberal Fascism by Jonah Goldberg is highly recommended reading.|`|b1c45661beb2a8e1f192d241d65240cfaa	Fascism is a species of socialism. NAZI was a National Socialist party, not Communist exactly. Communism was perceived as "International Socialism" and NAZI-ism as "National Socialism".
