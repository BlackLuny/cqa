r25yYbauaa	Well if you go to playlist.com and look up the songs and then search for the lyrics you might get a better idea in your own words. How I see it is the author was trying to set a mood and temperament for the characters and situations in the book. He used songs to do that so that it would connect you, the reader, to the inside of the story. He took something from the real world and incorporated it in there and made it feel familiar.|`|4BWaqJcTaa	Well I would first suggest you analyze the song lyrics of "Asleep" this will give you something to relate back to the book. Look for similarities in overall themes in the song and in the book. To give you a quick reference, this quote is from the books..<br>  <br>  "If you listen to the song “Asleep,” and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes you’ve known, and you cry, and the person holds you back, then I think you will see the photograph."<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, just try to make some basic connections. 
hJP9y6kjaa	<br>  Okay, so it looks like I'll be the only one to actually critique your poem. Sigh.<br>  <br>  Start by killing all of the commas and periods at the ends of the lines. If the lines were read as one sentence, would you still put a comma there? In other words<br>  <br>  There was nothing visible<br>  but the outline of his face<br>  <br>  There was nothing visible but the outline of his face.<br>  <br>  As a rule I tend to avoid punctuation at the end of my lines whenever possible - you aren't writing prose, you have a different set of rules to follow, so to speak.<br>  <br>  You started two lines in the first stanza with "but". Rewrite at least one of them - they're too close together.<br>  <br>  Try to pay attention to your scansion, the number of syllables in each line. The first two lines of the third stanza really don't jive with the rest of the poem, and in general the lack of consistency in syllable counts per line detracts from how your poem flows. The first two lines have 7 syllables each, try to stay as close as possible to that, or something like that, throughout the poem. Even leaving one syllable out of a line affects how it feels in a poem, so only leave out syllables to provide emphasis or to point out something that's missing, or an expectation, etc.<br>  <br>  The line "so they walked slow" is missing something. "She didn't want to leave so they walked slow". Slow where? Is there a different way to say this,a different adjective, a different phrase, etc? Likewise with "now was hers". Rewrite, expand, whatever. Make it match with the rest of the poem so you can keep that feel.<br>  <br>  The very last stanza has the phrase "sugar and poison/bitter and sweet". Why is it poison? Why is it bitter? You throw those terms out there, but they don't reflect anything else in the poem. Why? Can you add something to your poem or change something in your poem to reflect why his kissing you or whatever is both good and bad? Why is your life being complete both good and bad?<br>  <br>  The phrase "making her thoughts become blurs" doesn't really work. Thoughts don't become blurs, they get blurry, first off, but saying "making her thoughts" just seems to be a bit too much. Just "her thoughts became blurs" is better, but phrasing it a different way would be better.<br>  <br>  There's more, but I wanted to end it by saying that you have expressed some very beautiful sentiments, you just need to work on your delivery a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|65637be5b6e62fe9ddf9ceed6a13d85daa	Very romantic, and heartbreaking poem.<br>  I give it an A+<br>  |`|miFe45quaa	That's beautiful!

C9QSdCmWaa	I loved the third book. Its where you really get to know a lot of the culens backround and its filled with interesting situations. Its so addicting i couldn't put it down!<br>  <br>  well for right now she had put Midnight sun on hold from writing it. It is not comfirmed yet that she will finish and get it published or not. but there is a rumor going around that i heard she has continued to write it. but i don't know if it will be published.<br>  <br>  you can read the first 12 chapters on stephenie's website. its not illegal becuase she has posted it with permission. **remeber that this is not a finished copy so there for filled with grammer and error mistakes. ITs not the whole book either. <a href="http://stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html" rel="nofollow">http://stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.ht...</a>|`|8LEzLjmWaa	OK, my two favourites are Twilight and Breaking Dawn<br>  <br>  I love Twilight because of all the emotions (he hates me, he likes me, he loves me, he wants to eat me etc lol) and all about the finding out etc.<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn up until when they go on their honeymoon, then it gets kinda bad becuase it's like their love kinds dies after he hates himself so much for hurting her, and then she's like what does he mean get that 'thing' out. But it was really good, especially when she 'died' I was like No!! Erm but as soon as she started writing again it was the best part of all the books, everything was much better when she became a vampire. Except for the whole Jacob imrpinting thing, I mean, Renesmee was kind of hers if you know what I mean, she shouldn't have to 'share' with Jacob, but it did turn out ok, even if there was  bit of an anticlimax after there was no fight, but that still was OK because i was just relived that her and Edward weren't going to die.<br>  <br>  I liked the twist at the end of it as well, where Edward can read her mind.<br>  <br>  I think she will publish Midnight Sun, but maybe not for while.<br>  <br>  You can read the chapters that got leaked LEGALLY on her website www.stepheniemeyer.com where she posted her views on the matter, and the link to open the document. You might have to scroll down a little.|`|Ynrv705faa	she doesn't know if she's going to publish midnight sun or not because parts of it were posted illegally on the web. <br>  and yes if you go to www.stephiniemeyer.com there is a link to the first chapter of midnight sun in her blog.<br>  i think the best book would be breaking dawn because there is a wedding and she becomes a vampire.|`|z6kwUwvLaa	Breaking Dawn is the best for many reasons but most of all because u dont expect any of it!!!! like the honeymoon and renesmee and all. :]<br>  Midnight sun may or may not be published because stephenie got mad cuz it got leaked. im crossing my fingers though :[|`|Wi5MGlUFaa	Well sadly the 5th book got pushed to whenever. Someone had leaked some of the book online and now everyone has to suffer. <br>  <br>  Check this link, it tells you what happened. <a href="http://www.shortnews.com/start.cfm?id=73155" rel="nofollow">http://www.shortnews.com/start.cfm?id=73...</a><br>  <br>  Also I still love the first book. There was something new and refreshing about it. The rest of the books felt rushed and boring to me. |`|392d5f880bb60d6a8e379e3f65643ce7aa	they are all amazing, i don't know if i can pick a favorite..once i started them i couldn't put them down<br>  <br>  and i really hope it is published, i read the sneak of it and it seems like it is going to be absolutely amazing!!!!!|`|AA11657757	She said she was pissed because the fifth book got leaked, so I think she already put up the draft on her website. I don't think she's going to finish it though for a long long time.<br>  4th book is hands down the best.|`|qsHLSjvSaa	Eclipse.<br>  Im team Jacob so of course I love it. Bella realizes that she is in love with him to. And he's hottt!!!!|`|qKQbza9waa	twilight and the breaking dawn! stephenie meyer has put mid. sun on hold so i'm not even sure if it will be published. i really hope it will!|`|6a9e8f29ae2d33ea1a772294086f51b5aa	My favorites were New Moon and Breaking Dawn. |`|rKWEvoiRaa	I think the 3rd book because Edward comes back to Bella and they are both happy... and Edward saves her life.<br>  <br>  The 5th book isn't going to be published. They are going to start a whole new series on Edward's point of view, but it's not completely confirmed yet.|`|66x0PGoPaa	i acctually liked the 1st one!! |`|Wjc3Lc9Zaa	Twilight will always be my favorite, because it's where Edward and Bella first met and their relationship bloomed =]<br>  <br>  "So where does this leave Midnight Sun? My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't like math; in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything. If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely."<br>  (Stephenie Meyer's own words)<br>  <br>  You can read the first 12 chapters on her website, where she posted it.<br>  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...</a>|`|Ake3x3t1aa	i loved breaking dawn cuz its the last one and every thing was just so good o yea um midnight sun is on hold since people posted illegal copies of it and you can read the first 264 pages that she wrote of it on stepheniemeyer.com|`|EVS5t31qaa	Breaking Dawn was best because Bella became a vampire.<br>  <br>  Yes, Midnight Sun will be published.|`|EImjExb7aa	all of the books are nothing but ****.<br>  sorry to burst your bubble :D<br>  actually,no im not sorry. you guys should know better.
E80oq8bIaa	read the vampire diaries i like them alot not as good as twilight but still good and the vampire kisses and alot of others<br>  <br>  actually what i did when i wanted some was i went to amazon and typed in twilight then added it to my cart<br>  then itll give you like a giant list of books that are similar to it and theres alot of good ones on there<br>  <br>  and oh yah the vampire kisses isnt the best but youll like it im sure|`|bdYXd8exaa	well one of my favorite series is the Mediator series, by meg cabot. its about a girl named suze who can talk to ghosts, and she falls in love with one. the differences are that of course, the guy is a ghost not a vampire, although suze and the ghost, jesse, have the same problems edward and bella have, dealing with jesse not being able to age. also there is kind of a jacob-like character, except this guy is a mediator just like suze, and he is more evilish than jake. there is less violence but more comedy, but there is mystery, action, and romance. the twilight series is one of my faves, too. my other favorite series, though not quite like the twilight books is harry potter. they do have some comedy and romance, you know. my friend recommends the series called the "finding christina" series. i dont think they are called that now though, she thinks they are called like, the fog, and the fire, and stuff. what about the lord of the rings series? i've never read them, but i have a friend who really likes them. <br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|IW5Gc8eSaa	The Vampires Diaries- L.J.

TP3WalzAaa	Everyone deals with the question: Is there a God?<br>  <br>  Some come to the conclusion that there is, and try to live in a way they think He wants them to live. Others consider the question briefly reject the idea and carry on. Either way, the question 'must' be considered before choosing a way of life. Most people--only with exception of those unable to do so, due to mental impairments etc--have asked themselves that question even if they don't remember it. This begins the journey (life). Throughout the journey, everyone then has the freedom to change their position.

If you want something badly enough then focus on it completely and you will achieve it, but it takes perserverance, hard work and optimistism (not sure whether that's a word lol but you get my drift). <br>  <br>  <br>  Follow the acting path....who knows where it might lead you?<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope you achieve your dreams XXXXXXXXXXXX|`|I6dcRgD6aa	get the dvd "the Secret" you can get it from a library it explains how we create our life through the power of our mind...slso, look up Louise Hay & if you want to look at her book or her DVD it is You Can Heal Your life|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	If you are doing if for the fame it will not happen if you are doing it for the love of the theater and acting maybe<br>  <br>  keep this in mind - all Famous people are not happy the price of fame is to much many of them are dysfunctional in relationships abuse there kids take drugs drink  to much and kill themselves<br>  <br>  we all wanted to be famous when we were 13 <br>  maybe you should strive to be happy first|`|p0c4mek6aa	Well, if you want something bad enough you'll have to work bloody hard for it. I suggest you start off like many actors (I assume you want to be an actor since you are taking drama), by audtioning for minor parts or advertising. You need to start somewhere.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	if your goal is to be an actress because you love acting you should find an agent if your goal is to be famous for the sake of being famous find a good rehab now because it's not what you think it is.|`|eSodtiniaa	Be prepared for bitter disappointment. Make sure you have something to fall back on.|`|pQbFoVyJaa	Ignore that comment before. I am 14 and I am the same. Seriously, if you are determined enough then you can do anything. It is good that you have experience. What is the problem with getting an agent? Maybe you could try joining a drama group that has its own agency. Also, as an actor you have to be interested in all aspects of this profession such as television, radio ETC. You also need to think about whether you want to act, sing and dance, or whether you just want to be famous...<br>  Yes, you have your whole life ahead of you, but you decide what to do with it, so good luck!<br>  Keep an eye out for open auditions and get as much experience as possible - It will come in VERY useful when you are able to make your own desicions! =]|`|QWky1BgDaa	Basically, you can't. You will need an agent to get any big roll. The casting crews don't just get any old kids to audition for roll (there are thousands of kids like you who want to be famous and think they have what it takes). You have to be a good actor, so they go to agencies. If you are a good actor, and get an agent, the usually take a percentage, but once you have been in something big, you can start going independent. Fame is a crule world and you can't do it alone.|`|YBLrzF7Maa	like <a href="http://famous.tm/wp-signup.php," rel="nofollow">http://famous.tm/wp-signup.php,</a> <a href="http://myspace.com," rel="nofollow">http://myspace.com,</a> <a href="http://youtube.com," rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com,</a> <a href="http://www.gotcast.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.gotcast.com,</a> to showcase your skills.

If you haven't noticed, most celebrities may come from small towns, but they make their big breaks in places that have lots of agents: Hollywood, Miami, Los Angels, New York, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck :) |`|rMrcsjxpaa	Do things to help the community and practice at your goal.

I hope that you make it.|`|PLPXzxC4aa	Maybe you should consider changing your goal from "being famous" to "being the best". That way you'll continue to work your hardest. If you become famous, and even if you don't, you'll be proud of yourself knowing you worked really hard doing what you love. Also, remember to take critisism well and be prepared to be rejected many times before you reach your goal.|`|nicFV9HAaa	I want to be famous to, I have the same problem.<br>  I have been singing since I was little & have never stopped :P<br>  I always wonder what it's like, I want to big on a big stage with all those people.<br>  <br>  Just carry on with it, perhaps film yourself on www.youtube.com showing off your talents.<br>  Alot of people have become famous off youtube, Esmee Denters for example.

Fame is not the same as success.  Better to work hard, be passionate about acting, and be respected than to do it just so people will know your name.<br>  <br>  Look at how celebrities have to constantly find a hole to hide in to get any privacy, and keep their name and pictures out of the news.  Is that really what you're looking for?  Fame seems good, until everyone in the world feels entitled to a piece of you.|`|ymZsdMcAaa	If your best is better than the best of the rest you might have a chance.All you need is lots of exposure.You will need to be ok with lose of privacy and dealing with lowlifes and wild rumors.Fame will not make you happy but if that's what you want go for it.Get out in front and make yourself seen and heard.|`|AA11201256	You know, do you like acting, or do you want to be famous??<br>  <br>  first of all, a good actress will be discovered even in the worst possible situation. sometimes who's trying to be famous, will never be. <br>  <br>  trust me, every other 13 years want to be famous. |`|cpmZmw8Kaa	Go to hollywood, try to make it, fail miserably, become a porn star.<br>  <br>  Welcome to life kiddo!|`|ZKgbT78Iaa	pfffft wait till ur 15 unless ur rich dont try until u can actually go somewhere like Hollywood but i'm sure it will work out |`|JqjSAhPuaa	It is so hard to get famous.

Lot's of teens want to be famous.<br>  Now, if you want to just be famous, than don't pursue an acting career. It will be lot's of hard work when you can just go out and act like Chris Crocker or Perez Hilton to be famous. Not saying that is what you should do of course, but I am saying you don't always need talent to be famous. Now I don't think that's what you want though.<br>  I think you might want some fame, but I also think you mean success from being a good actress. Success as in awards, being in lots of movies, getting recognized, money, etc. Being famous would be fun, I'm pretty sure lot's of people would like that. So people making a big deal about you wanting fame is ridiculous. But wanting JUST fame is bad. You should love what you do for your major career.<br>  If you really want to act, be in movies, and be successful, just work at it! Of course there is a chance you won't make it, but there is a chance you WILL! If you live your life always thinking "what if this doesn't happen, eh I'm not gonna go for it chances are slim" etc. you won't get far in life. No matter which career you choose. If all the successful actors, actresses, musicians, etc. thought that there wouldn't BE any. Just think of that! =]<br>  Miley Cyrus landed the role of Hannah Montana when she was 12 or 13, so it's not like no 13 year olds have ever landed an acting job.<br>  Overall, if you really love acting, just work at it. Take headshots and write out your resume. Try to get into an agent. They'll help you land auditions. Even starting out as an extra would be good. So, good luck with your dreams and try to make them a reality! =]<br>  Btw, I am an aspiring 15-year-old actress. Just thought I'd let yah know. :D|`|jwK42UAQaa	Of course you can become famous, just perfect your skills and be prepared to take some risks and be ready to deal with disappointment, don't just focus your self on one discipline gain a broad lot of skills and just pray for the best.<br>  However I will say don't count o being famous continue with your studies and make sure you get good grades in case I doesn't fall in to <br>  place. If it is just fame you are after then there are other ways than just acting, singing, dancing, politics, literature, aleeping with famous people(maybe keep that as a backup :p)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Don't give up on your dreams, but remember all the other ptions ahead of you...<br>  |`|BTFAuCJSaa	Giving up isn't the answer, try your hardest.<br>  Tons of girls your age want to become famous.<br>  It's like 1 in a million, if you don't give up, you can be the 1.<br>  All I'm saying is that, follow your dreams, and don't give up.<br>  One day it will pay off.<br>  And don't listen to anyone to puts you down and say your pathetic and sad. <br>  My cousin, he's 8, no past acting classes, no resume,no agent, no nothing.<br>  He wanted to become famous, then he went to audition for a commerical, and he became the star of the commerical, he got his own free agent, and money.

Make sure your parents know of your dream, because behind every star there is parental support. They drive you around to auditions, and are there to support you when things go wrong and believe me there is more wrong than right. And then there are extras, look out for young extras needed, join school productions and talk to your drama teacher, they also are a good connection to competitions and actions out there.<br>  And another big one, don't depend on it all, as much as you want it, the worst thing you can do is depend on it all, because if things go wrong (more chance that less), you would be devastated, when an uncle told me I was hurting myself by what i was doing I never believed  until i realized I was going nowhere. I was shattered, but in my heart i'm still not giving up.<br>  Dancing, singing and theatre lessons. <br>  Be smart, don't let wanting to be famous get to your head and make you stupid. You need to have standards and dignity. It's hard work, but good things in life are hardwork.<br>  Keep researching and go for it. It could be just withing your reach.

AA11736322	It is important to find someone with whom you can create a good relationship from the outset... Sexual attraction blinds you to the thousands of little things by which relationships eventually survive or fail... You need to find a way to see beyond this initial overwhelming physical fascination...Truly fortunate partners manage to become longtime friends before they realize they are attracted to each other... They get to know each other’s laughs, passions, sadnesses, and fears... They see each other at their worst and at their best.... They share time together before they get swept up into the entangling intimacy of their sexuality.#|`|A01w1dHqaa	Ask for him or her to come.

K7ZV0v2daa	1) Looks like a nice sunset but the composition is a bit off. Think of the rule of thirds, don't split the image with the horizon. You want to place the horizon line at about the top or bottom third of the image. The way it is right now there is just too much dark space in the foreground. The sky is also a bit overexposed. Nice try here, but a little more work on the composition. <br>  <br>  #2) Love this. Nice abstract work with interesting colors. Nothing more to really say here. You managed to grab my attention with the interesting lines and the overall darkness of the photo.<br>  <br>  #3) Really like this one too but the white balance looks a tad off. You got some funky colors in the sky. Again, watch the horizon line here because it's rather close to the middle of the image again. Rule of thirds, rule of thirds, rule of thirds. You almost never want the horizon in the center of the image. Other than the horizon in the middle of the image I like the composition. Love the nice low point of view with the rock face dominating the right of the image. Good work here.<br>  <br>  #4) I like nothing about this. The colors are blah and look way too green. Probably a white balance issue here too. This image has nothing to catch the eye and makes it boring to look at (you wanted honesty).<br>  <br>  #5) Love the sepia tone here. Nice image and the colors work well here. Don't know if I would buy this though just because of the subject, it's not really something I would put on my wall. Another good one though :)<br>  <br>  #6) I won't even go here because this is just such a cliche shot and serves no purpose in serious photography.<br>  <br>  #7) I'm totally loving this one!!! I see that funny color in the sky again. . . but now that I think about it, this could just be the way your camera renders the colors. I would buy this if the sky colors weren't such a teal color.<br>  <br>  #8) Again, rule of thirds. The horizon line splits the image leaving way too much empty/dark/blank space at the bottom of the image.<br>  <br>  #9) Probably my favorite of the whole bunch so far. Love the black and white here. I woudl buy this one.<br>  <br>  #10) Odd colors again but still a cool shot. <br>  <br>  #11) Another cool one.<br>  <br>  All this said, are you shooting with a point and shoot camera or a DSLR. From the look of the images it looks like a point and shoot. You got some serious banding in most of the skys. The gradient of colors in the sky in almost every image doesn't transition smoothly and gives a rough appearance to the sky. Consider buying a DSLR if your serious about photography (which it sounds and looks like your are). You will not be able to sell many images from a point and shoot because you have no room to blow them up to fit large canvases. |`|4e55bf2d7b472d9d927ddf7c3220c25caa	I can only see one, a sunset.<br>  It looks ok, and the silhouettes look good against the sky.<br>  <br>  Have a look at <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redbubble.com/</a> and consider joining.<br>  <br>  If you do, message me, and I will send you the link to my profile on there, and help you get started.<br>  You get lots of help and tips etc. Join specialist groups, including this one, <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/photographic-france" rel="nofollow">http://www.redbubble.com/photographic-fr...</a> and its totally free.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your photography.|`|syKIxX45aa	My favourite ones in order are 7, 1 and 6.|`|Ll4yjTa7aa	i like the second one with the trees their branches are kinda curly|`|ouBEb03waa	the first one.|`|35f24b2af8a7ad84a7fcca13e0466ad7aa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/</a>|`|3e1945c2cf32eaa9d88c2b114ee89a1daa	Hi, <br>  <br>  One thing you may consider is joining a dedicated online photography website.

QJwOhM0qaa	I think you need more necessity in your life. If you found yourself in a place where you HAD to work or you would not eat or be able to pay the big bills you would find a way to do it every day or perish. <br>  Its like people who get sent to prison. They don't have the luxury of saying that prison is too hard or boring. They HAVE to go and they HAVE to deal somehow with it. I think until you get to that point you will continue to float. <br>  Many many people with/or without all sorts of attention disorders get up and go to work in order to survive every day. They would much rather be doing something else to enrich their lives but reality will not allow the time for it. Buckle down and focus on what the job is and do not let your mind go wandering off into the past or the future. Meditation can help with this but the best way to stay focused on the work is by doing the work. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	It's very difficult. One could look for another job, but the market out there is grim.

As you follow the path of the inner voice with its fruits of peace and joy, you will also encounter your share of tests and challenges. While it is natural to ask, "Why me?" when adversity strikes, feeling victimized leaves you powerless to change the situation.<br>  <br>  A better approach is to emulate the "triumphant survivors," those individuals who emerge from their ordeals strengthened and renewed. They understand the universal law that every adversity contains within it the seeds of an equivalent or greater good. The triumphant survivor says, "I would rather not have to deal with this challenge, but as long as I must, I will use it as an opportunity to grow and transform."<br>  <br>  When adversity is faced in this way, miracles happen. The apparent curse becomes a divine blessing. Uninvited situations bring life~changing lessons. Here, then, is the alchemical secret~by using everything for our spiritual growth, we become victor instead of victim.

The only thing that matters is the everlasting present. <br>  W. Somerset Maugham (1874 - 1965), The Moon and Sixpence <br>  <br>  Longfellow has also put "my philosophy" into a pretty nice quote:<br>  <br>  Look not mournfully into the past.

I'm not saying it's wrong, it is okay, but if we do it too much, and we resent every single thing we do, and we carry it on our backs until today, it will not help us move on. The first thing to do is to get rid of those mistakes and try to get a new life, to not repeat the bad things we have done in the past. We should also try to not think permanently of the bad memories we have. Memories should not be forgotten, but you should not really focus on them every single day because all it brings is negativity to yourself. <br>  <br>  When people think too much of the future, they like to worry because they don't know what's ahead of them, and they're trying so hard to plan whatever it is they want to do. Don't get me wrong, planning is great (I like to plan and be organized too, hehe) but unfortunately too much planning will just cause a headache, and you'll have trouble following them. It's not easy to manage a life, because personally, because I believe in God, I'll just give my future to God's hands.<br>  <br>  Another thing is the modern principles that people make these days. Ever heard of the expression "time is money"? This causes people to try to consume as little time as they can when they try to get things done. People don't appreciate each other, or the environment anymore, and it's causing us a lot of things, such as obesity (from fast food) and global warming (carbon emissions).<br>  But here's another thing to look for: I guess it's difficult to live in the present because you're sort of 'burdened' with the things that have happened in the past. We are people who are pushed with expectations to live our lives better than like the people in the past, therefore it can be a little stressful.|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	One should always try to live in the present.

bdttDnlwaa	Here I agree with Soullight comments on Personality, I could not phrase it better.<br>  <br>  Now, vis a vis all the other participants, I just do not see innocence quite like that.<br>  <br>  Innocence, for me, does not mean a lack of knowledge. <br>  <br>  Innocence does not come from the mind or the intellect.<br>  (may be "ignorance" does).<br>  <br>  Innocence is a spiritual state or a spiritual phase.<br>  <br>  I see it as very high or lofty, and at the same time, very premature and immature. It is both.<br>  <br>  It is very difficult to explain.<br>  <br>  Because if you are not so innocent, it is wonderful and helpful and can go a long way.<br>  <br>  But if you are innocent, it is like opening a Magical or Mysterious door, a little bit like "Alice in Wonderland" did, and next everything is possible.<br>  <br>  Personality, yes.<br>  <br>  Innocence, yes.<br>  <br>  All is well.<br>  <br>  Personality takes birth with our "incarnation".<br>  <br>  Innocence probably comes from a source that is beyond time and space.

In a study performed by Cohn (1991) several definitions were given. The first definition states that personality development is an increasing capacity for self-control, self-examination, and self-awareness. A second definition says that people become more reflective with age, display an increasing concern with philosophical issues and exhibit greater acceptance of responsibility for themselves and others. The third definition describes a series of developmental achievements : between childhood and late adolescence individuals replace immediate desires with long-range goals, develop an ability to tolerate frustration and adopt moral values because of their apparent validity rather than because of their approval by parents or peers. <br>  <br>  Now...about innocence...I think innocence is a stage regarding a person's behavior towards society. I suppose most people would define it as the lack of guilt regarding any situation. I mean, a child (given the "innocent" status) is not aware of what his/her acts will affect his enviroment...<br>  <br>  Innocence is also :inexperience<br>  To be innocent of something is to have had no part in, to not have been influenced by, and to have had no affect on that something. To never even have considered its possibility.And such a state is only present from birth to an early childhood stage...because my (2 year old) grandson has aquired already a certain "manipulative" tricky way in order to get "his way through", so in a sense, he's NOT "innocent" anymore...-smile-<br>  <br>  I hope this extensive explanation is satisfactory to you !

Personality represents a group of conscious and unconscious thinking, emotional and physical responses or reactions to our external environment. It is a product of conscious and intuitive interpretation of all that what is, and is our chosen relationship to all what is. <br>  <br>  Innocence is the absence of knowledge, and is so clearly, a state of unknowing or acting in a way without understanding the knowledge of what one is doing. Innocence is only relational to a thinking mind, it is a concept, surrounding someone who dwells in knowing or unknowing. It is a category term, where we can form perceptions of someone who is aware and those who are not. It is birthed within an individual when one employs the concept.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html</a>|`|Z49hyPfgaa	I hated reading that book in high school.

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	this is pretty easy-<br>  <br>  First off you need a program to edit with.  I would reccomend for you Vicman's or Gimp if you need a free program.  Vicman's Photo editor is the easiest to use for people new to photo editing.<br>  <br>  1. Open photo in Vicman's<br>  2.

However, this can be easily replicated in editing applications as stated below. The second picture is actually full color, seems some of the plants in the area have whitish leaves. With the powershot, you don't really have all that much creative control over your images. Your best bet is to retouch afterwards. Experiment with the "Camera RAW" output from the powershot. Might require reading the manual and will definatly require a powerful image editor although Canon may offer one for free on there website. It will allow you to adjust the fine details of the shot as if you were developing tangible film on your own. Canon offers a Camera RAW codec download on there website, its listed under the EOS software. That may however just be a plug-in for another application. The manual is also located on there site. Camera RAW editing is going to be your best bet. Google (or yahoo!) for "Canon RAW" for more information. Good Luck.<br>  -Chris H.
ohj5sRpsaa	Wow, that sucks! I would not want to write that paper either.<br>  <br>  I would say that Hamlet is often quite indifferent to dieing, and sometimes even a little blasé.

Death is an undiscovered country from which no traveler returns!<br>  <br>  Essentially - life is bad, but death may be worse. <br>  <br>  Your thesis is basically what you are going to talk about for your whole paper, and your topic sentences need to relate to your thesis.

What he's saying is: "Is it better to bear the painful burden of life, or to refuse the burden by killing yourself?"<br>  <br>  Life is so full of pain ("the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised love"), why do we continue to live when we could just kill ourselves and end the pain ("to die, to sleep, no more, and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to")?<br>  <br>  The only thing stopping us is our fear of the unknown, so we choose life over the risk of possible damnation ("the undiscovered country from which no man returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others we know not of").<br>  <br>  He rationalizes that the reason we are afraid is because we think too much and as a result we fail to act ("thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought").

ETFaQiTzaa	Because, in Greek Mythology, Prometheus was the one who made humans.  Just as Frankenstein created his monster from scratch.<br>  <br>  ***He didn't give the fire to the Titans, did he?  Prometheus was a Titan, himself.  He had access to the fire already.    He gave it to his creations--the humans.  Which is why Zeus chained to him the rock, and then created a woman (Pandora), giving her a box of evils that he knew she would open, and that would plague the rest of the humans who had his fire.|`|AA12219791	Hmm. In my humble opinion, Frankenstein can be compared to Prometheus in that they both were "punished" for attempting to help mankind.<br>  <br>  In Greek Mythology, Prometheus took fire from the gods on Mount Olympus and gave it to the Titans down below who were living in darkness. Now, the Titans could cook and see and do all kinds of things they couldn't do before. This angered the gods and Zeus, the almighty king of the gods, punished him by binding him to a rock and having an eagle come to eat his liver, which replenished itself, everyday.<br>  <br>  Similarly, Frankenstein (the scientist, not the monster), took creation into his own hands and instead of being celebrated for his accomplishment, the effects were horrible.<br>  <br>  ***After researching I found this quote from Wikipedia:<br>  "In popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as "Frankenstein", despite this being the name of the scientist. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the "over-reaching" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus."

They have the most helpful reviews displayed on the main page for the book, and the majority of the most-helpfuls, for all three books, are one-star reviews.<br>  <br>  Instead, I'd suggest books like these: Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynn Jones, anything by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes if she is into vampires, The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, The Giver, Gathering Blue, and Messenger all by Louis Lowry (and should be read in that order), and The Warriors series by Erin Hunter.

And yes, you can sit there and use the place as a library, take any book off the shelf and read it. <br>  <br>  I used to think we we catering to a bunch of cheap shi#'s, even the suitboy types would come in , get a six dollar coffee then ask if we had free wireless access and use our business section.  But at least folks are reading and learning.  <br>  <br>  Don't recall anyone being kicked out, though we did track some suspected of theft and caught them.|`|wEEOvu5Waa	The ones might be different by you, but mine never kick you out unless you do something that deserves for you to be kicked out. All of ours have chairs, couches, tables etc. I have spent multiple hours sitting and just reading a book, and I have never been scolded for bringing a drink inside.<br>  <br>  Thinking on it, it really depends. There was one I went to out of town that was a bit more tight on people just sitting and reading, but only if you looked homeless. A lot of them would come in with luggage and pretend to read just to sit indoors. I have seen them asked to leave, but I have never seen anyone else. Plus, I always see college students working on reports using the book there, and I am pretty sure they were not previously bought.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Yeah, you can pretty much set up shop in a Barns & Noble and they won't bother you. They figure if you're there long enough you'll eventually buy something, if only out of guilt. Also, it makes the store look good to have a bunch of people reading all over the place<br>  <br>  The one near me has a Starbucks in it, though I don't know if they allow outside food/drinks. They probably do, though.|`|pbw7chpyaa	If they don't sell drinks, they rarely let you bring snacks in.<br>  <br>  If they do sell drinks, you can't bring your own. It is a business.<br>  <br>  <br>  So fork out enough to buy that small coffee already, cheapskate..(or buy that hip flask to go with the coffee.)<br>  <br>  <br>  otherwise go to the library and take a break occasionally for that drink.|`|hprR6qfHaa	dont know about barnes & noble but u definitely can do that at borders|`|Udq1S1mQaa	where i live (orange county, CA) most B&N have a Starbucks or a small coffee shop connected/inside it...so i think its fine to enjoy a cup of coffee with your book. ive done this before and was never told otherwise by the management. it is also perfectly fine to sit all day in B&N and read read read! many students go there and study all day too! i love B&N!!<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you :)|`|ytpICvJdaa	fine by me|`|I0EpYn8Faa	well the barnes &nobles near me has a starbucks inside of it..so i wouldnt say drinks arent allowed.<br>  &you can just read the whole day there; they have chairs for you to read =P<br>  however if you do it everyday, aint tht a bit pathetic? u really dont hav anything better to do than mooch off free books all day?

Je pense que parfois une réaction de colère peut assainir un conflit. Disons que c'est une espèce d'électrochoc qui peut faire paradoxalement faire baisser la tension. Il me semble que l'important c'est d'avoir conscience que l'on est en colère, et qu'il nous faut cultiver la capacité de mettre un terme à une crise de colère.<br>  C'est peut-etre un aveu de faiblesse pour les etres qui ne savent pas donner du sens à leurs sentiments.

75068286807839d9cfaa471dccd5b16eaa	J'ai répondu à cette Q, il y a quelque temps, je recopie ma réponse d'alors....<br>  <br>  Au théatre, les trois coups sont frappés avec un baton appelé brigadier sur le plancher de la scène, juste avant le début d'une représentation, pour attirer l'attention du public, particulièrement quand il y a un lever de rideau.<br>  <br>  Cette tradition, plus particulièrement fran?aise, peut venir du Moyen ?ge, où trois coups, symbolisant la Trinité, terminaient le Mystère. ( définition de Mystère, représentation théatrale. : <br>  - Les mystères sacrés : sujets bibliques, Ancien et Nouveau Testament. <br>  - Les mystères religieux : tirés pour la plupart des vies de saints, miracles qui ont pris la forme du mystère. <br>  - Les mystères profanes : ils puisent leur sujet dans l'histoire. <br>  Ces trois coups pouvaient être précédés d'ONZE autres martelés (douze ap?tres moins Judas). On frappe toujours ces 11 coups dans la plupart des théatres.<br>  <br>  Une autre explication fait correspondre les trois coups à trois saluts que les comédiens exécutaient avant de jouer devant la Cour : le premier vers la reine (c?té cour, c'est à dire vers la gauche, quand on est sur scène) , le deuxième vers le roi (c?té jardin, donc, c?té droit quand on est sur scène ) et le troisième pour le public. (face)<br>  <br>  Le grade de brigadier était donné à un ouvrier dirigeant une équipe. Le régisseur se servant d'un baton pour frapper les trois coups, rassemble l'équipe du théatre pour commencer le spectacle, tel un brigadier rassemblant ses hommes ; on a appelé par métonymie le baton lui-même un ? brigadier ?.<br>  <br>  Le brigadier est fait traditionnellement en bois avec un morceau de perche de théatre, décoré de velours rouge et clous dorés.<br>  <br>  Pendant des années la Comédie-Fran?aise frappait deux fois trois coups, six coups donc, pour matérialiser la jonction des deux troupes, celle de l'H?tel de Bourgogne et la Troupe de Molière.|`|1UPqcWzLaa	le monde du théatre  adore les rites les traditions et le vocabulaire mystérieux aux non initiés. mais pour les trois coups, c'est du passé, aujourd'hui on te demande d'éteindre ton portable.|`|PbmMS9vXaa	et pour compléter la réponse de KAERICK, le baton s'appelle le brigadier.

I think you mean to compare the Classic Era TO the Hellenistic period, is that right?<br>  If that is the case, then you must answer: Where?  Anywhere near Greece?<br>  Because during the Classic Era, Athens and Sparta were on the scene (as different city-countries if you may , polis-krati), and had already differences in that matters. Now during the Hellenistic era, a different form of government was on, regality. Also, many kingdoms created, many nations mixed and new cities raised as cultural and political centers of these kingdoms. New mores and customs mixed, and the social status also took a turn to more open forms.<br>  You can't make an easy comparison because many factors come in, and I can't tell if there can be a comparison there at at all.

48f4f597261b49986babdc580d61d87eaa	Die URSACHEN? <br>  <br>  Die URSACHE war, dass Hitler den Krieg wollte. Er wollte ihn von Anfang an, schon, als er noch lange nicht an der Macht war. Er wollte nicht unbedingt in Frankreich einfallen, aber er wollte mehr und mehr in Europa erobern, "Lebensraum im Osten" erobern. Das stand schon in "Mein Kampf", was Hitler, bzw. die, die es für ihn schrieben, in den 1920ern schrieben. Das war das lang geplante Ziel. So hat Hitler 1933 als er an die Macht kam, zwar verkündet, er würde den Weltfrieden anstreben, doch gab es auch sehr gleich eine Besprechung mit hochrangigen Offizieren, in dem Gespr?ch forderte Hitler Dinge wie "St?rkung des Wehrwillens" und Bereitschaft zum Krieg, denn ein solcher würde früher oder sp?ter kommen. Bzw., von Hitler provoziert. Das ganze System Hitler war auf den Krieg ausgelegt, denn Hitler rüstete hoch und hoch und hoch und das Deutsche Reich hatte kaum Geld. Es hatte Schulden. Um diese zu bezahlen, musste man Geld irgendwoher kriegen... z.B. aus den besetzten Gebieten, indem man sie ausbeutete.<br>  <br>  So, das war freilich ein europ?ischer Krieg nur, wirst du sagen. War's auch. Aber da Hitler de facto mit Japan verbündet war ab 1941 (Kominternpakt), und mit Italien sowieso verbündet war, gab es auch Krieg in Afrika (Italien, Rommel unterstützt, gegen Briten) und dem Pazifik sowie Ostasien (Japan, viele Kriege, u.a. gegen China und die USA). Auch deutsche U-Boote selbst haben direkt amerikanische Schiffe angegriffen.|`|tMvWqGY4aa	Ganz klar war Hitler der Grund....aber hier steht, wie alles eigentlich angefangen hat:<br>  <br>  Der Krieg in Europa 1939 / 1940 <br>   ----------------------------------------...<br>   <br>  Die Vernichtung Polens <br>    In der Nacht zum 1. September 1939 t?uschten SS-M?nner in polnischen Uniformen einen überfall auf den deutschen Rundfunksender Gleiwitz in Oberschlesien vor. Damit sollte ein Anlass für den deutschen Angriff geschaffen werden. Gegen 4:45 Uhr er?ffnete ein deutsches Schlachtschiff im Hafen von Danzig das Feuer auf ein polnisches Munitionslager. Nur wenige Stunden sp?ter überschritten deutsche Truppen die polnische Grenze. <br>    Polen hatte die Forderung des deutschen Au?enministers Ribbentrops nach einer Wiedereingliederung Danzigs in das Deutsche Reich sowie eine exterritoriale Autostra?e und Eisenbahnlinie zu dem seit 1919 abgeschnittenen Ostpreu?en entschieden abgelehnt. Hitler h?tte Polen auch ohne die Ablehnung angegriffen; er wollte den Krieg. <br>      <br>   <br>    3. September: Kriegserkl?rungen Gro?britanniens und Frankreichs an Deutschland (noch keine Kriegshandlungen). <br>    Gro?britannien hatte sich am 31. M?rz 1939 bereit erkl?rt, den Bestand Polens zu garantieren. Dieses Angebot wurde auf polnischen Wunsch in einen zweiseitigen Garantievertrag umgewandelt. Frankreich schloss sich dem Vorgehen Gro?britanniens an. <br>      <br>   <br>    5. September: USA verkündet Neutralit?t. <br>   <br>    Sowjetunion bleibt neutral, beginnt jedoch am 17. September mit dem Einmarsch in das ostpolnische Gebiet.  <br>   <br>    27. September: Kapitulation Warschaus (ungleiche Kr?fteverh?ltnisse, am 6. Oktober 1939 Ende der letzten Widerstandshandlungen) <br>   <br>    28. September: Deutsch-sowjetischer Vertrag zur Neuregelung Polens (Freundschaftsvertrag). Die Grenze wird weiter ?stlich gezogen, als im Vertrag vom August 1939 vorgesehen war. Deutschland tritt das an Ostpreu?en grenzende Litauen an die Sowjetunion ab. Keine Neubildung eines polnischen Staates. <br>   <br>   <br>  Finnland, bis 1917 zum russischen Reich geh?rig, lehnte russische Stützpunkte auf seinem Gebiet ab. überfall der Sowjetunion auf Finnland am 30. November 1939; am 14.Dezember 1939 wird die Sowjetunion aus dem V?lkerbund ausgeschlossen. Als Franzosen und Engl?nder im Frühjahr 1940 damit beginnen, durch das n?rdliche Norwegen (über Narvik) in den Kampf einzugreifen, bricht die Sowjetunion den Kampf ab. Es kommt zu einem Kompromissfrieden: Finnland beh?lt seine Unabh?ngigkeit. <br>    Die Sowjetunion er?ffnet den Krieg gegen Finnland mit geringem Kr?fteeinsatz. Infolgedessen dauert es überraschend lange, ehe das übergewicht der russischen Truppen fühlbar wird. Dadurch wird die Neigung Deutschlands, die milit?rische Macht der Sowjetunion zu untersch?tzen, verst?rkt.   <br>      <br>   <br>  April - Juni 1940: Deutsche Besetzung D?nemarks (kampflos) und Norwegens. <br>    Bereits am 10. Oktober 1939 hat der Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, Gro?admiral Raeder, Hitler auf den Nutzen von Stützpunkten an der norwegischen Küste für die Seekriegsführung hingewiesen. Weitere Gründe für den Nordfeldzug: Benutzung Norwegens als Durchgangsland der kriegswirtschaftlich wichtigen schwedischen Erze, Angriffsbasis für den Luftkrieg gegen Gro?britannien.  <br>   <br>    28. M?rz 1940: Die Alliierten beschlie?en, norwegische Gew?sser zu verminen um sie für deutsche Schiffe zu sperren. <br>   <br>    Norwegen leistet Widerstand, die deutsche Marine erleidet schwere Verluste. Die schwachen englischen und franz?sischen Unterstützungskr?fte k?nnen die Niederlage der norwegischen Armee nicht verhindern.  <br>   <br>    Am 7. Juni 1940 ziehen sich die Alliierten aus Norwegen zurück. <br>   <br>   <br>  Das ist nur ein Auszug aus einer guten Chronologie des Zweiten Weltkrieges.....wenn Du Interesse hast, klick auf die Quelle.

Otdh4dJxaa	Chipre ha sido colonizada por diversas culturas a lo largo de su historia. La civilización micénica habría llegado cerca del 1.600 a.C., y posteriormente se establecieron colonias fenicias y griegas. El faraón Tutmosis III de Egipto sometió la isla en el a?o 1.500 a.C. y la forzó a pagar tributos, lo que se mantuvo hasta que el dominio egipcio fue remplezado por el de los hititas (que llamaban Alasiya a Chipre en su lengua) en el siglo XIII aC. Tras la invasión de los pueblos del mar (aprox. 1200 aC), los aqueos-griegos se asentaron en la isla (ca. de 1.100 a.C.), actuando decididamente en la conformación de su identidad cultural.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Castillo de Kyrenia<br>  Los asirios invadieron la isla dl a?o 800 a.C., hasta que el faraón Amasis reconquistó la isla en el a?o 600 a.C., para luego ser reemplazado por los persas tras la conquista de Egipto por parte de éstos. Salamina, la más poderosa de las distintas ciudades-reino de Chipre en esa época se rebeló contra el dominio persa en el a?o 499 a.C., bajo el Rey Onisilos; tanto esta rebelión como los consiguientes intentos griegos de liberar Chipre fracasaron, entre ellos los del Rey Evágoras de Salamis, en el a?o 345 a.C. No obstante, en el a?o 331 a.C. Alejandro Magno liberó Chipre de los persas reincluyéndose en el mundo helénico. La flota chipriota le ayudó a conquistar Fenicia.<br>  <br>  Tras la muerte de Alejandro Magno, Chipre fue objeto de rivalidades entre los generales que le sucedieron debido a su riqueza y estratégica situación, cayendo finalmente bajo el dominio de los Ptolomeos de Egipto. El Imperio Romano, finalmente, se apoderó de la isla en el a?o 57 a.C..A partir del a?o 45 de la Era Cristiana, los apóstoles San Pablo y San Bernabé introdujeron el Cristianismo en la isla y Chipre fue la primera region del mundo gobernada por un cristiano.<br>  <br>  Tras la caída de Roma, Chipre pasó por la dominación bizantina, árabe y griega, hasta 1192 cuando fue capturada por los cruzados liderados por Ricardo I Corazón de León.<br>  <br>  Italia ejerció su dominio sobre Chipre a través de La República de Venecia desde 1489, hasta la invasión turca otomana en 1570. Tras el Congreso de Berlín, Chipre pasó a administración británica el 12 de julio de 1878, siendo convertida oficialmente en colonia en 1914, con el inicio de la Primera Guerra Mundial.<br>  <br>  En 1931 comienzan las primeras revueltas a favor de la enosis (unión de Chipre con Grecia). Tras el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, los grecochipriotas aumentan la presión por el fin del dominio británico. El Arzobispo Makarios lidera la campa?a por la enosis, y es deportado a las Seychelles en 1956 tras una serie de atentados en la isla.<br>  <br>  En 1960, Turquia, Grecia y el Reino Unido -junto a las comunidades turcochipriota y grecochipriota- firman un tratado que declara la independencia de la isla y la posesión británica de las bases de Acrotiri y Dhekelia. Makarios asume la Presidencia. La constitución indica que los turcochipriotas estarán a cargo de la vicepresidencia, y tendrán poder de veto. Esa peculiar Constitución que le fuera impuesta dificultó el funcionamiento de Estado y las relaciones entre greco y turcochipriotas se hicieron tensas, desembocando en las explosiones de violencia intercomunitaria de 1963 y 1967<br>  <br>  El 15 de julio de 1974 un golpe pro-griego depuso al gobierno legítimo, lo que provocó la reacción de Turquía, quien invadió y ocupó militarmente el tercio norte de la isla, incumpliendo la legalidad internacional. éste es el origen de la República Turca del Norte de Chipre, un estado de facto que sólo es reconocido por Turquía y la Organización de la Conferencia Islámica.<br>  <br>  La República de Chipre entra como miembro de la Unión Europea en 2004, a?o en el que se aplica un plan para la reunificación apoyado por Naciones Unidas. Sin embargo, el referendo es rechazado por el 76% de los grecochipriotas.

Il termine “kebab” significa letteralmente “carne alla griglia”: la ricetta originale non prevedeva infatti la preparazione di un panino bensì di sottili fette di carne magra salata e poi fatta saltare in padella.<br>  <br>  Una variante è lo shish kebab, una specie di spiedino, che era originariamente preparato su fuochi da campo presso popolazioni nomadi della penisola arabica. Data la sua diffusione presso popolazione di religione islamica, non include carne di maiale, ma di agnello, manzo oppure pollo. <br>  Nei Paesi arabi è possibile trovarne moltissime altre varianti, e in alcune regioni costiere non è raro imbattersi in kebab a base di pesce, particolarmente tonno fresco.<br>  <br>  Nel secondo dopoguerra, alcuni turchi emigrati in Germania modificarono la ricetta per adattarla ai gusti tedeschi; nacque così il D?ner kebab (“carne alla griglia rotante”), ossia un panino preparato con pane arabo e l'aggiunta di molti ingredienti oltre alla carne. Quest'ultima è tagliata a fette circolari e poi infilzata su uno spiedo posto in posizione verticale, dove cuoce lentamente grazie al calore di una griglia elettrica o a gas. Un apposito utensile affilato permette poi di ricavare delle piccole strisce di carne da inserire nel panino.<br>  <br>  Il pane arabo (detto anche pita) ha la caratteristica di essere cotto a temperature molto alte, che lo fanno gonfiare in maniera notevole, creando una sorta di “tasca” adatta a contenere molti tipi di ripieno. Gli altri ingredienti sono rappresentati da verdure, come ad esempio cipolle, verza, insalata e pomodori, e salse di vario tipo. La più caratteristica è probabilmente la salsa yogurt, di cui esistono due varianti, una alle erbe e una all'aglio. Molto diffusa è anche una salsa piccante a base di pomodoro e peperoncino.<br>  <br>  Può essere un'alternativa valida e saporita al classico fast food di stampo americano, e spesso è di qualità superiore; non bisogna comunque eccedere nel suo consumo perché le porzioni sono solitamente molto generose e si rischierebbe di assumere troppe calorie. Inoltre, per mantenere la carne fresca e tenera, in cima allo spiedo è posto del grasso (prelevato dallo stesso taglio di carne in cottura) che, sciogliendosi, è assorbito dal kebab stesso rendendolo piuttosto “pesante”.|`|gvzsYfvLaa	manzo o maiale|`|x2oQt0LCaa	manzo o maiale aromatizzata cn pepe e spezie!!!!

Spain and Portugal were, at the time, the two big powers at sea. they were going places, discovering things. the treaty didn't exactly split the world between the two, what it did was give each country the right to claim undiscovered lands in their designated half. in other words, if Spain, on its travels to America, had discovered an island somewhere in the Atlantic, that island, even though it had been discovered by Spanish ships, could only be claimed by Portugal. the treaty also gave them the right to control who was allowed to sail in their designated areas. Spain was allowed to sail through Portuguese waters only to get to their own.<br>  It's hard to know who got the best deal here. At the time the Americas were pretty much a huge question mark. They knew there was something there, but it could have been just a small island. Spain ended up getting a lot of land and gold, but it could just as easily have ended up with a whole lot of salt water and nothing but. it was a gamble, it payed. Portugal got the monopoly to the safe and very lucrative spice and slave trade, on routes that were well known and therefore safe, and a slice of the new world to go with it (Brazil). But there was more to the treaty than just that. it meant that when the Pope (who was the highest authority at the time) sanctioned it, all other christian countries, countries such as England, would be under the same limitations. in other words, England could only sail the Atlantic if Portugal allowed it. England is an island on the Atlantic. The treaty effectively trapped England within itself. It was not until considerably after England broke with Rome (and therefore could consider itself no longer bound by the treaty) that they ventured away from their own shores.|`|319e672bb7d1fc4c106452bf653d4115aa	It was a treaty between Spain and Portugal whereby the two effectively split the world.  Spain got the New World and west, except for Brazil, and Portugal got Africa and east.  If I recall correctly, the treaty didn't address the Pacific, but Spain ended up colonizing much of it and Portugal didn't go much past India.|`|48fe46bf80f77ce6456b7b712da12bdaaa	It's also worth noting that while people have long thought portugal got the short end of the stick on that one, they also avoided many of the problems associated with such a massive empire, and did not have some of the severe financial problems Spain ended up with.

I think that pretty much gives it away...|`|B4SYW96jaa	In the story's epilogue, set nineteen years later, Ginny Weasley and Harry have three children named James, Albus Severus, and Lily. Ron and Hermione have two children named Rose and Hugo. The two families meet at King's Cross Station when they are taking their children to Platform Nine and Three Quarters for their departure to Hogwarts. Lily is too young to attend Hogwarts just yet, Albus is entering his first year at the school, and James is already an experienced Gryffindor. James finds Harry's godson Teddy, the son of Lupin and Tonks, kissing a girl named Victoire, James's cousin and assumed daughter of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. Harry tells Albus Severus that Severus Snape, whom he is named after, was possibly the bravest man Harry ever met. Neville is now the Herbology professor at the school and is close friends with Harry. At the station, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione spot Draco across the platform with his unnamed wife and their son Scorpius; Draco sees Harry, nods, and turns away. The book ends with the line: "The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."|`|c25bb4eeb8a23121abdbb64a43909abcaa	Yeah!!

8d4mZoPJaa	Assolutamentissimamente i libri! Io adoro HP e avrò letto ogni libro circa 7 volte...lo so che è un po' esagerato ma è l'unica serie che leggo in continuazione senza mai stancarmi...Non ci sono parole per descrivere i libri di Harry Potter...sono eccezionali, evocativi, splendidi, magici..c'è una descrizione di luoghi, oggetti, ma in particolare personaggi che è cosi precisa, dettagliata, profonda che fa di HP un libro straordinario...per questo motivo secondo me non c'è proprio confronto con i film, che, sì, sono carini, a volte simpatici, ma non possono trasmettere, l'intensità, l'emozione, la magia dei libri. Insomma, LIBRI, LIBRI, LIBRI!! ;)|`|GynCz8puaa	ovviamente il libro!!!!|`|d87000b3581902b50720c0d9b73b4048aa	putroppo non ho avuto occasione di vedere l'ultimo film di harry potter, e neanche di leggerne il 5°libro, perciò non so cosa pensare, solo quando uscirà il 6°film(Harry Potter e il Principe Mezzosangue)potrò dirti la mia preferenza, comunque bisogna tener conto, che il film di Harry Potter e l'Ordine Della Fenice è più corto dei precedenti, da quel che ho potuto leggere, e di coseguenza, credo che buona parte della storia del libro non sia stata inserita nel film.<br>  Spero di poterlo vedere al più presto il film :D:D:D 1bacio|`|07633ff3edcb82ec59c8b6b77a22a095aa	Certi film sono talmente dissimili dal libro corrispondente (come il terzo ed il quarto, ad esempio) che mi viene quasi da gridare al miracolo ad ogni somiglianza, come se fosse frutto di un caso fortuito.<br>  <br>  I libri di Harry Potter sono molto più coinvolgenti dei corrispettivi adattamenti cinematografici. Avendo già letto il settimo episodio, confesso di paventare il giorno in cui la Warner darà il "go ahead" per girare il film da esso tratto: ho paura che lo rovineranno e che finiranno per dare importanza ad episodi non esattamente rilevanti al momento (tipo un certo bacio tra certi due personaggi....).<br>  <br>  Non pensavo che mi sarei ridotta a dirlo, ma...Columbus, ritorna, per favore!|`|7HTSDrusaa	Se la domanda riguarda solo l'ultimo libro, non so perché non l'ho ancora visto, ma se la domanda riguarda tutti i libri in generale dei Harry Potter, allora mi sono piaciuti molto ma molto ma davvero molto di più i libri... Secondo me un libro fantasy perde molta della sua bellezza quando ne fanno il film, perché il vero film è nella mente del lettore e non è mai uguale a quello che pensa il regista... Io vorrei che non facessero più film tratti dai libri, perché di solito di uguale prendono solo il titolo...|`|LORfizhWaa	libro..penso non esista film migliore del libro stesso..|`|dd88ac2382eabc3aeddf57aa7567b481aa	I libri, sempre e comunque! Da "Potterologa" appassionata quale sono, vado sempre a vedere i film, ma ho costantemente l'impressione che siano molto raffazzonati. Un esempio su tutti: sfido chiunque non abbia letto il libro "Il Prigioniero di Azkaban" ma abbia solo visto il film a dirmi cosa c'entra la Mappa del Malandrino con il papà di Harry e con Remus!|`|80ff30d3ce3a78663521afdf06777b5faa	sicuramente i film non reggno confronto con i libri di harry potter... danno un'idea della narrazione completamente diversa rispetto al film, certo questi sono fatti bene, però spesso a causa del tempo mancano numerosi episodi e particolare, che invece nel lirbo vengono esposti!!!<br>  insomma il libro è certamente + completo, anche di emozioni, perchè per me è + emozionante leggere il libro... inziare a leggere le prime pagine, ansiosi di arrivare alla fine per sapere come va a finire...<br>  ma cmw... w harry potter, perchè la rowling ha permesso ad adulti e bambini di trasportare un pò di magia nella nostra realtà!!=)|`|KinAxyaBaa	I libri senza dubbio, il film non riesce a trasmettere tutta la magia dei libri ^^|`|LPh2ho9Laa	Decisamente i film (almeno ci sono gli effetti speciali!...). Ho provato a leggere i libri, ma li ho trovati un pò infantili e noiosetti...|`|QXC3YZ4Vaa	Il libro! senza alcun dubbio!|`|Z7XQ0MOCaa	il libro perchè la storia è più ricca di particolari rispetto ai film ma comunque anche i film sono belli per gli attori e gli effetti speciali(specialmente nel quinto film).|`|dVopYU5oaa	Io preferisco i libri di Harry Potter anche se i film sono lo stesso molto belli, è solo che nei libri possono essere raccontati molti più fatti e ci sono cose che nei film non potrebbero mettere per questione di tempo....|`|hPNrv9HOaa	libro libro libro libro libro libro .....libro!|`|jfgyuFLgaa	io continuo sempre a pensare che non si possano paragonare film e libri...perchè per me sono cose diverse...è come se si paragonassero una maglia e un paio di pantaloni...seono tutti e due di stoffa e sono vestiti...ma te li paragoneresti??<br>  <br>  ad ogni modo anche io preferisco cinquecento miliardi di volte i libri...perchè sono più lunghi, quando li leggi ti danno emozioni che difficilmente un film può riprodurre, sono un po più compresibili, la rowling scrive per me davvero bene e quando ne inizi, rinizi e rinizi ancora non puoi fare a meno di andare avanti...ti prende in una maniera impressionte...è scritto che sembra che le avventure di harry le stai vivendo di prima persona...poi ovviamente in confronto ai film cè logicamente più roba...nei film purtroppo vengono giustamente tagliati personaggi e scene e modificate altre...<br>  <br>  ma ad ogni modo devo dire che anche i film sono nel complesso molto ben fatti...specialmente secondo il mio parere soprattutto questultimo...<br>  <br>  perciò direi che:<br>  libri 10<br>  film 9....XD<br>  <br>  e miraccomando W HARRY POTTER!!!!|`|0rjsXSH9aa	senza dubbio i libri perchè i film sono incompleti e vengono modificati|`|184ada9959a41fc5ccd8407af6ce6015aa	Assolutamente il libro.In rarissimi casi s riesce a trasportare la reale magia d quello ke s legge sullo schermo,harry potter è uno di quei pochi ke riesce un pò a farlo..ma quando leggi prima i libri, è davvero un problema nn trovare mille difetti al film e quindi giudicarlo migliore.|`|1nCKx4vzaa	io non trovo sensato leggere un libro dove le cose che sileggono non possono essere reali.|`|6Zzfbv6taa	il libro.e bellissimo|`|6iM8QGIeaa	i libri..come sempre il libro e' meglio...pero' devo dire che anche i film sono buoni..putroppo data la lunghezza del libro tante parti interessanti devono esser tagliate..ma il succo rimane...pero' continuo  a dire MEGLIO I LIBRI|`|AaAckgpbaa	il libro perche in certi film tolgono parti importanti|`|CGyQNME2aa	Il film|`|DmWWcjdZaa	Preferisco senza riserve il libro, perché lascia più via libera all'immaginazione personale.<br>  Puoi figurarti personaggi e luoghi senza essere costretto ad accettare la personificazione cinematografica decisa da produttori, scenografi e registi.<br>  Secondo me la fantasia è molto più eccitante!!|`|OEFFiMwuaa	i libri!!! assolutamente!! perchè la rowling scrive benissimo, ti fa entrare nella storia !|`|SxDEonDNaa	Preferisco i libri perché ricco di informazioni sui personaggi, sulle magie e sulle pozioni. I film ruotano molto intorno hai personaggi e meno intorno alla magia e certi argomenti non vengono trattati molto. La soluzione e leggere e vedere!|`|hUhm5eyoaa	film
8ygky5g4aa	No she has not gone yet, I bet she will be on last.  At this point it's anyones game, she isn't as graceful as others so I guess we will see.

I would say that's about as obvious as it gets.|`|SPJCw9ESaa	i don't understand this question... but i'll just say 42.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	But does it look better in a photo or in a mirror?|`|n4KoinUpaa	Because it all depends on what 42 exactly. It could be the selective colour 42, the blurry 42, the mirror 42, the repeat 42, once I saw this one with maths involved (I think the answer though, was sum of 42).<br>  It can be the professional looking 42 or the Myspace 42 as well.
x0ut6OULaa	Dan Brown's book is very heavily based on the 1981 book "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" by Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln.  HB/HG was presented as non-fiction and was one of the first major works to claim that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and that the Merovingian kings of France were descended from them.  The book also claimed that a secret society, the Priory of Sion, had protected the descendants of the "Holy Family" throughout the centuries and had hidden the knowledge away from the world until such time as it was appropriate to be revealed.<br>  <br>  Much of their information came from a French man named Pierre Plantard, who claimed to be the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.  Unfortunately for Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln, Pierre Plantard had to testify in court about the Priory, and he admitted under oath that the Priory of Sion was a hoax, a story he had made up and had forged documents to back up his fraudulent claims.<br>  <br>  So...what this boils down to is, Dan Brown wrote a novel.  A work of FICTION.  He based much of his novel on fraudulent information.  <br>  <br>  Despite the disclaimer in the beginning of the book that "all documents are real, everything presented as truth is verified truth," in fact there is no substance behind any of his characters' claims.  There's nothing in the novel that should make anyone doubt their religion, because there's nothing in the novel that is based in verifiable FACT.|`|mLf1Jhxoaa	I'm not very religious either but u have to remember that the book is fiction.It shouldn't change your believes because non of it is true...Yes,i agree it opens your eyes,reading something like this ,but u have to take into consideration that the book it's not true...There are facts that prove the Dan brown's concept it's wrong...we could never know for sure what happened 2008 years ago and so doesn't Dan brown also....so if the religion it's a fake thing,a lie or the path we need to follow only u can decide that coz nothing is for sure...|`|3e9Deb1Baa	its dan brown's point of view so we must not treat it as the ultimatum<br>  it is fiction<br>  good fiction<br>  so we shud treat it like that<br>  nothing shud shake ur faith even if its not much!|`|AA12212523	It's a combo of fiction and urban legend, with a heavy plagiarism of early speculative books on the topic.|`|AA12375660	I loved the book, but I'm not a huge religion person, so I mostly just skipped over the in depth religious parts.
9qD4JfmNaa	It kind of depends on who you're meeting, and also what conditions you're meeting them. I personally haven't met anyone from the cast but I know a lot of people who have. A lot of them are really nice and will pretty much answer any questions you have, just don't ask anything TOO personal, there are boundaries. But don't get too worried or over think it, they're normal people and really nice and welcoming to their fans.|`|isHVxaqWaa	Yeah, it depends who I meet. I have met everyone in the touring cast, but I haven't really asked them any questions. I mostly just compliment them and they are so sweet. I did ask Blake Bashoff if he was planning on doing anymore television work, cause I love him and want to see more of him. They are all incredibly nice, so if you're going to see them, you're going to have a great time!|`|C60Vl27Xaa	I would love to talk to John Gallager Jr. (original Moritz) I would ask him what is was like to win a Tony... and just tell him he is amazingly talented!

It can be a positive experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid. <br>  <br>  If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you. What we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down. <br>  Mary Pickford (1893 - 1979) <br>  <br>  <br>  If in "your view" God sends us messages through our failures, then he's only saying...NOT to be discouraged !! I'll compromise on that one ...-smile-<br>  <br>  Send you all my best wishes for not too many "failures" in the future...Your friend....Annette***|`|OKClYfDQaa	Failures or success -- yes.

I find he talks to me through TV shows sometimes and through mistakes also sometimes.<br>  <br>  To person who wrote a previous comment all I can say is that I used to stand in your shoes what changed was that I realised, I knew and know nothing, I could read every book in the library Im currently in or spend my whole life just reading. Even then knowledge would still escape me, and that knowledge that escapes you what is it? that one bird can swim? that you cannot see electricity but it exists, or that everyone of human kinds monumental failures has been not due to the ineptness to discover something but rather the ignorance to accept it. World War 1 this will never happen again... what happened next? Complacency and pride assure me that there is someone out there, because for us to be so high and mighty and still exist, for one of our failure to not have eradicated us, is a mystery (or series of great coincidences). <br>  Furthermore sorry for the rant. When a series of coincedences happens at a building site or a meeting or on a tv set it is know as planning. In the same way God is a planner just cause you can't understand why and what he is building doesn't mean he aint building it. Its just a shame its so easy to disregard this truth, if I was God it would be like gravity, but I ain't ahh well.......I pray u understand some day...........................|`|6kyxT7mGaa	yes god sends messeges through our failures.

Does it mean that one can not be shy of oneself? The answer is no, because our ego can be hurt even on the basis of our own self assessment when it shows that we are or can be worse than what our ego has assumed us to be........ in fact, it is this situation that hurts us the most since we can't even have any excuse of either faulty or biased judgment by someone else conveniently presumed to have arisen from either ignorance or prejudice.|`|9TsiMhp6aa	ego is self respect ,a standard which one determines for one,s self. Shyness is not opening or exposing one self every where.In a sense shyness has some relevance with ego as shyness  may be based on self esteem ,not to belittle one self in front of others.So this also sounds egoistic.|`|7bLrZOAvaa	No, i don't think that shyness is another form of ego.

Your question falls in my IInd category, as I agree with general definition of ego in my Ist category only.  I would best define this second category as your internal spirit in the purest form. Whenever anyone donot allow social, external, physical or whatsoever materialistic means to justify his or her proud and yet he or she donot want the situation or person he or she facing,  to go unanswered or unresponded from him or her,  the very result is SHYNESS. Hence, by virtue of its cause of occurrence, the shyness shown by face or any part of a human, whether internally or externally, whether influenced by the feelings or body or soul, whether anything from within his or her mind or heart...., is nothing but one's ego in its eternal spirit.|`|5b1c35be2738e515ba378aa9a50a6975aa	cloud u plzz tell me who says so...<br>  ego n shuness r jst oppspsite to each other<br>  shyness s another hin n ego s another<br>  either u wana say smthin else or u don kno the real meanin of shyness tht u r comparini it wid ego<br>  noway<br>  plzz 1stly clear ur concept abt shyness n ego thn ask such ques.|`|GHHiHlX2aa	shyness is another form of ego because a paerson who is egoistic , he becomes so shy that he can't express that he is egoistic .|`|kqCvVx1Saa	maybe shy people could give off the impression that they are too intimidated to put themselves forward, or maybe they don't want to bother with it because other things are more important to them?

On the other hand, some historic societies might be housed in specially-built buildings, in which case they could be new (when constructed). This is the case of the Chicago Historical Society. <br>  <br>  How "old" is relative; presumably the building George Washington lived in as a boy is older than the building Barack Obama lived in as a boy, yet both are "historic". <br>  <br>  In 1983 I visited the Dixon (llinois) historic society building--Ronald Reagan's boyhood home. I don't know when it was built, but he lived there from 1920 to about 1926, and I doubt the building is now over 100 years old.

k8AcVixTaa	Minolta's work just as well as any other 35mm SLR.  I have a couple I use from time to time.  Make sure you are using a fine grain film!<br>  <br>  Personally I would want to take that kind of photo with a medium format camera using 120 film.  The enlargements would be fantastic.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	in your hands, a drugstore tossaway can whistle dixie. <br>  so i will say a 35mm slr minolta would be just fine.<br>  it isn't so much the camera, as it is the operator of said camera that makes a good image.|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Sure.  In fact, Minoltas are very good cameras.  I have a couple of Minolta SLR cameras, and they take awesome pictures.  If you have good lighting and get the right exposure, you can take an excellent picture.  The best time of day for landscape photos is either early in the morning, or later in the afternoon.  When the sun is lower in the sky, the light will have a much warmer tone and you will get better colors.  Try to avoid taking pictures right in the middle of the day.  (Avoid taking pictures around 12:00-2:00 because if the sun is directly overhead, the light is too harsh and colors will look washed out).<br>  <br>  Use a low ISO film with good color saturation.  I would recommend Fuji 200.  Kodak Gold 200 is also not a bad film, and it is forgiving with exposure.  Kodak has a new film, called Ektar 100, and it's great for landscape photos.  It's super sharp, with no grain, and it gives beautiful saturated colors.  You'll probably have to order it online, or you should also be able to get it in a camera shop or photography supply shop.  (a REAL photography supply shop, not some place that just sells digital cameras).<br>  <br>  <br>  The most important thing is lighting and getting the right exposure.  If you don't know how to use manual exposure, then you'll need to learn that first because SLR cameras use manual exposure (you set the shutter speed and aperture yourself).  Actually, manual exposure is better anyway because you'll have a lot more control and creativity with your pictures.  Look up what's called the "Sunny 16 Rule."  It's a guidline for how to take pictures outside with manual exposure.    <br>  <br>  Despite what some people might try to tell you, film can take excellent pictures...in fact, if it's properly exposed, 35mm film will take better pictures than any digital point and shoot camera.  And you have a very good 35mm camera.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun :)|`|AsL8KhgLaa	Any camera with high megapixel and a wide angle lens will help you get a picture like that. The photo looks like it has had some post-processing, which doesn't depend on which camera you get.<br>  If you don't want to get a wide angle lens, you could always just take a panorama instead to get that elongated effect.|`|uiKAI8bWaa	Minoltas are great, I wanted a Minolta when I was saving for my first camera, they always had such neat features, I had to settle for a Konica.<br>  I am new to digital, I still can't get used to clicking like mad as there are more than 12 or 32 exposes I can make & they don't me anything.<br>  I used to use 25ASA film for fine grain prints, long exposures.|`|b24a63ab0fefcb0091951039cb962b43aa	It wasn't belongs to a camera,you must have  many years of experiences in photography techniques,passed photography degrees,selling cameras for many years too.|`|CyUxMcWSaa	Like some of the others said, it's not the camera, it's the operator of the camera.<br>  <br>  Minolta is a fine camera, the first 35mm camera I ever shot was the Minolta my father bought while in Vietnam in the late '60s.  I still have the XG7 that my grandfather gave me, and still use it.<br>  <br>  For those vivid of colors and resolution I would recommend buying some Fujifilm Velvia 100 or Fujifilm Provia 400.  I found with those films, the meter of the Minoltas does just fine, you shouldn't have to do anything like adjusting the ASA manually to compensate.  <br>  <br>  Hope to see some of your shots with the Minolta.<br>  <br>  Jerry|`|auOBJNEGaa	The camera doesn't make the photo or the photographer.

pZGLhV2Waa	See my answer to your next question. Better flashes allow you to manually adjust the output of the flash. The SB-400 does not allow you to do this. The camera will set the flashes output. You can use your camera on whatever mode you like.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ace is correct. I am not all that familiar with Nikon accessories. I was not aware that you can manually adjust the flash output with the D40. I apologize for the misinformation.|`|xcw4EBalaa	That isn't true.<br>  <br>  Actually, it's just the opposite.  The SB 400 has no manual exposure mode so can only be used in iTTL with the D40 or 40X.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Where did you hear this.  Actually the D40 is the only camera that can use the SB400 in both the manual and i-TTL mode.<br>  <br>  "The SB-400 has no manual exposure mode, unless controlled from the D40. The SB-400 cannot be controlled manually from any other camera as of December 2006."  -- Ken Rockwell<br>  <br>  "This Speedlight, which features the Nikon Creative Lighting System (CLS), provides i-TTL flash operations in combination with CLS-compatible cameras. Manual mode is also available with the D40 camera".  NikonUSA<br>  <br>  This quote is in the SB400 manual under "Compatible Cameras"
pZGLhV2Waa	It will go off regardless of what mode your camera is in. What it means is you can't manually adjust the output of the flash. For instance with higher end flashes you can turn down the intensity of the flash.

The process is circular and self defined and therefore not necessary for reality.<br>  <br>  Without taking that last step, the illusion is interrupted at the level of consciousness without resolution.  Hence the dualistic separations - of mind and body; death and afterlife.  The problem is that we could not observe the conversion between something and nothing.  The process is counter intuitive and it has the same nature as any illusion we set out to doubt.<br>  <br>  To say "I think therefore I exist" is to assume there is the illusion of "I" to begin with, so the obvious conclusion is that the "I" entity exists and "thinking" or consciousness is just an illusive property of an impermanent world / reality.  When reality is chaotic, our notion of "self" is just as temporary, hence the uncertainty of everything seems self evident.|`|FSkge0d1aa	Many years ago there was a painter who painted a simple picture of a steel pipe.

One interpretation of this piece was that he meant it to challenge mankind's perspective. WHO, I ask, is to say that the pipe which we know is actually a pipe, or the pipe in the painting is not a pipe but just a painting.

Per prima cosa i bambini provano piacere fisico che, anche da studi neurologici fatti (in molti aspetti è simile al piacere sessuale). Mi spiego... Prendiamo un bambino di 1 anno (fase orale) si è visto che nel succhiare il latte materno il suo cervello libera un elevato quantitativo di DOPAMINA (sostanza chimica che oltre a generare il senso di piacere viene liberata durante l'orgasmo, l'assunzione di droga, antidepressivi e, in minima parte, quando si mangia cioccolato). <br>  Inoltre, cosa comunissima nei bambini dai 4 ai 6 anni, c'è la scoperta del proprio corpo e non è assolutamente raro trovare bambini di questa età (chiedetelo a qualsiasi genitore o sessuologo se non mi credete)  magari toccarsi e giocare con i genitali (pratica che ritorna nella pubertà con la pratica onanista (masturbatoria). Un altro aspetto inerente a questo elemento è dato sia dalla famosa domanda dei bambini "I bambini da dove nascono?" sia dal fatto che i bambini (sopratutto all'età di tre anni e sopratutto con gli animali (non per un motivo particolare ma  non avendo inventato ancora le mutande o i pantaloni per i cani o i gatti i loro genitali sono visibili a tutti) chiedono spesso, ad esempio "perchè cagnolino non ha il pisellino?" (anche questo ha a che fare con la sessualità).<br>  <br>  Poi... Freud non ha detto che il sogno e sintomo di un desiderio sessuale represso ha semplicemente detto che è la realizzazione di un desiderio, irrealizzabile nella realtà (quando sogno che un'auto investa un mio nemico non è che in realtà il sogno mi dice che vorrei trombare il mio nemico... Vuole dire che io vorrei ucciderlo, ma visto che non posso farlo materialmente soddisfo questo mio desiderio, tutelandomi anche dalla frustrazione, sognando di farlo nel sogno) poi ovviamente ci sono anche connotazioni sessuali e questo è giustificato dal fatto che (dato sperimantale) durante la notte, in concomitanza con le fasi REM il cervello libera un grande quantitativo di ormoni tra cui quelli responsavili sia della lubrificazione della parete vaginale sia quelli inerenti alla famosa erezione notturna (Freud, prima di ste dati aveva defiito il sonno ed il sogno come il momento in cui la libido si ricaricava grazie ad un contributo nervoso... Che hanno dimostrato quasi 40 anni dopo la sua morte essere vero).<br>  <br>  Infine... Sulla natura dell'inconscio non mi dilungherò tanto, perchè è una cosa facilmente dimostrabile anche con due esempi:<br>  1) Hanno dimostrato (degli psicologi americani) che una sensazione prima di divenire cosciente viene prima elaborata per 10 millesimi di secondo (la percezione in tal caso non è conscia)<br>  2) I colpi "di fulmine,l'innamoramento, l'odio e l'antipatia (talvolta le si provano ma a volte non si è in grado di spiegare il perchè)|`|sFqcoKA4aa	leggendo le sue opere (oltre che studiando il suo pensiero sui libri di scuola a volte troppo generici e sbrigativi) ho compreso che Freud era davvero un genio spesse volte incompreso... ha una sua particolare teoria del sesso, ma essa è sicuramente valida perchè riscontrabile (e basata) sui bambini. poi la psicoanalisi oggi aiuta l'uomo a conoscersi meglio. consiglio la lettura di "Totem e tabù" e "La psicoanalisi". L'interpretazione dei sogni spesso rimane un complicato "mattone", ma a me è piaciuta ach'essa, forse perchè mi affascina la psicologia in genere...|`|PQA5Zawgaa	Tutte le diverse fasi della crescita di un bambino passano anche attraverso gli istinti sessuali. La fase orale (quando il bambino porta alla bocca gli oggetti) e la fase anale (quando il bambino comincia a controllare i propri stimoli) sono alla base degli studi di yung, discepolo di freud. Non devi stupirti ma è la verità. Leggi "I casi clinici" di sigmund freud se vuoi saperne di più. Non è proprio tutto incentrato sul desiderio sessuale. Sigmund Freud è il vero padre della psicanalisi.|`|bjX7HObLaa	Freud cercò di trovare un' altra strada per analizzare la mente, ma una cosa va capita; non fu nè un filosofo nè uno scienziato. Era un pò fissato con il sesso, in effetti lo metteva dapertutto. Io non concordo affatto con lui,ma capisco quallo che ha tentato di fare, anche se secondo me in modo sbagliato. I bambini non possiamo sapere se hanno davvero una cognizione del sesso, poichè non hanno ancora sviluppato un senso critico e dunque non posssono essere in grado di giudicare il sesso e connessi, anche se probabilmente avranno un impulso naturale di curiosità e conoscenza nei confronti dell' altro sesso, ma questo non vuol dire che sia un impulso erotico, no? Io la penso così. Ciao. Domanda interessante, comunque.

Think of all the political cartoons and caricatures you've seen. So I don't think this one is really an issue.)<br>  2.

XQEBIkkhaa	Four years experience would make it easier on the piccolo for some reasons.<br>  <br>  Piccolo is both easy and challenging to flute players, no matter how much experience. Flutists should have no problem getting fingerings down, getting octaves. It is the pitch and range that is a problem for many. Piccolo takes a smaller air-hole and more air to reach the really high octaves on a flute. Some flutists play piccolo for years and can never reach them. Also, pitch is crazily uncontrollable on a piccolo. You can make the best sound, produce the best notes on a solo but recieve a lower rating because of your bad pitch.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would borrow someone piccolo or try one from a store for a few weeks. See how initially comfortable you are with the instrument. If you think its a challenge you want to go for, then buy one. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Be careful, though. Generally, the more time a flautist spends on her piccolo, the worse her flute sound gets! Practice both evenly, and always start with the flute first for embouchure reasons.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is basically the same fingerings; you can play the piccolo well with flute fingerings. However, if you become a more advanced piccolo player, there are fingerings specific to the piccolo that will help you get your sound better.|`|8QejfAo8aa	Piccolo is a bit more difficult just because it needs a lot more air and control.

AA11442722	A setup will take care of the buzzing normally. Check your tuning though, if your doing a drop tuning or flat and not set up for that you'll get some string buzzing. <br>  <br>  As for stretching, takes time. More than a few days for most people. Just stay at it. A good stretching exercise would be the spock sign, stretch it out till it hurts then inverse it and go back and forth. Helps stretch the fingers out, limber them up a bit. On the guitar work on getting first a 3 fret stretch with your index/ring finger then get 4 frets. It'll make the 3 fret stretch seem easy and later on down the road you'll use it at times. With the pink try 5 frets. Same principle. If you work on 5 frets then 4 frets will seem pretty easy pretty quick. <br>  <br>  Don't flatten your fingers. Bend at the first joint. Sounds like your flattening your fingers when you chord. That'll cause you to muffle strings, and slows you down. It will also make some techniques nearly impossible down the road. So bend those fingers, change your arm angle, bend your wrist,  don't lock your thumb to one spot on the neck, let your thumb move up and down to facilitate where your fingers are. Common beginner's mistake is they glue that thumb in place and try play every chord with the same elbow and wrist angle.|`|96zZlJVYaa	I am having the same problem (you're not along) try to go at it a slower pace.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Buzzing sound: You are not pressing down on the fingerboard adequately enough to stop all the other strings from vibrating.<br>  <br>  You fingers will eventually stretch to accommodate the bar cords or notes that you are attempting to do.

Keep at it.|`|RplkclzJaa	You probably aren't pressing hard enough on the strings and thats why you are getting the buzzing. If you are playing chords Put your hand in the right position and play each string individually. If any note is muted or muffled then adjust your hand until it comes out clear. Keep doing that  and eventually you will build up enough hand strength and be used to the position so that it will almost be second nature.

Virgil, Raphael, Nicolas Poussin, Haydn.<br>  <br>  Contrasting with the Baroque and the Rococo, Neo-classical paintings are devoid of pastel colors and haziness; instead, they have sharp colors with Chiaroscuro.

TSAl7ZX1aa	During the second World War the Atlantic became the supply route to Britain from the Commonwealth, USA and a number of other nations, since Britain was the only nation in Europe still in open opposition to Nazi Germany and was fighting for her life. Reinforcements, materiel and food were in short supply and in continuous demand, and, later, the needs of the USSR – hence the length of the battle.<br>  <br>  Changes<br>  German surface units, large powerful battleships, were largely shackled in harbour following the sinking of the Bismarck, leaving the brunt of the battle in the hands of Luftwaffe spotters in FW Kondors and the U-boat wolfpacks. Tactics developed to counter the threat, including the convoy system. As the convoy system developed the threat became reduced and the U-boat fleet became the arm of the Germany military that received the highest number of casualties per capita.<br>  <br>  US navy and merchant marine units were brought into open armed conflict with German naval units, before the declaration of war and the Pearl Harbour attack.<br>  <br>  Had it failed and had Britain fallen through a long term siege, there could have been no invasion launched from Britain, in fact there might never have been an attempt to launch a military assault.<br>  <br>  The significance of the battle is that, had it failed, it would have totally altered the course of the war in Europe and North Africa, although ultimately an Allied victory it was never a foregone conclusion and was a victory of technology and tactics as much of manpower.|`|AA11304025	It was the longest continuous battle of the war from 1939 to the last week of the war in Europe in 1945.<br>  So it didn't change the war in anyway but was an important part of it..<br>  The main weapon of the germans was the U-boat which in the first 3 years sank million of tons of shipping.<br>  Things improved a bit after 1941 when Germany declared war on the USA and the USA stopped all trade with Germany and took an active part in fighting the U-boats but the real breakthrough in 1943 came when British intelligence cracked the German naval codes which led to the U-boat positions to be pinpointed and avoided or for them to be destroyed.<br>  With the entry of the USA into the war air bases could be set up in Iceland and Greenland which made it easier to give air cover to convoys anywhere in the North Atlantic. This forced U-boats to stay submerged in daytime.

It is however best interpreted as an argument for the Enlightenment and what it stands for.

VOZWgWgLaa	At one time all of what is now Finland was part of the Russian Empire, largely the result of Russian victories in wars with Charles XII of Sweden. Russia held onto these territories until the First World War.<br>  <br>  The occupation of Finland was probably not very popular during the reign of the Tsars, but never had the ability to fight off the government. During WWI, the Russians sided with the allies and were trounced so heavily by the Germans that the victories they won against the Austrians was unimportant. By 1917, the Tsar was deposed and the Russian Revolution began. As a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1917), the Versailles Treaty (1919), and the consequences of the Russian Civil War, Finland won its independence.<br>  <br>  Finland's borders extended down the peninsula between Lake Ladoga and the Baltic Sea as well as part of the land between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega as well as a narrow strip of land running up to Petsamo on the Arctic Coast. In 1939, Stalin invaded Finland and they were forced back to their present borders. This was done probably to gain the nickel mines near Petsamo, and was only possible after Stalin committed nearly all the Soviet armies to the battle.|`|P8dIznazaa	Yes, Finland was joined to the Russian Empire in 1809, and it became independent after the Russian Revolution.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Finland was historically a part of Sweden and from 1809 an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire. Finland's declaration of independence from Russia in 1917 was followed by a civil war, wars against the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and a period of official neutrality during the Cold War.<br>  <br>  In the 18th century, wars between Sweden and Russia led to the occupation of Finland twice by Russian forces, known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath (1714–1721) and the Lesser Wrath (1742–1743). By this time Finland was the predominant term for the whole area from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Russian border.<br>  <br>  On March 29, 1809, after being taken over by the armies of Alexander I of Russia in the Finnish War, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire until the end of 1917.<br>  <br>  In 1918, months after the Russian October Revolution, the revolutionary wing of the Social Democratic Party staged a coup. They succeeded in controlling southern Finland and Helsinki, but the right wing government continued in exile from Vaasa. The stage was set for a brief but bitter civil war.<br>  <br>  During World War II, Finland fought the Soviet Union twice: in the Winter War of 1939–40 after the Soviet Union had attacked Finland and in the Continuation War of 1941–44, following Operation Barbarossa, in which Germany invaded the Soviet Union. For 872 days during World War II, German and Finnish armies besieged Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second largest city. Following German losses on the Eastern Front and the subsequent Soviet advance, Finland was forced to make peace with the Soviet Union. This was followed by the Lapland War of 1944–45, when Finland forced the Germans out of northern Finland.<br>  <br>  The treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included Finnish obligations, restraints, and reparations as well as further Finnish territorial concessions (cf. the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940). Finland ceded most of Finnish Karelia, Salla, and Pechenga, which amounted to ten percent of its land area and twenty percent of its industrial capacity.|`|DmYfr5veaa	Yes. And for a long time there was this question of whether or not to grant the Finns autonomy. Eventually, they achieved independence.

I don't believe Germany would ever have beaten Russia.<br>  <br>  But I do believe that the entry of America into the war shortened it considerably, and i am glad that they did come in.<br>  <br>  I think your second point is quite correct, we would never have learnt to speak German, the Germans would all have been speaking English by now.|`|2016b2eff949f27f73d7f010484e92fcaa	When Americans say...<br>  "You would be speaking German if it wasn't for us"<br>  <br>  I reply with...<br>  "What language would you be speaking if it wasn't for us.

They lost the air battle known as the Battle of Brittain. <br>  They new we were isolated on our little island so diverted their attention to the eastern (Russian) front. The Germans invaded Russia in 1941 just as the French had done in 1811/12 but on a considerably wider front. Despite initial success the German Army underestimated the resourcefulness and endurance of the Russian people.<br>  After the Germany Army lost the Battle of Stalingrad the Russian Army launched an offensive which steamrollered the Germans back.<br>  They were doing this on their own before the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944.<br>  I think the part played by the Russian Army was the main reason why the Allies succeeded in the west they simply knocked the stuffing out of the German Army.

We were winning when America joined us in the fight, though only because Germany made a few mistakes to our advantage.  The fact is we would have won the war but without the Americans help it would have dragged on longer and with more casualties.  <br>  <br>  I appreciate and respect anyone who fights for my country and there were some who came over and fought even though they were not required to, but before bragging about their part in WW2,  Americans should consider the fact that It would have saved many more thousands of lives if they had joined a lot sooner.<br>  <br>  Because English is fast becoming the world language,  Britain doesn't consider learning languages as a priority (Big mistake) but that doesn't mean that we are incapable of learning, don't judge everyone by your own standards!! :oD|`|AA11442722	The US lost tens of thousands of merchant marines bringing in raw materials, supplies, ammo, food and other essentials. Without that help England would have lost the Battle of Britain. Having lost that England would have been invaded. Without US support, with it's industry reduced to rubble  the UK would have fallen to Germany, though there is a real chance that the US would have eventually been forced into war with the Nazis by the 50s or 60s and might have liberated England by the 70s but that's far from certain. Without England as a base and English resources such as intelligence and connections to various resistance movements as well as English technological contributions it'd been much more difficult to beat the Nazis. <br>  <br>  What is really sad is so many Americans gave their lives delivering those supplies to England they are totally forgotten now. <br>  <br>  When it came to invading Europe US help was essential. In the end it was industry that beat Germany and the US had the greatest industry in the world at the time. The US was the primary combatant against Japan who may well have sent Naval, air and land forces to aid in the invasion of England. <br>  <br>  Without US supplies it is doubtful Russia could have stood, if it had, no way it took the offensive. Russian industry was nothing but rubble. As it was the Russians took many more casualties and resorted to using anybody who could hold a rifle just to keep a fighting force going at points in time. <br>  <br>  Your second issue is meaningless. If the choice is speak German or die, I think folks in just about any nation would learn rather quickly. The English linguistic skills issue is pretty much the same problem we Americans have learning other languages. The simple fact is we don't have too. The incentive is not there. Was not the case when French was the language of diplomacy, most educated English could also speak French and Latin in those days. <br>  <br>  As for paying back every penny, no you only paid the lend lease portion. You did not pay a penny in the mounds of money spent by the American military. Not for the aircraft lost, not for the ships, ammo, etc. Nor did you repay half the supplies sent over. The 2nd world war cost America huge sums of money. It was necessary, the UK is our ally and has been for many years. So even if Nazi Germany was not a threat we shamefully took far too long to enter the war. In reality the Nazis were a threat to all the world and that doubles our shame in taking so long in entering the war.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Your rant is incoherent, lacks accuracy and syntax (and so are some of the responses apparently from Britain – yes, language skills indeed).<br>  <br>  Those Americans who I have heard or read making this claim*, I reject as fools, but I also question your ability to repudiate them.<br>  <br>  *And they are fewer than you seem to imply, although you will attract some with your inflammatory question.<br>  <br>  EDIT: a quick study of the history of British intellingance (sic) units would reveal that "we" did not have MI1 – MI19 and although we were fighting hard we were not "doing okay on our own" Britain was crippled by the financial and physical effort put into the Second World War, without the supplies and reinforcements from Commonwealth countries and some other nations, including the major efforts of USA, Britain would have succumbed to German efforts, not through invasion, but due to siege – the conduct and eventual success of the Battle of the Atlantic was crucial to Britain's survival, although U-boat packs could not operate in the Channel they could stifle the flow of goods in the (British!) Atlantic.<br>  <br>  And, going back to the "fools", Dunkirk was a (fortunate) achievement, the first minor Pyrrhic victory; in that it attached to the crushing German victory in the Battle of France, a minor British (and technically France deserves more plaudits) victory – crucially returning the core of a professional well-trained army to Britain (British and French), unarmed and battered it is true. Hindsight and ignorance gives you the opportunity to deride the conduct of the First World War with only the vaguest notions of what actually occurred; and, apparently absolutely no idea of the vast gaps in your knowledge.<br>  <br>  The Soviet Union out-performed all other nations (including those that weren't invaded) in producing military materiel for their land forces, at least check out their wartime production figures before making extravagant claims about their capabilities.<br>  <br>  btw: for the hard-of-thinking I am British.|`|WLizHwtkaa	There are two ways that America aided Britain in WWII. Firstly, via lend-lease, they supplied us with the hardware with which to fight and they provided all of the petrol we needed to fuel our war machines. Secondly, and later on, they provided troops to help us go back to the Continent and confront Hitler's Germany.<br>  <br>  Had America not supplied us with material via lend-lease, and petrol, we would certainly have lost had we had to stand alone. I don't think there's much doubt of that. That's why the Battle of the Atlantic was so critical.<br>  <br>  However, what really lost Hitler the war was his invasion of Russia. Provided we still had American material and petrol we could probably have held Hitler off indefinitely after the Russian debacle. Though we'd never have been strong enough alone to invade the Continent and defeat him.<br>  <br>  So we probably wouldn't be speaking German, but we'd be living in a VERY different world for sure.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Very few Americans have any real understanding of the English and of Britain and just how determined we are as a nation.  I won't say we're united, because that has never been the case, except just once, when Winston Churchill went on the radio at the BBC to tell the nation of the fall of France and of the coming Battle of Britain.<br>  <br>  Winston did not need to say anything more, because as a nation we came together, united, for the only time ever in our history.  We rolled up our sleaves and got on with it.<br>  <br>  I was born in 1941 and have only vague memories of the war, but I do know this, our people won their Victory and would have won it without the Americans.<br>  <br>  The British had masses of oil reserves, endless energy from coal, vast amounts of iron ore and all the rest.<br>  <br>  We also had a massive Royal Navy and within three days of any attempt to invade the Island of Britain, the RN would have been in the English Channel from Scarpa Flow with six massive capital ships and their escorts of destroyers and high speed frigates.  No one, not even the Germans could take on the RN - they would have been blasted out of the water.<br>  <br>  The Luftwaffe for all of it's strength, three times larger than the RAF, could not get on top of the Royal Air Force and thus could not command the skies over the British Isles.<br>  <br>  The Germans then were no match for the British, neither in the air nor on the sea.  One by one their pocketbattle ships were sunk by the Royal Navy.  Over 75% of their U-Boat crews were killed or drowned at sea in the vast expanse of the British Atlantic.<br>  <br>  The rest is history and when it was all over we went back to our arguments and fights amongst ourselves.<br>  <br>  This happy breed. . . .

But I also believe that humans are all unique, and they might go against the tread of their family. It's possible to change your way in life; everyone has the capability, and I don't think that just because you were born into a working class family, for example, that you are going to live the same life.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	To a certain extent, yes, My mother's mother's father, who was a Civil War veteran who went to college and graduated on the first GI bill. was in the the Cherokee land run in OK in 1893. I can still take you right to my great-grandparent's house in Pond Creek, OK, which was founded as a disciples of Christ community, just like Sharon, Kansas was. The house and farm was sold after one of my great-aunts died in 1961. She took us out to the farm once,  maybe twice. I definitely remember the trip out to the farm when I was 6 years old, and I think there was another trip when I was maybe 2 years old that my grand-mother shared driving with my dad. Since my grand-mother broke her hip when I was 3 years old. I know my grandma didn't make another car trip home after that. <br>  <br>  My grandmother's youngest sister died on December 18, 1908. My mother was named for her in June, 1919. I've wondered at times if I am her re-incarnation, but I doubt that. How can some one who died more than 45 years before I was born tell me not to turn left minutes before my car was totaled in a left turn lane on Friday, September 4, 1998? Aunt Mary was only one of a chorus of dead relatives telling me not to make that left turn.<br>  <br>  I feel more at home living in OK than I do when I'm home in New Orleans. I may be a native New Orleanian by birth place, but I warn't raised South'n.  That would have been difficult with one parent who grew up in the OK panhandle and the other who was born at home in Brooklyn, New York City. I love New Orleans, but I'm a cube trying to fit into a spherical hole culturally, and that was BEFORE Katrina. Some of my corners have eroded since Katrina  living most the year for 28 years in Norman, OK. I usually can tell pretty quickly if the craw-fish in craw-fish etouffee was frozen or fresh pretty quickly. Yes, even New Orleans Seafood and Hamburger Co. uses frozen craw-fish, and so does the St. Charles Tavern (false outrage, how could they? lol!!!). <br>  <br>  I actually forgot to breathe a mental sigh of relief until the next morning when I got into Texas on my way back up from New Orleans in January.

For example, families that are emotionally stable over several generations often produce descendants that have good marriages and a healthy family life themselves, perhaps because they have good models to follow.|`|7Oxa6afFaa	I don't believe that's true.

AA10981338	So you want to be either Amneris or Aida?  The Phantom of the Opera probably wouldn't be a good fit for those roles. for Aida sing a song like "I Know Where I'm Going" from Hairspray and for Amneris "Popular" from Wicked (even though it gets overused). Aida is a very solemn and sensible character. Amneris is more comical and ditzy.

9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	You mean "How was paper invented?"<br>   Probably from soaking various reeds and stems to see if they could be pulled apart to make rope or to make them easier to weave for baskets.  Some materials turn to pulp, others become rope strands, but some get sticky and papyrus when its outer skin is peeled off, the inner parts when laid out cris-cross with each other, will stick and form a thick paper like substance.   Later it was found that boiling/cooking the pulps and spreading them thin on screens or fabrics produced a thin layer of material that could be written on.|`|RdCfpWeBaa	AD 105 is often cited as the year in which papermaking was invented. In that year, historical records show that the invention of paper was reported to the Chinese Emperor by Ts'ai Lun, an official of the Imperial Court. Recent archaeological investigations, however, place the actual invention of papermaking some 200 years earlier. Ancient paper pieces from the Xuanquanzhi ruins of Dunhuang in China's northwest Gansu province apparently were made during the period of Emperor Wu who reigned between 140 BC and 86 BC. Whether or not Ts'ai Lun was the actual inventor of paper, he deserves the place of honor he has been given in Chinese history for his role in developing a material that revolutionized his country.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	paper was invented originally by wasps for their nests it is called paper because the ancient egyptians made paper from the papyrus plant, the ancient chinese used bamboo and wood fiber and processed it similarly to the way they observed the wasps processing it.

R3UVYaHtaa	35 mm film (200 - 400 ASO)|`|AA10722993	The XS takes a SD memory card.  You can buy them at most stores that sell digital cameras.   Get a 1 or 2GB card.   This is not a film camera!   Read the instruction manual!|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Check the camera again...and check to be sure whether it's a Rebel X, or a Rebel XS.  That sounds like a small difference, but they're completely different cameras.  One uses film, and the other is a digital camera.<br>  <br>  If it's a Rebel X....then YES it is a 35mm SLR film camera.  (And don't anyone argue with me about this, or click thumbs down because I'm looking at a manual for the Canon Rebel X from 1994 at this exact moment.  The Rebel X uses 35mm film.  And coincidentally, it also came with a 35-80mm zoom lens).<br>  <br>  If it's a Rebel XS, then it's a digital SLR camera, and does NOT use film.  I'm assuming that you're looking at the camera in an advertisement, because surely anyone can tell the difference between a film camera and a digital camera.  <br>  <br>  If it's a Rebel X, then the camera will use 35mm film, which you can get anywhere.  You can find 35mm film at Walmart, Target, drug stores, grocery stores, and even some gas stations.  You can also order it online, or buy it at a photography supply shop.  Read the instruction manual for the camera.  One of the biggest advantages of an SLR camera (either film or digital) is that you can use manual exposure control.  You can put the camera into manual mode, and select the shutter speed and aperture yourself manually.  That will give you a lot more control and creativity with your pictures.  Learn how to use manual exposure.  Look up what's called the "Sunny 16 Rule."  It's a guide for how to take pictures outside with manual exposue.<br>  <br>  But check to be sure what kind of camera you have.  Is it a Rebel X...or a Rebel XS?  <br>  <br>  And of course, a film camera will be obvious, with the door on the back for the film compartment!|`|CyUxMcWSaa	Best answer would be, it depends on the situation you're shooting.  I don't know much about Canon so I'll asume that it is a film SLR.  If you're just starting out, pick up some rolls of ISO 400 film from Walgreens, Walmart, etc and shoot, shoot, shoot.  Once you learn more about your camera, what you like to shoot, etc, you can pick up faster or slower films to suit your needs.  If you get confident enough, pick up some transparencies, or 'slide' film from a camera store.  Just remember slide film is not as forgiving as negative film you pick up from a regular store.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy shooting..|`|pZGLhV2Waa	It does not use film. The Canon Rebel XS is a digital SLR and uses a memory card. All of the film Canon Rebels use 35mm film. These would be the Rebel 2000, Rebel G, Rebel Ti, Rebel K2 and probably a couple that I can't think of.
8AYA5gTBaa	The film is called 120, not 120mm. It's just the name designatiom Kodak gave this particular sized film when they came out with it.<br>  <br>  My recommendation for film beginners is to get a Holga 120N. Why? This is an inexpensive camera that will give you a chance to see if film photography is for you.  <br>  <br>  Sample Photos:<br>  Holga<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/86881528@N0..." rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/86881528@N0...</a><br>  <br>  120 film is a little more difficult to deal with, since there are fewer labs that can process it. Ask around at your local Walmart, Costco or other 1-hour labs. While they may not be able to process the film on site, many of these labs will send the film out to be processed for you.<br>  <br>  The next option is to find a local pro-lab. These are labs that specifically cater to professional photographers and will be able to process your film on site. As you might imagine, it can be a little pricey.<br>  <br>  Then the best of all option, process the film yourself. BW film processing and even color processing are not too difficult to learn and also not very expensive to get into.<br>  <br>  If you think that 120 film is too much trouble, you can try a 35mm camera, like the Holga 135BC. While I find that something gets lost in the smaller negative and rectangular format, it might work for you. <br>  <br>  Check out these photos:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/holga135bc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/groups/holga135bc/</a><br>  <br>  The Holga 120N or 120CFN (120 format) or the 35mm Holga 135BC can be found at Freestyle Photo supply:<br>  <a href="http://freestylephoto.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://freestylephoto.biz/</a><br>  <br>  Getting it online from Freestyle is cheaper than buying the kit from Urban Outfitters.<br>  <br>  Whichever camera you choose, remember that the point of lo-fi photography is to have fun and don't sweat the details!<br>  <br>  For Holga tips, check out these websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.squarefrog.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squarefrog.co.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://goholga.com/" rel="nofollow">http://goholga.com/</a><br>  <br>  Please also visit my website:<br>  <a href="http://www.dianacamera.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dianacamera.com/</a><br>  <br>  I have lots of tips, tricks and photos taken with plastic cameras.<br>  <br>  For how-to videos for Holgas and Diana cameras, check out my youtube channel:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kaituba" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/kaituba</a>|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	120 Format is much more difficult to procure and develop but is totally worth the effort in lomography.
n843aGrEaa	I assume that because you're posting this question under Philosophy and not Astronomy or Physics or something, that you're looking for a more metaphysical response. Admittedly, I know very little about the scientific aspect of this topic.<br>  <br>  What I can suggest is this: All that exists in our universe, our reality, once came from something else. Yes? By that logic, all that as ever existed came from something as well. Taking is a step further, all that has ever existed came from something that came from something else. Makes sense, I think. But to what end? That is where your question comes in. In my mind, the Big Bang is the moment when existence became possibly. Before that, there was nothing. As James Gaardner (author of Sophie's World) would have it, "at some point, something must have come from nothing". Big Bang Theory (and others along those lines) makes sense to me only if I assume that there tiny particle that went bang came into existence the moment it banged. As opposed to thinking that there was this glowing speck in the vast nothing for possibly millions of years before it did anything<br>  <br>  "In the beginning, there was nothing - which exploded" - Terry Pratchett|`|AA11635601	My opinion is that we don't know WHY anything happens - all we know is that some things we observe seem to immediately precede certain other things we observe for whatever reason and for however long they may continue to do so.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	wooooooooooooow your making me want to turn to natgeo right now. i love theories on how we all came to be. so puzzling you know? personally i don't believe in the big bang theory though. i believe we were all created since it has a stronger case then the big bang. i just don't think we were all formed by some big accidental bang. because only a creator could make the created. but then you ask yourself who created the creator?!!! its a continuance cycle man. we are not meant to know.|`|oEcVqwpaaa	Although not entirely an answer, this will give you something to think about. In regards to the creation of the universe (or reality, or whatever you'd like to call it), one must ask oneself, "in what did that substance from which the universe originated exist?" That one thing must have existed inside something larger than itself, and in turn, that "something larger than itself" must have also existed in something. You see, I think it must be that every "thing" that "exists" takes residence in something else. It is not logically possible for one thing to exist without being inside something else. For example, water is in a cup, the cup is in a room, the room is in a house, the house is in a city, the city is in a country, the country is part of the world, the world is in the solar system, the solar system is in the galaxy, the galaxy is in the universe, the universe is in the __________.|`|kqCvVx1Saa	i really have no idea but it is so FUN to think about!<br>  one theory (theory meaning "wouldn't it be so awesome if...") I have (being not very logical and more imaginative) is that the universe keeps renewing itself. like... big bang > expansion > IMPLOSION!

It looks more like a doll than human flesh.<br>  <br>  Way over saturated color that does not even exist in real life.<br>  <br>  Obvious background replacement due to poor subject cut out and / or poor light and shadow match between subject and background.<br>  <br>  Teeth that are so white you need sunglasses to look at the photo. <br>  <br>  Eyes way over colored.<br>  <br>  Things such as that.<br>  <br>  As far as looking at a photo directly out of the camera and seeing what it "needs", that is just a matter of understanding things like proper exposure, composition, cropping, and what retouching on a portrait is needed to ENHANCE the person, yet not make them look fake or totally unlike themselves.<br>  <br>  It is all a fine line between proper, subtle editing and going completely over the top. Over the top is ok if that is the goal, but often times it is done unintentionally.<br>  <br>  steve|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Do you mean manipulating a photo?<br>  <br>  In art there is no right or wrong. Manipulate the image as you see fit and advances your vision.<br>  <br>  In client or commercial situations what is right/wrong is generally more clearly defined.|`|AsL8KhgLaa	I have a few things that I do to make my photos pop just that extra bit. Like the person before me stated, know when to stop!<br>  I usually adjust my levels in photoshop, which basically is a fancy way of saying I add contrast. A grey photo is almost never good, you want something that is going to pop when someone looks at it.<br>  There is no harm in adding a little vibrance to your photo with a little saturation, don't go overboard and make it look unnatural. I also suggest checking the colour balance, not always necessary. <br>  From there, you can decide how serious you want to go about editing your photo. It's your decision! In my opinion, the best editing is the most discrete.|`|L9qt8wS8aa	PHOTOSHOP!!<br>  :D

If you just play Nirvana's arrangement off the record and have the lead guitarist play the vocal melody, it will sound really lame.  IMO, of course.|`|pcAxKyGBaa	Who cares what you wear dude...<br>  <br>  But as for the song I say you should play the original, unless there's a lot of people there you could play smells like teen spirit and ask them to sing along.|`|3lsL9YWHaa	I do not know about song, but have an idea for clothes. You should wear bluejeans with bleach stains, and shirts that are all the same, You can paint them and wright Bleach on it. If you do paint them, place a peace of carboard inside the shirt so the paint does not bleed threw. I think a blue button up shirt with the name on the back, Keep the top couple buttons unbutton. And the sleaves roled up to right above the elbows.|`|KBBonf97aa	If I were you, I'd go with the original song, since that will show everyone you're more talented than most bands your age.  Lots of kids are in cover bands, but most aren't adventurous enough to tackle original material.  And since it's going to be an instrumental, the funk rock piece sounds like it would be cool.  Funk rock works better instrumentally than cover tunes.<br>  <br>  As far as worrying about how you'll look, you should just wear stuff you'd normally wear.  Whenever I see a band wearing clothes they wouldn't wear in real life, I think they look silly, since they're basically wearing costumes.  It's much better to wear jeans and T-shirts than something that's clearly being worn as an attempt to appear cool. The secret to appearing cool is to look as though you're not trying.  If you hit the stage wearing clothes you clearly chose because they're supposed to look showy, people will probably think you're pretentious.  But if you wear normal stuff and appear confident, that will come across really well.<br>  <br>  The audience will take its cue from you about how to react, so don't be afraid to show that you're having a good time during the song.  Nothing makes me happier than seeing band members make eye contact and smile during a show, since fun is infectious.  If there's a part of the song with heavy bass and drum interplay, it's always cool to see a bassist put his foot on the rim of the bass drum and stare down the drummer while they riff off each other.  There's no such thing as too much fun on stage.  Good luck with the show!

The .303 round was used by the British army in all of their battlefield rifles and machine guns. The find was photographed but left in situ under the terms of the license. In December 2008, Gregg Bemis discovered a further four million rounds of .303 ammunition and announced plans to commission further dives next year for a full-scale forensic examination of the wreck.

8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Interesting point raised by your question!!<br>  <br>  The right way probably to look at it is to say that the good must prevail in the end...... which means that the evil can prevail at other times, but it is only the good that has the greater stability and sustainability to prevail finally. So, can the good and the evil be balanced perfectly? I believe that this is indeed the case, which means that at any point in time, there are a number of evils prevailing yet to be vanquished by the good at a future time and thus the sum total of all evils at that point in time need not be lesser than the sum total all the good. In other words, there is a dynamic balance between the good and evil in totality such that in each instance the evil first outweighs the good but ultimately the more sustainable good outlasts the evil.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Evil is a myth.

A concept can be removed, but what IS just simply IS.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, the darkness is an illusion.  It is a functional illusion to the Light which is really all there is.  However, God is smart you see - God creates things which are very powerful and so the impression is that the darkness is very much a truth.  <br>  <br>  I separate the Darkness from the Light:<br>  <br>  Light is the Total Truth of what IS.<br>  <br>  Darkness is a concept and an illusion and has no real substance.

7ONKVbbiaa	the biggest probability is that you are right.. it isn't a name associated with Eastern Europe, or persons who spoke Polish. <br>  The likelihood is that the name (like thousands of others) was ENTERED as Baker in records either when she came over, or shortly afterwards. What you do need are her death record/ place, and seeing if she was in the 1920 or 1910 census. Her marriage will be shortly prior to 1920.. where grandpa was born, is the first place to be looking for this. At least one or more of the census, would indicate about when she immigrated, and MIGHT lead to the record itself. With ANY LUCK.. you might be able to look in the neighborhood, and find either her parents or siblings. Just because she died young is not proof that they did. <br>  "drop back" to grandpa, and his exact date/place of birth. That is the key to opening the door.|`|d34420f9831ea7145b960db693b6179aaa	With the information you've given us and the names that you found, your ancestors are probably Ruthenians. Galicia was a huge area encompassing almost 1/2 of the current country of Poland, plus parts of the Ukraine, Lithuania, etc. When Poland was partitioned, Austria-Hungary took the region of Galicia. The Ruthenians were a group living in the SE part of what we now know as Poland, which overlapped the Russian partition of East Prussia and the Austrian partition of Galicia. FWIW that's considered Central Europe, not Eastern Europe, so when you're looking up records don't look just in Eastern Europe or you may miss a huge section.<br>  <br>  The name Baker is an English name so the one thing I can guarantee is that it was changed somewhere between the time she left Europe and the time she learned to speak English. You're probably looking for some version of the word "PIEKARZ". Just as a slew of Kowalskis became Smiths in the US, a number of Piekarzic, Piechowiaks, etc became "Bakers".|`|ppTanSqXaa	The fact that a surname doesn't sound Slavic doesn't mean that it is not Polish, Ukrainian, Czech etc. <br>  Imagine such situation: in the year of 1300 a family of German settlers Backer (a latter "a" with two dots above) came to the city of Lvov for example. Four, five generations later their ancestors are polonised (changed into Polish) or ruthenised ( changed into Ruthenians) because most of their neighbours are Polish or Ruthenians. Their surname was changed  into Baker, what is simpler for Slavic speakers. You can't say that it is not Polish, or Ukrainian ( because his owner was a Pole or Ukrainian) but you can definately say that it is not Slavic. Baker guys got married with women from neighbourhood (Kowalski, Nowak for example) and Baker girls got married with other neighbourhood guys <br>  ( with slavic surnames as well). Only the first owners of such surnames were foreigners in the new place. Their ancestors became Indigenous people. Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe are not Slavic but  BASED on Slavic culture. <br>  As for English people. There were not many English people in Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine etc. but there were quite large diaspora of Scotisch in the 17th century in those countries.<br>  In the middle age there was a huge migration of German settlers to the east from the overpopulated provinces of Germany. Most of those people became Czech, Polish, Hungarian etc. after few generations. Poland, Czech Rep., and other countries from that region are full of people with such names (Vaclav Klaus the president of the Czech Rep., for example). Germany are also full of people with slavic names and they are German not Polish, Czechs etc. Even some Polish generals in the WWII had German surnames <br>  ( like gen. W. Anders).

Yqyi3CcWaa	I have been on pointe for probably about 5 years now and I started out with Capezios, they have pretty soft shanks and are good for beginners.  If you are not getting over your box there are a couple things to consider.<br>  <br>  1. You have not broken in your shoe enough.  You can break in your shoes by bending the shank where your arch is so that it will bend with your foot.<br>  <br>  2. The shank is too hard.  The shank, if you are not familiar with the term, is essentially the bottom of the shoe that is hard.  Shanks come in many different strengths for different feet.  For beginners soft or medium shanks are the best.  If your shank is too hard you will not be able to get over the box fully.<br>  <br>  3. The vamp might be to long.  The vamp, the part from the tip of the shoe to where you tie the drawstring on any shoe (except Gaynor Mindens I think).  If it is too long you might also be having trouble getting over your box.<br>  <br>  Russian pointe's website has a great fitting guide that will explain a lot of this in more depth.

Le sue motivazioni per il viaggio sono quelle di allontanarsi il più possibile da Valenda più che per pregare gli dei.<br>  Una volta in viaggio dopo un incoraggiante inizio Ista comincia ad avere delle terribili visioni di un castello sconosciuto e di un uomo morente e una serie di terribili circostanze la porterà a trovare Arhys dy Lutez, figlio di quel Lord dy Lutez che lei ha contribuito ad uccidere.<br>  <br>  LA RAGAZZA DELLA TORRE - CECILIA DARTH THORNTON<br>  Tutto comincia con una fuga. Qualcuno corre a perdifiato in un bosco, cade, si rialza, riprende la sua fuga precipitosa. Infine sprofonda in un precipizio, e lì giace privo di sensi su un cespuglio di edera paradossa che lentamente sfigura il suo volto fino a renderlo deforme e irriconoscibile. <br>  La storia segue l’avventura di questa creatura, muta, ignara di se stessa e del mondo. Prima osserviamo il suo lavoro nella torre in cui è stata condotta da chi l’ha salvata, poi il suo pellegrinare in terre ignote e dense di creature pericolose “alla ricerca di tre cose: un viso da mostrare al mondo senza vergogna, il mio nome e il mio passato”.<br>  <br>  LE TRE PIETRE - BUJOR FLAVIA<br>  Il giorno del loro quattordicesimo compleanno Giada, Opale e Ambra, tre ragazze cresciute in famiglie diverse, scoprono di essere state adottate e ricevono in dono un sacchettino da aprire a mezzanotte, in un determinato luogo. Lì, sotto un cielo stellato, si incontrano per la prima volta e insieme scoprono di avere uno strano destino comune, legato a un'antica profezia: dovranno affrontare un lungo viaggio in un regno molto lontano per sconfiggere le potenti forze del Male. Unica arma, la pietra che hanno ricevuto in dono e che corrisponde al loro nome di battesimo; unica possibilità di sopravvivere, imparare a fidarsi delle altre per sfuggire ai mille pericoli che le attendono. <br>  <br>  IL GIGLIO NERO - MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY<br>  E' un regno pacifico quello di Ruwenda, dove le attività economiche sono molto fiorenti. E' pertanto preda ambita del malvagio re del Labornok, Voltrik, che lo mette sotto assedio, aiutato dall'oscuro mago Orogastus. Solo tre gemelle, le figlie della regina scampate al massacro, possono ribaltare la situazione, in quanto Petali del Giglio Nero, predestinate sin dalla nascita alla lotta del male.<br>  Le tre ragazze, Haramis, Kadyia e Anigel, gemelle ma molto diverse fra loro, vengono convocate, compiuti diciassette anni, dall'arcimaga Binah, dalla quale apprendono l'oscura profezia che grava su loro tre...<br>  <br>  TIWILIGHT - STEPHENIE MEYER<br>  Quando Isabella Swann decide di lasciare l'assolata Phoenix per la fredda e piovosa cittadina di Forks, dove vive suo padre, non immagina certo che la sua vita di teenager timida e introversa conoscerà presto una svolta improvvisa, eccitante e mortalmente pericolosa... Nella nuova scuola tutti la trattano con gentilezza, tutti tranne uno: il misterioso e bellissimo Edward Cullen. Edward non dà confidenza a nessuno. Ma c'è qualcosa in Bella che costringe Edward dapprima a cercare di stare lontano da lei e quindi ad avvicinarla. Tra i due inizia un'amicizia sospettosa che man mano si trasforma in un'attrazione potente, irresistibile. Fino al giorno in cui Edward rivela a Bella il suo segreto...<br>  <br>  Alcune sono sono saghe (il secondo il terzo e l'ultimo) quindi ti ho inserito solo il primo libro..così se ti interessa puoi leggere tutti gli altri...<br>  |`|36n1Rn35aa	Lo strano caso del cane ucciso a mezzanotte<br>  di Haddon Mark<br>  <br>  è un bel libro, non troppo lungo e scorrevole<br>  il protagonista è un ragazzino autistico<br>  credo che per iniziare a leggere possa andare bene non è per bambini ma non è neanche troppo impegnativo, <br>  buona lettura<br>  |`|z5sVkPFXaa	Anche io avevo il tuo stesso problema, infatti ho iniziato ad appassionarmi alla lettura all'età di 15 anni....<br>  IL primo libro che sono riuscita a leggere x intero è "IL buio oltre la siepe" di Harper Lee...non pensavo mi sarebbe piaciuto (era un regalo, perciò non lo scelsi), invece ho iniziato ad appassionarmi sin dalle prime pagine...linguaggio scorrevole e trama avvincente...te lo consiglio davvero!<br>  Potrei consigliarti altri 1000 romanzi ma mi rendo conto che a 14 anni alcuni libri possono risultare noiosi per via del linguaggio non esattamente "attuale" (mi riferisco ai romanzi di Jane Austen...ora è la mia scrittrice preferita ma a 14 anni l'avrei detestata, perciò ti consiglio di aspettare per assaporare i romanzi della mitica Jane!)...<br>  Potresti provare anche con la saga di HArry Potter....riscuote sempre moltissimo successo tra i giovanissimi (e non..)<br>  Comunque non preoccuparti, a forza di provare troverai un libro che riesca a coinvolgerti e vedrai che da quel giorno non smetterai più di leggere!<br>  Buona Fortuna!|`|wtbgCmAmaa	mille splendidi soli...........<br>  e se vuoi anche quello precedente: il cacciatore di aquiloni.<br>  Quelli si che sono libri che non smetteresti mai di leggere!<br>  Ma se vuoi qualcosa di molto leggero del genere storielle di amori fra adolescenti, ecc. prova la linea de "Le Ragazzine", ci sono molti titoli e molte storie carine.

Vinicio si innamora di Licia e cerca dapprima di prenderla con la forza, ma ella lo respinge. In seguito però Vinicio, seguendo la ragazza, entra in contatto con la comunità cristiana guidata da san Pietro, che si riunisce nelle catacombe, e finisce per convertirsi a sua volta al cristianesimo.<br>  <br>  Nel frattempo scoppia il Grande incendio di Roma, del quale sono incolpati i cristiani: Nerone ne ordina allora la persecuzione, ed essi sono catturati e massacrati nei più vari modi nel circo, per il divertimento degli spettatori. Pietro tenta di fuggire da Roma, ma gli appare Gesù che lo convince a tornare indietro, e viene crocefisso a testa in giù. Licia viene spinta nell'arena per essere uccisa da un toro inferocito, ma viene salvata dal fortissimo schiavo Ursus, che ingaggia una furibonda lotta con l'animale e infine lo abbatte spezzandogli le corna a mani nude. Il pubblico, entusiasmato dallo spettacolo, chiede e ottiene la grazia per Ursus e per Licia, che con Vinicio lascia Roma e si mette in salvo.<br>  <br>  Per questo romanzo Sienkiewicz ricevette nel 1905 il Premio Nobel per la letteratura.<br>  <br>  <br>  oppure Cime tempestose di Emily Bronte<br>  <br>  Il romanzo della Bront? narra la storia di Catherine e Heathcliff, del loro amore a tutto tondo l’uno per l’altra, e di come questa passione irrisolta alla fine li distrugga entrambi. Tensioni sociali ostacolano la loro unione, portando Heathcliff a rifuggire dalla società e ad abusarne. La trama è qui riportata in dettaglio, poiché la narrazione del libro non è né lineare né sempre chiara.<br>  <br>  Il narratore è un gentiluomo di città, Mr Lockwood, che sta affittando Thrushcross Grange; una casa di Heathcliff. Questa è vicino a "Wuthering Heights", Cime tempestose. Un giorno va in visita a Cime Tempestose e qui rimane colpito dagli strani personaggi della casa e costretto a passare la notte li' poiché fuori imperversa la bufera. Durante la notte di tormento passata nella casa, a Mr. Lockwood succedono strani episodi come la visione del "fantasma" di una donna che, durante la notte, bussa alla sua finestra. Poco dopo, Lockwood si ammala e durante la noiosa convalescenza si fa raccontare da Nelly Dean, la governante di Thrushcross Grange, la storia degli abitanti di Cime Tempestose che lo hanno incuriosito.<br>  <br>  La storia di Nelly Dean offre al lettore la possibilità di comprendere a fondo come la relazione fra Heathcliff e Catherine doveva avere ripercussioni di vasta portata per le loro famiglie ed i loro bambini. La passione di Heathcliff per Catherine è così fosca e sinistra da farlo giungere alla distruzione della felicità degli Earnshaw e dei Linton.<br>  <br>  ecco alcune frasi particolarmente belle tratte dal libro Cime tempestose<br>  <br>  ? Il mio amore per Linton è come il fogliame nei boschi: il tempo lo cambierà, ne sono consapevole, come l'inverno cambia gli alberi. Il mio amore per Heathcliff somiglia alle rocce eterne che stanno sotto quegli alberi: una fonte di piacere ben poco visibile, ma necessaria. Nelly, io sono Heathcliff! ?<br>  <br>  (Cime Tempestose, Catherine I)<br>  ? In ogni nuvola, in ogni albero, nell'aria della notte e nell'aspetto di ogni oggetto durante il giorno, io sono circondato dalla sua immagine! I più comuni visi di donna o uomo, i miei stessi lineamenti, si fanno gioco di me con il loro ricordarla. Il mondo intero è per me una terribile collezione di cimeli che mi ricordano che lei è esistita e che io l'ho persa! ?<br>  <br>  (Cime tempestose, Heathcliff )<br>  <br>  oppure: <br>  la lettera scarlatta<br>  orgoglio e pregiudizio<br>  mille splendidi soli<br>  il cacciatore di aquiloni<br>  l'ombra del vento<br>  la solitudine dei numeri primi...<br>  <br>  se nn sai cosa prendere ti consiglio i libri che hanno vinto il premio STREGA.....  di solito sono davvero molto belli.... ma è difficile consigliare un libro da leggere xk ognuno ha i suoi gusti....   x esempio c'è gente k va matta x il fantasy mentre io lo odio.....<br>  <br>  spero cmq di esserti stata di aiuto....<br>  fammi sapere ..........baci...... |`|oiBCuLAeaa	-twilight, new moon eclipse  di s.meyer<br>   (a breve uscirà il 4° libro^^)<br>   <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_di_Twilight" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_di_Twi...</a> (se vuoi sapere qualcs d qst serie)<br>  <br>  -shadowhunters di cassandra clare <br>   <a href="http://leggiamo.altervista.org/fanta_shadowhunterscittadiossa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leggiamo.altervista.org/fanta_sha...</a><br>  <br>  -la saga di anita blake   di laurell k. hamilton<br>  -la saga di merry gentry  sempre della hamilton<br>  <a href="http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laurellkhamilton.org/</a><br>  <br>  -i libri di cate tiernan<br>  <br>  -i libri di ann rice come: intervista col vampiro, la regina dei dannati, armand il vampiro, la mummia .. ecc... oppure la serie sulle streghe di mayfair<br>  <br>  ^^ sxo d esserti stata utile^^|`|D2Zaw8h8aa	dipende molto dal genere che ti appassiona.<br>  Ecco i titoli che potresti trovare non noiosi che mi vengono in mente<br>  <br>  se ti piace il fantasy o cmq le storie ambientate nel medioevo puoi scegliere tra:<br>  -il signore degli anelli<br>  -harry potter (non è per bambini, tranquilla)<br>  -eragon<br>  -i pilastri della terra di wilburn Smith<br>  <br>  Se preferisci le commediole poco impegnative o i comici:<br>  -il diavolo veste prada<br>  -i love shopping<br>  -chissà se stai dormendo<br>  -tutti i libri della littizzetto e di severgnini<br>  <br>  Di narrativa ti consiglio<br>  -memorie di una geisha<br>  -il conte di montecristo<br>  -i libri di patricia cornwell, di faletti e di dan brown <br>  <br>  Per i gialli buttati senza alcun dubbio su Agatha Cristie!<br>  <br>  Ce ne sono moltissimi altri ma ora ho il vuoto, scusami.|`|P7kc366oaa	A me piacciono molto i classici.

Gub99Dr5aa	-"Il cacciatore di aquiloni" e" Mille splendidi soli" entrambi di Khaled Hosseini. Ambedue sono ambientati in Afghanistan, sono due romanzi epici spettacolari. Il primo tratta l'amicizia profonda che lega due bambini; quest'amicizia verrà però compromessa dagli enormi sensi di colpa del protagonista. Il secondo romanzo invece, parla delle difficili condizioni delle donne afghane con la presa di potere dei talebani. Sono molto tristi ma nonostante ciò, li reputo dei capolavori contemporanei.<br>  <br>  " Il profumo" di Patrick Süsskind- da questo libro, hanno tratto anche un film,é la storia di un ragazzo che pur di riuscire ad ottenere il profumo perfetto é disposto ad uccidere<br>  <br>  " I pilastri della terra" e " Mondo senza fine " di Ken Follett- ambientati nell' Inghilterra medievale, non mancano intrighi e colpi di scena.<br>  <br>  " il codice da vinci" e " angeli e demoni" di dan brown, due gialli favolosi, scritti impeccabilmente, pieni di suspence, si concludono con un colpo di scena. La Chiesa ha giudicato il codice Da Vinci blasfemo.<br>  <br>  " la casa degli spiriti" di isabel allende- é la storia di un intera famiglia, racconta le gioie e i dolori dei protagonisti.<br>  <br>  " il postino suona sempre due volte" e "Mildred" di James Cain- All'epoca fecero scalpore. Non mancano vendette, sesso e opportunismo.<br>  <br>  " il brooker" John Grisham- Un uomo condannato a moltissimi anni di galera viene improvvisamente scarcerato. A sua insaputa, si aprirà una vera e propria caccia all'uomo.

Assuming that you're younger than that, unless you're ambitious, I recommend you wait on it--I was an Early Modern major and it felt like a bit of a slog despite that.

Would YOU invest millions in "I have this really good idea, but it is not finished yet!"?  If you are a degreed, experienced, theatrical professional, then you would not have to ask HERE - so I am assuming that you are still young.  Finish your musical, get i copyrighted, and then get it produced ANYPLACE - local theater, etc.  You might have to pay for that yourself - hope you are independently wealthy.  You need something to SHOW people - nobody spend money on an unproven idea or person.

Listen to your favorite songs and imagine how you would move to them. Listen to the beat for accents and to keep time. Keeping time is one of the most important parts of dancing. You can't really go wrong with a simple side to side movement. Most importantly enjoy what you do. I'll do the robot if that's what I feel like doing. There's a reason they say "Dance like no one's watching" its because you're supposed to feel happy and comfortable no matter what.

s1xoaIBAaa	It can be very complicated First, the Roman Catholic Church recognized four Major Orders; sub-deacon, deacon, priest and bishop.  People progressed through these in order. To become a bishop, one had to first be a priest. To become a priest one had to first be a deacon.  Only a bishop could ordain a priest, deacon or sub deacon, and it took three bishops acting together to consecrate a new bishop. Below the Major orders were four minor orders; porter, lector, exorcist, and acolyte. These were seen as preparatory for the Major orders, although men might remain in them forever. Men in minor orders did not have to remain celibate.<br>  <br>  Beyond the three Holy Orders, there was a complex power structure of offices. At the top was the Pope, who as Bishop of Rome was seen as the successor of Peter and was the head of the whole Church. Below the Pope were the Cardinals. These men usually were bishops or archbishops. The Cardinals in Rome selected a new Pope, almost always from the ranks of the Cardinals. Archbishops were the Bishops of especially important dioceses (a diocese is the area controlled by a church.) An Archbishop might have several Bishops under him. For example, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the head of the English church, and was over the Bishop of London. A Bishop headed a diocese, that is all of the parish churches within an area. If the area was very large, or the bishop held political posts that kept him from administering the diocese, he might have an auxiliary bishop who helped him. (Since a bishop had to be the head of some church, auxiliary bishops were give the titles to dioceses that no longer existed because, for example, they had been conquered by non-Christians.) Beneath the Bishops were the priests, some of whom served as his staff and some of whom were parish priests. Deacons and sub-deacons assisted the upper orders of clergy.<br>  <br>  Alongside of the this structure there was the parallel structure of monasticism. Monks and nuns were (at least originally) people who had decided to live a life apart from the world dedicated to God. A group of monks was known as an abbey, and was headed by an abbot. Sometimes a large abbey would control a smaller separate monastery called a priory, which would be headed by a prior, who would answer to the abbot of the larger abbey. Abbeys were often grouped together into Orders, which could often be multinational. The individual abbies would be subservient to the order. Orders often owed allegiance directly to the Pope, which meant that local bishops had no control over the abbies in their dioceses. In other cases, an abbey would be under the control of the local bishop. It is important to note that a monk was not necessarily a member of the clergy, that is he might not be ordained into any of the minor or major orders. Some monks were priests or even bishops, but many were not.

qNCsLuaNaa	I believe that lack of security can make you feel this way.  I belly dance and dance latin/dancehall/samba all the time... some of the most skin-baring styles. At first it was hard for me to feel comfortable because I'm not as voluptuous and feminine as these full-grown women are who surround me. I realized that I have the same talent and that there are others who are my size in the same dance genre who can come across just as girly and sensual. With this knowledge, I began to gain confidence.  May sound cheesy but I believe that your femininity comes from within. <br>  <br>  Also, having grace in your steps and movement instantly makes you look feminine onstage. (posture is another)<br>  <br>  Another possibility that you may feel this way is because of the costume.  Is it flattering for your figure?|`|6308c9e7197518ff4b58be785c53e832aa	Perhaps you tend to criticize yourself too much. It doesn't take years to stop criticizing yourself. You don't have to be perfect. Tell yourself that you are OK, you are good enough, even if you don't feel perfectly feminine at the moment. We are all born feminine, but often enough we suppress it by striving to be better, by thinking we're not good enough and by doubting ourselves. Allow yourself to be, and you will do fine in the show. Good luck.

V2v66A7Waa	Eric Satie wrote many short pieces that would work beautifully. Gymnopedie I, II and III to name but three, you'll usually find a CD full of his short pieces. Also listen to Elgars Chausson de Matin or Chausson de Nuit. Benjamin Britten's Simple Symphony has four short movements all very colorful and danceable, written when Britten was a boy. The third movement is longer but the Playful Pizzicato has great potential for choreography. There is an orchestral version of Canteloubes, Songs of the Auvergne that is unbelievably beautiful and many would fit your timeframe. Don't forget Chopin and all his waltzes, polonnaise and preludes. Also Felix Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Nights Dream is tailor made for extracting a three minute section and although not designed as ballet music it truly is ballet music. Beethovens the Turkish March from the Ruins of Athens. Debussies, Gardens in the Rain. One section sounds like raindrops falling, perfect for small children.

"Berimbau/Consolacoa"  and "Samba Da Bencao" by Sergio Mendes are good ones too. <br>  <br>  Try almost any surfing song... so mellow but packed with fast drumming. The Ziggens are my personal favs.  This may sound funny, but "First Date" from the Wall E soundtrack could be usable if you want something short and sweet. lol Another odd selection is "Hill Dwellers" from The Doors.

It's best to take a sample doll in and ask the staff these questions: 1) How many coats do you have to apply 2) What is the drying time 3) Will it eventually yellow, crack or age over time 4)Is the product toxic and not good to use with dolls for children. 5) Does the product require that you use turpentine or ? to clean the brushes afterwards 6) How much ventilation is required when using the sealant.<br>  <br>  I have used both brush and spray, and I think you will find brush on to be the easiest for this project because you will avoid spray "bubbles" and you will not have to cover the hair when applying it. Sometimes a sponge brush works best with the clear coats because it will not show any brush marks, but for the finer details around the face where you don't want it globbing up you may wish to use a very fine water color brush. And, of course, it is smart to do a test first, so have a sample doll ready to try different techniques on that you don't mind messing up.<br>  <br>  To find the closest art store nearest you go to Google.com and input your city, then art stores. For example: Los Angeles Art Stores. I'm sure it will give you a decent list of places you can go to.

It just means an action that helps another person by making a sacrifice or assuming a large risk. Risking your life to save another's -- say, entering a burning building to rescue a stranger, when you know you could die trying -- is always altruistic, regardless of the fact that you did it because you would feel guilty if the person died while you stood by, and regardless of the fact that you like being a hero.|`|4aa8824c12babfd0fa8da8f2f1cf115faa	Yes.

Could be. But suppose I say in my will that, in the event of my death, all of my possessions are to be sold and the money given to the Red Cross or other charity. Suppose further that I then kill myself (often called the ultimate act of selfishness - I disagree) for truly no reason other than to benefit the charities to which I am leaving my estate. I would argue that THAT is a truly selfless act. Assuming, of course, that the real reason for my suicide is not that I'm too lazy to actually work to benefit these charities. <br>  <br>  Feel free to message me or IM or however this site works.

Spencer. <br>  For Comte Altruism meant the discipline and eradication of self-centered desire, and a life devoted to the good of others; more particularly, selfless love and devotion to Society. In brief, it involved  self-abnegating love...." Dictionary of Phil; Runes <a href="http://www.ditext.com/runes/a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ditext.com/runes/a.html</a><br>  <br>  Self-abnegating love exists all around us. Mother Theresa apparently grieved for 12 years that her god had forsaken her, yet she continued to serve the poor of India. IF and only if she believed her god was by her side, she would not have been eradicating her "self" at all, but sustaining it by working side by side with god.<br>  <br>  Instead, she choose to believe her punishment for what ever sins she imagined she had committed was to serve god selflessly, without the reward of her god at her side.

a9wRfuuSaa	For a book, you can start with simple page numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) for all the pages of the book (usually starting after the table of contents) and then design the table of contents and index to correspond with the numbering.<br>  <br>  Often, manuals will be paginated using section numbers followed by page numbers (1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2-1, 2-2, ...) and then design the TOC and index accordingly. <br>  <br>  If you will be printing double sided, make sure to place the page number itself on the outside corners of the pages to make flipping through easier for the reader. <br>  <br>  You can also include other information either as a header or footer as well. Items often included in headers (at the top of the page, above the text) are author's name, chapter or section title or the book title itself. Items often included in the footer (at the bottom of the page, below the text) are page numbers, section titles or revision dates. You will want to make sure the same information is shown consistently (i.e. the author's name on the front side, book title on the back side, numbers on the outside, text centered or on the gutter side). <br>  <br>  Open up a variety of books or manuals in a library or book store to get an idea. Just look at the top and bottom of the pages (front and back) and don't forget to check out the table of contents and index.<br>  <br>  I hope this is the type of informaiton you were looking for.
WZNaNvplaa	It played a critical role. Ghandi's utilization of non violence as a method of opposing Colonial rule helped Indians to gain the moral high ground. It's one thing when one's troops shoot at insurgents who are killing soldiers, and even women and children, as had happened in earlier rebellions. But it was another for government officials and troops to fire on unarmed, unresisting men and women. And it was difficult for a nation that had banned slavery two centuries before trying to justify the use of violence to force men to work against their will. The non violent methods helped swing public opinion towards sympathizing with the Indians, as well as making it clear to the British authorities that the only way to break the revolt was to use methods too brutal and abhorrent to them.<br>     Note that such a strategy would most likely have failed with a more totaltalitarian state, such as Germany. Such a government would not have heisitated to use ruthless violence, even if it meant killing thousands. And they would have suppressed and censored news about such attacks.  So Ghandi's idea worked because he knew and understood that his foes had a limit to what they would do; that their ethics would prevent them from extreme excesses.|`|LICzadWCaa	Those nuns were vicious, you know...|`|rZVPzfFAaa	It divided India into two parts.

That means that its an opinion paper! Which means there is no wrong answer. You might want to start with the focal point in the painting and discuss what it could mean to the artist. If you want you can go find some background info on the artist and see what their common themes are. Then you can discuss the placement of the subjects in the painting and describe how that effects the general moods of the painting. There are many many things that you can discuss. If you want to outline it, you should just start with your topic sentences and on to each point from there. if its only 4 pages double spaced then it seems that your paper could be around 5-6 well developed paragraphs.

iLrp65oXaa	Tap would be the least dangerous.  It has the least amount of jumps and leaps, especially at a beginning level.  Ballet would be the style with the largest potential for injury, but this would occur more at an advanced level.  Jazz would be in between.  At a beginner level none of these types of dance is any more dangerous than the other.  Many dance schools suggest students start with ballet to learn how to take instruction and body movement.<br>  <br>  Ballet costumes seem to be the most expensive, but it is going to depend on the dance school.  If the children are young and growing the shoes are going to be expensive to replace every year or more often.  Ballet shoes are the cheapest of the bunch.<br>  <br>  This may not be a popular answer but I am an adult and I took 9 years of ballet, 7 of tap, 7 of jazz, and 2 years on pointe.  I really wish my parents would have made me learn an instrument instead.  At least that is something I could still do today.|`|UIYKRs1Zaa	Jazz: most frequent injuries (usually short term though, like spraining ankles), most expensive (due to more costumes, buying of jazz shoes), but VERY rewarding, expressive and fun form of dance<br>  <br>  Ballet: medium amount of injuries (more long term results affecting normal body growth), somewhat expensive, requires more consistent commitment (learning curve is high)<br>  <br>  Tap: least amount of injuries, somewhat expensive, fun|`|Xqno8BTKaa	To be honest, all forms of dance and sport (or exercise of any kind) can cause long term injuries. One person may do tap and never get an injury that will affect them long term, another person can do the exact same thing, slip and fall one day and end up with an injury that will affect them for the rest of their lives. But then, you could never dance and still end up with arthritis or a long term injury of some sort, so if you're choosing a type of dance based on which will cause the least long term injuries, it's a little pointless to do it that way, because there is no absolute. Some forms of dance are more likely to result in long term injuries than others, because of the way you are required to move your body, or the shoes you are required to wear, but there's no guarantee that one form of dance will cause long term injuries and another won't. And in some cases dancers are less likely to get long term injuries because they know how to take care of themselves, and they're aware of their bodies.<br>  <br>  As far as expenses go, it really depends on how involved your kids are and what they want to do with it. I mean, if they took one or two jazz classes a week, and went in recitals twice a year, it probably wouldn't be that expensive. If they decided they wanted to be professional ballet dancers and took 10 classes a week and went in 4 recitals a year, or if they wanted to compete, then it would probably be pretty expensive. Heck, if they wanted to be professional dancers of any kind it would end up being expensive just because of how many classes they'd have to take. And how expensive costumes are depends on where you get them, you can get cheap, good quality costumes (admittedly if they did ballet and got to higher levels it'd end up being expensive, because the tutus and however many pairs of pointe shoes a year do add up). But again, more involved = more costumes & more money. <br>  <br>  So I guess all there is in the end is to let your kids do a type of dance they think is fun, and just let them enjoy themselves.|`|iCpDKt5Caa	well wat ever form of sport or dance you do you will not have least to highest amount of injuries.<br>  <br>  costume expense wise: it depends wat costume the dance teacher or choreographer wants, i will admit wen you get bigger and older in ballet- the tutus can get pretty dear to get a good quality one.. theres also the expense of shoes.. to get a good pair of shoes; for an average 6 yr old you may be paying about 50$ for a pair of ballet slippers or jazz booties.<br>  <br>  dance is a great way to form/improve co-ordination and keep fit!|`|9MoytEURaa	BALLET<br>  check our their feet .<br>  <br>  <br>  wowwwwsaaazzz :O|`|eXueJEQraa	most dance schools will ask you to take ballet while taking either or jazz and tap and it depends in ballet its more dangerous the more advanced you get if you plan on doing alot of flips kicks and kartwheels jazz may be more dangerous and if your stupid and try to do slides that your not ready for because the master class teacher said if your really brave and or stupid you could try this well then tap may be more dangerous jazz shoes are probably the cheapest then ballet shoes then tap (because of the metal taps) then pointe <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|XSzNJVsVaa	i have been doing tap and jazz since i was five and have never really had any major injuries. It really depends on how old your children are. if they are younger, tap would probably be easier as it gets more difficult as your child progresses.

LEp7IFdvaa	First of all you need to understand what constitutes a "conceit" in the literary sense.  A conceit is an extended metaphor that shows how things are alike by showing how they are not alike...such combinations as "bright smoke" or "cold fire", or "sick health".  The power of the conceit comes from the level of attention the reader focuses on the combination due to it's apparent oxymoron status...in other words, it makes the reader think harder about how they are or are not alike, and why.<br>  <br>  In this case, Donne says, "if they be two, they are two so as stiff twin compasses are two."  meaning, they may be two in the broadest sense of the word, but rather than being two vines entwined, they are opposite ends of a compass, stiff in their jointness.  He then goes on to further show the difference saying that the one stays put and the other goes about, leaning and roaming, growing "erect" (a double entendre meaning the compass grows taller as the two points are brought together, but also that the man gets "randier" the closer he gets to his mate) as he gets close to the other after being gone.  He then goes on to say that this is how he is to his love...those, the entire poem is an extended metaphor, as well as a conceit.|`|6558e1177abb6a029748d359090ee9f9aa	John Donne is comparing the two lovers in this poem to the two legs of a compass (a math compass, not a directional one.)  <br>  <br>  He says that if one person should travel far away, that the other lover will remain where they were, faithful and unmoving (with the exception of leaning toward where the other has gone, "hearkening after it") like the fixed leg of the compass when used to draw a circle.  <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the other end of the compass (the end with the pencil in it) is compared to the lover who has gone some distance away, yet is still connected to the first lover, as two legs of a compass are connected.  <br>  The stationery lover remains firm and loyal, allowing the other lover to come full circle and return to where he began, bringing the two lovers back together.<br>  <br>  It seems to be about trust and love in long distance relationships, though Donne himself apparently had mistresses despite being married to his wife Anne, who bore him 11 children.

qNCsLuaNaa	If you feel that you lack the skill and knowledge but is still capable of performing alright... then go ahead and try out.  I would recommend asking for some additional help if you feel that you need it. I think having a trainer, instructor, or whoever, is best but not always required to do well. I think it depends on the style of dance as well.  If it's more street dance and all of those sub-genres under that, then you can't really be taught that because it's more about style and attitude (with some stellar steps.)  <br>  <br>  If you can get on the team with a smile, personality, or looks... that's just wrong. <br>  <br>  If you make that team with your own talent... then don't feel inferior because obviously there is a reason why they let you on it. Yeah, there are those chicks who can perform better or whatever, but who cares... just enjoy dancing!|`|65Rzxlv2aa	There is a reason dancing is called a PERFORMING ART.. which means YOU HAVE TO PERFORM.. and to get through the auditions you have to do that better than the other hopefuls.<br>  <br>  If you have never had any formal training, then how the hell do you think you can perform better than people who HAVE had training?

eVptHOOBaa	It isn't just the light (although, if you get so close that your camera and own head shadows the light, that too), but also it's a thing about depth of field. When you shoot macro, at 100mm, at f/2.8 and very close to the subject - all three of these things (long focal length, wide aperture, close to subject) shrink your depth of field to be paper thin. <br>  <br>  Move your camera just a notch between focus being locked and shot is taken, and your subject falls out of focus. It's not a motion blur that you'd see, you'd be just missing focus, because you moved your camera, not when that shot was being taken (you probably know better to hold it well at that time), but between focusing and shooting!<br>  <br>  You may somewhat help yourself by closing aperture tight (f/11, f/16 or so), so that you get a slightly better DOF, but then... well, then you really do need lots of light for shutter speed to be decent, or else you'll get the actual motion blur you were talking about!<br>  <br>  So either way - a tripod is a good thing to have when doing macro work... Or hold your camera absolutely still for the whole process - focusing and taking a picture...<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|n4KoinUpaa	Well, you've got a long focal length, and that 'amplifies' camera shake so to speak (Any tremors whilst the shutter is open will be more visible than if you'd shot it with a 15mm lens). Also, the fact that you are pretty close means that both you and your lens will block a little bit of the available light.<br>  <br>  And no, you don't need the USM  version. The USM version just has a faster focusing technology in it.<br>  <br>  You can, however, buy a macro ring flash, which sits at the front of the lens.

y2qA23DHaa	It is very hard to say how to dance in words as dance involves movement.... but i'll give a a definition of dance so you can see if its right for you. Dance is a sequence of movement and is movement to a rhythm. It is a fun and social sport and gives you a great workout. There are many types of styles such as ballroom, jazz, hip-hop, classical ballet, Contemporary, musical theatre, etc. As a said early I can't tell you how to dance but if you want to dance you should try some lessons. Every person is different and some people just don't suit dancing but others are so natural at it, so if dancing isn't your thing don't be upset because there are a whole lot of other sports you can do. Hope this helped :)|`|CTZmy8Blaa	so whats your question?>

My boyfriend's mom works on set and when they fax her the script it says TOP SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL all over it.<br>  <br>  Most people aren't willing to lose their jobs to leak that stuff.|`|cqDsR7gqaa	Hahaha.. no.  <br>  <br>  Most TV shows have special clauses in the contracts that their employees sign that states not only would they lose their job for leaking a script but they would also have to pay a pricey fine.

6Pckjqlsaa	progressive era was mostly for the people in the workforce.. fighting for equal opportunities...|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Progressivism was rooted in the middle class, unlike the earlier Populist movement of struggling farmers and workers. Perhaps as a result of their class status, their usually high level of education, and their resulting influence, Progressives were also more successful at getting their reforms passed into law, even if some of those reforms failed to accomplish all that the Progressives hoped they would.<br>  <br>  The middle class has the time and much of this came from religious and political ideals, not self interest.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop
ktdMxaGuaa	The first one is really gorgeous. The composition is nice and it's from an interesting point of view (I like how the trees sort of seem to line up). The color isn't super dynamic though, I think if you turned up the saturation a bit that would make the leaves and sky pop a bit more.<br>  <br>  The second picture is nice but it's a bit hazy because of the sun rays. In the future if you lower your exposure a shot like that would become a lot more effective. The composition is very nice. <br>  <br>  The third picture is really fantastic. It has a lot of depth and layers, it's very stunning! The only thing is that the sky is very turquoise, and the green of the trees in the background are kind of pastel which looks unnatural. Again, if you color correct it (add a little blue, maybe a little red) it will really pop. (To avoid this while taking the photograph rather than doing it in post you'd probably want to lower the exposure, and white balance you can learn how to do that here:  <a href="http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_white-balance.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_white-...</a><br>  <br>  The fourth picture is also very stunning in composition, but is a bit overexposed and needs to be white balanced/color corrected.<br>  <br>  The fifth picture is goregous. <br>  <br>  The sixth picture is awesome, I'm surprised the squirrel let you get that close! If you tweaked the contrast a bit, or darkened it a little it will be even better.<br>  <br>  The seventh picture should be darkened just a tad to get a good contrast between the sky, the tree trunk, and the landscapes behind it. <br>  <br>  The eight picture is also very nice, I like how VAST the field seems. Again, it's a little bit green, and could stand to be darkened just a tad to get good color and good contrast. (A good rule of thumb for photo/video is you want to make sure your blacks are as black as can be, and your whites are as white as can be, this is how you'll get a perfect contrast/exposure/color balance)<br>  <br>  The ninth picture is interesting, I keep debating in my head whether or not it has too much open space on top and on bottom. You might want to crop it just a bit because it seems that there's extraneous space. (That might just be personal preference however, so don't quote me on that!) Again, it's a bit turquoise and just a bit overexposed (see how the shadows from the tree on the right are a little bit green? If you make it darker they will be black and you'll have good contrast). <br>  <br>  The tenth picture is VERY COOL! I like how it's layered from being overexposed in the front to completely dark in the back! There's a lot of good depth in here and the composition is interesting, and there's a lot to draw the eye to. I wonder what the blue splotches are though? That's probably something that happened with your camera/flash. <br>  <br>  You have a very good eye for composition, all of these pictures were very interesting and had a pleasing aesthetic. If you spend a little time learning the technical details of photography (camera functions and all that) you'll have some really perfect art! Keep working at it, because not everyone is gifted with such a good eye, most people have to work really hard to get it.|`|rgXrXmaZaa	They're not too bad. I agree with everyone else when they say they shots are a bit too 'blue', you should find the White Balance setting on your camera (even the cheap ones will have it on there somewhere) and play with it a little so the shots come up a bit more natural. <br>  I hope you dont mind but I tweaked one of the shots a little so you can see what I mean about it looking more natural, more like what your eye can see and not an electronic device.<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30782404@N03/3343787932/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/30782404@N0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Some of the later shots seemd a little bit bare...<br>  And the last one, was that taken from behind glass? It seems like there is a reflection in the bg...<br>  <br>  Anyway, keep it up, you're on the right track :)|`|HZojX6tsaa	theyre good, but are you sure your settings on your camera arent set to make them blue, or your camera isnt broken? the color isnt natural|`|mKhTNsdRaa	Excellent composure.<br>  Terrible coloring.<br>  You need a much better camera.|`|aAe0aZTqaa	I set the squirrel one as my desktop background, hope you don't mind! =)|`|N0EEYQUnaa	All great. 3rd form the top is the best.|`|Nj36OUPFaa	Very nice! but they are kinda blue.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	very nice. love 'em ^_^|`|9PChI0Bxaa	Whatever camera you're using you need to be aware of how much light there is outside. If you have photo shop you could correct the lighting to be more pleasant to the eye. Since you like landscape pics you can buy a nikon or canon. There are the best brands on the market. Do some research on the different kind of lenses you can use to take landscape pics. The photos are good, but the bright light from the daytime ruins what I think you're trying to capture. If its just a hobby, the Nikon's and canons can be pricey. If you want to make some money in photography then they are a good investment. So, good pictures in the end, but if they were a little dimmer and more colorful they would be perfect. Good luck!!!|`|4ZtAvYG9aa	My favorite would definitely be this one<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s400.photobucket.com/albums/pp81/kittyloverr/?action=view&current=PB090022.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s400.photobucket.com/albums/pp81/...</a><br>  <br>  For a picture taken using an amateur camera, this photo contains some Professional handy work to it. I love how the focal point is clear so that you are staring straight. The reflection on the river is nice as well. <br>  <br>  The photos seem a bit blue. However, this is not something you can't fix on Photoshop. Just change the lighting, add a bit of a dreamy affect to it, and voila! You have a masterpiece ;]|`|AlAqoQABaa	honestly, i think a couple are quite good. The close up of the swamp with the tree halfway blocking it and the one of the trees with the light shining through. i think the others are average. I think a better camera would help but also maybe just taking more random unexpected shots. I do think you have talent.|`|AA11732721	My favorite pic is PB090010.jpg.<br>  You've definately got potential. Keep taking pics!|`|dPrAoDtZaa	They are amazingly beautiful pictures!

Looks like it's set for tungsten light, which will make outdoor sun and shade very blue.  Try using the cloudy setting to warm things up.  Otherwise they are pleasant but mediocre snaps, nice for your album.  Keep learning and practicing.|`|mv7h2Wjbaa	looks like pics from swannee river or from here in jax where I live the remind me of home :) where my heart is lol.. so I like them|`|VtTBRrl1aa	hm... i liked most of them<br>  but the ones of the open Field with tree's in the back seemed sorta empty.<br>  and the last one was good but i think it would look better with like a person of something.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	They look alright but the colors/lighting seem off. Perhaps try messing with the settings on your camera or editing them on the computer.|`|B2PW3sUKaa	those are really pretty and peaceful! i love the one with the squirrel! they are so cute lol|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	i think the pictures are nice. good hobby to be in... but hard profession to get and stay into.
HlQCmCG0aa	A suggestion and only that.<br>  Duplicate your image in PS, go to Filter, Render, Lighting effects. Play with that for awhile. <br>  Your stuff isn't terrible the way it is. Composition is fine in most cases, focus the same <br>  Go have fun! Be yourself, enjoy the light.<br>  <br>  Consult your manuel/handbook if you wish to adjust BW balance.<br>  <br>  We all can't just keep treading in the same footsteps, if the path was  that clearly defined we'd all be taught the abc's and 2x2's as if a photography Bible.<br>  <br>  Learning right from wrong - good from evil is the easy part, learning how far you can bend the rules is THE FUN S***T|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Your white balance is off. You can try fixing the curves, levels and adjust the exposure in photoshop. Good Luck. In general I think the photos need to just be thrown out and retake checking all your camera settings.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	I agree. You can't add lighting to a photo unless you are editing a RAW file format and even then, it's no substitute for taking a proper exposure the first time.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Unless you also saved a RAW file at the same time (RAW + JPEG), you are out of luck.  It seems that you  had your camera set for incandescent lighting when shooting outdoors.  This is a good lesson and will help you remember to always check your cameras white balance before shooting.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Apparently the Japanese did not realize it was based upon a real language, and presumably they had no knowledge of Native American languages (grammar, structure, usage rules, vocabulary, etc.) <br>  <br>  Most codes are developed along mathematical models, but this one was not. In addition, they never captured any of the code-speakers alive.|`|qeR967J7aa	It was avery organized program from the beginning.  If a codetalker looked like he was going to be captured, it was up to his troop mates to kill him.  But the biggest reason, Navajo is an unwritten language.  Little hard to learn unless it's been passed down.  Did you know all the code talkers were volunteers in service?  Not draftees.  And they faced alot of prejudice back then due to their skin color.
AA12025213	Get a cheap kit. Not the walmart kind. I'm talking a cheap Gretsche, a Ludwig. Anything but Yamaha and other brands like that. You can get a decent kit for between 100 and 200.<br>  <br>  When you're first starting out, it's important not to get discouraged. Try to learn songs by ear. Pick songs that make you feel good, and that get you going so that it will be easier to learn. Analyze the recordings and figure out what the drummer is hitting when.<br>  <br>  Above all, it CAN get very expensive if you don't do it right. Don't bash away, or you're gonna break sticks and heads, try to develop a light but firm technique. As you progress, you can find videos and such online.<br>  <br>  Above all, if you can, get a teacher. It will help you immensely. If you can't, just be ambitious about your playing and don't get discouraged, because it will come in time.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	You have to have an instrument to practice on in order to learn to play. Yes, drums are prohibitively expensive for a beginner. You could start out with a used set until you get some idea if you want to proceed. Start with basics. Talk to a local instructor to get an idea of a good place to start. Once you have an idea of what you need, check pawn shops for used drums and cymbals Do not skimp on cymbals. You can make any drum sound and play halfway decent, but cheap cymbals just do not sound good and break easily. For new drums, there are student packages that will get you started.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Find a good drum teacher.  If you are unable to find one, or dont know who is good... call a local guitar teacher that seems successful and ask him for a referral.  Once you've found a drum teacher, ask him to go to the music store with you to assist you in buying only what you need at the beginning.

cqDsR7gqaa	To audition for a movie as highly anticipated as Harry Potter you would need an agent.  Other then that, no.<br>  <br>  You can go and watch them film, you have to do some research online as to when and where they might be.  Seeing the set is possible from beyond the police barricades but its a long shot.  If you find out where it is, chances are lots of other people will too.  There will be huge crowds surrounding the area and they always make sure to keep the crowds far enough back so they aren't disturbing the actors or causing any noise that would be a problem for filming.|`|zFOC0PZnaa	They only cast British people for the movies, even as extras. It's no fair, but that's life. Watching them film would be incredibly difficult... The best you could do is to get close to a filming location and see how close you can get. Actually hanging out on the set is highly unlikely, though, unless you win some kind of contest or if you're Andrew Sims or something. There's going to be a national tour of HP props and sets soon, going around to major US cities. You could look into that, should be interesting. If you're more interested in seeing the actors, head to a premiere.|`|6rNmAqXnaa	Well I do think it might be too late because they have all characters from the book, so I think they're ready to go!

na60ogCNaa	They're a GREAT way to get started. I'd never say anything bad about a school play. You have to start somewhere!|`|fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	School plays are only necessary if they are your only opportunity to get experience.  At a young age I started participating in classes and shows outside of school because I felt I would get a more well rounded experience that way but I also did school shows. <br>  <br>  Participating in school shows (or any shows for that matter) will not ensure you will become a famous actor. They will however give you the training, experience and backbone that is necessary for this field.|`|hIhDvVtZaa	They are pretty much your best option, though you need classes too if you can. The main reason is because no (film) director will want to take a chance with someone who has never acted before. Having that experience shows that you're dedicated. Also, casting directors only get to see you for 5-10 minutes. They want solid proof that you can handle the pressure of acting, especially since the longer it takes to film, the more money they have to pay. The roles you put on your resume show what kind of actor you are. For example, if you list  a dramatic character that you played and a comedic one, a director will know that you can do both. Your resume needs to speak for you. Another huge reason is that most people will not get any film jobs until they have experience. Since you can't get film experience, you have to get it from theatre. Theatre is also lots of fun and teaches you things to apply to regular acting. You don't have to do it at your school; you could try community theatre. Good Luck!|`|AOtnoozdaa	They're good practice and like the cliche says, "Practice makes perfect."  How do you think many famous actors started.  Doing plays. I mean, there's a reason some actors win awards and some barely make it in the industry.  The ones who are successful typically work their butt off to get where they're at.  There always has to be a start, and it won't be pleasant at first.  Life is full of adversity and the strong ones succeed and the weak fail, but succeeding isn't difficult if you put your mind to it.  I hope I helped : )|`|kqCvVx1Saa	school plays help you get used to being comfortable in front of a big audience, and it helps you learn to keep character more efficiently too!|`|ATydiE6Laa	YES!!!<br>  School plays is agreat way to start and a great experience to give you more experience|`|da1UKp8Maa	There isn't a specific road map for becoming a famous actor. Obviously working and gaining experience are a necessity, so a school play would be a good means to do that. You can also go and get work in a community theater. You can also work on student films to get your start. Which it sounds like is more your speed, since you want to become a "famous actor." Just keep in mind that getting to A-list status takes a lot of talent and work. Years of studying, focusing, and honing your craft. Also bear in mind that theatre is not some sort of stepping stone into films, but a separate art with it's own livelihood. As an actor you can bounce between the two, but they are very different experiences.
na60ogCNaa	Any age at all--as long as you've got the passion and determination!|`|gdW8rZt8aa	No not at 11, because your career could have been over by now.  Look at all the other child actors who have not made it to go on to acting as adults.  Now or between now and 18 or so would be a good age.

Contact them and ask to be notified of any auditions.  <br>  If you do not get a part, offer to help in any way (paint scenery, usher etc.) Just being around the production you will learn a lot.<br>  Study Dance, Music and Acting.  You must be able to do at least one great and the others well enough to let the others work around you.  Find classes or instructors that have produced talent.<br>  Work on your image.

DzNyOIZpaa	first of all i think that the roaring twenties stunk but here is what i know-----Roaring Twenties is a phrase used to describe the 1920s, principally in North America, that emphasizes the period's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. 'Normalcy' returned to politics in the wake of World War I, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked, and finally the Wall Street Crash of 1929 served to punctuate the end of the era, as The Great Depression set in. The era was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries of far-reaching importance, unprecedented industrial growth and accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle.<br>  <br>  The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the aftermath of World War I. Europe spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. When Germany could no longer afford war payments Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass produced goods. By the middle of the decade, economic development soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany (the Weimar Republic), Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the "Golden Twenties". In France and francophone Canada, they were also called the "années folles" ("Crazy Years").[1]<br>  <br>  The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population.|`|13XBknitaa	alcohol was illegal, so the mafia thrived selling the stuff<br>  <br>  consumerism abounded and people appeared prosperous in the suburbs and even in some cities, but most cities were laid in awful conditions.

QYPrM3GPaa	I don't have an exact reference, but you might want to look for what is called, The Syrian Bible.  The Aramaic texts were translated into Greek and I think also into Syrian and so the Syrian Bible is probably one of the earliest renditions of the Bible available.  <br>  <br>  The fact is, Jesus does not care if you call him Joshua.  It is what you THINK of Jesus that matters, and more importantly than that, it is what you DO with YOUR life that matters.  God knows every intent in the heart and mind, nothing is hidden, all is transparent.  God has one million names, every one of them are correct names.<br>  The word "God" is just one of those.  And no matter what God is called, we are all referring to the One True God.  So Jesus doesn't care if you call him Jesus, Jeshua, Jehova, or Jerry, for that matter.<br>  <br>  Move on to what is really important - your spiritual growth - God has heard every word ever spoken, and is impossible to offend.  If God were to be offended, this world long since would have been erased from the universe, all memory erased...yet the fact is, we are all still here, right?|`|spYpsixUaa	Great, first God's name is an offensive thing to speak aloud in the presence of Jews, and now Jesus' name is immaterial.

So what if your birth certificate says Jeffrey.  I won't call you what I call that Giraffe!<br>  <br>  It has everything to do with the connotations!  I know the name Joshua from the bible, and that's a very different persona!  Wouldn't you be offended if I decided to start calling you Jeffrey instead of Jeff only because I started singing "I don't wanna grow up..." immediately afterward?  It's about the different connotations brought about by a different persona.

Buying 8 foot columns for what you want won't be cheap, and won't look how the designer wants.

They are essentially giant cardboard tubes, then you attach a base and a top for it. It will also have to be painted.  Have you scoured the space you are working in? Columns are something that would be kicking around, I would think. Is there another theater in your town that has columns you can borrow? Just keep digging around.
AA11442722	Actually Stalin facilitated the eventuality of any Socialistic society. <br>  <br>  To make everybody equal is to reduce everybody to the lowest common denominator. To take the least intelligent and least talented and reduce everybody to the possible aspirations of those people. Stalin did exactly that for most people. Yet there was still the elite, instead of money the elite was defined by what job they did. Cosmonaughts, artists, musicians, Gov officials, etc became the new elite. <br>  <br>  The corruption became rampant as Socialism concentrates power by it's very design. "Everybody works for the good of the whole" has a big gotcha. Most jobs suck. As such somebody has to choose who does what. Who gets more education and becomes scientists and doctors. Those who are chosen by a select group of elite, who are of course then targets of bribes and blackmail. Shoes, gas, cars, where you live all assigned to you. Those resources controlled by a very tiny group of people. Can you think of a better way to create corruption? <br>  <br>  Thats the thing, Socialism is a fertile bed for corruption. Ideal conditions really. So the corruption that marked the Soviet regime was an inevitable side effect of the high level of Socialism. <br>  <br>  As for Stalin's genocide, that is not directly connected to Marxism. Genocide is also inevitable in Communist societies but Stalin instituted it for petty reasons well before it was necessary. <br>  <br>  The reason genocide is inevitable with Communism is simple. By diverting so many people into the management of resources and people you create a system that lives on much thinner margions. The thinner the margions the less that society can afford dissidents. Each person dissenting and or who is doing their own thing takes resources away from the rest. The society cannot afford people who divert resources from the "common good". If a shoe maker instead of Brown shoes makes Blue shoes then there is a shortage of Blue dye. That means something meant to be painted blue for easy identification isn't and problems result. So dissidents cannot be tolerated. Esculating punishments produce hardened rebellion which eventually leaves only the labor/death camps that the Soviets used through the entire existance of the USSR. No Communist nation has been able to function without such Gulags. <br>  <br>  So yes, the USSR is what you get when you have Communism.|`|d9f63360c00901d3fe28d35b4e974c71aa	Absolutely. Problem was, some were more "equal" than others.  (e.g. party officials) Most everyone worked for the good of the whole (Read: Those more equal) whether they wanted to or not.<br>  <br>  Like Yakov Smirnoff was quoted to say "you didn't join the party, The party joined you"<br>  <br>  P.S. Only two major world leaders in recent history were so ruthless as to carry a handgun and personally assassinate rivals when in office. Stalin and Edi Armin Dada|`|akvrwpywaa	Hahahahahahaha.

Stalin was one of Lenin's cohorts, and after Lenin's death stuffed it up completely.<br>  Many countries tried to introduce Marxist ideas with little, if any success.

But Stalin was JUST a dick.|`|yHaGnT4gaa	yes he believes in communisim|`|C1pieKaDaa	do your own damn homework|`|4nhkC9qYaa	Stalin changed marxist-leninist Ideals to a different current of marxism called stalinism, which created two different classes an elite (politburo and communist party members) and another proletariat (everyone else), his cult of personality around an absolute dictator, and repression of political opponents (which expanded the gulags). I would argue that Stalin did not create equality or works that were good for the whole. The politburo and communist party members more often received better education, food, and perks. The communist party itself became an elite class, where only a small subset of the population was included. Party members would shop at well stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, dachas, holiday resorts, and even prestigious jobs. The theory of aggravation of class struggles under socialism, dictates that there must be a constant suppression of political enemies. Stalin's policies put many innocents in gulags or work camps. By Stalin's death as many as 2.5 million people were in the Gulag system. Nothing was equal about his society, and nothing was good for the whole either.|`|sunEk8NVaa	In order to properly answer this question, we have to ask what did Karl Marx want?<br>  <br>  <br>  Karl Marx proposed a utopian society where, just like you mentioned, everyone is equal and works for the common good. This is what Lenin had in mind when he launched the Russian Revolution in 1917. But there are some things that don't seem to fit with Lenin's ideas. First of all, Marx wanted a communist "world" not a communist "state". One of his definitions of communism, along with being "classless"  is "stateless". Karl Marx also proposed on a society that is not simply classless but where absolute equality is achieved. No one is higher than the other. Marx was a bit of an anarchist. After all, if there is a government, how can there be pure, absolute equality? Lenin on the other hand believed that Russia should be led by a group of revolutionaries. He believed in "Democratic Centralism" which is where ideas are made from the bottom then sent to the top where it will be voted upon. The people at the bottom cannot join in the voting. This is in direct contrast with pure Marxism. That's why there is another term for Lenin's ideas- Marxism-Leninism. <br>  <br>  Stalin, being a follower of Lenin, adopted Lenin's ideas while throwing in some of his own which eventually led to Stalinism which is basically authoritarianism to the extreme. So, in short, Stalin did not follow pure Marxism.

AA10303012	The war in Viet Nam tended to "polarize" the American public.  That is to say that one was either a "hawk " or a "dove"......either pro war or anti war, with no in between, one couldnt have been neutral about it.<br>  <br>  When the war started, in the early 60s, most people believed what the government was telling them, that the US had to take a stand against communism in Southeast Asia.  The common belief was that we let Hitler get too far before we tried stopping him, and we had to stop communism before it got too far.  We tended to accept this as truth as it seemed to make sense.<br>  <br>  But as the war progressed, more and more people started questioning the rationale of sending so many American boys to their deaths in a conflict which didnt really make a lot sense.  At first the anti war people were far outnumbered and were considered anti American for not supporting our efforts there.  The war dragged on for what seemed like forever.  It was the first time in history that the fighting on the battlefield was broadcast into our homes via the television, and we could actually see what it was like.  Anti war sentiment continued to grow, more and more people started becoming doves and protested the war.<br>  <br>  All in all, the American public was split on the issue, and hostilities grew between the two groups, tension was rising, protestors were being arrested by police while the "law and order" establishment stood firm on its "America, love it or leave it" platform.<br>  <br>  There was no middle ground in this conflict between the opposing sides.

j5Apt8hWaa	Most of the shots taken using long shutter speeds is done at night or under low light conditions.  If you are attempting to do this during the day, you will need to take those shots into the shade and maybe even need to add an ND filter.  Any photos taken at shutter speeds slower than 125th second, needs to have the camera attached to a tripod to prevent camera movement if 1) you are not using a lens with IS or VR or 2) have not been hand holding cameras under low light at slow shutter speeds successfully for years ... subject movement will still be a factor at long shutter speeds.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Put the camera on the manual mode (M) and turn the wheel until you get to five seconds.

z7lg0l7xaa	It all depends on what monologue you are performing.  However, you still do not want to always stand in one spot.  It bores the judges to death. (unless of corse you are auditioning for a robot or inanimate objects) And yes, pick a spot in the back of the room to look at when you are performing your audition piece.  The more you stay focused on that spot the more real and believable you look.  From feedback from my Actor's Studio teacher, she said that when you focus on one spot and stay calm the judges will focus on you more.  But don't whatever you do, stand in a quarter position.  It annoys the heck out of the judges, they want to see YOU not anything else.   And don't point to yourself, ugh, they don't like that. Show them through your monologue and feelings, not through your hands.   <br>  <br>  If you don't know how to block, sometimes it might work if you start center stage and and take a step to the left and the right to make it look natural, but don't pace. That also gets annoying.  Don't let your eyes wander, focus on one point or you won't be focused on.<br>  <br>  If you need a chair ask for a chair, and if you need to stand, stand.  Try to practice the blocking before you perform, it always makes you more confident performing. practice makes perfect!<br>  <br>  AND!! Take this advice. My class was visited by an actor from New York and what bugs him is the whole, "Come in stand flip the hair thing."  Please if you can help it, do not flip your hair, play with your hair, tug at you clothes, and the what not.  The judges see it all the time! They don't like it.  <br>  <br>  Smile the judges like that when you come in! But all in all have fun doing monologues.  Do what comes natural to you, without looking fake.<br>  <br>  Sorry about such a long list...My whole class gets picked on for a few of these.<br>  <br>  Hoped it helped at least a little.|`|AbSizeNBaa	Rehearse a LOT at home so that you are comfortable with the piece you will probably have a better feel for what kind of blocking to do if you understand the monologue|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0PU1gbDlaU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0PU1gbDl...</a>|`|cqDsR7gqaa	Most Casting Directors will tell you that auditioning actors never MOVE enough.  They just stand in one spot and recite.  CDs love it when you move around.. Walk to a chair, sit down, stand up again.. Anything so long as its appropriate to the monologue.<br>  <br>  A few tips.. Stay at least 10 feet away from the CDs table so as not to make them feel uncomfortable.  Never look at them when doing your monologue, instead pick a point on the 4th wall (behind the casting director's heads) and use that to focus your eyes.  To make eye movement natural, pick 2 spots.  And the only question that's appropriate to ask during an audition is "Am I in the light?"  That's if they're using only a few lights when you audition but make sure to be in it if its there.. They want to be able to see you!|`|kqCvVx1Saa	i love to use emphasized and appropriate movement when doing monologues. its very fun and keeps the audience interested :)|`|BIweLR4raa	move ur hands as if ur acting the part in ur monologues<br>  keep ur eyes on a spot wat WILL NOT make u laugh and loose concentration|`|AaCw0HV0aa	I act at the Houston Academy of Dramatic Arts, and the director there, Michelle Coopwood, is best friends with the director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He came in town, and I attended a seminar that he gave. He said that when you come into the room you shouldn't turn your back to the people who are interviewing you EVER. When you shake their hand, make sure not to bend over the table that they are sitting at. After that, just stand still, with your chin up, to show confidence. Don't move around, or mess with your hair or jewelry. Don't put your hand in your pockets, or do anything disrespectful.

6wGkycFAaa	The Jewish people have been abused by other cultures since the beginning of time. As for Hitler, there are several ideas about the reasons behind his hatred of the Jews. One idea was that his mother was treated by a Jewish doctor and she died. While I have never heard that he was responsible, that doesn't mean Hitler didn't hold him responsible. The second was because the Jews owned a great deal of the businesses and land and the German's didn't. It was a matter of pride for Hitler. They were in Germany and the Jews owned most businesses, land, ran most levels of government, etc... As far as he was concerned, they had taken over and the German's were taking a back seat in their own country. It was a horrible time and he was a sick and demented individual.|`|AA12095483	Sorry, but I really can't understand your question.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel The Lord of the Rings by the English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It takes place in the fictional universe Middle-earth. It was originally published on July 24, 1954 in the United Kingdom. The volume consists of a Prologue "Concerning Hobbits, and other matters" followed by Book I and Book II.<br>  <br>  Characters within Tolkien's works consider Hobbits to be a separate race from Men, but Tolkien made it clear that they are actually an offshoot of the race of Men; they and the "Big Folk" are far more closely related to each other than to either Elves or Dwarves. Thus Hobbits are among the Younger Children of Eru Ilúvatar and are the result of the same act of creation as Men. This would imply that Hobbits have the Gift of Men to pass entirely beyond Arda, which also means that the avoidance of the Gift of Men in Hobbits, like in Men, can be physically and morally destructive. Sméagol, who had originally been a Hobbit, was transformed into the monster Gollum by a combination of the evil of the One Ring and the resulting avoidance of the Gift of Men. Bilbo Baggins became "thin and stretched" from the immortality that the One Ring granted to him, since neither Men nor Hobbits are intended for immortality in this world. Men and Hobbits appear to have the same spiritual nature.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Fellowship_o...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/fel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/fel/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/fellowship/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/fellowship...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/TheFellowshipoftheRing/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/TheFellowshipo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/fellowship/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a>|`|Pnh6Vlzyaa	That whole movie.

aUtBNzLUaa	The printing press was inevitable, but if it didn't, then probably no. THe printing press was responsible for making books like the bible cheap enough for everyone to afford, those from the high up to the low class could read and then begin to think for themselves. it help develop a thrust for knowledge, enlightenment, and started getting people involved because we could now be informed of what was going on in our world, or at least our part of it.

What is interesting about the show was that Judy was inspired by all the women in history who had made influential impacts on humanity--and the way they were often written out of history, or had their parts downplayed. What she did was to find significant female figures in history and for each of them she created a plate that symbolized that particular woman. <br>  <br>  I included some links so you can check it out if you're interested.|`|qfGXtF5taa	I know that back in the Middle Ages it was practically a sin to paint The Virgin Mary in anything but blue.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Life in Ancient Egypt' Eugen Strouhal writes:<br>  <br>  'It needs to be stressed that until the Late Period Egypt had nothing like a market economy with prices set by supply and demand, or independent merchants operating a money system.  The state machine simply collected most of what was produced and rationed it out to non-producers.<br>  <br>  This system was supplemented by the bartering of goods, either informally between individuals, or at market stalls in the towns and larger villages.  Farmers customarily traded their surplus crops and farmstock, and artisans part of their corn ration and their home products such as furniture, coffins, wooden statuetetes etc, and ireturn for livestock, oil, food, clothing, walking-sticks and the like.  Employees of the king and dignitaries and temple staff (including artisans) were glad to take on other work in return for payment in kind - bread, beer, clothing or whatever.<br>  <br>  Despite this non-monetary system of direct exchange, values were expressed in a comparable unit, the shat, originally denoting a flat silver disc (silver having been more precious than gold until the 18th dynasty).  <br>  <br>  Because of the barter economy the shat itself was not in current use, but the word was needed to express values in contracts and bookkeeping. During the New Kingdom it corresponded to 7.5 or 7.6 g of silver.  The next higher unit, by a factor of 12, was the deben (90-91g of silver).  At the end of the 18th dynasty, a goat, for example, cost half a shat, a cow 8, a bedstead 4 and a house 10.  A male slave could be bought for 7 deben of silver, a girl-slave for 4.  <br>  <br>  During the New Kingdom free trade began to emerge between Egypt and the more advanced regions of the Middle East, instead of commerce being a royal monopoly.  Scenes from teh tomb of Quenamun, the harbourmaster of Thebes, show goods being taken on board by Syrian merchants.  Egypt's main export was grain, but also included cloth, parchment and dried fish.  The country received in turn copper from Cyprus, timber from the Middle East, metal ware from the Aegean, myrrh from the Land of Punt, and ebony, ivory, cattle and exotic animals from the south.  Crete and the Middle East supplied weapons and other military equipment.  Internal trade also increased as a consequence, the 20th-dynasty Lansing Papyrus enthusing "Merchants sail upstream and downstream, eager to convey goods from one place to another, and to supply whatever is needed anywhere."  There are more and more frequent records of commercial deals sworn under oath before the courts.'|`|LdMixoe2aa	This seems to be a pretty comprehensive website about what was traded during the Pharonic era<br>  <a href="http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/trade/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/trad...</a><br>  <br>  It's the best I could find.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	In the Early Period, bartering, the exchange of services or goods for chattels, was most common.<br>  <br>  In the Late Period, coins had been invented, and so this was money. Coins, right up until very recently (within the last 100 years), were normally made wholly, or partially, of a precious metal. The value of the coin was contained in the metal the coin was made of (such as gold, which is universally still recognised as money.) With coins made of gold or silver, there is no real need for a central bank to store gold as security, as it is now, used to guarantee the value of paper money, which is technically worthless.

gIzJaGTZaa	Lord of the rings is way more epic<br>  twilight is the most romantic<br>  i feel the same about harry potter|`|0fEBJinjaa	I'm not a fan of Twilight. Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are both genius, though. Oh, I know that Harry Potter is technically for children/teenagers, but J.K. Rowling writes so well, and she tied all the strands of the plot in brilliantly. I love HP, lol. And LotR, well, you just can't get past it.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Lord of the Rings is a cornerstone of the entire fantasy genre. Three quarters of fantasy books that are published now borrow ideas from Tolkien. The man truly was a genius.<br>  <br>  Twilight loses for sure, it is, I can honestly say the worst book I have ever read<br>  Bella: I love you Edward<br>  Edward: I love you too you are so beautiful<br>  Bella: No YOU are so beautiful. I love you. You're all sparkly<br>  Edward: You are the most perfect creature ever<br>  1000 pages and 3 books later<br>  Bella: I love you Edward<br>  Edward: I love you you are so beautiful<br>  Bella: No YOU are so beautiful. I love you. You're all sparkly and now we have a mutant child together HORRAY!<br>  OMFG it's just them proliferating their love for each other for 1000+ pages. And right at the end Smeyer is like JESUS CHRIST I NEED PLOT and throws some crap in.<br>  <br>  Ok Edward is not hot. He is a creepy stalker. he watches her sleep. He won't let her see her friends. He follows her around. He won't let her drive. He beats her up while they're having sex. He gives her a c-section with his teeth. Come on that's gross. Bella is disgusting, falling apart as soon as Edward leaves and only getting some semblance of togetherness back when she finds another guy to take Edward's place. PATHETIC.<br>  <br>  It seems only tween girls with half a brain enjoy twilight. Every single one of my friends hates Twilight. Thinks it's absolutely ridiculous, the writing is terrible, the characters one dimensional and the plot cliche. We're 18. My sister, who is 13 is in love with Twilight. So are all her friends. They get together and talk about it and how 'awesome' it is and 'how much they love Edward' and how they 'just wish Jacob would die'. Basically Twilight is aimed for girls 12-16. <br>  <br>  Smeyer writes likes she's swallowed a thesaurus and apparently doesn't know the meaning of Purple Prose. And she repeats the same phrases over and over and over again. Chagrin chagrin chagrin. STFU. Her books are riddled with plot holes and discrepancies. How can Edward, who has been dead for nearly 100 years, have sperm, which is alive, and has the capability to father a child. Yeah makes awesome sense. And how can that child even exist. It's not scientifically possible for someone to have 23 chromosomes. It results in down syndrome. Obviously the stupid mormon doesn't believe in proven scientific fact. Or just doesn't research her books<br>  <br>  Ok and every single character in Twilight is one dimensional. <br>  Bella: Pathetic Mary Sue<br>  Edward: I love you Bella. And the oldest virgin ever<br>  Jacob: annoying.<br>  And that's it. That's all the major characters. If you include like Emmett and Jasper and Alice. They don't even have personalities. Alice is just constantly jumping around "horray i just had a vision that we'll all live happily ever after".The best one, in my opinion is Rosalie. Or Jasper. In that movie he looked constipated the entire time. Did he even say anything?<br>  <br>  I hate the way Bella is supposed to be an average girl, with faults. As far as I can tell her only fault is being "clumsy" which everyone seems to find endearing so isn't really a fault at all. And what's with her supposed to be average looking? yeah ok coz it's not like every guy in the school wants to be in her pants apparently. At my high school all the guys went for the average girl, definitely. She looks basically the same as Stephenie meyer would look. Except 50kg lighter. Lol at her photoshopping her fatness away. But this girl is supposed to be a role model. She completely falls apart when Edward leaves her and only pulls herself back together when she's found another man to replace him. It's pathetic. She has no independence or goals. She just wants to be with Edward forever, regardless of the consequences to herself and everyone around her. <br>  <br>  And EDWARD. Apparently the man of every girls dreams? Why because he's pretty. Hey maybe it's just me but I'd be a bit freaked out if my boyfriend started to sparkle. I love the fact that he hasn't got chisseled abs. I've grown up learning that you love a person for who they are, not what they look like. Yet in relation to love, the only thing that Bella ever describes is Edward's looks. Great example for all the kids out there. You look at his personality and you realise he's a stalker. He follows her around, watches her sleep, won't let her see her friends, won't let her drive. He controls her completely and people find this romantic! During sex he beats her black and blue and again, his regret is seen as romantic. He gives her a c-section with his teeth and again, oh so romantic, I would swoon if this happened to me.<br>  <br>  Stephen King, best selling author for decades said on Twilight and its comparison to Harry Potter: <br>  "The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn," he said. "She's not very good."<br>  <br>  <br>  So really for me, it's between LotR and Harry Potter. <br>  In my opinion Lord of the Rings is better written. I mean it's an epic classic, maybe in time Harry Potter will have the same standing, but for now Lord of the Rings would win for quality. Tolkien is an absolute genius. I read lord of the rings 8 times one year. Needless to say I'm a HUGE lord of the rings fan.<br>  <br>  However I liked Harry Potter more. Harry Potter was an integral part of my growing up, I've loved it since I was 9, nothing can replace that. I made life long friendships through my obsession. I was always the first person in line for a release. I loved the suspense and anticipation. Harry Potter has created it's own separate subculture which I am proud to be a part of. I think Rowling is a modern day genius, with the foreshadowing, backstory and research intwined throughout the entire series. She's inspired millions of kids to read and to get up from in front of the TV. A massive feat if ever there was one.<br>  Just out of interest, why do you have a grudge against Harry Potter? I mean you're free to. I have a grudge against Twilight, it's my prerogative. I'm just interested in hearing your reasons.|`|S4W7FojCaa	HP and Twilight are nothing compared to the genius mind of Tolkien.

There are lots of writers out there that are not getting the kind of recognition they deserve because number one, they do not know where to turn to to get their stories across and number two, not everybody has the same level of thinking that they have - which of course results to them turning the book down.<br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>  <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start. It is best if you send in the entire manuscript and should not worry about protection because publishers have an agreement to not use your material without your consent.<br>  <br>   You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books.

ceBTTCPwaa	Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980), commonly known simply as Jean-Paul Sartre, was a French existentialist philosopher, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the leading figures in 20th century French philosophy.<br>  <br>  The basis of Sartre's existentialism can be found in The Transcendence of the Ego. To begin with, the thing-in-itself is infinite and overflowing. Sartre refers to any direct consciousness of the thing-in-itself as a "pre-reflective consciousness." Any attempt to describe, understand, historicize etc. the thing-in-itself, Sartre calls "reflective consciousness." There is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, and so reflection is fated to a form of anxiety, i.e. the human condition. The reflective consciousness in all its forms, (scientific, artistic or otherwise) can only limit the thing-in-itself by virtue of its attempt to understand or describe it. It follows, therefore, that any attempt at self-knowledge (self-consciousness - a reflective consciousness of an overflowing infinite) is a construct that fails no matter how often it is attempted. Consciousness is consciousness of itself insofar as it is consciousness of a transcendent object.<br>  <br>  The same holds true about knowledge of the "Other." The "Other" (meaning simply beings or objects that are not the self) is a construct of reflective consciousness. One must be careful to understand this more as a form of warning than as an ontological statement. However, there is an implication of solipsism here that Sartre considers fundamental to any coherent description of the human condition. Sartre overcomes this solipsism by a kind of ritual. Self consciousness needs "the Other" to prove (display) its own existence. It has a "masochistic desire" to be limited, i.e. limited by the reflective consciousness of another subject. This is expressed metaphorically in the famous line of dialogue from No Exit, "Hell is other people."<br>  <br>  The main idea of Jean-Paul Sartre is that we are, as men, "condemned to be free." This theory relies upon his atheism, and is formed using the example of the paper-knife. Sartre says that if one considered a paper-knife, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because, there is no Creator. Thus: "existence precedes essence". So, and just for that, the sartrian man with his freedom will became a god, but he remain always only a bankrupt god.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre#Thought" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_S...</a>

Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html</a>

Unfortunately, these (and I've tried them) typically ignore where the ACCENT of the word falls, and that is critical to rhyming.<br>  <br>  Ordinarily the rhyme must begin with the vowel of the last accented syllable, so in this case it must include '-in-'. So most of the words you are getting will not work at all. True, in some circumstances you might be able to use "mattress" as a sort of rhyme for "princess", but it would not even be considered a very bood 'near rhyme'.<br>  <br>  Now, so far I assume (and I guess others do to) that you are using the common American pronunciation of the word. In fact, if you were pronoucing it with the final syllable accented (prinCESS) there COUNTLESS words that would rhyme iwith it (though not 'countless'! or the other words that have been suggested that accent the preceding syllable). That might still be of use to you IF you are using a type of verse that allows more flexibiliity with which syllablle you accent. You might, for instance, find it pefectly suitable for a limierick beginning "There once was a pretty princess' (whose accent pattern practically forces you to accent the last syllable).<br>  <br>  But it you're not free to do that, you'll have to look at using the closest 'near rhyme' you can managie. Rather than just list words, I'll try to describe a way of going about this, as set of things you may try, in decreasing order (roughly) of preference, with some examples:<br>  <br>  1) Try a word that INCLUDES all the sounds you would need for a perfect rhyme (-incess), but has additional sounds that don't match, and preferably aren't 'highlighted' (don't 'draw attention to themselves'). In this case, one of the best rhymes (though likely not very suitable for what you want to say!) has already been mentioned: "incest" whose additional 't' doesn't do much harm. Along the same line, but a bit better (if not that handy) would be "insets" or "incense". Adding more sounds (and getting a bit further away): insects, inspects, interest(s), instance<br>  <br>  2) Look for words that match all the sounds but one, or (slightly less desriable) match all but one sound AND add as few and unobtrusive extra sounds as possible (as with #1):<br>  a) first preference is to drop or change the medial/transtional sound (the "c') -- in other words, the sounds that most stand out in this word (for rhyming purposes) are -in- and -ess. (If you make a substitution, the closer the soun is to the "c" the better -- cf. #3)<br>  this might lead to things like: thinness, slimness, skinless, winless, sinless (or don't forget two word phrases like "sin less")<br>  b)the same thing, with added sounds: 'pinkness', 'interest, ''inference, 'tin fence' ?! 'interest', 'inlets'<br>  [note tha /f/ is a pretty close substitute for /s/, as would the /th/ sound in words like 'thick', but I can't think of any words that would use that here!]<br>  <br>  3) For the 'most important' sounds (the 'in' and 'ess' mentioned above) -- look for words that substitute a sound very CLOSE to ONE of these sounds (occasionally for more): for the vowels, short e and short i are almost interchangeagle so 'en' for 'in' and 'iss' for 'ess' could work); /m/ will work in place of /n/, for the final -ess, you might use -eth or /ez/ (though spelled "es" the final sound is voiced, that is it becomes the /z/ sound). Do note that the /e/ in this /ez/ is a short e, and NOT the totally unaccentd, back of your throat sound (called the schwa sound) that you find not in "princess" but in "princes" . Since when that happens the syllable is almost swallowed, it doesn't work very well rhytmically (which is why 'minces' may not work as well as you'd like):<br>  a) without any other changes. Example: census<br>  b) also using the procedures in #1 or 2 above (changing middle consonant, adding sounds)<br>  Examples: simplest, temptress, IMpress (the noun, not the verb imPRESS), senseless, defenseless, tenseness<br>  <br>  4) Finally, try to match the VOWELS in the rhyme syllables exactly or as closely as possible (=assonance), and change the final consonants as little as possible (better the 'n' than the 's' !).<br>  a) with no other changes. Example: ellipsis<br>  b) with other changes described in #1-3. Example: existence, insistence, mistress; more of a stretch: isthmus, Christmas, distance, insistence (though here again we run into the same problem as "minces", that the final vowel sound AND it accent do not match 'princess')|`|6wGkycFAaa	I'm not sure what the hell Shandi is going on about because I disagree and was bored to tears.

kr34vLJkaa	I would guess that you have an assignment with this as the topic.  Below is a link you might find helpful.<br>  I suppose at issue here is that you were not around to be influenced by anything in the 60s, and I wasn't born until the late sixties.  So, anything that you or I will come up with will be based on the histories.<br>  When I see his work, and what I know of that period, I think, "Far out, man."<br>  That period in our history was a breaking out of traditional molds.  And, this breaking out was far reaching:<br>  Civil Rights<br>  Free Thinking<br>  Free Love<br>  Protests<br>  a basic "I will be self determined."<br>  an unpopular war<br>  Clinton in Canada not inhaling pot<br>  McCain a prisoner or war<br>  all basically coalescing into a rebellious generation.  The BABY boomers in their teens and twenties.<br>  This is the time when our country's identity changed.  For good or bad, and Kaprow designed his stage and photographed it.  Now we study it.  Do you see the change in his work.  He was like a producer in a play.<br>  I don't know if he influenced it as much as rode the wave of change.  What was happening was so much bigger than him.  Just as what is happening now is so much bigger than any one of us.|`|A2cNK3Lgaa	okk girl.. i suggest you search yahoo or google and that crap. and type in "art in the 60's" or "Alan Kaprow" and it'll help alot muchie.. lol kk byeee hun☆☆☆

Writing is a skill that arguably is never truly mastered, but skills (I think) are relative to age.<br>  I find that I work well when I'm given constructive criticism. If you don't want to hear the ways I think that your friend could improve your piece, you're not obligated to keep reading. <br>  I'm going to assume your friend is in her early teens. This piece needs a lot of technical work.<br>  Firstly, structure. It's a daunting lump of text as it is. But with some paragraphing it could be a lot more approachable. Just think in terms of new topic-new paragraph.<br>  Secondly, there is no discernible voice or sense of identity. This could be fixed through introducing us more to the character - how old is she? is she loud? quiet? rude? Does she like bugs? Simple things can really give a story a whole new dimension.<br>  Thirdly - CLICHE. The topic you've chosen is a total cliche. Writing is always going to the product of outside influences, but it should also reflect on you and your experiences. This gives it a uniqueness which will help it stand up on it's own. For instance, WHY did the character go down the alleyway? Don't just say 'against all rational thinking'. Give a motivation for the action and this will in turn give depth to your piece.<br>  <br>  You've maintained a constant tense throughout the piece, which is good. You've also created a nice sense of tension, which I think shows real talent.<br>  <br>  I think with further study and practice you've definitely got a future as a writer :) Read as much as you can, attend workshops, enter into competitions would be my advice.|`|UI6vdCrWaa	yer its interesting but i think she should definately have more descriptions to every scene. she gets to the point straight away, try describing every scene it makes the reader more interested and gives them a vivid image in their head of the story

n843aGrEaa	To be born.<br>  This is the first and most obvious step.<br>  <br>  To live.<br>  Slightly less obvious. To me, truly living is simply allowing ourselves to fall victim to "human" emotions. Joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, etc.<br>  <br>  To question. <br>  We are blessed with the gift of reason and are obligated to use it. To do this, we must ask the hard questions and admit that we know nothing. Only then can we find wisdom.<br>  <br>  To die. <br>  The easiest step with the hardest explanation. I won't even attempt to explain this. It for each human to figure out for them self, what it means to die. Perhaps THAT is the human experience - complete only when we've discovered what's on the other side.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I reread the question. What we have that "no one" else has is the ability to ask that very question. Do you think cats ask themselves what happens when they die?

To us, all the things we sense have other meanings. When you see a tree, instead of just seeing a tree, you can also see something that can be used for wood to light a fire, or paper for writing a story, or timber to build a home. You can speculate about the age of the tree, and think about how it was once a mere seed and has grown into what it currently is. You can think about what kind of things have happened to the tree in the past, what kinds of animals have climbed it? What sorts of weather has it endured? How much longer will it stand? There are so many possible ways to think about what you can sense around you instead of just being aware of it's existence.<br>  <br>  Language - While some animals have ways of communicating with others, they are vastly limited compared to human language. We can take things that people have never seen before and use words and symbols to put the image in their head. We can share all sorts of ideas, emotions and concepts by talking about them with another person. People are given the opportunity to be aware of things that they have never once been in contact with in any way. How many animals can visualise a place, animal or object they have never seen based purely on description?|`|AA12156928	A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.<br>  <br>                                                         George Bernard Shaw<br>  <br>   To err once and learn is experience, but to err repeatedly is to invite ridicule and scorn but not mercy or support|`|2JerJwCcaa	Humans can think.

This isn't to say that all we do is simply for the amusement of others, only that interpersonal relationships are, at their roots, based on the "performances" that we give every time we open our mouths or go out in public. We cannot help but hide behind the masks we develop as we grow older, living in constant fear of rejection, failure, uncertainty, et cetera. We filter all we say and do, subconsciously, based on how we think others will perceive these things.

crZg76Hpaa	Ah, you're lucky my friend. I'm a history major as well and have just written a paper on this myself!<br>  <br>  Now, he argues a point that is true, but has been debated against. Pretty much the Japanese justified their conquest of Asia as a "Liberation Mission" against Western hegemony. They used this view to justify the occupation of South-East Asian countries that they occupied. <br>  <br>  This seems good, however it was just a cover up for Japan to go into these countries and exploit them for their economic needs (Japan had little oil and rubber which it needed to sustain it's military). In conjunction with the West being Hostile to Japan; the Japanese felt it was imperative to capture these countries' resources if it were to sustain itself as a world power amongst the Western Nations.<br>  <br>  Anyways, people also justify Japanese Imperialism as liberation from the West, which in part is true. However the Japanese occupation was more brutal than the West. Japanese were racist and undermined local cultures they established themselves over. Implemented their politics as superior and exploited and oppressed the Asian people they were considered to be liberating. Overall, the "Japanese Liberation" was false and was just a cover up for the Japanese to exploit South-East Asia AND rather than Japan liberating South-East Asian from the West, the JApanese simply replaced the West's rule with a more brutal one; therefore South-East Asia become liberated from a fading Japanese Empire rather than from the West being kicked out.|`|PUiPeJqVaa	Japan had always wanted to become a superpower..<br>  and wanted to take control over Asia Pacific as well as the whole Asia if they see a chance. The US however, has already established control on the majority of the territories in the Pacific, and Japans aims to gain supremacy in the region would mean conflict with the Americans.<br>  Taking control over korea, taiwan, the philippines and other southeast asian countries would make it easier for them to achieve their plans (including the attack on the Pearl Harbor during WW2)
941fa81e87eff57b91b425e22082ba49aa	for imperialism basically countries were expanding and rolling over other countries which pissed them off and for militarism countries thought they could avoid war by building up there army an was used as an intimidation factor more then anything else, also the alliance system played a big part in all that by if one country got attacked the allies would have to back them up which started WWI<br>  <br>  now do your own homework

The federal government introduces a tight money policy in order to control credit.|`|lvyEnAtAaa	The first was the absence of any meaningful regulation to prevent abuses by insiders.  This meant that the markets were corrupted internally, which made them vulnerable.<br>  <br>  Another was the simple law of gravity.  Things can only go so high before reality brings them back.  Investors were paying absurd prices beyond the actual worth of the stocks and bonds, and once reality set in they could only recover actual value.  Given that they were all dealing on credit and maxed out they had no reserves to support them when their loans came due.<br>  <br>  Third, and this is a big one, the culture of "profit taking" is actually that of failing to reinvest.  Corporations have infrastructure as much as countries do.  If they do not reapply some their profits to the production plant they lose their ability to compete.<br>  <br>  These are causes of the 1929 crash.  They are causes of today's crash.<br>  <br>  Look up the South Seas Bubble of the 1700s.  It was the biggest of its day.  We never seem to learn that the CEOs must be watched.|`|AA10303012	The main cause of the market crash was the excessive "buying on margin" done by so many speculators.  This was a system by which a buyer of a stock only paid for 10% of its value initially, and by the time the remaining balance was due to the broker, the value of the stock had risen by that much or more, so the buyer could then sell it back, pay off the broker what was owed, and pocket the difference.  So, you could buy $1000 worth of stock for $100, wait a few months, then sell the stock for $1200, pay off the broker his $900 , and pocket the balance of $300<br>  <br>  Pretty easy money making system, and it only costs you the 10% to do business.  Ofcourse there were many who were playing with hundreds of thousands and making money hand over fist.  It was a cash cow, a golden goose....at least until the value of the stock wouldnt rise, but you still owed the 90% balance to the broker.  The system broke down, stocks had gotten way overvalued, and traders couldnt pay their debts.  They had to sell other investments off in order to pay what they had owed,  and there was massive selling, causing the stocks value to plummet.  It was indeed a drastic situation.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, regarding another answerers comment on Kennedy.  He was not a short seller, he simply avoided the crash by cashing out all his holdings prior to the crash.  The story has it that while he was getting a shoeshine, the shoeshine boy asked Kennedy what stocks he recommended, so he could make some investments.  Kennedy reasoned that if  a shoeshine boy was investing in the market, that it was time to get out, which he did, and kept his fortune.|`|AA12097624	Fear, panic, short sellers.<br>  <br>  People had stocks on margin 10:100. For every $10 they bought in with they got $100 worth of stock. People even created dumb companies that made no money but whose value rose due to the enthusiasm for the stock market. <br>  <br>  The federal reserve tightened the money supply. Once people panicked it was like an avalanche it could not be stopped. <br>  <br>  The Short sellers with the foresight made heaps of money! The Kennedy's are one such example.|`|941fa81e87eff57b91b425e22082ba49aa	debt from lending to much money out to people who coulnt pay it back<br>  <br>  poor post war economy due to the US selling goods to europe while they were at war, which that market was lost after the war<br>  <br>  too much invested in the stock market so when the banks failed so did the country

RzbRRUOdaa	If you are writing a non-fiction, you need to get his permission.  But if you just base your fiction on a true-to-life story, you can go ahead and creatively write your book.<br>  <br>  Here's a site that provides information you might find useful to your publishing journey:<br>  <a href="http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...</a>|`|LVZdzPmpaa	You cannot reveal John's secrets in a book even though he himself shared the secrets with you. To do so might expose him to ridicule or harm, which constitutes libel.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, you cannot write about things that have the potential to embarrass or harm someone, even if the incident was public knowledge. For example, your neighbor has a drug and alcohol problem and is sent to rehab. Everybody in the neighborhood knows about it. Still though, you cannot write about it. Even if you were to fictionalize the incident, it still has the potential to cause problems.<br>  <br>  There are several sites that explain libel and slander. Compensation and/or permission are not key factors in avoiding difficulties.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/defamation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertlaw.com/library/persona...</a><br>  <br>  (Google for other sites.)<br>  <br>  Further, if you were to write such a book, a publisher would vet the manuscript for potential problems. Ultimately, that would be the final word on the subject.|`|pbw7chpyaa	"based on", this means you intend to take liberties with the facts.  You must change the names then, as you are writing fiction based in fact.<br>  <br>  If you mean to tell the factual story, double check that you can prove things, as lawsuits may follow.  Keep in mind, if you tell John's story, John might be a liar and other people may have strong opinions as to the real truth.<br>  <br>  However, you don't have to pay anyone anything for using their stories, unless you make just such an agreement ahead of time in return for their co-operation with your work.  Biographers don't pay their subjects, journalists don't pay their subjects, and even the writers for law & Order don't shell out cash for their ripped off storylines.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and exposing someone to ridicule or harm is not libel.  libel is a false statement.  Anyone who says different has never laughed at politics in his life.   As google puts it "a false and malicious publication printed for the purpose of defaming a living person "|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If your book is based on real life stories and you are using real names, real situations, etc, you might need to get his permission to use it. <br>  <br>  It might be best to just use his story and turn it into fiction. :)|`|dAyf0MJUaa	reference him.
