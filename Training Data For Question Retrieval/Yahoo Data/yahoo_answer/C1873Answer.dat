AA10162294	No. You should not use antivirus programs together because they will interfere with each other and will likely cause your computer to crash.|`|NObydQT1aa	You can of course. But the protection will be no better than a single AV, and system performance will suffer drastically.<br>  <br>  Two antivirus programs running at the same time is a very bad idea.

Typical file storage locations are in My Documents and the C:\Documents and Settings\<your login name> folder.

You'll always end up with a mess otherwise. <br>  <br>  Lots of new PCs now come with restore options, a cd or startup option like Hit F12 to enter recovery mode (when you first turn it on) so that might get it back to basics again, otherwise find a windows cd and bung it in.<br>  <br>  If you really care about the data ie selling the computer, use DBAN to wipe the whole drive before sending it away, or the best and my favourite way....drill through the middle of the hard drive so it cant ever be used again and put a new one in.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Don't know about every brand , but if you have HP there is system recovery.

McAfee and Norton are good and safe to use, Don't get Norton 360 it takes up alot of CPU and Ram off your PC, but before you format make sure u have a licence copy of Vista or else u are screwd. If you arn't sure which virus it is then the best is to talk to a licenced company like McAfee Support Team if you don't know.<br>  <br>  If you want to do it manually then you have to look in your "WINDOWS" folder. also in Run Program type "msconfig" then look under services and start up tabs, usually thats where i would start from. You can also look in your Registery too, but once you delete it you can't restore it, to get into your Registery program is again type "regedit" in the Run Program.<br>  <br>  My professional advice as home user is to get a licenced Anti-Virus program that isn't free and download the free ad-ware programs, they are good too.

zorYTX59aa	YOU DON'T NEED ANY DOWNLOADER. SOME PEOPLE ON YAHOO! ANSWERS <br>  ARE ACTUALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE WANTING TO "SUCKER" YOU INTO <br>  BUYING THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE --- which I find insulting <br>  since you cannot even access or watch videos. You already have Flash, so getting it <br>  again is certainly not the answer.<br>  <br>  It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens<br>  and players that are blank or all black. Thus, I recently spent<br>  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of<br>  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to surmise<br>  is that there is no definitive solution out there. However, there<br>  was one interesting factor in nearly everything I saw:...Firefox.<br>  <br>  A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to<br>  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same<br>  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly<br>  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-<br>  computerese" that I would not dream of recommending those<br>  potential fixes.<br>  <br>  However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible<br>  solutions, so check these out:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a Mac and are using Firefox, apparently logging<br>  out of YouTube restores everything.<br>  <br>  2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:<br>  go to → Tools → Quick Preferences → Edit Site Preferences<br>  → Network tab → Browser Identification → Identify as Firefox.<br>  <br>  3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a<br>  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).<br>  <br>  4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet <br>  connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote <br>  that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left <br>  corner of their browser screen.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you. <br>  If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,<br>  please feel free to type any of these into Google's search box:<br>  -- youtube "blank screen"<br>  -- youtube "blank player"<br>  -- youtube "blank box"<br>  -- youtube "black screen"<br>  -- youtube "black player"<br>  -- youtube "black box"<br>  <br>  If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise<br>  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird: <br>  Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary <br>  Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has <br>  solved 100's of people's YouTube problems, so why not yours.<br>  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options > Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  The only other ideas I can think of are Flash and Google Web<br>  Accelerator. The most recent versions of Flash are frustrating<br>  lots of YouTubers. Updates are typically good for only 1 thing: <br>  software conflicts.

XXLOMOjeaa	In my experience that would either be a fan or a hard drive. <br>  <br>  If your computer is still under warranty, use it :)<br>  <br>  If it is not, then you need to take off the side or open it up as the case may be, and locate where the sound is coming from. this will tell you what piece is making the noise and what to do about it. Is it coming from the top bottom, back, front, middle, etc.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Yeah, almost certainly a fan. Needs attention, if it fails it will cause big problems.<br>  <br>  Probably best to replace it, shouldn't cost much to have it done in a computer shop if you don't know how to do it. Case fans are very inexpensive, might cost a little more if its the CPU fan, especially if it's a modern, hi-spec CPU. Time-wise, about 15 minutes for someone who knows how to do it.|`|VQqsJgWaaa	Note that if you take up the cover yourself you'll lose the guarantee.Anyway if this doesn't matter look inside and try to clean the dust from the fans with a soft brush.|`|qV8ooIXPaa	Physical noises mean physical problems. Do you have a desktop or a laptop?<br>  If you have a desktop, it would mean that something is brushing up against the fan. <br>  It could also be a hard drive that is about to go bad, depending on the noise it's making. Or, it could be a disk in your optical drive that's not in there correctly. <br>  <br>  I don't recommend opening up your computer though, unless you know what you are doing.|`|CGfEZV45aa	your question is very sketchy. could you at least describe the noise? was it a beep, a clicking noise, a grinding sound, or a loud whine? I know this might sound funny but have you tried smelling the computer? if you smell anything like burning hair then take it into a PC repair shop, the power supply needs to be replaced. but really, a "weird noise" coming from your PC could mean anything. unless you provide more detail like what computer you have, what the model is, when you got it, or if it's a custom computer then give us the technical specification.|`|M0qbyACRaa	its a fan going bad.<br>  <br>  start by taking off the case cover and blowing it out.<br>  <br>  disconnect all wires, and dont touch the motherboard

tlBBwNwTaa	Unfortunately, for privacy reasons the answer is no. In regard to the person who said the top visitors app, it used to be possible to do that, however, the developer of the app met with facebook and they discussed the matter and decided to change it so that is not possible. You can not track who sees your profile so my best advice is to change your privacy settings in the top right corner of your screen so only your friends can see your profile in addition to withholding any cell phone home phone numbers, any sort of address and do not be specific with your status for example don't say: going to the fist street parade in New york city. Instead say something like going to the parade. Make sure you know who your friends are and be cautious when adding friends|`|vLLRONWTaa	I don't think so.

5Y5nZZTRaa	The history of broadband evolution shapes today's market. Hence why we're touching on it here.Significant migration of domestic internet connectivity from dialup to broadband started in year 2000 here in the UK.For the business user at that time, high speed internet connections were expensive dedicated leased lines that typically were the domain of larger businesses that had big budgets to spend on connectivity.Broadband options had been around since the late nineties with a few cable operators offering cost effective high speed connections. However, the options for small businesses and homes at the time were fairly limited with only sporadic availability of broadband connections. Getting a high speed connection at that time was a lottery of geographic location (i.e. one had to be within a particular catchment area of a Cable Company [CableCo]).<br>  Everything changed in late 2000 when British Telecom (BT) came to the market with its generic DSL products.<br>  <br>  Rather than BT retaining exclusive retail rights for DSL, it opened up a wholesale channel programme allowing Internet Service Providers (ISP)s to resell BT generic DSL products.There were (and still are) are two product types offered by BT wholesale:-<br>  <br>  DataStream <br>  IPStream <br>  <br>  The channel programme meant that BT could leverage sales and support of its broadband products via its reseller partners. This approach has proved to a highly effective means of matching the demand for broadband with the supply in the UK marketplace.<br>  BT have created DSL broadband as almost a tangible "commodity" whereby it is the producer / supplier and between it and the end customer is a supply chain. The model was (and still is):- Producer(BT) -> Wholesaler(BT) -> Retailer(ISP) -> Consumer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Evolution of Broadband Services<br>  Commercial and technical issues have changed the market in the last few years.As wholesale bandwidth has become cheaper due to technological advances, the prices for provision of DSL bandwidth have also fallen.<br>  <br>  With Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) now in full swing, ISPs are now free to install their own equipment in local BT infrastructure. With this new freedom, higher DSL speeds of up to 24Mbps are possible. Availability of these LLU based services is currently sporadic and mainly around large cities and towns.<br>  <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.broadband-help.com/articles/consumer/broadband_providers_in_the_UK/" rel="nofollow">http://www.broadband-help.com/articles/c...</a>|`|KFagjt8Jaa	it cost me 45 pound a month when was beta testing for Freeserve (now Orange, previously Wanadoo). speed was only 512kbps but it was fast compared with dial up
pUzJiMUcaa	Part of it depends on who owns the copyright...I may be wrong on this, but last I checked it was Warner behind the whole YouTube mess (I had a video muted, the letter I got was from them...also, I've read several articles on the topic...no mention of anyone but WMG).<br>  <br>  So, the way around it is to not use anything owned by Warner. People who have NOT been muted likely are not using something owned by WMG.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, only using part of the song doesn't work with the YouTube infractions. Heck, even COVERING the song can get you muted (one of the videos removed was a girl singing a christmas song, which Warner owned the rights to).<br>  <br>  The best you can do is write your representatives and join the fight for reasonable copyright laws. This kind of thing is getting out of control.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Disclaimers and credits make no difference.

AA11927200	The reason why you aren't seeing the background on your webpage is because the background image is located on your computer and you are using that location. That location is not on your website so it would never show. If someone else wanted to see the background they wouldn't be able to. You must upload the background image to somewhere on your website and then use that location for your website. Like if you have a website with a domain <a href="http://www.happypanda.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.happypanda.com</a> and you have a folder images for all images, you can upload the background image to the images folder and change the location of the background image to background="http://www.happypanda.com/im... panda.jpg"<br>  <br>  You can never use the location of an image that is on your computer.

They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before! "Note"Until you get your computer clean I would disable the AntiVirGuard It's a little sensitive and can drive you crazy with popups saying your computer is infected.<br>  I found a very good video by Matt Rizos that explains the whole prosess in detail so get out the popcorn and watch this video!<br>  Video:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdWes&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdW...</a><br>  Downloads:<br>  1.<a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/superantispywarefreevspro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Personal-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10322935.html?part=dl-10322935&subj=dl&tag=button&cdlPid=10986298" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe...</a><br>  <br>  I set up a couple of blogs to help people like yourself deal with viruses and other problems associated with them!

You might be infected by viruses and/or trojans.

AA10845522	According to MSI   "4 DIMMs w/ DDR 800+ up to 4GB " can be put on that motherboard. With a 4Gb max and 4 DIMMs total, then 1Gb per stick is the max.<br>  You can mix the speed of the RAMs, but it will run at the speed of the slowest RAM.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Your board supports up to 4 GBs of dual channel RAM @ 400, 533, 667 and 800MHz using 240-pin DDR2 (1.8v SDRAM DIMMs) in four slots so that means 1 GB per module (stick).<br>   <br>  You may need to adjust your memory setting in the BIOS for better system stability on some RAM.  Example: Kingston HyperX DDR2-800 PC-6400 operates at 2.0V, 4-4-4-12. For this reason, always check with RAM manufacturers for the specifications of high performance memory modules.<br>  <br>  If you add modules of 800MHz to the existing 533MHz, all the modules will sync down to 533MHz (the lowest speed) so you should replace ALL if you want 800MHz performance.<br>  <br>  They should all be 800MHz (or all 533MHZ) and same size of GB in the same color slots to achieve dual channel mode but as long as they are the same MHz, they don't need to be the same size of GB in different color slots. Example: That will work if you install one 1 GB 800MHz module in each of the green slots and one 512 MBs 800MHZ module in each of the orange slots.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps

IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|GxXpvNIwaa	The most common cause of computer freezes is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>   Often there is also spyware which is using your computer for nefarious purposes and slowing its operation.<br>  The answer is to scan your pc with a best anti-spyware to clean spyware/trojan/virus.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/reviews.htm</a>|`|AA10367307	Through my experience i think you might find it an hard ware issue like your hard drive or even your memory as these are the two main parts that can cause a pc to freeze up. hard drives do fail and quite easily too, try to reinstall all software then open pc and check your memory sticks aint loose by taking them out then replacing them untill you hear them click into place. check your hard drive light to see if it stays on when it freezes, if it does then its your hard drive. you can take the hard drive out and give it a bang,sometimes they do stick believe it or not. Goodluck|`|XXLOMOjeaa	Restoring should have fixed any software issues, but sometimes it doesn't go in properly.

Printing onto actetate with a conventional inkjet printer will yield results of varying degrees of transparency depending on which colour ink is use and at what coverage.

Make sure your NIC card is enabled and you have the necessary security setting (if needed) to connect to the internet.

edPeEGzmaa	I would go with Dell when it came to computers. Acer makes pretty good monitors and stuff for cheap, but when it comes to computers, I would stick with Dell or one of the other major brands. It's hit and miss, you could get a Dell that sucked and an Acer that was great, and vice versa. But I have a few friends who tried Acer laptops and had a lot of problems, whereas my dad's Dell laptop for work runs 24/7 and isn't rebooted for months at a time. It still runs stable.|`|FIG58FVpaa	I think it depends more on the specs of the computer you buy, than the brand name. I have a Dell and it's been treating me well for the past year...|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Acer! I have been a PROUD Acer owner for 5 years on the same computer. I have never had an issue with it and the worst thing that happened was when my brother accidentally recovered the computer. Dells on the other hand have a history of poor customer support and are made with low grade parts.|`|YK5Mg2wBaa	If you are going to choose from the 2 then Dell is by far the best. They are very well built and reliable. Especially if you want a laptop.|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	Both are retail companies, therefore both suck. The best brand is no brand, build a computer yourself and you'll save a LOT of money and get to customize every aspect of your system.|`|u99Z7uJQaa	I hate people saying apple is the best... wtf.... <br>  <br>  <br>  Like the one said before, it depends on what model what price the computer you are getting.|`|o72Ng7IRaa	There's really no great or worst laptop - depends of your price range. I do agree with the Dell choices. If for no other reason than the technical support. Acer's are also VERY reliable and inexpensive, but I question the quality of their tech support. Go with Dell you want something proven and backed by good support. It will also be easily upgradeable and will maintain a pretty high resale or trade value. Go with the Acer if you have some computer knowledge and are able to perform minimum hardware and software support yourself. Acer are relatively inexpensive and make very good starter laptops.|`|7XJPR10Waa	Acer is a good computer offered at a pretty nice price in comparison to many other models but Dell has additional features and capabilities that make it a better long term investment. Too many to really get into explaining but I'm confident in my opinion on this.|`|EJDKjLwQaa	dells are much more reliable, have better chipsets, and are just cooler. acers tend to have big hard drive and memory, but their processors aren't as fast. Their memory is a cheap kind that breaks fast, too. instead i would get a 2.4 ghz MacBook, and run windows on it - it runs vista faster than a pc does natively. so if u are the gaming type, u have that option.|`|J8FHAIZ2aa	Well I have acer and my sister has dell her internet always laggs. she bought 3 different kinds and the same response and she moved every 3 times she got them. but once I got acer my EVERYTHING was 100 percent perfet from now to then|`|60f353122f2f6d4ec5b729ce52cef758aa	My personal choice: DELL.<br>  - Good supports website<br>  - Not expensive<br>  - LAPTOP works well<br>  Have a nice day!

evXcM5sQaa	I depends on what socket type your 3800+ is. <br>  <br>  If it is a AM2 then it should work just fine, you might have to update your motherboards Bios though. You can check the MB manufacturer to see if the 5800+ is supported.  <br>  <br>  If you are using the older 939 socket then it will not work, and you will have to get a new motherboard that supports the newer AM2 socket.<br>  FYI- If you are going to have to buy a new motherboard, get a AM3 motherboard and a new AM3 CPU instead. In the long run, it will last longer.|`|edPeEGzmaa	Nope, you could just swap them out. They are both Socket AM2 processors, so a simple swap would be possible.|`|gHMK8TpVaa	Both are socket AM2 and, depending on your motherboard, should be able to switch them out with no problem. I'm confident that your motherboard supports the 5800+. Try and find out the make and model of the motherboard and look up compatible CPUs if you're really paranoid about it not working.

SJM0rzHtaa	Depends on what kind of ports your computer and the TV has.<br>  <br>  HDTVs of recent vintage with HDMI or VGA ports are computer-ready.  An HDTV's HDMI port can be directly connected to a computer's DVI port using a DVI-to-HDMI cable.  (Yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI).  A graphics card with an HDMI port will work too.  This is the best way because DVI/HDMI are digital and can support up to 1080p High Definition (that's 1920x1080 resolution).<br>  <br>  An HDTV that has a VGA port can also be connected to computers that only have the older analog VGA output, using a standard VGA monitor cable.  Not as nice as DVI/HDMI, but will work very well too.<br>  <br>  I'm using a 52" LCD HDTV as my monitor.  It's connected to my computer using a DVI-to-HDMI cable, and it looks fabulous, displaying 1080p:  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/armchairaviator/computer/IMG_0880c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/a...</a>|`|iEGHgoboaa	you must purchase a converter that convert VGA to AV.
W4FtzyDnaa	The motherboard is the foundation of the computer. To replace the motherboard usually means replacing the processor and memory also, due to the fact that the memory and processor MUST be compatible with the motherboard. <br>  <br>  The problem with brand name computers is that sometimes they use proprietary form factors. I honestly don't know much about emachines, so they may or may not. I know I've owned a few HP's that had non-standard motherboards.<br>  <br>  The current standard form factor for motherboards is called ATX. If you can find out somehow that your computer does in fact support the ATX form factor, then the sky is the limit as far as upgrading goes, but you must make sure that the new motherboard supports whatever parts you don't want to replace (ie, processor, memory, video card, etc.).<br>  <br>  As for Vista, my personal opinion is that you stay away from Vista unless you plan on using the 64-bit version. The reason is simple: it uses way too much memory. Compare 1gb minimum vs. 64mb for XP. In 32 bit operating systems, you can NEVER have more than 4gb of RAM (the actual number is something closer to 3800mb). Thus, when the OS uses over 1/4 of your RAM, that's a BIG problem if you do a lot of multitasking, or working with large documents. The absolute biggest slow down for any computer is running out of memory. <br>  <br>  It's up to you, but personally I don't recommend Vista unless you plan on getting the 64 bit version (which would allow you to install memory beyond 4gb). You really need more than 4gb of RAM to run Vista efficiently with memory intensive professional applications (like Photoshop), otherwise they will run faster in XP. That's just my personal experience. Vista really doesn't offer much benefit over XP in general.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: as the above poster said - yeah, 64 bit has a lot of compatibility issues since it is new, and drivers have to be written to work for it specifically....so a lot of your older stuff won't work|`|AA11736483	About the only good thing Emachines has going for it is that it uses a standard cabinet, so almost any mobo will fit. I think EM used MSI boards which fail quite often. I would get an Intel board and put 4GB of RAM in it. Don't forget, Vista is a real hog, so get the highest performance board you can afford. And don't do the Vista 64 bit thing - almost nothing works with it.|`|QUQY3HQYaa	Oh deffinately not if you reinstall your operating system you can use tons of different boards.|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	www.newegg.ca or .com, depending on where you live, would be a much better choice for getting your motherboard.

The platform I use depends on what I need to achieve.  <br>  Having said that, OSX is my preferred platform. It seems more secure, more stable, more intuitive and prettier than other operating systems.  If I could only ever own one machine it would be a Mac.

If you like a rich graphical interface then get vista, which is about the same price as xp, but xp will run faster on a computer with 1GB of ram than vista will. Vista has enchanced security, and I don't find UAC (User Account Control) to be annoying, especially when I install or delete something I don't want to. Also, Vista is incompatible with most Antivirus programs made before 2007, and some programs without the Windows Vista Logo. I have had to keep my 2002 Xp Machine for downloading my videos from my 2006 handycam, as vista does not support the software.<br>  <br>  It is a hard choice, but I think vista is better and not as annoying as people have said, but if you have alot of legacy applications then I would get XP.|`|gC6KbO1Yaa	xp. then just install a theme to make it look like vista<br>  <br>  vista is trash.<br>  <br>  wait for windows 7 if you can.|`|eVMJnNt1aa	vista....|`|m7eTAJVwaa	windows vista|`|SnZJsp51aa	For right now stick with xp, then when Windows 7 Come Out then upgrade it Windows 7, because It looks like vista, except there are changes like the start menu. <br>  <br>  I tried vista on my PC and it is unstable even if you install SP1<br>  <br>  So Right Now Use XP then upgrade it to 7 when it is released.|`|72e1e0606cad3d86ea30d72d5e64aef1aa	I work for a company that has over 300 computers in the field.

As far as video card, go with Nvidia 8800 or above, just keep in mind when choosing a video card to compensate with the P.S.

So how is this? most viruses, trojans, spyware and stuff disable this command and ctrl + del + alt is a shortcut for task manager. So if it is disabled, it is likely that a virus has taken control of you task manager. Another clue is the run command theory, by pressing run on your start menu it should be functioning however when virus again attacks your pc it disables this command. What you can do to counter this is by using a program callled flash detector google on it and it will bring back your run and task manager command. Well those are some of the clues for detecting possible infection|`|xIG518Wfaa	If its from a pop-up you don't need to close it immediately, a pop-up is harmless, if you visited the site, there are scripts that will download for you without you clicking a thing, and if you get a virus, don't take it to an expert, its not hard to use Google and find a free solution.<br>  <br>  but no, you most likely have not been infected by that.

fc77a866e635617e01c610e44fc41f33aa	Blob is a bad idea. It will make your DB very large.<br>  <br>  If your files do not need to be secure, your way is not bad, but you must find a way to make your file names unique. One way is to do a MD5 of the current timestamp and store this information in a table. Your image's name will therefore be something like this:<br>  <br>  3989ab9a89a0a80a9.jpg<br>  <br>  And in your database, you can link to this filename where needed.<br>  <br>  If you files need to be secure, then you'll need to use a hidden download method that will make direct access to the files hard or impossible (depending on your configuration). You'll have to build your own file "download_image.php" and this will fetch the image in the right location on your drive, read it, and push the info the browser (with the correct headers). This is probably the ideal method.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The two choices are storing the files on disk and the names in the database, and storing the files as BLOBs.  And you're correct - that's not the best way to do it.<br>  <br>  We currently store about 500 million images (not on a Windows or Linux box, of course), and store them as individual files.  (And we NEVER do a wildcard search of the directory they're in - my unborn great-grandchildren will be dead of old age before that completes.)  Access time on the website is single-digit seconds, and most of that is transferring the image to the browser - longer, of course, for large images and users on other continents.  Displaying the image on the page itself (we send the image, for viewing in whatever the user has set for that file type, usually a pdf or a tiff) should take about the same timeframe.  The lookup is in an RDB database, but MySQL should be just about as fast, for a reasonably sized table, if you index on what's being searched for.

h0hSIgC1aa	it is pretty simple to power up an ATX power supply without it being connected to a motherboard.<br>  <br>  First you have to be comfortable with shorting out the green "ps_on" wire to a ground (black) wire - this simulates the motherboard when the power button is pressed.  Paper clips work well.  See here for more info  <a href="http://www.gideontech.com/content/articles/196/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gideontech.com/content/articl...</a><br>  <br>  Before you plug it in and turn it on, you have to connect some load to the +5 and +12v through one of the hdd connectors at least, so if you have an old CDrom or hdd laying around that is good to use.  This is needed since some power supplies will not power on when there is no load connected.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|U0fjB82qaa	Don't take it out!

They can load very fast as opposed to normal hard drive which use magnetized disk. In hard drive, there is read speed and write speed. Read speed is the one that concerned with how fast computer can open your program, save documents , boot window and so on. Write speed is the one that concern with saving  files, copying one files from other. <br>    Solid state are very fast in read speed but they are not much different from normal hard disk in write speed. Which is perfect for a Netbook because I don't think you'll be writing and copying a lot of files in net book. <br>    Solid state drive don't have moving parts as magnetized disk so if the drive fall , it have higher chance of surviving the impact. Which is great for a Net book because people like to carry them and drop them occasionally. <br>    So in m option , Solid state driver are better than hard drive.|`|AA10162294	A solid state drive is faster, uses less power, and is much more reliable than a hard drive.

FxXFLLeuaa	I assume that by splitter you mean a 10/100 switch like the D-Link DSS-5+ or the 10/100/1000 DGS-1005D. In theory, the delay introduced by a 50' cable directly to the router would be shorter than the delay introduced by an extra switch having to examine each packet to decide where to send it. However, in practice the delay either way in not observeable by humans and the 10/100 switch probably costs abotu the same as the cable. Buy the 5-port switch and you will add the capacity for up to 4 computers in the basement.|`|Pv4Z88wPaa	The basic problem why you can not split a network cable is becasue the port the cable is plugged into on the router registers the MAC address (or hardware address) of the computer plugged into it.  The router will not be able to forward frames (layer 2 protocol) to two computers on the same port.  I wish it was like a telephone line.  What you could do though is buy a cheap switch and have one long cable plugged into the switch and two short cables to the computers.  That way you dont have to run another 50 footer.|`|5LQVhoSSaa	cat5e it will own the **** out of the rj45.|`|Cp11snJBaa	Edit: RJ45 and Cat5e are different, my bad, you need to run it up through the router.

If you don't have a dedicated graphics card, or it is an old one, you probably won't won't be able to play the latest games. <br>  <br>  As for a processor being dual core, this means that it can process two threads of commands (Like two programs) simultaneously. Nowadays clock speed does not necessarily mean performance, especially when comparing between AMD and Intel. You'll find the best performance in newer dual and quad core chips like the i7 or the Core2 models.|`|m2mny87jaa	no. your processor has two cores running at 1.8 ghz. because of the extra core, certain applications will be able to make use of it, and therefore you would be virtually running two processors at 1.8 ghz. know that not all programs take advantage of the extra core in a dual-core processor, although most games, video editing software, and multimedia tasks often do.<br>  <br>  also you should realize that clock speed is only a contributing factor of processors. a pentium dual-core at 1.8 ghz is going to be much faster than an older processor at 1.8 ghz.|`|tz4Xdz97aa	Your cpu is only 1.8ghz dual core, just because its dual core it doesn't mean that you double it or anything.  If the requirements for a game are a 2.8ghz processor then that is what you are going to need to play it.  <br>  <br>  1.8ghz is physically how fast information can past through the processor so being dual core doesn't change much. Just because its got two cores doesn't mean it is twice as many ghz.  1.8ghz refers to the speed of the whole thing operating as one processor.<br>  <br>  To play that game you'll need to upgrade or get a new computer!

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Web *design* is graphics - the look of the site.  If it's really a design class, you'll probably learn how to make graphics in Photoshop, how to slice them and create a web page with no code.  (That's about as real as learning to be an artist with a paint-by-numbers kit.)<br>  <br>  If it's a web *development* class, you'll be learning how to create the code for a website without learning either programming or any programming language.  Again - it's not reality.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn design, learn fine arts.  Computers are just one of many tools used - you should learn art itself, not one tool as a whole subject.  That's like learning "hammer" in a class called "carpentry".  It's not real.  If you want to become a website designer, become an artist.  No tool (program) will do it for you if you don't know how to do it.<br>  <br>  The same goes for development.  Learn programming.  Not a programming language, programming.  Like <a href="http://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/AD.pdfhttp://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/AD.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/...</a>  Then you can learn the tools to do it with - the languages.<br>  <br>  Don't try to learn both design and development - the last person who was really good at both analysis and art was named Leonardo da Vinci, and it'll probably be another few hundred years before someone else that good is born.  Human beings are normally right-brained (artistic) or left-brained (analytical) - not both.

The first, alpha testing, takes place within the developing company.  The second, beta testing, uses real-world customers as guinea pigs.  <br>  <br>  Beta testing can be very dangerous to your data and software configuration.  It can have serious bugs in it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	Beta is a test version. usually for a update. dont go with Beta if you want a version without glitche's.

vBKNsWlZaa	The reason the computer gets slow is due to the registry files becoming corrupted, or messed up, in simple terms. These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry. The registry Scan will identify corrupt files, paths,and registry keys causing your computer to have errors and run slow.Go to <a href="http://www.registry-bot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.registry-bot.com</a> to download registry bot.It is the most advanced and comprehensive registry repair product on the market.It will speed up your computer and make windows startup faster. <br>  <a href="http://www.registry-bot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.registry-bot.com</a> free download Registry Bot.|`|Yn7JMTKxaa	well to start with vista is a resource hog.all that eye candy does come at a price.personally i disabled some of that and it did make a difference in performance.you said you scanned for virus.i assume you also scanned for adware;spyware' etc?.you have 60% free on hard drive.that's good but when you first got your pc you probably had a lot more.and last but not least your internet connection might have to be upgraded. assuming you are not crippled by malware i would tweak vista and possibly get a faster internet connection.|`|6PSZDDrHaa	Sounds more like the internet not your computer, check that maybe?!|`|Bl1PRpGuaa	You can use a registry cleaner to clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".<br>  Every time you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time, the registry can grow to enormous proportions, especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and/or updating it's Registry entries.You need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast.Good Registry Cleaner will improve your computer and Internet performance dramatically!<br>  There are some comparison and review of TOP 5 registry cleaners.<br>  <a href="http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com/</a><br>  You can download and scan your computer for free.|`|5005cd4a6806f01f54b06adb6e2758f1aa	If you installed any you tube downloader please uninstall it and restart, because there may be some spywares in it.<br>  <br>  Remove your Ram clean the socket and plug it back.<br>  <br>  Mycomputer - right click on c - properties - disc cleap<br>  <br>  Start - Run - %temp%<br>  once you key %temp% and press enter it will show you the temporary files select all and delete it.<br>  <br>  Restart your computer.|`|nvPdCJbdaa	You can go to <a href="http://www.pc-optimizer-pro-download.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pc-optimizer-pro-download.com</a><br>  With pc optimizer pro you can safely clean, repair and optimize your computer.<br>  It will help improve your system performance without expensive hardware upgrades|`|gdGcxlk5aa	probably just your internet<br>  just wait for a while and see if it returns to normal<br>  otherwise contact your isp<br>  <br>  ^_^
Dzmi2XXPaa	Go back to your computer seller. They have to give you a recovery disk (with original OS either Vista or XP) otherwise they are selling you a fake computer or OS.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	You need to contact your computer's maker for the discs.  Use a friend's computer and have the make and model and serial number of your computer handy.<br>  <br>  No, you can't use another os's disc unless you want to format the drive and try to downgrade to XP.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	take the drive out, take it to someone elses computer, put it inas a second/slave drive or as a external drive, go to my computer when it's recognised, and right click on it, proporties, and uncompress it.<br>  <br>  happend to me, i compressed the whole drive, when i restarted, windows had compressed the boot sectors and wouldnt load. <br>  <br>  you could use someone else's Vista disc and put in your code, and it should reinstall if you want to do that, but you will lose all your stuff.
U0fjB82qaa	If you can boot the computer you can access the recovery system through the programs menu. I have an S4200nx and an S5300nx both had the recovery disc. Compaq has an idiotic policy which only allows you to make one disc and that it. I really think that soured me on Compaq PC's. You have no way of ever making another, so unless you know someone who has the exact disc you out of luck. You could contact Compaq and buy a disc but then you’re paying for Windows twice (Compaq’s fault) and I don't think that fair.<br>  Over the years somehow the original and the extra copy of each disc would not work. The disc look pristine, not a scratch yet it would not completely install Windows, there was always a problem.<br>  So I bit the bullet and got my friends copy of XP Pro and installed it. I really wanted my copy but after the install I noticed that none of the irritating Compaq programs were there, no Compaq this, Compaq that, just Windows XP Pro. So why I'm telling you this is I too was dependent on the Recovery disc and had they let the PC make a copy anytime you want it would have probably been fine, but now I can do it without Compaq’s help and they inadvertently taught me how. You can do virtually the same thing with the standard windows disc that you could do with the Recovery except the "free stuff" won't be there, (I never used any of it) so what, You can't however recover or repair your PC's operating system with some other disc unless you format the drive and lose everything If you end up needing drivers go to HP/Compaq to support and downloads. Don't feel like you can't do it, YOU CAN, you may make mistakes, correct them and start again till its right.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	it's probably best to contact tech support.|`|3cl8IkFFaa	It has a program called system restore click on that and from there its self explanitory
cdNMnh1Paa	you need an emulator to run the game.<br>  i think snap was on n64, in which case you need an n64 emulator.<br>  project64 is a good one, but i suggest you do research first as its very tricky at times.
DCXk0bVLaa	Asking for a keygen or program asking how to obtain one to illegally activate a program amounts to theft.<br>  This is not the place to ask.
fCOq04lNaa	It will work fine, but the performance decrease isn't as drastic as suggested. If your card is worse than a 9600 GT or a Radeon 4670 you should see virtually no decrease in performance.|`|0QUFjLmcaa	You can, but the performance of the GPU will drop drastically
XI5aQb2taa	Yes.  And it works fine.  The PCIe 2.0 spec is fully backwards compatible with the 1.0 spec.  The difference between the two is the 2.0 has higher memory bandwidth compared with the 1.0, and that's about it.  Because the 1.0 bandwidth is already so high, there really isn't much of a functional difference between the two, and you certainly wouldn't notice any performance difference unless you plan on running HD 4870x2 cards or somesuch at insanely high resolutions (the extreme high end in other words).  So anything from the 4870 down will work just fine.<br>  <br>  For the record, my HD 4850 is working perfectly on a similar motherboard, on a PCIe X16 slot.|`|d13ffb64b199e16801c20c68edf7e132aa	Just like Eyez said, it is possible but since 1x pciex have less bandwidth than 2x, data transfer rate would be slow and it'll be a waste if you plan to play games on it|`|wDKq567gaa	It is possible to put a 2.0compatible graphics card on a 1.0 interface slot BUT you will lose quality.

u3tKeaHsaa	A Java package is a mechanism for organizing Java classes into namespaces similar to the modules of Modula. Java packages can be stored in compressed files called JAR files, allowing classes to download faster as a group rather than one at a time. Programmers also typically use packages to organize classes belonging to the same category or providing similar functionality.<br>  <br>  A package provides a unique namespace for the types it contains. <br>  Classes in the same package can access each other's package access members<br>  <br>  To import any package you have to use the following syntax:-<br>  <br>  <Keyword(import)>  java.(dot operator)util(package for example).*;<br>  <br>  i.e<br>  <br>    import java.util.*;<br>  <br>  remember end with a semi colon. <br>  <br>  and one more important thing if you want to import any peculiar method(s) you can call that method instead of "*".. * allow  you to call the whole package. Method(s) calling is good if you know what particular method you are going to use.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if you are talking about a package you have created manually using a keyword package then you need to use this:-<br>  <br>  import <package name given by you><br>  <br>  thats it !!..<br>  <br>  In Java source files, the package that the file belongs to is specified with the package keyword. This keyword is usually the first keyword in source file.<br>  <br>  package java.awt.event;<br>  To use a package inside a Java source file, it is convenient to import the classes from the package with an import statement. The statement<br>  <br>  import java.awt.event.*;<br>  imports all classes from the java.awt.event package, while<br>  <br>  import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;<br>  imports only the ActionEvent class from the package. After either of these import statements, the ActionEvent class can be referenced using its simple class name:<br>  <br>  ActionEvent myEvent = new ActionEvent();<br>  Classes can also be used directly without an import statement by using the fully-qualified name of the class. For example,<br>  <br>  java.awt.event.ActionEvent myEvent = new java.awt.event.ActionEvent();<br>  does not require a preceding import statement.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you have different methods in different packages !!<br>  I hope this helps you !!..<br>  <br>  <br>  Gud Luck !!|`|71d2e85f2c4054e0a579f422056fa4ddaa	import java.io.*; (this will import all packages inside io)<br>  <br>  import java.util.ArrayList; (this will import arraylist package)<br>  import java.util.Date;<br>  import java.util.Properties;<br>  <br>  If you want all  in one import statement then you can use<br>  import java.util.*;|`|mkEgdIyfaa	import java.*;<br>  <br>  import package name.*;<br>  <br>  that's it..|`|36DaC9R3aa	package package name;<br>  <br>  we can do this way and in the other way is <br>  import packagename;thats it|`|rNA6x4r2aa	before you start the rest of the code, just put it at the top.<br>  <br>  ex. <br>  import java.util.Scanner;<br>  import javax.swing.*;

Htgj1LL6aa	both of those guys are right and wrong. mostly wrong. games utilize the cpu and graphics card at different levels. some do not even take full advantage of your graphics card, but most do. most games will not take full advantage of your cpu, but some do. <br>  first thing first. do you have a specific game in mind or just a bunch. see which games is the most cpu intensive, you can do this by running task manager from windows. run the game then press control, alt, delete. or press the "start button on the left of your space button during a game. open up task manager and go to the page where it shows cpu and ram usage. now play your game for 5 minutes while having that open then go back to it. it wil show the history of cpu usage while running the game. if you were at 100% on both or one core, then overclocking will indeed help. if they were not fully utilized, then overclocking will do squat. games that use the cpu heavily are left 4 dead, and call of duty. i dont really know about too many others as i just play oblivion mostly. left 4 dead uses all the power my 4800 X2 at 2.5 ghz can muster, i even overclock my cpu to 2.8 and it uses about 95% of my cpu power. thats when i have it maxed out on dual core mode though, with 4 x AA and 8 x AF. havnt tried it lower.<br>  <br>  also, overclocking your gfx card will just about always give you more fps, regardless of cpu usage. <br>  <br>  i need you to edit your question and tell me your specific cpu, if you want me to give you advice on overclocking.|`|omNEQ4Tkaa	<a href="http://com.puter.tv/forum/index.php/topic,189.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://com.puter.tv/forum/index.php/topi...</a>|`|nyqoPvL2aa	Very unlikely, unless your processor is rather old.

However, if you represent yourself as older, and MySpace finds out about it (which will happen if you change your age on your account), they have the option to close your account, because they state that you must provide truthful and accurate information when you register. Also, if you are under the age of 18 and you represent yourself as over the age of 18, you can get in a whole bunch of trouble. <br>  <br>  For the official terms and conditions concerning MySpace, it's rules and regulations, visit: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=misc.terms" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseact...</a>|`|thh7eh7Yaa	13 or 14. but i think u have to be 13|`|Jh57ZwUeaa	i think its roughly 13. as long you have an MSN account :)|`|kQufRZDjaa	14 and you have to have an e mail|`|1hrEdnJraa	13 years old.|`|HGoLIcPnaa	i think you have to be 18 good luck|`|WIr7tezwaa	13

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|uE1oTRcpaa	THIS IS WITHOUT DOWNLOADING OR PAYING!!!<br>  <br>  Antivirus is a HUGE scam!!!!<br>  <br>  To get rid of it:<br>  <br>  Close down all programs, save all files.<br>  <br>  Go to Start, All Programs, and Accessories.<br>  <br>  Click on System Tools. Then click on System Restore.<br>  <br>  A screen should pop up. <br>  <br>  There should be two options: Restore my computer to an earlier time; <br>  Create a restore point.<br>  <br>  Click on Restore my computer to an earlier time, NOT create a restore point. That will only get you VERY confused!<br>  <br>  After you click on Restore my computer to an earlier time, select a day from the calander that is on the screen. Select a time (there's probably only one).<br>  <br>  The computer will then restore itself to what it was before. <br>  <br>  Remember to select a day before you first got Antivirus 360. Don't go too far back though.<br>  <br>  The computer will then restart itself and PRESTO!!! no Antivirus 360.<br>  <br>  This worked for me, and it should for you too!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|wFRuecKwaa	It's fake. Such alert are caused by fake security software adverting themselves to scare the users into downloading and buying their product.<br>  Antivirus 360 which you mention is fake and has no affiliation with Microsoft.<br>  <br>  I also advise you to scan your computer with your current antivirus program or Malwarebytes just to make sure that the mpop up is not caused by Trojans or adware.|`|FEgJH3Ajaa	Do not click on pop ups that say they are antivirus or you will need many of them to get rid of what was down-loaded and with out you'r permision

If you do i can walk you through the process but if you don't have any copies of those operating systems,especially the one you want to install  then you're wasting my time.<br>  <br>  Before you start back up anything you want to keep as it will be lost forever. Make sure all the drivers for your hardware is available for XP before you start. If you have a SATA  hard drive you will need the raid drivers for your computer or motherboard and make them availible on a floppy or separate CD.<br>  <br>  You would place your XP CD into the CD/DvD drive and restart your computer. If it's not set to boot from the CD/DvD drive in the bios you will have to get into the bios and change the boot device order to the CD drive first.<br>   <br>  When it restarts it will prompt you to strike any key to install Windows. It will begin to load files and when it asks for third party software (drivers) you will install the raid drivers (if needed). Once installed replace the driver disc back to the Windows CD and continue installation. You will see a legal BS screen, F12 to continue.<br>  <br>  When it showes you the partitions that you have installed you will delete them one by one by highlighting  them and hitting the L key until they are all removed.<br>  <br>  Create a new partiton (Default size)   and quick format it using  NTFS install Windows following any prompts that come up.<br>  <br>  When your done and everything is working install your Anti-Virus and get all your Windows updates and patches.<br>  <br>  When installing Windows your computer will restart several times and will prompt you to strike any key again. Only do this once at the very beginning or the install will start all over again.|`|83ftA09Paa	Reinstall XP using your disc.

Someone is pretending to be me - what do I do? <br>  <br>  A:  In order to verify your identity, please send us a "salute". This means we will need an image of yourself holding a handwritten sign with the word "MySpace.com" and your Friend ID (your Friend ID number appears immediately after "friendID=" in the web address/URL when viewing your profile). We can then remove the profile that uses your identity without your permission. <br>  Please be sure to include the web address/URL to the profile in question when you send your salute. <br>  <br>  If you do not have a profile on MySpace please write in the email address that you are emailing us from instead of your Friend ID. <br>  <br>  If the profile is an extremely obvious attempt to be cruel/false, you may not need to send a salute.

At least $1200 will be needed to purchase a decent laptop with a dedicated graphics processor from either nVidia or ATI.  The "integrated" Intel GMA graphics processor is known for being extremely incompatible with medium-end to high-end 3D video games.  World of Warcraft, Star Wars Empire At War, Crysys, Fallout 3, The Sims 2 or 3, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, and Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars all require 3D graphics that Intel's GMA integrated graphics cannot handle.  Another thing to consider is the amount of memory.  At least 4GB of RAM will help future-proof the system for the next 4 years.<br>  <br>  In order for PC makers to get a laptop or even a desktop computer below the $800 price mark, they usually start by using the cheapest components, which will most likely not be up to snuff for playing any 3D games.  Another thing is that some people may be satisfied with their $600 cheap laptop, most of these machines usually have some quality compromises in their construction, and tend to become software-compatible obsolete within a year or two, with no real ability to be upgraded.  This is how the PC makers get these low-cost PCs to be as cheap as they are.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a good multi-media laptop, I would look at Dell's XPS m1330 (with a nVidia graphics processor) laptops, Apple's 13-inch MacBook (base model starts around $1,200), or Sony's VAIO 13-inch laptops (as long as they have either nVidia or ATI graphics installed).<br>  <br>  These are good laptops that start between $1,000 to $1,200, have ATI or nVidia graphics which will allow them to play games, handle music, and have excellent displays for watching movies.  The monitor sizes on the laptops themselves are small, but all three have video ports that allow larger monitors and even TV's to be used with them.<br>  <br>  check them out on:<br>  www.dell.com<br>  www.sony.com<br>  www.apple.com/macbook<br>  <br>  I know that these computers are not the cheapest, but I have had a lot of experience repairing low-cost, cheapo laptops, and seen the trouble they cause their owners, and I try to steer people away from buying a computer just because it is cheap, but try to get people to buy a computer that may be a "Great Fit" for them instead.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|QxtdyNvgaa	i recomend dell computers, they are fab and if not that you can always get sony laptops-(viao)<br>  <br>  if you want something completely different , try apple, its brilliant and has tons of new features that microsoft doesnt have,<br>  <br>  <br>  your choice, microsoft or apple,..................................<br>  if you choose microsoft i recomend choosing sony-(viao)|`|8IdjddlTaa	Acer laptops is the my best option, but i live in the UK so i dont know if they do them in America... but yeah, they are good looking, cheap and fairly reliable.|`|BByDc3PAaa	Dell is excellent for these types of things.<br>  <br>  Buy from them, then you can custom make your laptop.|`|7TqFISbtaa	Dive In and take your pick <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=pcat17080&type=page&qp=crootcategoryid%23%23-1%23%23-1~~q70726f63657373696e6774696d653a3e313930302d30312d3031~~cabcat0500000%23%230%23%2311a~~cabcat0502000%23%230%23%23o~~nf518||4c657373207468616e2024363030&list=y&nrp=15&sc=abComputerSP&sp=%2Bbrand+skuid&usc=abcat0500000" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a>

Your website designer either needs to know HTML, or work closely with someone who does.<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether a website designer does the HTML programming required, they do need to understand what is possible and what is not possible when designing the look and functionality of a website.<br>  <br>  The challenge for a website designer is to create a look which can be successfully implemented on all browser and computer configurations required by the client. Websites should be tested on sixteen or so combinations of browser and computer.<br>  <br>  JavaScript<br>  JavaScript(3)is a more complex language which enhances the capabilities of HTML, and which is incorporated into the HTML code itself. You may need to use JavaScript if you want your site to do more complex things.<br>  <br>  Java<br>  Finally, Java (not related to JavaScript) allows interactions with your website. To be able to interact the user needs to have the Java plug-in for their browser application. These days it may be a standard inclusion when you obtain your browser application.<br>  <br>  Plug-ins<br>  There is a range of technologies available to enhance the functionality and interactivity of your website. When you use these technologies you need to provide a link to a website where users can download that plug-in in case they don't already have it.<br>  <br>  You need to make this process as simple as possible otherwise users will leave your site. Many organisations maintain two versions of their websites - one which is 'enhanced' and uses the latest technologies, and another which does not. This ensures that all users can access the website's content.<br>  <br>  Commonly used plug-ins you can download free:<br>  <br>  Real Audio Player(4)<br>  Shockwave Flash(5)<br>  Adobe Reader(6). <br>  Multimedia file formats<br>  A range of different file formats are used to deliver and decode multimedia on the Web. This article(7) called "All about multimedia" is a useful introduction to them.|`|bfuZtIX0aa	know more about java<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yx1.net/200903/29.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.yx1.net/200903/29.shtml</a>

Re-boot and the pc should see new hardware and re-install it to see if that works.  If not open control panel, then click on the system icon to check the manufacturer of your motherboard. the sound device is usually Integrated with the motherboard.  open the pc case and get the model number of the motherboard, then go to the manufacturers site and grab the drivers from there. (You'll probably have to get the sound driver and the plug and play driver.) Download them to your desktop and run/install them from there. Run the plug and play driver first, then the sound driver. You'll probably have to re-boot a couple times.  See if that works.

There is a system for transcribing music for guitar called 'tabulature' (based on this grid system) which makes it easy to learn how to play the guitar without reading music.

AocUhQ5Haa	Dude, these days all appliances work all over the place.<br>  <br>  Tell him to tell the Apple store that you need a British (?) plug and they will give you one that fits on the adapter instead of the American one it comes with. It's a slide-on, slide-off attachment that fits on a universal adapter, so the same adapters are made for all over the world but the slidey-plug things are handed out according to country of sale.<br>  <br>  That's all you need to do. My Mac was bought in the States, and works all over the world.<br>  <br>  Also, tell him to unpack it before he brings it over, else he might have to pay Customs duty (tax) at the airport. He has to make it look like it's his own laptop, geddit? :)|`|gebjlwkPaa	You'll probably still have to pay duty and VAT when it comes back through customs.

sftn1Sy8aa	Getting a crack version of a software is not just illegal, but dangerous as well. You gotta think - why do all those crack websites provide cracks. That is because it gives them an opportunity to download virus and other trojans to your computer. That helps that in stealing important info off your computer.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go with some free version of software, such as AVG or Avira. <br>  <br>  Here is an article dedicated to Avira Free Antivirus:<br>  <a href="http://savefewbucks.blogspot.com/2009/03/free-antivirus-avira-free-antivirus.html" rel="nofollow">http://savefewbucks.blogspot.com/2009/03...</a><br>  <br>  And this one is for AVG Free Antivirus:<br>  <a href="http://savefewbucks.blogspot.com/2009/02/best-free-antivirus-avg-antivirus.html" rel="nofollow">http://savefewbucks.blogspot.com/2009/02...</a><br>  <br>  Go with free software version, instead of crack.|`|eTLG23N4aa	You can get a copy of Kaspersky 2009 at the Kaspersky website.

I have a Toshiba Satellite P105-S6134 and here are some of the problems with the Satellite models:<br>  <br>  1. Onboard Graphics - 3D is crarpy! Seriously I can't even run google earth! The graphics card is not something you'd want if you were interested in using it for gaming.<br>  <br>  2. The keyboard is not very good. I'm a touch typist and I can't type very fast on this. The keys are loose-ish and keys randomly stick down (even though there's nothing stuck under them)<br>  <br>  3. Onboard Audio - Okay unless you're using Linux<br>  <br>  4. BIOS software - The BIOS software is crappy; and depending on the version of your BIOS software and the exact model of your laptop, you may not be able to have sound in Linux. the onboard sound card settings conflict with the ACPI settings in Toshiba's BIOS software. You *may* be able to extract, patch, re-insert your DSDT file on linux to fix this, but again, it depends on the specific model of your laptop (it doesn't work for mine - I have to use USB audio). No BIOS software problems with Windows.<br>  <br>  5. Recovery Disks - I don't use these anymore as they kept crashing my computer. They actually damaged my hard drive when they crashed while creating the primary partition.<br>  <br>  6. Software - You get the recovery disks, so it restores Windows to the factory settings (default) when you restore. But even when you haven't yet installed anything, the bootup is S-L-O-W on Windows. Also you get a lot of 'trial' (junk) software that you have to spend ages uninstalling LOL.<br>  <br>  7. Monitor - spiffy!!<br>  <br>  8. Performance - meh I think its okay but I'm not into doing much with it. I would definitely *not* recommend it if you want it for gaming; I don't think the onboards graphics could survive!! lol<br>  <br>  9. Laptop lid - very sturdy. No complaints.<br>  <br>  10 - Replacement Parts - easy to come by<br>  <br>  11. Fingerprint reader - Useless to me.|`|cbe8d33e7cbbe8c1c91e8ee76259d01faa	Go with the toshiba.. and do not install lime wire or toshiba... if you need music that bad look in to bit torrent.

Also, the beta expires August 1 and you'd need to revert to your current system then anyway.

F5GyrdQfaa	I have a similar problem with my HTPC running wireless. There doesn't seem to be anything to do but disable it in Device Manager when I want to watch TV or Movies, but that's not ideal. Other than that, you might try upgrading your motherboard. I move up from a lower-end MSI mobo to a not-as-low Gigabyte and now the lag-stutters only occur every 5 minutes or so (give or take). Still annoying when watching something on HULU though.<br>  <br>    Last but not least, just switch to a land-line. I think I'm gonna do that soon. Apparently the problem relates to the Delayed Call Procedure (?? i think) that orders the sequence in which the CPU handles tasks. The WLAN basically screams "hello! Hello! HELLO!!!" and when the CPU asks whats up, it says, "oh, nothing." By then the lag-spike has occured as other tasks get backed up in the queue.

xfpJGBfwaa	Yes, lots of times.  The most interesting was when I realized I was shocking my Playstation during the winter "static" season.  I thought it was the controller going bad, but it wasn't - if I shifted in my chair, and I was just touching a button, it would be "pressed."  Actually eventually I fried the new controller that way to where the buttons functioned differently after two weeks of use.  This effect repeated itself until I figured it out.  <br>  <br>  Now I wear more cottons, and I use an ESD strap when playing the Playstation in the winter.  Sounds silly, but hey I want my PS2 to live, I have lots of cool games for it.  And I don't use the "Gamespot" controller anymore because it seems to shock ME in the winter.  Ouch.
VBngSH9raa	Will Limewire slow down my computer?<br>  <br>  It all depends on:<br>  <br>      * How fast your computer is, if it's an older computer that already has a lot of programs on it then it will, people have been complaining about when Limewire is open their computer slows to a hault, but this is probably on computers 5+ years old.<br>      * If you download any spyware/malware, if you do then you will definitely see a decrease in speed<br>      * If you download too many files that take a good amount of space and fill up your hard-drive then your computer will slow down<br>  <br>  But Limewire is a relatively light program (or once was, I haven't downloaded Limewire in a long time), so it shouldn't really affect the speed of your computer unless you fall into one of the catagories mentioned above.|`|BByDc3PAaa	If you download lots of files then yes, but if it is a good laptop the shouldn't have a huge effect.|`|8dK5HCGpaa	Well it depends how you look at it, Limewire is written in java which makes it a slow program to load on older systems, but as you say yours is new it shouldn't effect this. There is one other thing you should take into account which is the fact Limewire is sworming with viruses and child porn, which is why I prefer to use torrents. If you don't know about torrents, there a much safer way to download files in that you can read others experience and torrents offer extremely large downloads such as films and whole albums.|`|1RIoNAKlaa	Laptops/PCs only slow down when they become junked up and have to load a lot of files/programs when booting. Your laptop will slow down if you download a virus from limewire, download alot of files, install programs.<br>  <br>  If your computer does become slow, try this: <a href="http://www.tune-up.com/products/tuneup-utilities/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tune-up.com/products/tuneup-u...</a> (Works great for me.)|`|68QBysNoaa	DON'T use limewire.

Your wireless card should have signal strength meter somewhere in it --i.e. one bar 3 bars etc. -- if signal strength is the issue-- a new router is in order.

At times, remote control cars and tv remotes have been culprits, along with wireless gaming controllers. Hope this helps you.

So the 403 error is equivalent to a blanket 'NO' by your Web server - with no further discussion allowed.<br>  <br>      By far the most common reason for this error is that directory browsing is forbidden for the Web site. Most Web sites want you to navigate using the URLs in the Web pages for that site. They do not often allow you to browse the file directory structure of the site. For example try the following URL (then hit the 'Back' button in your browser to return to this page):<br>      <a href="http://www.checkupdown.com/accounts/grpb/B1394343/" rel="nofollow">http://www.checkupdown.com/accounts/grpb...</a><br>  <br>      This URL should fail with a 403 error saying "Forbidden: You don't have permission to access /accounts/grpb/B1394343/ on this server". This is because our CheckUpDown Web site deliberately does not want you to browse directories - you have to navigate from one specific Web page to another using the hyperlinks in those Web pages. This is true for most Web sites on the Internet - their Web server has "Allow directory browsing" set OFF. <br>  <br>  403 errors in the HTTP cycle<br>  <br>      Any client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) goes through the following cycle:<br>  <br>          * Obtain an IP address from the IP name of your site (your site URL without the leading 'http://'). This lookup (conversion of IP name to IP address) is provided by domain name servers (DNSs).<br>          * Open an IP socket connection to that IP address.<br>          * Write an HTTP data stream through that socket.<br>          * Receive an HTTP data stream back from your Web server in response. This data stream contains status codes whose values are determined by the HTTP protocol. Parse this data stream for status codes and other useful information.<br>  <br>      This error occurs in the final step above when the client receives an HTTP status code that it recognises as '403'.<br>  <br>  Resolving 403 errors - general<br>  <br>      You first need to confirm if you have encountered a "No directory browsing" problem. You can see this if the URL ends in a slash '/' rather than the name of a specific Web page (e.g. .htm or .html). If this is your problem, then you have no option but to access individual Web pages for that Web site directly.<br>  <br>      It is possible that there should be some content in the directory, but there is none there yet. For example if your ISP offers a 'Home Page' then you need to provide some content - usually HTML files - for the Home Page directory that your ISP assigns to you. Until the content is there, anyone trying to access your Home Page could encounter a 403 error. The solution is to upload the missing content - directly yourself or by providing it to your ISP. Once the content is in the directory, it also needs to be authorised for public access via the Internet. Your ISP should do this as a matter of course - if they do not, then they have missed a no-brainer step.<br>  <br>      If your entire Web site is actually secured in some way (is not open at all to casual Internet users), then an 401 - Not authorized message could be expected. It is possible, but unlikely, that your Web server issues an 403 message instead.<br>  <br>      Some Web servers may also issue an 403 error if they at one time hosted your site, but now no longer do so and can not or will not provide a redirection to a new URL. In this case it is not unusual for the 403 error to be returned instead of a more helpful error. So if you have recently changed any aspect of your Web site setup (e.g. switched ISPs), then a 403 message is a possibility. Obviously this message should disappear in time - typically within a week or two - as the Internet catches up with whatever change you have made.<br>  <br>      If you think that the Web URL *should* be accessible to all and sundry on the Internet and you have not recently changed anything fundamental in your Web site setup, then an 403 message indicates a deeper problem. The first thing you can do is check your URL via a Web browser. This browser should be running on a computer to which you have never previously identified yourself in any way, and you should avoid authentication (passwords etc.) that you have used previously. Ideally all this should be done over a completely different Internet connection to any you have used before (e.g. a different ISP dial-up connection). In short, you are trying to get the same behaviour a total stranger would get if they surfed the Internet to your Web page URL.<br>  <br>      If this type of browser check indicates no authority problems, then it is possible that your Web server (or surrounding systems) have been configured to disallow certain patterns of HTTP traffic. In other words, HTTP communication from a well-known Web browser is allowed, but automated communication from other systems is rejected with an 403 error code.

722f004961c6dd1f40b58236ff0f224caa	Hi - <br>  <br>  On your local PC where Oracle is installed, try changing directories to your ORACLE_HOME/bin   in there should be the imp.exe utility which can be used to import that .dmp file.<br>  <br>  Also, check if the .dmp file was created using expdb or just plain old exp .... because you can't import a file created with expdp with imp. (you have to use impdp instead).  So basically, if the 10g in your lab created the .dmp file with expdp then you won't be able to import it on your 8i database.  You'll need to upgrade to 10g on your local machine or redo the export in the lab with exp.exe instead.

aoTB1EUNaa	It's plenty of video RAM for what you're looking to do.<br>  <br>  Apple tends to match their hardware pretty well in their machines.  With their emphasis on graphics, they aren't going to skimp on video performance, especially on the MacBook Pro.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure you understand what VRAM is for.  It's just for the display.  How long a movie you're editing doesn't have anything to do with it.  VRAM tends to impact the size of your display and how much color depth you can handle.  If you're doing 3D, then it sometimes has to do with how many patterns can be loaded at one time time for high-frame-rate animation.  Since you're not worried about games, that's likely not an issue.<br>  <br>  I don't think the MacBook Pro shares video RAM with real RAM.  Some earlier Macs used to do this, but you pay a big penalty in speed, as video memory is typically a lot faster.<br>  <br>  4Gig RAM is probably overkill.  I'm using 2 Gig right now and I never run into memory related issues.

75nbESJUaa	in the java jdk folder is jdk/demo/applets/tictactoe. Their scenario is to load up a "scorekeeper" array called pos. pos is an array of booleans. They quickly make that array with the left shift operator like this:<br>  static boolean won[] = new boolean[1 << 9];<br>  // to show you...<br>  System.out.printf("1 << 9 is: %s", Integer.toBinary( (1<<9) );<br>  // yields 1000000000<br>  when the array 'won' is all '1' the game is definitely over. But, what they are doing is adding two booleans for each move. This is an elegant solution, but one that your instructor would immediately spot as plagarism. The Bruce Eckel "Thinking in Java" takes this game as Objects and does this program with 2D arrays and jpeg graphics for the X and O.<br>  <br>  For you... perhaps,<br>  <br>  int rows = 3;<br>  int cols = 3<br>  int[][] board = new int[rows][cols];<br>  String positions = "";<br>  for(i = 0;i<rows;i++)<br>  for(j=0;j<cols;j++)<br>  positions += String.valueOf( board[rows][cols] );<br>  } // collected a row<br>  boolean straightAcross = checkRowWord( positions );<br>  if( straightAcross){<br>  if( positions.equalsIgnoreCase("xxx") )<br>  Sys.out.( "You win!");<br>  else<br>  Sys.out.("You lose");<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  <br>  private boolean checkRowWord( String row ) {<br>  if( row.equalsIgnoreCase("xxx") || row.equalsIgnoreCase(<br>  "ooo");<br>  return true;<br>  else<br>  return false;<br>  }<br>  <br>  As you can see, the String comparision methodology is a lot more more work instead of referencing a single "bank" of booleans. But it can be done. The booleans offer bit operators such as:<br>  c = a & b;<br>  c = b ^ a;<br>  c = a >> 1;<br>  and so on, so forth. But most importantly, the a&b in this situation. Most java programmers don't bother with the bit operators. I love 'em.<br>  <br>  You however, could also have a String of 9 hyphens,  or whatever, and charAt[i] could put in an 'x' or an 'o'. then you would int win = positions.indexOf('x'). Then see if two more x for a row win.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I only offer strategy that might work. I'm too brain dead today to make the class for you.
t5sYXwSqaa	Many viruses hide in folder, programs and files that are been used by the computer so Anti virus programs either cannot detect then or if they do they cannot delete them. Sounds like you have a mixture of a virus and spyware/malware. Firstly you need to download Malwarebytes antimalware and TR (Trojan Remover). Run both these in normal mode and delete anything found. Then restart the computer in safe mode (as the computer is starting keep tapping the F8 key) select start in safe mode and wait till it loads. Now run each of the programs in this order (NOT TOGETHER) TR and delete anything it finds, Malwarebytes and again delete what it finds, the run your Anti virus (NOrton 360) and again delete what it finds. This should now leave you with a clean computer. By the way all the programs above are free, just google them. Hope this helps. Good luck.
