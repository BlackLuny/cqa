20090129083540AAbbTwO	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does size defeat God?	On Google maps you can usually zoom in on your house.   Then you can zoom out to see your city   Then you can zoom out to see your state   Then you can zoom out to see your country   Lets say you live in the USA, which is approximately 5000 miles across. Lets also say you can walk for an indefinite amount of time at 10 miles per hour. It would take you about a month to walk across the USA.   The world is approximately 25000 miles around. It would take you about 6 months to walk around the world.   The sun is 93 million miles away from the earth. It would take you about 1500 years to walk to the sun.   The closest star to our sun is about four light years away. That's approximately 24 trillion miles away. It would take you approximately 40 million years to walk to the closest star.   Our galaxy has an appoximated size of 50 to 200 billion stars. And it's about 100 thousand light years across.   From what our telescopes can see there are hundred of billions of galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy, the closest major galaxy, is about 2 million light years away.   So if God is the creator of the universe, and has to keep track of everything everywhere, do you really think he/she/it has time to worry about our little earth?   About your problems?   The sheer size of our universe defeats the possibility of a single intelligent creator.   If there was one, we could not fathom it's abilitites, and it would be ridiculous to believe that it would know or notice us on earth as a species and as individuals.      Relevant thought and crackpot theories being accepted.

I have been looking at careers and majors for me to do after high school. Here is a list of them:    - I want to start my own Equine Photography Business. I already have a name. It's Pink Saddle Pad Photography :) or just Saddle Pad Photography. but I like the Pink part because it adds a personal flare, my fav. color is pink :)  - I want to major in Equine Studies and become a Riding Instructor. Although, if I start my Equine Photography Business, I would like to do both. So I would like to find a college that provides both photography and an Equine Studies major, if anyone knows of any near Virginia?!  - Equine Law if neither of those work out...    Please leave comments/suggestions :)  Lists of colleges would be very much appreciated.  I would also like to know if I could start my own Equine Photography Business now while I am still in high school.

20090129094731AA8Ao0h	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	First chapter? would you read this?	Chapter One   Everyone knows the story. Its made millions of books popular and sold out tons of movies. I don’t why its appealing to so many people but it is. Not sure what story I’m talking about? Well, I’ll fill you in. Its starts with a blond cheerleader in high school. She’s dating a jock and everyone fawns over them. They are going to prom king and queen because they are the King and Queen of the high school. Sound familiar? The queen is a ***** and makes fun of freaks, geeks and weirdo’s like me. But then one of those freaks, geeks or weirdoes somehow manages to enter the Queen’s inner circle. At first they are thrilled and start to act exactly like their Queen and do some awful things. But eventually their goodness will trump everything and they will break away from the Queen and live happily ever after.    This is not one of those stories. Sorry. When I was in middle school I watched those movies over and over and read the books countless times, trying to prepare myself for the jungle that was high school. After the first day of freshmen year I realized that all those writers and actors were liars; everything I had learned was useless. My big plans of being the Queen’s right hand girl (I decided in seventh grade that this was the best position to be in. You got to go to the parties and have all the fun without the pressure) were ruined. Without any idea what to do I faded into the background. I joined the masses of freaks, geeks and weirdoes.    My parents helped seal my fate. My dad is a college professor who decided halfway through my freshmen year that his true calling was plants and quit his teaching job to work on writing “The rare plant guide of North America.” After he wrote about all the plants in Klamath Falls he started to get antsy to discover more rare plants. So we moved to Illinois. And then after he was finished there we moved again…and again. By the time I was about to start senior year we had moved six times.    Moving so often made it kind of hard to make friends but I wasn’t unhappy. I’m not one of those girls who needs someone just to go to the bathroom. I was used to being alone and it worked for me. But when we moved to Holliston, Massachusetts so my dad could research the New England Boneset, everything changed.

20090129100537AAoIjUJ	Arts & Humanities;History	Was Genghis Khan the most powerful Dictator ever?	I think so, he was never defeated by anyone. Even though he has received much criticism about his actions. Let's face it, he was clearly the most powerful dictator. People can argue for Napolean Bonaparte or Adolf Hitler but both of those 2 suffered horrible defeats in the end. While Khan destroyed all of Asia and parts of Europe.

Sad little boy   no one knows   the pain in your heart   as the knife   you hold   in your tiny hand   is being aimed at your heart.   I want to help.   I want to hear.   When I try   you don't speak.   Banging your head   against an invisible wall   I'm sure    you can't speak   can't hear   beyond what is in your head.   But no child   should know your pain   They're going to take you away   you know.   And put you somewhere safe.   Safe for yourself.   They're going to give    you a nice soft blanket   to hold you together.   They may hug you,   but not as they would hug   their own baby.   You just let this be   take the pills like they tell you   and nod when they ask.   Then come home to Auntie   you don't have to speak   or hear   just let me hold you   for a little while.
20090129113256AAboVPs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can A Story Have More Than 1 Climax?	hmm i'm writing a novel, but instead of having the traditional beginning, build up, climax and resolution, it's completely different. Instead, it has a beginning, a small build up, and then a mini climax, and then another small build up etc...at basically yeah there's loads of climaxes. There's like a whole big story line that keeps the reader reading on, but then it keeps the excitement with constant thrills.       hmm is it ok to do this? Is this a good or bad idea?      why? please explains pro's and cons?

The Crow and the Dove      Outside it begins to snow   I gaze out my window   From the distance fly’s a dove   She begins to fall from above      She lands in front of a tree   She let’s out a hoot, a feeble plea   Crawls to the shelter under the leaves   In meager attempt to escape the thieves      Her luck is running low   Flying towards her is the crow   He swoops on down to the ground   The dove dare not make a sound      He Scampers on over and sees her there   He gives her quite a scare   Head tilted gives her a stare   She mistakes it for a glare      Then the snow starts to fall too thick   Like a white wall of brick   I can’t see a single thing   I can’t wait for spring      Once the snow is clear   I look outside and shed a tear   Crow is keeping her warm   Keeping her safe from the storm

Ocean Of Fate  My subconscious mind is not asleep  When I dream, to me, it speaks  Subliminal messages dwell deep inside  Thoughts of death by suicide    When I'm awake, I block it out  But when I'm asleep my heart cries out  Say something please, tell someone now!  But when I wake up, I don't know how    I'm not my dad, I'm not like him  So I dive under water and start to swim  No matter how far I go, I can't escape  For the water I'm in is the ocean of fate...

20090129103717AAg6olw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would like some feedback on a short dialog piece i have written?	basically this is a more or less philosophical exchange between a more or less pessimistic man, and a optimistic girl. their ideologies clash all the time, and this is just a short example i made in a few minutes. it starts with the girl asking the question, mid discussion. not that i purposely didn't put any in between thoughts and actions or descriptions because, as i have said, i made the dialog in a few minutes, and its just an idea right now. this can also be considered a part of one of my earlier writings, though not the same excerpt:    "are you giving me a lecture of a battle between good vs evil?"  "the thing is, people have neglected to tell that evil has already won, there was no fight, there is no battle. there is no good left to be found."  "what about me?"  "the few good left, is a dieing breed, and is overshadowed by the evil that exists. even the beauty of your light is darkened and cannot be seen through the thick cloud that has been casted."  "you know...in the darkest of our nights..event he darkest of our days..the light which we are shines the brightest."  "i think its YOU who's giving me the lecture."  "i think you might be right."  "im trying not to think."  "good. its a bad habit."      "...how come i cant see it then?"  "see what?"  "this "light" that you speak so highly of. how come i cant see it?"  "maybe its cause you turn away from it, close your eyes and shut yourself away from it. or because you run from it. maybe its cause your too scared to look into it. i don't know. its something you should be asking yourself. but i do know this..and you do too. wherever there is light. anywhere there is even the smallest source, darkness vanishes. it runs. fear strikes it, and it disappears."  "are you saying that i am this darkness? the very thing i want gone?"  "that...and imagine what would happen..imagine what it would be like, if we all chose to be the light that we are- instead of denying ourselves. imagine if we all chose to play the role of the good."  "ive learned that imagining and hoping, only leads to disappointment."  "then your denying yourself of what makes you human."

I have had some brief experience with this in one of my other subjects [as level student] but im not sure im doing it right... Can you tell me if this is a monologue please?        What's it like to be locked within a world you know nothing of?  Better still, what is it like to be trapped in yourself?...    Well i will tell you.  Firstly, there is no worse feeling than feeling lost.  But when you are there and you can physically see yourself but at the same time, only see a stranger...  Well that says it all...  It's horrifying.  This, i have to say is how i feel.  Dont get me wrong, I know there are others out there and that im not the only one to feel like this but in my world i am.  Im not talking about transvestite or anything like that.  Im just saying that im losing myself... And i cant find a way out...  But then, the reason for this is because im pathetic.  What have i done with my life?  Absolutely nothing.  I dont even have a social life.  You know something.  You are all lucky.  You have no idea how much....      Please.. if this is not a monologue... can you let me know what one is please!!! thank you all very much :D .x.x.x.

20090128091919AAYDy7o	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Should we institute a National Agreement Day?	Surprisingly, my other idea for annual Golden Globes awarded to the best countries has not taken off yet.... so perhaps we should start a bit less ambitiously.      With a concern that we are going to need all of our resources to meet the dire challenges in our future, cooperation seems essential. Yet we seem to fight and bicker at the drop of a hat. We have replaced discussion and compromise with "labels". We are pathologically polarized. And  we don't even sing together like we use to!      Now I know there are a few touchy topics that we should avoid at least until we get the hang of this.  As a method of offering incentives, perhaps we could break up into groups (perhaps states) and the state with the most agreements and compromise (judged by an independent panel), would get a free barbecue at the end of the year!      Thoughts? All responses are welcome! (see, I'm agreeing...welcoming both silly and serious responses).

There, I said it. I, Bradley Louise Turner put on an act. Everyone thinks I’m so wild and crazy but really I’m just the opposite. It’s not like I’m fake or anything. I do say the truth and nothing but. It’s just…sometimes I wish I was different. The reason I act the way I do is because I want to be liked and I guess my act worked. I am liked but this isn’t the “real” me. The real me doesn’t like love-stories or staying out until three in the morning partying. The real me would rather stay inside and watch a horror movie with a close group of friends and then play truth or dare and go to bed. The real me doesn’t like wearing designer jeans every day and having to go to the bathroom three times a day in school just to make sure my makeup looks flawless. The real me doesn’t mind wearing sweatpants and baggy t-shirts. Of course I would never tell them. Who’s them? Oh, just the Aphrodite girls. Yep, the Aphrodite girls. That’s their group name and I am part of them.

Hi,      I am looking into getting a portable reading device and I am having a difficult time deciding if it is worth buying Amazon's SOLD OUT Kindle or just going for a couple hundred dollar cheaper Sony 505 model.      The Sony I am looking at seems to be comparable in quality to the Kindle. The only MAIN issue I have with the Sony is that I'm worried about where you can buy the books. Since unlike the Kindles you cannot just buy them on Amazon.com as far as I know.      So do you know where to buy the eBooks for the Sony?      So my main question is, is it worth it to buy a Kindle for about $400 or should I go with the Sony 505?      I will add links to the two as well...      Here is the Sony 505 I am interested in:    http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stor...       Here is the Amazon Kindle:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI7...       Oh and I would not be able to wait the 4-6 weeks to buy it from Amazon so I am stuck buying it from somewhere else for more expensive which is why the price of the Kindle would be around $400.      If you have any other eBook readers you like or have used you can suggest them as well.      Thank you in advance!   ADD:   I am re-posting this in Books & Authors since I didn't get any responses in Consumer Electronics. Sorry if it's the wrong category.

20090129113431AA3SuNn	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Can forgiveness be irrelevant?	Hello      I have great difficulty being able to communicate what I mean when I explain why I that forgiveness and blame is irrelevant once someone has started to make the decision to be good.      What defines someone as being good is when they are making an effort to no longer be bad.   It makes no sense for me to continue holding blame against someone once they have decided to change their behavior to good, as at this moment it is clear that they are already doing what I want (being good).   When people say that I do not forgive, then I cannot understand what they mean, as they are no longer being blamed anyway.   If there are not in a state of blame because they have changed their behavior, how can I forgive?      In the past, I saw that forgiveness is something that someone has to earn in someway.  Or that at some point I have to force myself to swallow my continued anger against them for what they have done.   Now that I know, once people have altered their way of behaving, there is nothing to be angry about; it seems pointless to continue anger for something they are no longer doing wrong. They only option is to try their best to become good.      What relevance does forgiveness have for me to have to relinquish it in the first place, when they have changed their behavior?   I won't stop blaming people when they are still misbehaving; but once they have stopped, why would people feel that I have blame still continuing against people?   Forgiveness is not relevant, and therefore so is asking for forgiveness irrelevant; once you have you become of good intension.      I know that this is weird and different, but this is how I see; to me this is logic.   What do you think of this, and how do you suggest I explain this?      CREED

Most base our current callendar on an important event  - and compare time to it. In our case, the presumed birth of Christ.      Given the latest findings on Mars - that a civilisation may have LEFT 30,000 years ago, that co-incides with our civilisation STARTING 30,000 years ago,  - Was their "First time" actually the first time they visited Earth ?      Just supposing the story of Noah was actually bringing animals and life TO earth, and the Deluge was not of this planet - but of Mars?      ... Puts a different spin on things ?      There are a lot of ancient stories from all cultures that talk of battles between planets - are they all just made up stories ?

With the green beans untouched, he stared at the center piece with the fork in his hand. The electric sound of the refrigerator could be heard it was so quiet. He slowly and softly tried some of the greens, but his jaw was too weak, and his stomach wouldn’t accept it. A week it’s been since his true love passed. What a heart break. He gave his life for that woman, but it didn’t make her immortal. He looked up and gazed through the cracks of the blinds, but what was there to see? It was dark and black. What was there to see?

20090128094629AAY2uOn	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	Sorry, I know it's long. Maybe just read a little bit.. anyway-      There are tear stains on my pillow case   Again, because of you.   You, the fool who twists and breaks   The hearts of whom you choose.      Am I part of your plan to become a man?   An object of your lies?   Or am I just another body still,   For you to utilize?      Like a shiny toy or a fancy car,   You wear me on your arm   Broadcasting unbeknown to me   But thought by everyone      That the things we do when I'm alone with you   Are more than honest fun   While I think that the things they say we do   Will never quite be done      Am I part of your search for world domination?   To start by manipulating two,   And wait till each one falls in love   To slowly break the news?      You're a dishonest one, I can see.   You're mighty fond of stuff.   You like to pretend that that stuff is me,   And deny that it's a bluff.      Words like love don't mean a thing,   Just maps to make yourself a king.   King of a place called the human race,   Where you, my friend, get lost.      Just who are you, the reader asks?   A name I'll gladly tell.   Your name is man and from your birth   Your heart's belonged in hell.      You're the man that rapes   And the man that kills   You're the man that cheats   And the man that steals      You're every man that ever lived-   Call yourself what you want.   But the truth is that you're a filthy pig,   Lonely and distraught.

Normally I do architectural drawings (renderings, drafts, elevations, etc) but I've recently begun experimenting with people. I'm not really going for realistic- that's what a camera's for. most of the style is based on personal study of Victorian engravings (but don't worry, I didn't copy or trace anything). It's not finished, by any means, and it's really just for my own enjoyment.      P.S. Sorry for the quality of the online image- The actual picture is fairly large, and it's hard to shrink it down without blurring the lines a bit. Also note that the top and left sides have been cut off partially.

I need a name for this world. this is how the the story starts out.    I have always had a huge imagination. I was very good when I was younger coming up with ways to play and make up magical stories. I was an only child Id guess thats why I had this over powering imagination! I love to take long walks into anywhere and just write. Sometimes Id get so caught up in my imagination id forget where I was even as school and my friend Sam would have to snap me back into reality always saying "Tesla your so weird."  I loved it when I got to go to my grandparents cause they live out in the middle of nowhere in the wood so it was perfect to get to write and escape to my own world   When I heard my parents arguing it usually upset me but I always got to go down to grand parents house so today it did nothing but excite me since I just havent had the time or place to get to escape to my own world.   When I got to my grandparents house I went in gave them hugs and visited after grandma Rose got started with dinner and grandpa Jasper with his tv shows I took the chance an grabbed my pin and paper and headed out to the woods. Grandma asked me to not go past there fence cause the other side was not there property but she had told me no one had lived there for many years. I was sitting on a rock and just realized I needed something different a little adventure I mean what could it hurt walking past the fence no one lived there so no one would ever know right!        Well she ends up in a whole new world very magical i dont want to go much more into it but i was just wondering a of a good magical name for the now World she is in.

She sat, uprighted with pillows,   her face, soon a death mask,   wore irritation and disgust.   Those surrounding her said   she must be angry at God,   if only she'd go in peace.      Determined to make a   difference and choice, she   snarled her last words to them all.   You stupid, ignorant fools!  I   leave my wrath upon you for   wasting your perfectly good lives.      Her death mask wore an impish grin   as they gathered to say their good byes.   Each agreed it must've been heavy   morphine for pain that caused her    bizarre final outburst.  What a pity she    lost her fine mind at the end.      And they got back into leathered seats   of their cars, or the couch of their shrinks,   or the arms of adulterous affairs, one    even wrote to her kid off in boarding school   while another, with broken false nail, speed-dialed her   salon, demanding an appointment RIGHT NOW!

20090128102730AA5Yivb	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Where can I get a dented filter taken off of my lens?	I have a UV filter on my 50mm lens for my Pentaxs, but the edge is dented. It has been like that for a couple of years and now I want to get if off.  I have tried myself, but I'm afraid I am going to damage the lens if I try too hard.  I want it off now so I can experiment with more filters and remove some of the dust trapped between the lens and filter.  The lens itself is fine, but the filter has got to go.      Will Ritz be able to remove it or do I have to find someone else?      Here is an old picture of the camera and lens.  You can see the dent on the right side of the lens:    http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c215/m...       Thanks.

20090128111805AAgKziR	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Pre-1837, how would you go about researching accurately your family tree?	Once the Birth, Marriage and Death records have been exhausted I am often unable to research my family tree beyond 1837. I know I have been told time and time again to research parish records but alot of these records are often obscure and cannot be sure of a positive result. Therefore I suppose what I am asking to any experts out there is how else could I go about researching pre-1837 and being sure of accurate results?      P.S. If anyone has information regarding Corbett or/and Bicknell surnames based around Birmingham (pre and post 1837), and Warwickshire/Worcestershire (pre-1837) I would be greatful.

20090128114820AAXEQ6U	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Questions about The Sweet Far Thing by Libba Bray?	1. Did you expect the Pippa/Felicity thing? I did, but the times when Pippa was "dreaming of a handsome (male) knight" and Felicity talking about all her male suitors didn't add up.   2. What was the story behind Fowlson/Miss McCleethy?   3. Why couldn't Gemma talk to Kartik if she could talk to Eugenia Spence?      Also, this may sound odd but on Page 601 of the book there is a quote Felicity says about life for girls in those periods. I don't own the book so could anyone tell me what the quote is or where to find it online? I meant to copy it down for a example of a quote for a book report but forgot.       Thanks!

20090128104404AAcXIie	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Corporation Nation- Whats your opinion?	Water down the imagination.   Kill all of the creation.   Broadcast on the radiostation, "Here comes the Corporation Nation!"   Strips of red represent the dead,    Beaten by the whip until evey tear was shed.   Red blood splattered,    A people shattered.   Brought on by this Corporation Nation.   Stripes of white are glowing bright,   When soldiers are fighting in the night,   Missing home, and full of fright,   Because of this Corporation Nation.   Blue sky with silver stars,   Represents the congestion of cars,   And working for something that isn't ours,   But for this Corporation Nation.   Manic lines in shopping malls,   Movie stars that look like dolls,   Consumers responding to the commercials' calls,   Of the Corporation nation.    Children paid 12 cents a day,   They have no time to go and play.    Children with sadness in their eyes,   But we never hear their cries.   Hopelessness silenced by the lies,    Told by the Corporation Nation.   Let's change the way things have become,   Let our voices be heard like the beat of a drum.   Stand up and shout,   And get this message out,   "WE MUST STOP THIS CORPORATION NATION!"
20090128110150AA4BCtq	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	We don’t defy    But embrace human nature   Articulating instinct   To separate true love from labor      The vanity of slaves rings true   As they idolise their tears   And Crave for the crippled psalms of safety   To ring inside their ears.      As useless as the night around us   We shade in the streets with red   So that the cries of the cold and vacant   Can occupy our heads            it expresses the idea that to be led by your instincts is superior to being controlled by reason and thought, as most humans are. It is inspired by the character of Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' and communicates a twisted justification of the brutal crimes he commits.

20090128105649AAVQsVH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hey does this sound any good...first draft, still editing, tons of gaps?	There's a bunch of gaps in here (marked with ***) and I still need to do some editing, and I need to add in a lot more detail. It's basically a bunch of dialogue right now...is it any good?         "Oh! Hey!" the tall, shadowed figure called after me.         I started taking longer, faster strides.         "Hey you! In the woods!"      I quickly glanced back, nearly tripping over a broken limb.         "Yeah, girl! I'm talking to you.   "   ***Something needs to go right here, but we haven't decided on what yet.***         "Look, dude, I don't know what you want from me-"      "Ah, just save it.   Do you mind if I asked you a question?"      I came to a complete stop and turned to face the shadow      "Do you think I'm sexy?"      ***Somewhere through here, we're going to make the girl (Melanie) start freaking out.***         !?!?      "Excuse me!?!? What!?"      "Do you...think I'm...sexy?" he repeated again.         Crap.   My face was tingling- I could tell that my entire face had flustered bright red. Luckily, it was dark, and the guy was too far to see.   "      "Ugh...no comment.   "      I turned and began walking again.      ***Then we were going to mention something about how cold it was outside in contrast to how hot she had felt from getting embarrassed... Then Melanie was going to look up through the canopy of the trees to see the moon.   Then she was going to feel a tugging on her jacket***      Holy. Crap.         ***Melanie is going to turn around and the stranger is going to be right behind her.***         Of. Freaking. Course.         I froze. The stranger released my jacket and came closer to me.         "Tell me, why would a girl like you be alone in the woods...at night, anyway?"   His warm breath ..replace with something alongs the lines of "came into".. my ear.         I stepped back.         His features were much more prominent now. His eyes linked to mine.   Nervously, I looked away.         I wanted to tell him just to leave me alone, but I couldn't bring myself to it.         "Er, you don't just walk up to some random person and ask them if they think they're...sexy. Especially when you're alone...at night...in the woods.   "      I glanced at his eyes again. Bright grey-blue.         "So is that a yes or a no?" he asked playfully.         "Ugh..."      His eyes were so familiar.         "Have I seen you somewhere before?" I asked.         He didn't answer. His dark eyebrows furrowed.         "Nope. I don't think so.   "      "You didn't go to ..replace with a name.. Jr./Sr.   High, did you?"      His eyes were...so enticing...so infectious.         "Stop trying to change the subject.   "      "Ugh. No...sorry.   "      I didn't look back to see his reaction. There was a long pause. I turned again to walk away, but he grabbed my arm.         "Why are you alone in the woods?"      I still couldn't meet his gaze.         "Er, I like to walk.   "      "In the dark?"      His eyebrows were arched down again. His eyes were still friendly.         "Yeah.   "      "Isn't that a little...strange?"      Melanie thinks about what she wants to say for a little while      "You're very quiet."      Not really.         "Ugh, yeah I am."      "Why is that?"      "I dunno."      "You've always been like this?"      "Er, I guess. I dunno."      There was another long pause.         "Can I go now?" I asked, impatiently.         "Wait...you wanna leave?"      "Well, yeah if you're not planning on raping me, I have other things I need to do, if you don't mind." I scowled.         "Har.Har.Very funny." he chuckled bitterly, "Do you mind if I walk with you?"      "Why?"      "Well, a girl like you-"      "Look, I don't need your help."      "I could protect-"      "I said no!"      ***She starts walking again and then she has the urge to look back.   She turns and the guy is just standing there***      "Oh...fine! Come on!"      .. The guy catches up with Melanie..      "Hey, I didn't catch your name?"      "It's Melanie.   Yours?"      "Seth."

Any tips or sentences that i can manipulate would be great!          Eden the Goddess of nature is naturally stunning! Her skin glows beneath the dress that was woven out of leaves and flowers. Upon her third finger lies a delicate un-blossomed bud of a daisy. Her cinnamon coloured hair is pulled back into a single French plait. Around her braid are tiny little flower heads (mostly lavender). Slung round her swan-like neck is a floral necklace with a pink rose quartz rooted in the centre. She has a button nose and forest green eyes. Her cupid's-bow shaped lips look like they have been painted by raspberries.

The song is called "Red Rose Romance" or just "Romantic" (i havent decided which one yet.    here are the lyrics, and i copyright these lyrics as mine, so please do not take, (just something i gotta say, not trying to be all up tight)    She's such a romantic,  always looking for a happy ending  lost in translation  i cannot escape what i dont run from  she's something to admire  dont you dare try to put out her fire    Chorus: (hold each word for a bit while singing)  Moonlight kisses, rooftop dances  take her breath away    She loves my cliche's, bed of roses  takes her breath away     (while she loves my cliche's... portion plays i have in the background singing this:)    Say you want yours, but you cant start over  so everyone hand in their four leaf clovers  i'll never be one to be superstitious but  this is getting a little out of hand,   when everyone gets there happy, but her    ( i would like words to go hear after "takes her breath away", like a catchy chorus ending.. please any ideas romantic girls???)    next portion:    her library of movies, everything from "you had me at hello"  she's the first shine of light, when the sun begins to rise  she wears her colors oh so well  Nobody, wears blue quite like you do...    (should i say right here... "you know its true"? or is that too plain?)    then goes back to the chorus again...  so any tips, ideas or just ideas of what you consider romance... i am not yet satisfied with what i have made, i need more words to point out how "fairy tale", peaceable, romantic this girl is, although not un realistic, naieve, or gullable ya know.. please girls give me what your thoughts on romance is.. i hope i am not being too confusing with my question here.     also if you want to hear a sample of the song im making i can send a sample in a email if you want, but thats your choice, i know how some people are a little paranoid and safe, so i dont want to pry its only if you would like... thanks again all.

20090128121451AATQsoh	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Should I get a resonator guitar?	I've been shopping around for a new guitar under $500, and I'm seriously considering a Jay Turser solid-body resonator. I'd like something unique, with at least one humbucker, and something that's not built for metal. I play anything except metal, rap and adult alternative, but my preferred genre is garage rock. Would it be good with distortion, and the genres I play?
20090128115124AAT7WXu	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poem: what do you guys think?	Everywhere I go, death follows   When I want to think of happiness   I only think of hate,      When I want to dream, I only have nightmares   When I want to breathe, my lungs are filled with sadness   Suffocating me, until I might pass out from the sorrow that rips at my heart      I wish for death, play by its rules   only death does not wish for me,    Death only chooses those it feels are ready      Those who do not seek it out in the darkness   But eventually succumb to its embrace in the light   I try to speed up the process but every attempt seems to only slow it down      All I ask for is a shoulder to lean on   I feel like crying but I cannot cry anymore   All of my tears have been thrown into a river   of hopelessness       I want someone to tell me they love me    and that I am somebody in life   When will anyone truly understand   What I am feeling inside?      I look in the mirror    but all I see is a somber reflection   of a young male lost in a forest of damp affliction   there is no escape, his voice is forgotten, his soul silenced..
20090128114023AAroUvK	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Poem what do you think? Thank you for critique!?	The fly only has twenty four hours to live   If you knew you only had twenty four hours to live   How would you spend it?      The fly spends his entire life searching   for food, also to breed so that another    may grace its presence when its time has come      A fly may have a short life   but a wasted life, it is not   Better to have a short life            Understanding your purpose in life   Rather than have a long life   alone, to not have searched at all.      I am seventeen years old what do you think? I actually just thought of this when I was on the bus going home. I just wrote it down as it came to me.
20090128095256AASMpTQ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What exactly is life? Many questions here, philosophical and religious answers welcomed?	Many people say that life exists because the conditions were right. But what exactly is this thing that we call life that arose from the perfect conditions? Why did it arise from the perfect conditions? Where did it come from? Is it always here? What if the universe were to contract, explode and expand again, would life once again evolve? Does it need or have to exist or are we just a freak accident?

20090128102919AADsAq6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	This is the beginning of a story. Is it "catchy" enough?	“Hurry up Gwen!” Austin yelled at me. I had silent tears running down my face. I can’t believe what we just did. What he just did. Austin and his supposed friends. Why was I here? Because, I was Austin’s girlfriend. I have to help him.    What am I going to do now? Maybe I should just run and not turn back. This is Austin’s problem, not mine, right? Wrong. My fingerprints were all over the seen, all over James. If I went to my mom now… no. I can’t.    “Gwen! Help me!” He spat at me. He sounded mad but I knew him. He wasn’t angry, just worried. Really, really worried. He finally looked at my face but I avoided his gaze.    “Gwen,” Austin said softly. “Please. We don’t have a choice now. We have to hurry. Don’t be difficult,” he reached over to rest his hand on my face. I knocked it away with my arm.   “What the hell are we doing here Austin! What?” I screamed at him. I looked at him and he looked away. Looking everywhere except me. “What?” I asked again. My tears weren’t silent anymore.   He ran his pale fingers through his dirty brown hair. He was staring at the ground now and but his hands over his face. He turned slightly to look at James’ cold, bloody, disheveled body.   “I don’t know. I don’t know.” He repeated. “I’m so sorry. I tried and tried. I’m sorry.”    I stood there, waiting. I didn’t know what for. I was just waiting. I heard a siren and both our heads snapped up at once. We shared a shocked expression across our faces and he grabbed my hand. We started to run, he was mostly dragging me along with him. I tried to stop but I was not match for him. I looked back at James. He was laying there. I remember gently closing his eyes for him. Austin tugged harder and I gave in. We started running as fast as we could.

The main charecter is a florist and his assitant. he is a normal man who lost his mother to blepharospasm, where your eyes have spasms. oh by the way this is my only book/play that is a musical. At night, Abraham, the main charecter goes to the cemetary and digs up corpes of recently deceased people. he then has conversations with them, dances, and then puts them back in their graves. he doesnt have sex with them, because he is a tender loving caring person and he is not a necrophiliac. Abraham has total awarness of what he is doing and thinks it is crazy, but he is just attracted to it. i wont tell you the rest. it sounds totally crazy but im pretty sure all books are. any answers?

In the song I use different works in the public domain -- i.e. Schubert: Ave Maria, The Tempest, etc; however, I have used a snippet from Andrew Lloyd Webber's: Cats.       "Plagiarize, all alone in the moonlight, if that's where you find yourself, you can just plagiarize."  Change the words to the original and hum it to yourself.       What would I have to do to make it legal for me to publish this work...? because I know that it is under copyright still.      Thanks guys! Best answer is a DETAILED one.       Christopher

I am directing and co-writing a Horror Comedy Movie for a class project, and I cannot come up with a title. The story's teaser synopsis is: Locked inside the school for a detention with Mr. Wilson, the toughest chemistry teacher in the state, an eclectic group of students find themselves terrorized by some kind of psycho in their own predicable, horror movie parody. After several mysterious and horrify events, and the disappearance of Bobby Smith, the Quiet Kid, the group soon realizes that one of there only way out is to discover the identity of the psycho. After searching the school the group quickly realizes that the psycho must be one of their own. Is it Mr. Wilson, the unappreciated teacher, or is it Joy, the cynical and sarcastic Goth chick? Is it José, the stereotypical Hispanic Kid, or is it Mia, the increasingly jealous girlfriend? Could it be Kate, the attractive cheerleader, or maybe Jeff, the geeky, paranoid Trekkie? Horror and hilarity ensues in this unorthodox horror movie spoof. Does anybody have any ideas for a title?

I am writing a short story, 300 words or less, for school. Here is what I have so far.    ______________________________________...    The time for tricks is over, and Master lets me off the leash to greet the residents. Some shrink back as I get near, and others carefully lean forward to lavish me with timid pats and caresses. This here is Lilly, my dog, Master bends down and loudly tells the nearest old woman. She greets me with a leery eye and says in a cracked old voice, Well, I've never seen that dog in my life. Get that mutt out of here. Never seen me before in her life? I was just here last week...and she had been open and loving then.     A whithered man with milky white eyes whispers, Come 'ere, ol' Jack, we'll get out o' 'ere and get back to the farm. We 'ill, Jack, we 'ill... My names not Jack. How could he forget my name?

I've been wrting for years and my husband has yet to give me an honest opinion, so, I'm counting on you guys.      The Hand that Knows the Beat      Hold out your hand and show me my heart   You've held it all along   Something that compliments you    Like voice compliments song   Carry it not like burden   But like one would hold a balloon   Something light, and fun, but delicate   That you wouldn't want to lose too soon   Most of all, hold it close   This precious heart of mine   Because this heart will love only you   In and out of time.    Endya Sierra Mosley       The Story of Love Never Known      We found eachother in the dark   He and I   Our fingers grazed and I heard him sigh   We fell into eachother   And wrestled with intensity of battle   We settled into eachother with the calm of the sea   Rushing to greet the sand   The heat filled our heads   Sweat danced on our skin   With patterns like rain drops   This is what lovers do, I thought   Love is the coolness of winter window open   Grazing the intensity of progression   The wind blew more fierce   Our dance soon to end   And it did...   I awoke to cold room, indentation on the pillow   I wonder his name
