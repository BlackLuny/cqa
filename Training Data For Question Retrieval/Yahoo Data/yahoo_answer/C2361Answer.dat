cdaecb041ea05ae863554db25fbdb666aa	Mahim was one of the seven islands that originally made up Mumbai. Mahim, or Mahikawati as it was known, was the capital of Raja Bhimdev, who reigned over the region in the 13th century. He built a palace and a court of justice in Prabhadevi, as well as the first Babulnath temple.<br>  <br>  The original Mahim town is located near Palghar about 60 miles north of Bombay. The ancient temple of Mahim or Mahikawati still exists here. The epic Ramayana mentions this temple when Ram and Laxman were captured by Ahiravan and Mahiravan and imprisoned in this temple. They were rescued by Hanuman from here. As it is known to the people who live in this beautiful village of Mahim; that after Raja Bhimdev lost his capital, i.e. Mahim, to another king, he established his new capital in the present Bombay region giving it the same name Mahim, which people now know. This fact is not known to most people.<br>  <br>  In 1343, this island was possessed by the Mohammedans of Gujarat. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. A dargah of Makhtum Fakir Ali Paru was built here in 1431.<br>  <br>  In 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, Charles the II, as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza. After British acquired Mumbai, they built the Mahim Fort here in order to protect themselves from the Portuguese. The fort today stands in ruins.<br>  <br>  The Causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from "Bunder" meaning port) was completed in 1845 at a total cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, wife of the first baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.<br>  <br>  In 1847, a small group of Scottish missionaries decided to start a new school, now one of the most high profile schools in Mumbai – the Bombay Scottish High School.<br>  <br>  Geography<br>  Mahim is surrounded by Bandra in North, Arabian Sea in West<br>  <br>  The Mahim fort<br>  The fort which was once visible from the Mahim Causeway and Bandra Reclamation, is barely visible now. The Mahim Fort is a part of the larger "Bombay Castle" or St. George's Castle. This castle was an important base during the time of the British Empire, but now all that remains are a few ramparts scattered about the city - Sion, Worli, Sewri and Mazgaon. The fort was built by in 1669, by the former Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier.<br>  <br>  Thomas Grantham then strengthened the fort's ramparts in 1684. In the year 1772, 111 years after Bombay was taken from them, the Portuguese attempted to attack this fort. The British replied fiercely with canon balls. In fact, the Bandra church also bore the brunt of their fire. There were about 100 soldiers and 30 cannons in the Mahim Fort at that time.<br>  <br>  Today the fort is almost ruined and encroachers and hutments occupy it.|`|AA11284541	longitude 55, latitude 48

Your teacher will eat it up.  If you have to read it word for word, just do it.  It probably won't affect your grade much if any at all.  Note cards help a lot if you use them but you have to know your topic well enough to look at keywords on a notecard and keep going.

AA10312525	I am a little hesitant to answer as this seems to be criminal justice homework.  It could also relate to the study of criminal law, but few law schools give multiple choice homework.<br>  <br>  The degree of intent is sort of a scale of assigning severity when considering aggravating factors in  a crime.  For example, the most severe form of murder, Murder 1, (or premeditated) includes an element of planning, making the crime intentional.  Other forms of homicide such as murder 2, include an element of knowing tht ones actions might result in the death of a person, but without premeditation.  If a person dies as a result of the negligence of another person, we consider that to be "negligent homicide", meaning that there was no intent for someone to die, but as a result of the reckless or negligent actions of the accused, a person dies.

AA11850523	Doctor Of Osteopathy<br>   doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.) is a physician licensed to perform surgery and prescribe medication. Like an M.D., an osteopath completes 4 years of medical school and can choose to practice in any specialty of medicine. However, osteopaths receive an additional 300 to 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system.<br>  <br>  Osteopathic medicine is dedicated to treating and healing the entire patient as a whole, rather than focusing on one system or body part. An osteopath will often use a treatment method called manipulation -- a hands-on approach to assure that the body is moving freely. This free motion ensures that all of your body's natural healing systems are free to work unhindered.<br>  <br>  Osteopaths hold to the principle that a patient's history of illness and physical trauma are written into the body's structure. The osteopath's highly developed sense of touch allows the physician to palpate (feel) the patient's "living anatomy" (the flow of fluids, motion and texture of tissues, and structural make-up).<br>  <br>  The osteopath's job is to "set" the body to heal itself. To do so, the Osteopath gently applies a precise amount of force to promote healthy movement of tissues, eliminate abnormal movements, and release compressed bones and joints. In addition, the areas being treated require proper positioning to assist the body's ability to regain normal tissue function. This process is called osteopathic manual medicine (OMM) or osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).<br>  <br>  Over the years, the gap between "conventional" medicine and osteopathic medicine has narrowed, as M.D.s have embraced many of the premises of osteopathic medicine (such as recognizing the impact of stress on the immune system or posture on various body systems). In addition, D.O.s have incorporated the diagnostic and treatment techniques common to conventional medicine.<br>  <br>  Doctors of osteopathic medicine may be found in nearly any health care setting, from community clinics and private practices to academic medical centers.<br>  <br>  Like M.D.s, osteopaths are licensed at the state level. Osteopaths who wish to specialize may become "board certified" (in much the same manner as M.D.s) by completing a 2- to 6-year residency within the specialty area and passing the board certification exams|`|4d99334f60856f1567cf86a73219976aaa	Doctor of Osteopathy.

003bc106659f3599d4ae53ff14fc81a0aa	El primer periódico fue el Acta diurna que Julio César mandaba colocar en el foro romano en el siglo I antes de nuestra era. En la baja Edad Media, las hojas escritas con noticias comerciales y económicas eran muy comunes en las bulliciosas calles de las ciudades burguesas. En Venecia, se vendían hojas al precio de una gazzetta, de las que provienen los nombres de muchos periódicos publicados en la Era Moderna y la Contemporánea. En los siglos XVIII y XIX, los líderes políticos tomaron conciencia del gran poder que podían tener las gacetas para influir en la población y proliferaron los periódicos de facciones y partidos políticos. Hacia fines del siglo XIX, los empresarios descubrieron el potencial comercial del periodismo y surgieron las primeras publicaciones parecidas a los diarios actuales. En los Estados Unidos, Joseph Pulitzer y William Randolph Hearst crearon grandes diarios destinados a la venta masiva. Nuevas invenciones, como el telégrafo, facilitaron la obtención de noticias. Surgieron, ya en el siglo XX, empresas dedicadas a recolección de informaciones sobre la actualidad que eran vendidas a los diarios. Estas empresas fueron conocidas como agencias periodísticas o agencias de prensa. La fotografía comenzó a usarse en la prensa diaria en 1880. Alemania fue el primer país que produjo revistas gráficas ilustradas con fotografías.<br>  <br>  En la década de los a?os 20 del siglo pasado surgieron las primeras emisoras de radio, que tomaron gran parte del protagonismo de los diarios en el seguimiento paso a paso de los hechos de actualidad. Las primeras emisiones de televisión se hicieron en los Estados Unidos en los a?os 30, y ya en los a?os 50 la televisión competía con la radio en la posibilidad de trasmitir instantáneamente la información, con el agregado seductor de la imagen.<br>  <br>  Convertido en el "cuarto poder" de las grandes democracias occidentales (los tres primeros son los que establecen las constituciones modernas: poder ejecutivo, legislativo y judicial), el periodismo oscila actualmente entre la imagen romántica de árbitro social y vocero de la "opinión pública", y la de empresa comercial sin escrúpulos que recurre a cualquier medio para llamar la atención y multiplicar sus ventas, sobre todo, la intrusión en las vidas privadas y la exagerada dimensión que otorga a noticias escandalosas y hechos policiales. Lo cierto es que el periodismo es un componente fundamental de la vida contemporánea y parece inseparable de los sistemas políticos democráticos. El periodismo creó, por sus necesidades de rápida lectura y comprensión y su supuesta neutralidad, un estilo redaccional que ha nutrido a numerosos escritores, los cuales formaron parte de sus planteles y se destacaron en sus columnas. Además ha creado prestigiosos y serios comentaristas de la vida social y política, vistió sus páginas con buenos humoristas y dibujantes; ha desarrollado desde el proyecto costumbrista hasta la investigación documentada.|`|f98a4c41273c1e5276d6b1a8805a5bf5aa	Viene por la peridicidad de las noticias, es decir, por la frecuencia en que son dadas.

98d66a136e461fb5f6ef9746f9678226aa	The term I think you are asking about is "postdoctorate" "postdoctoral fellow" or "postdoctoral associate".  It refers to a professional with a (typcially) recently-earned Ph.D. who is undergoing an apprenticeship of sorts to help them develop their professional career without the full responsibilities typical later in the career. A postdoctoral fellow typically accepts a lower wage than a standard professional Ph.D. for the opportunity to increase his or her skillset and thus future employment opportunity.    While most postdoctoral fellows earned their Ph.D. within the past few years, sometimes more experienced people will take a pay cut and return to the apprenticeship period to help break into another career path.  This is typical if they obtained an industrial job but desire to switch to a research academician pathway.|`|AA10926354	I think it refers to someone with an "earned" doctorate degree.

In the same scene Romeo gets in trouble for both Tybalt's death and Mercutio's death when Tybalt took Mercutio's life. In the latter part of Act 3, Juliet's parents and Paris constantly tell Juliet that she will marry Paris and that she needs a man so she would not be so sad, and the whole time she has her marriage with Romeo of which everyone else is clueless about. Also when everyone thinks that Juliet is crying over Tybalt's death, the reader knows that the crying is for Romeo.|`|c5b5637c7240ef901450212e4682312caa	It is ironic that Romeo and Juliet have just proclaimed their love for one and other despite their family's feud, but no more than a day later Romeo has more or less caused the death of Juliet's cousin. <br>  <br>  This is not really dramatic irony, but Mercutio says 'Ay, a scratch, a scratch' after he has just been fatally wounded.<br>  <br>  But it is possible that the answer your teacher is looking for has something to do with the fact that before Romeo left for the party (upon Mercutio's insistance and his ticket in), he got a feeling that something bad was going to effect him but he disregarded it and told fate to "direct my sail".

A portion of the chemical energy a cell produces is transformed into heat, and a portion into an electric current.<br>  <br>  A chemical action sets the electrons free, when it triggers the cathode slowly to dissolve into the liquid electrolyte. A circuit provides the escape route for the newly paroled electrons, and they rush down the hatch in the form of an electric current.

59457c0a753630a83c65eb48066a375baa	I think there are several things you can do.<br>  <br>  First, make sure you have a good environment for studying.  If you must go to a quiet library and sit somewhere with no distractions -- then do that.  <br>  <br>  Secondly,  study in timed increments.  Set your cell phone alarm clock or whatever, and study in maybe 30 - 60 minute increments.  Take a break and do something you like (TV show, computer fun-time, or whatever), but make sure you time yourself for that too.  Then, go back to studying.<br>  <br>  And Thirdly, try to have a good attitude about what you are studying.  Every subject can be interesting if you have a sincere desire to educate yourself.  Don't be afraid of the subject, just get outside help if you get stuck.  Procrastination is usually about doing something you dread.  And you dread it because you fear it!  Just go find resources that can help you understand your subject!! <br>  <br>  Good luck, and get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat healthy!|`|3440351ddef62e52fd6524cdfdf8b544aa	YOu can if you will set aside all other activities and problems...and definitely you have to have this determination in you....Success really depends on the person's character!!!|`|AA12306829	Don't smoke pot
KUnohBQZaa	When referring to books and literature, the present tense is always used.  Good luck!!|`|euVc2u5maa	I took many English and literature classes throughout high school and college, and I would say that nobody can answer this question for you, accept for your teacher. It completely depends on the assignment. Is she/he asking you to review something? In that case you might use the past tense. Or maybe she wants you to use your imagination to add your own chapter to the book- in which case you would continue the tense used throughout the book. The teacher probably has his or her own preference. <br>  <br>  The absolutely best thing you can do is communicate with your teacher. Let her know that tenses are confusing you, and ask her if she would further explain to you how she wants a particular paper written. Trust me, any decent teacher appreciates and respects good questions. She will know that you care about the assignment, your grades, and most importantly about her course.

b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	Normallly an annoted bibliography includes two parts.<br>  <br>  1) a full citation of the text (in this case the particular story).  Your instructor has probably told you what citation style to use--if not, ask/e-mail him/her to find out--and also where you can find a manuel/example sheet.  The most common forms are available online however, so you should be able to find them.  In your case its probably MLA (Modern Language Association) and tehy have examples on their website.<br>  <br>  2 The second part is a brief summary/evaluation.  This should be SHORT.  The contents can vary--depending on the purpose of the biblioggraphy.  (One I did recently for a research project where I work included a short evaluation purely in terms of an article's relevance to our project)<br>  <br>  But an annotation always includes a brief summary (2-3 sentances for a story/article/book chapter) or 4-5 sentances for a book--at most.  And for a class like this, perhaps a line or two of evaluation on your part--for instance, was it well-written and what does the story have to offer?  This "evaluation" should be no more than 1-2 sentances.<br>  <br>  That's the standard model--vary it to suit your professor's particular instructions if need be, of course.|`|5bc502dd1d4ad09ec078fddc0258caf3aa	Not me.|`|027c8e6717b551612929e25883283b88aa	An annotated bibliography is just like a regular bibliography except after you list each source, you explain what information you got from that source. The explanation doesn't have to be long. For example, if you used one of your sources for a picture, it would look like:<br>  1. <a href="http://www.whatever.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatever.com</a><br>        I used this source for the image shown in my report.<br>  Hope i helped!|`|AA10413836	bibliography would be a story about you. maybe use examples as in what they are talking about to talk about yourself. sounds like a creative writing assignment. make your kid do it if it's their lit class.

s9tvr0DTaa	John Hron (January 25, 1981 in Kung?lv – August 17, 1995 in Kung?lv) was a Swedish boy of Czech origin who was tortured and murdered by four young men on August 17, 1995. The month before his death, John had won a bronze medal in the national canoeing youth championships.<br>  <br>  John was murdered .... <br>  <br>  John was camping with a friend, Christian, by a small lake near the small town Kode in Kung?lv Municipality. Four young men, aged 15-18, appeared. The men, who had ties to the neonazi subculture, had bullied John for some time in school. That evening, John was told to say that he loves Nazis. He refused and was beaten until he did what he was told. The beating nevertheless continued and John was eventually thrown into the water. Soon after, they ordered John to swim back, which he refused. They then threatened to beat up John's friend instead, which made John return. Two hours of torture commenced. After he became unconscious, two of the attackers continued kicking him for several minutes. After that, they threw John's fractured body in the water. It quickly sunk.[1] Christian managed to escape and managed to alert the authorities after having hitch-hiked to a nearby village.|`|bs4EQtkvaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hron" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hron</a>

A trama, que, vale dizer, surpreendeu pela originalidade e uniu o país em torno de importantes quest?es do cotidiano, também nos empurrou garganta abaixo um Brasil fabricado, pomposo e desconhecido pela maioria da popula??o. Claro que a nossa abertura de texto reflete uma brincadeira, uma provoca??o bem-humorada “contra” os nossos irm?os do Rio, que sempre encaram tudo no maior alto astral. Sem dúvida, Barra da Tijuca e Recreio dos Bandeirantes s?o regi?es da capital fluminense onde o padr?o de vida é de primeiro mundo; discordar disso seria absurdo. Mas n?o é o glamour da cidade maravilhosa que está em quest?o.<br>  <br>  O ponto aqui é perceber como algumas “piadas” caminham de bra?os com a situa??o real, cutucando as feridas do contrastante reino tupiniquim. Existem “Leblons” espalhados por todo o território nacional, distantes dos grandes centros ou mesmo encravados neles, dividindo espa?o com palafitas. Lugares que sustentam uma riqueza frágil, amea?ada pela volatilidade econ?mica e pela fúria da corrup??o e exclus?o social. A palavra estabilidade, cujo significado prático já foi “vencer na vida”, simplesmente caiu, dando lugar a uma batalha desenfreada por espa?o.<br>  <br>  Até aí, nenhum ovo de Colombo. Quem nasceu no Brasil conhece a história toda de cor. Mas a triste novidade, que destruiu o nosso ecossistema conjuntural, foi o brutal aumento dos predadores em rela??o às presas. Em síntese, quem entrou no “novo esquema”, entrou. Caso contrário, é hora de se virar. O dinheiro sumiu, o mercado de trabalho encolheu, os clientes n?o aparecem mais, e o primo deputado foi cassado. Você ainda duvida que muitos moravam mesmo na Barra, antes de vir para os Estados Unidos limpar banheiro?<br>  <br>  Definitivamente, somos a na??o que mais desperdi?a conhecimento e talento. A falta de estrutura para absorver o gigantesco contingente de m?o-de-obra disponível, faz com que a porcentagem de “doutores” mergulhados na informalidade progrida geometricamente. Tem muito universitário vendendo pipoca no Brasil. E mesmo assim, quando o cinema fica vazio e a sobrevivência da família é amea?ada, nossos médicos, dentistas, advogados e psicólogos acabam encontrando no exterior uma espécie de “última chance.” A princípio, é difícil entender como alguém que estudou vários anos para construir uma carreira, simplesmente chuta tudo e sai do país. Há quem diga que a decis?o é radical, fruto de falta de coragem ou habilidade profissional para competir no mercado. Mas as notícias mostram o contrário: o sistema econ?mico brasileiro é cruel; os juros s?o astron?micos e acabam com as possibilidades de recupera??o de quem está em dificuldade. Embora se perceba certa euforia no campo do comércio internacional, o caos ainda parece muito perto.<br>  <br>  O desemprego na grande S?o Paulo está em torno dos (desesperadores) 20%. O salário mínimo n?o chega a 100 dólares mensais e a violência está fora de controle. Todos os dias, pais de família perdem a vida por conta de um par de sapatos ou um automóvel. Popula??o e autoridades apenas observam, imobilizadas pelo medo e pela incompetência administrativa. A corrup??o reina absoluta, e continua seduzindo desde síndicos de prédio, que desviam tímidas quantias dos fundos de obras, até grandes cérebros de renomadas institui??es financeiras e governamentais. Os jovens, mesmo os recém-formados em universidades de alto padr?o, terminam obrigados a trabalhar de gra?a, motivados pela cínica “chance de adquirir experiência.” Quase n?o há programas de incentivo à educa??o de base, muito menos política definida de encaminhamento profissional. Recentemente, um concurso para gari (isso mesmo, uma sele??o para varredores de rua), promovido pela prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro, transformou-se em cena lamentável, digna de enrubescer o mais patriota dos seres: milhares de pessoas, boa parte com nível superior no currículo, passaram noites na fila, a espera da entrevista. A impaciência, motivada pela necessidade de conquistar a vaga, gerou tumulto. A polícia usou bombas de efeito moral e balas de borracha, na tentativa de organizar a multid?o. O salário oferecido? R$ 600 por mês.<br>  <br>  O B&B pergunta: é melhor preservar o status social de certas profiss?es, convivendo com os riscos de um Estado frágil; ou o negócio é batalhar em uma na??o de primeiro mundo, onde qualquer emprego garante ao menos integridade física e dignidade material? O que fazer quando a falta de experiência (no caso dos recém-formados), a competitividade (para os expelidos do mercado), a decadência (que destrói quem n?o se recicla), ou simplesmente o “saco-cheio”, sufocam o sonho de uma carreira brilhante? Como fica a cabe?a do médico que, de repente, se vê lavando pratos? Quais s?o (ou foram) as principais dificuldades e o que mais dá saudade da “antiga” vida no Brasil? Ser feliz é possível ou a idéia de voltar atormenta? E a profiss?o original, fica para trás ou há chance de retomá-la em solo estrangeiro? Este mês, entrevistamos pessoas que passaram por reviravoltas de vida nos EUA. Confira as histórias.<br>  <br>  Edson Dias, contador, programador de computadores e desenhista arquitet?nico, veio para a América em busca de reconhecimento profissional, movido pela certeza de encontrar maiores oportunidades. Atualmente, como motorista da Disney, pensa de outra forma: “Eles (os americanos) querem mesmo é fazer dinheiro em cima do seu trabalho. Quando percebi isso já era tarde; havia perdido a identidade com o Brasil e n?o podia deixar de ajudar meu filho lá.” Edson, que antes de vir respondia pela parte contábil de uma importadora de vidros, encarou aqui diversos subempregos, entre eles o de lavador de pratos. “Lutei muito, e só consegui continuar porque estava bem preparado física e psicologicamente”, lembra. O carioca teve uma experiência familiar desagradável, quando sua esposa recusou-se a acompanhá-lo em busca do sonho americano. “Ela viria seis meses após a minha chegada, mas acabou desistindo. Fiquei sozinho, com a responsabilidade de sustentar uma crian?a de dez anos no Brasil.” Sobre retomar a carreira, Dias descarta a possibilidade: “Tudo é diferente, principalmente as leis. Muito difícil.” Ele confessa que sente falta da vida social que tinha no Rio, pois lá “saía com os amigos, viajava, velejava e tudo mais; aqui n?o fa?o sequer um exercício físico. S?o 14 anos só trabalhando; até o colesterol aumentou.” Mas nem tudo é negativo para Edson Dias. Ele se mostra feliz por ter “entrado em contato com Jesus” na América, e por viver em um país que garante os direitos do cidad?o. “N?o dependo mais do homem, e sim de Jesus”, afirma. “E tenho o privilégio de viver num lugar seguro, onde posso contar com a Justi?a e as autoridades”, finaliza.<br>  <br>  O dentista Jandir Bernardo Silva Jr. n?o veio por dinheiro. Ele nos conta que, em Recife, possuía uma clínica com 16 salas e extensa carta de pacientes. Além disso, ainda era contratado do governo municipal há 12 anos. “Eu estava mesmo é de saco cheio. No nordeste, as pessoas falam muito em sofrimento e problemas; isso n?o me faz bem.” Jandir gosta de dizer que “quem tem raiz é árvore”, e lembra que se aventurou por diversas profiss?es e lugares diferentes, até vir para os Estados Unidos.<br>  <br>  Aos 15 anos de idade, estudou em New Jersey por oito meses, quando se interessou pela organiza??o dos americanos. “Antes da odontologia, fiz engenharia e tive um restaurante, um bar, óticas e bancas de jornal. Mas o que me interessa mesmo na vida é buscar aprimoramento moral. Profiss?o é pura prática.” Nos EUA, trabalhou com limpeza e como ajudante de cozinheiro. Hoje possui uma van de sorvetes, e atende crian?as em regi?es menos favorecidas. “Gosto de lidar com o povo”, exclama Bernardo. O pernambucano já tentou retomar sua profiss?o original aqui, mas as barreiras do idioma, os custos elevados e os planos de retornar ao Brasil o fizeram desistir. Para quem quer ficar, mas ainda sofre com a quest?o profissional, o dentista deixa um conselho: “o melhor é combater o sofrimento e viver um dia de cada vez, perseguindo os sonhos e aproveitando esta chance de se reencontrar com a humildade”.<br>  <br>  Fabiana Cerqueira, engenheira elétrica de sistemas, assimilou com tranqüilidade a reviravolta profissional: “Sou muito adaptável. Onde Deus me manda, fico bem. Vim para casar, pois meu marido estava aqui há muito tempo. Sempre fui consciente de que n?o teria certas regalias, como ficar em casa por doen?a ou aproveitar finais de semana inteiros. Mas sempre lidei bem com isso. Pensei até que as coisas pudessem ser piores, e gra?as a Deus, n?o foram.” Fabiana, que hoje trabalha com remessas de dinheiro, entende que qualquer trabalho tem mais valor que status social: “O importante é se expandir, viajar e conhecer novas realidades. Se você teve o privilégio de estudar e continuar na área, ótimo. Se n?o, é fundamental manter-se trabalhando com dignidade, fazendo tudo da melhor forma possível”, ressalta. Mas a ex-consultora da Xerox confessa sentir saudade da estrutura trabalhista brasileira, que oferece muito mais benefícios que a americana. E pretende retomar a carreira construída no Brasil: “Por enquanto, aplico meus conhecimentos de acordo com a nova realidade de trabalho. Mas n?o vou jogar fora anos de estudo e especializa??o.” Ela faz quest?o de encerrar com palavras de gratid?o ao Criador: “Com Deus você sempre é feliz, n?o importa onde nem o que fa?a.”<br>  <br>  Getulio Oliveira, administrador de empresas formado pela Universidade Federal do Pernambuco, entende que n?o vale a pena insistir na América. “Quando vim para cá, achei que estava tendo uma oportunidade. Porém, depois de conhecer a verdade das coisas, cheguei à conclus?o de que prefiro estar no meu país. Lá sim somos cidad?os, mesmo com todas as dificuldades e problemas. Lá posso exercer minha profiss?o; aqui n?o. O Brasil é a minha casa.” Nos Estados Unidos, Getulio já trabalhou em uma lavanderia, e hoje é “houseman” de hotel. Ele assume que se sente diminuído ao “tirar roupa suja do carrinho das camareiras” e trabalhar ao lado de pessoas que n?o sabem escrever o próprio nome. Ex-funcionário do Unibanco, Oliveira admite que a falta de fluência no idioma inglês, a distancia da família e os tipos de trabalho destinados aos imigrantes s?o os fatores que mais o desencorajam. “Tenho saudade da minha liberdade; de fazer o que gosto e praticar o que estudei durante a vida toda.”<br>  <br>  “Resolvi mudar para me reencontrar com a paz interna, depois de viver situa??o trágica na família”, afirma o cirurgi?o facial Alfredo Botelho. Segundo ele, que hoje se considera feliz, o conceito de êxito na América varia de acordo com cada propósito. “Tem gente que só vem pra fazer fortuna (chegando até a morar com dez pessoas num apartamento), e outros que procuram expandir horizontes e viver bem. S?o casos totalmente diferentes”, compara. O médico nunca se incomodou em trabalhar fora da área de forma??o, e compreende que, nos dias de hoje, “status n?o importa; o que vale é alcan?ar a satisfa??o.” De acordo com o carioca, todo trabalho é digno: “Especialmente aqui, onde se consegue as coisas em muito menos tempo. N?o é nenhuma vergonha trocar o diploma por algo que dê mais retorno.” Botelho lembra que já veio preparado psicologicamente para “come?ar por baixo”. Lavou pratos, foi “houseman” e também passou por uma lavanderia. Hoje é gerente de área de uma empresa hoteleira, respondendo por toda a regi?o de Tampa e Clearwater. “Sempre tive jogo de cintura para perceber que os problemas do come?o eram parte de um processo, iniciado a partir da decis?o de viver nos Estados Unidos. Isso ajudou muito.” Alfredo Botelho tem planos de voltar a atuar na área da saúde, mas “devido aos tramites burocráticos que envolvem a decis?o, o projeto está temporariamente adiado.”<br>  <br>  Ronaldo Carvalho atuou como arquiteto e psicólogo no Brasil. Também estudou comunica??o social, chegando a escrever para um jornal. Em determinada época, largou tudo para se dedicar a uma grande paix?o: voar. Por mais de 10 anos, foi comissário de bordo da Transbrasil. Já conhecia os EUA, pois sempre vinha pra cá com a família. Em uma dessas viagens, prometeu “que ganharia dinheiro nesta terra.” A Tranbrasil quebrou, e a oportunidade de cumprir a promessa apareceu de repente. Hoje em dia, Ronaldo trabalha na portaria do parque Wet’n Wild e no South Gate Hotel. Abriu m?o de todas as suas habilidades, mas n?o sofreu nenhum trauma com a transi??o: “em termos de condi??o de vida, educa??o geral e moradia, os EUA d?o um banho no Brasil. Aqui n?o há discrimina??o por idade ou ra?a, e quem se forma na universidade tem muito mais condi??o de atuar na área.” Carvalho diz que atingiu maturidade suficiente para entender que “títulos e cargos n?o enchem barriga.” E afirma que seria capaz de repetir toda a “aventura” novamente.|`|56c42f0fc9c0f780104e007f5531f638aa	Sei algumas informa??es, porque sou enfermeira e quase fui trabalhar lá, ano passado, descobri que os unicos cursos superiores que é aceito o nosso diploma lá é de enfermeiro e de fisioterapeuta,como tecnico, infelizmente será muito dificil...depois de fazer a faculdade de enfermagem, voce tem de passar num teste de conhecimentos de enfermagem em ingles, fazer uma entrevista, mandar seu curriculo pra alguns hospitais e aguardar, eles tem interesse, porque lá tem necessidade destes profissionais de enfermagem , mas tem de ser curso superior, inclusive eles d?o green card,assim que conseguir ser registrado.,claro que depois de um tempo....tambem tem de fazer um teste no org?o de enfermagem deles,é uma etapa dificil, mas n?o impossivel, conhe?o uma enfermeira que conseguiu e n?o voltou mais, porque eles ganham em torno de 3.500 dolares mensais, se fizer extra é bem remunerado e lá tem plano de carreira, se no futuro voce  se destacar pode ter cargo de chefia e ganhar muito mais,depende de voce , e n?o esque?a tem de ter o ingles fluente...boa sorte, espero ter ajudado...

SYYO9LUDaa	Most schools offer a PR degree under the college of Communications, but as a ten year veteran and someone who has hired 30+ marketing and PR staff, I'd do a Journalism degree, and an internship with a publication or media outlet.  If your school doesn't offer either, consider a Business Marketing degree or an English degree - both are critical elements of understanding for a career in PR.<br>  <br>  <br>  I entered the field through Finance, but unless you want to pursue Investor Relations, I wouldn't go that route.|`|L28baPnpaa	You could easily do Communication Studies if you want to work for a company ... you could also do a minor in business if that is what you want.
YpFNEskoaa	You may encounter some troubles at first. To get into most master's programs, they seem to pick bachelor grads with G.P.A.s of 3.5 or higher. Your B average, or 3.0 g.p.a. is pretty good. Its should be enough to get you in, but some problems my come, such as a placement test (depending on your vertical curriculum).<br>  <br>  BUT, since you're not done with your bachelor's yet, try very, very hard to ace the rest of your classes to raise your g.p.a. Even if your g.p.a. doesn't go up significantly, when looking at your transcript and application they will see that you finished your major strong. Take advantage of any and every opportunity that comes your way.

8vOPMannaa	well my brother has autism and the visual schedule works great for him.  i don't know how old your cousin is, but my brother is 8 and he loves matching games.

That way he has visual representation and it won't change, the game will always stay the same.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	He needs a visual schedule - students/children on the spectrum really do not retain nor do they have the working memory to know what to do typically to auditory information.  You need to work on telling/showing him what he CAN do instead.  Just telling him to stop doing something does not help as much as giving him a replacement behavior.

Also, your cumulative is a 3.7? Your numbers are fantastic, and your MCAT is probably one of the highest in the country. However, admissions to every top medical school requires shadowing of a physician and some work in the medical field. Your work in a lab is great, but I'd recommend getting some volunteer work, if you lack this. Don't worry about not being published if you're not interested in MD/Ph.D programs. While it certainly is a big boost, there are many students applying without publications, and there are many more applying to many of the schools you've listed with considerably poorer statistics. <br>  I'd say find a physician to shadow, and do medical volunteer work, and you'll have some great options. And your age won't hurt you.

I think you could get into most other medical schools though.<br>  <br>  <br>  But a 3.7 is fine--it will get you in the ball game for most med schools, including Ivys.

In the elimination process, the object is to eliminate one of the variables.  You do this by getting the coefficients of the variable you are eliminating to be opposite numbers.  In your case, if you want to eliminate x, you need to get the coefficient of x in the first equation to be the opposite of the coeff. of x in the 2nd equat.  You can do this by multiplying the 1st equat by 3 to get 6x - 15y = 129 and multiplying the 2nd equation by -2 to get -6x - 8y = -56 <br>  <br>  Now add the two equations<br>  <br>  6x - 15y = 129<br>  -6x - 8y = -56<br>  <br>  -23y = 73<br>  <br>  y = -73/23    Now substitute this value in for y in either equat. and solve for x.  It would be a good idea to check your answer and see if the values work in the other equation.

DTkAVdk4aa	If you aren’t getting straight A’s it is your teachers’ fault, not yours.  Good teachers, like the ones I have, can make even the really dull stuff seem interesting if they like their jobs.  Subjects like history and grammar may not seem that important in real life, but whether you are planning to be a carpenter, hair dresser, or doctor, everything you learn in school is important!<br>  <br>  For example, if you are planning on owning your own business you will need good grammar when you write your letter to apply for a business loan.  Knowledge of history and politics will come in handy with the big foreign client that you impress with your knowledge of their culture and customs.  <br>  <br>  If your teachers aren’t making your subjects interesting for you then it is up to you to find ways to make learning fun.  Try studying with friends, use flash cards, or make up games.  If you like computers, write a fun computer program that will quiz you on the subjects you are having a tough time with.  <br>  <br>  I promise that even the stuff that seems like it makes absolutely no sense for you to learn is teaching you something valuable, discipline.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I am a nerd, but I like learning because it opens so many doors and lets you see that if you can dream it you can achieve it!|`|UxBL7K3uaa	having excellent grades plays an important role on the colleges you will be applying to.

R94PIATQaa	The SAT essay will be pretty simple IF you enjoy philosophy and social sciences. The questions they may ask you are usually controversial and require deep thinking. To write a successful essay, you will need an analytical yet open mind. Also, the essay requires you to give specific examples (either from history or from personal experience)-three examples is your ideal number. <br>  <br>  A good essay has 5 paragraphs-introduction paragraph (about 3 sentences long, giving hints as to what you're going to talk about in the essay), 3 body paragraphs (1 paragraph for each example), and a concluding paragraph (restating your thesis).<br>  <br>  Put yourself in the point of view of a SAT essay grader. Surprisingly, these graders are actually just Average Joes-not professors or doctors, like you may think! They sit in the office, all day long, correcting/commenting on essays after essay. You will want to grab their attention! So, start your essay in a way that gets right up close and personal (e.g. start with a question or a crude statement or be sarcastic!). They love that. Also, end with a strong sentence.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind the graders are only going to read your essay ONCE, and ONCE ONLY. There are 2 graders for each essay and they will give you a mark out of a possible 6 (so, maximum of 12 points in total, for your essay). They will only mark their OVERALL impression of your essay-but that's it. So, make sure that your essay flows well and is easy to read! <br>  <br>  ~Good luck :)<br>  <br>  p.s: I just did a practice SAT this week organized by the Princeton Review and the question was: Do you think people show a lot of their personality simply based on the decisions they make?|`|LYrSOdCBaa	From experience, I find that the essay section of the SAT is not difficult. The essay basically asks that you give your opinion. Here are some questions they might ask:<br>  1. Is envy a strong motivator for personal success?<br>  2. Does imitation demonatrate a sluggish imagination?<br>  3. Is leisure reading a luxury that on;y the priviledge can enjoy?<br>  4. Is wisdom a more valuable personal asset than kindheartedness?<br>  <br>  Basically, they are yes and no questions, but to have a strong essay, you need to provide decent examples.<br>  Hope this helps.

AA11103615	The Stamp Act was passed by the British Parliament on March 22, 1765. The new tax was imposed on all American colonists and required them to pay a tax on every piece of printed paper they used. Ship's papers, legal documents, licenses, newspapers, other publications, and even playing cards were taxed. The money collected by the Stamp Act was to be used to help pay the costs of defending and protecting the American frontier near the Appalachian Mountains (10,000 troops were to be stationed on the American frontier for this purpose).<br>  <br>  The actual cost of the Stamp Act was relatively small. What made the law so offensive to the colonists was not so much its immediate cost but the standard it seemed to set. In the past, taxes and duties on colonial trade had always been viewed as measures to regulate commerce, not to raise money. The Stamp Act, however, was viewed as a direct attempt by England to raise money in the colonies without the approval of the colonial legislatures. If this new tax were allowed to pass without resistance, the colonists reasoned, the door would be open for far more troublesome taxation in the future.<br>  <br>  Few colonists believed that they could do anything more than grumble and buy the stamps until the Virginia House of Burgesses adopted Patrick Henry's Stamp Act Resolves. These resolves declared that Americans possessed the same rights as the English, especially the right to be taxed only by their own representatives; that Virginians should pay no taxes except those voted by the Virginia House of Burgesses; and that anyone supporting the right of Parliament to tax Virginians should be considered an enemy of the colony. The House of Burgesses defeated the most extreme of Henry's resolutions, but four of the resolutions were adopted. Virginia Governor Fauquier did not approve of the resolutions, and he dissolved the House of Burgesses in response to their passage.<br>  <br>  The Townshend Acts, British legislation intended to raise revenue, tighten customs enforcement, and assert imperial authority in America, were sponsored by Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend, (right - 1725-67) and enacted on June 29, 1767. The key statute levied import duties on glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea. Its purpose was to provide salaries for some colonial officials so that the provincial assemblies could not coerce them by withholding wages.

a4hJti3Kaa	This will start you off,<br>  <br>  Shakuntala Devi is a calculating prodigy who was born on November 4, 1939 in Bangalore, India. Her father worked in a circus as a trapeze and tightrope performer, and later as a human cannonball. Her calculating gifts first demonstrated themselves while she was doing card tricks with her father when she was three. They report she "beat" them by memorization of cards rather than by sleight of hand. By age six she demonstrated her calculation and memorization abilities at the University of Mysore. At the age of eight she had success at Annamalai University by doing the same.<br>  <br>  Unlike many other calculating prodigies, for example Truman Henry Safford, her abilities did not wane in adulthood. In 1977 she extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number mentally. On June 18, 1980 she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers 7,686,369,774,870 x 2,465,099,745,779 picked at random by the Computer Department of Imperial College, London. She answered the question in 28 seconds. Her correct answer was 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730. This event is mentioned on page 26 of the 1995 Guinness Book of Records ISBN 0-553-56942-2.<br>  <br>  Shakuntala Devi has written a number of books, many of them dealing with popular mathematics. She has also written a cookbook for men. She is a devout Hindu who feels a strong connection to Ganesha, whom she connects to her gifts. She is also interested in astrology and in recent years she has offered personal astrology consultations in India and the United States.<br>  <br>  In 2006 she has released a new book called In the Wonderland of Numbers with Orient Paperbacks which talks about a girl Neha and her fascination for numbers. The book is in the form of story and will excite the readers about numbers and number theory.|`|4k0aMBPqaa	which school r u from<br>  Am i right if i say ur from 9B of IEA<br>  And wats ur name

WSXZ6tEMaa	?Noticias retransmitidas a través de imágenes y sonidos?|`|Lpur61m8aa	Se ha insistido excesivamente en dividir la programación y las funciones de los medios en compartimentos incompatibles según la información, formación, diversión y persuasión. Pero la regla de oro de todo programador es congregar estas funciones en cada unidad programática. De esta manera, por ejemplo, lo formativo, o antiformativo se encuentra diseminado en el conjunto y continuidad de programas. Programar es planificar, distribuir, dosificar y ordenar unos mensajes a lo largo del tiempo. Tal acción programática corresponde no sólo a los elaboradores de cada programa, sino a la emisora. Es precisamente a través de la programación como la empresa radiotelevisiva, estatal o privada, de servicio público o comercial, manifiesta su ideología y sus tendencias educativas o antieducativas. <br>  <br>  El mensaje se sitúa en el punto de relaciones de competitividad y complementariedad de las emisoras de televisión existentes en un país y dentro de cada una de ellas en los diversos programas o canales que ofrezcan. El mensaje educativo emana de todas las posibilidades que el receptor tiene de seleccionar mensajes televisivos. De poco sirve crear programas específicamente educativos si en otras emisoras se desatienden tales orientaciones o se va directamente contra los principios que dan vida a dicho canal. Se requiere una labor conjunta y coordinada. Más que preocuparse por la creación de una televisión educativa debería preocupar la educación que se emite por el mismo u otros canales no denominados educativos, pero que tienen más repercusión en la sociedad por ser los de mayor atractivo para la audiencia. <br>  <br>  La televisión se ha convertido en la constante acompa?ante del individuo, familias y grupos en las horas de ocio. Y entre los sectores sociales hay que destacar, por la importancia en la formación y desarrollo de su personalidad, el de los ni?os. La televisión al presentar a los ni?os los primeros descubrimientos del mundo se convierte en la guía y forjadora de su cosmovisión. Pero lo que la televisión ofrece son unas realidades artificiales, unos reflejos aparentes y a veces encubridores de la autenticidad de las personas y de los hechos. Y esto ocurre por la mediación humana y por la intercalación de medios técnicos que crean un nuevo mundo. La televisión agranda o empeque?ece la realidad, crea espacios y tiempos nuevos, la transforma y la interpreta. <br>  <br>  Cada día se hace más imprescindible, como necesidad social, la ense?anza de la lectura y análisis de los mensajes audiovisuales y en particular de los subyacentes en los informativos. Aunque la imagen surge en los albores de la humanidad como sistema mágico y comunicativo, es, no obstante, en nuestros días, gracias a las nuevas técnicas productoras y multiplicadoras de imágenes, cuando podemos decir que la sociedad actual vive envuelta en una imagosfera de cuya gravitación ya nadie puede evadirse. Nuestro tiempo será incomprensible sin la consideración de la importancia de los medios de comunicación y en especial de la televisión. <br>  <br>  No se trata de abandonar definitivamente el aprendizaje de la lectura alfabética y comprensión de textos escritos, sino de incorporar la ense?anza del lenguaje icónico. No se puede caer en el error de que tal lectura es innata. Sólo la adquisición de una personal y responsable descodificación de los mensajes emitidos por los medios podrá ofrecer al hombre actual el bagaje necesario para defenderse de la contaminación icónica que ha invadido su entorno vital y social. Pero paradójicamente, los medios en general y la televisión en particular, en lugar de responsabilizar a la audiencia, en lugar de dar orientaciones para que se seleccionen programas que fomenten el desarrollo libre de la personalidad y el aumento del nivel cultural, lo que hacen es promover aquellos programas de más atractivo comercial. <br>  <br>  La televisión lejos de ofrecer una lectura fácil de su sistema textual como se cree con excesiva ligereza, presenta una organización muy compleja. Lamentablemente su estudio apenas si ha penetrado de forma subrepticia en las ense?anzas básicas y medias. La iniciación a lo que los medios de difusión representan en la actualidad y una preparación para que el hombre desde la edad escolar aprenda a enfrentarse con ellos, sería uno de los mejores antídotos frente al avasallador potencial educativo/antieducativo de sus propuestas textuales. Hay que destacar en contrapartida que la acción debe partir previamente de la propia televisión con una concepción educativa de la realidad que ofrece y en particular de los informadores. La responsabilidad es de todos. <br>  Por ello se desprende la necesidad y exigencia de que los informadores por sus posibles influjos en la sociedad actual para configurar la personalidad de los telespectadores, sean conscientes de la función educativa que cumplen sin proponérselo paralelamente a la informativa con tanta o más repercusión que la efectuada por los educadores durante el período escolar, pues su acción será permanente y casi exclusiva para la mayoría de los telespectadores desde que abandonan las aulas. Su trabajo es el de mediador y no el de un impostor; el de un investigador y no el de un encubridor de los aspectos, antecedentes y consecuencias de los hechos para situarlos en sus contextos con el fin de que el espectador con toda la información que le recopilen elabore un juicio crítico sobre los hechos. El informador actúa como un documentalista que recopila todos los datos informativos necesarios para que otra persona, el telespectador, configure su versión sin necesidad de dedicarse personalmente a tal investigación. <br>  <br>  1. Dimensión educativa de la programación televisiva <br>  <br>  La programación informativa en televisión recoge los problemas, tensiones y soluciones políticas, económicos o sociales de la vida cotidiana. La manera de enfocar tales hechos e ideas comporta una determinada visión de la realidad. Cada informador, cada emisora, a pesar de sus intenciones de respeto por la objetividad, ofrece una interpretación conforme a su formación, ideología y cosmovisión. La audiencia que siga sólo un medio informativo recibirá un enfoque único, sin contrastarlo con otras versiones y opiniones sobre los aconteceres. Su conocimiento de la marcha social, política y cultural del país dependerá del prisma de la emisora que ha difundido la información. Estará condicionado por el medio. La forma de contrarrestar tal información puede desarrollarla con amistades, compa?eros de trabajo y familiares, pero siempre tendrá como referencia lo recibido por el medio y la credibilidad que en él tenga. La audiencia recibe la información sin que con antelación, próxima o remota, se le haya preparado y formado para filtrar y reflexionar sobre los mensajes emanados de los programas. El espectador individual, y la audiencia en general, desarrollan su experiencia personal de la historia reciente, mediante la información diaria que seleccionan y elaboran los medios de difusión especialmente los audiovisuales. <br>  <br>  Los educadores y familias se preocupan por la falta de programas televisivos para ni?os. Se preocupan también ante los existentes por la carga educativa que encierran: les incomoda la orientación de los programas infantiles y juveniles. Se olvidan con frecuencia que los ni?os suelen seguir más los programas para adultos que los dirigidos a ellos, especialmente cuando sobrepasan los ocho a?os. Incluso en aquellos casos en que los padres son los que efectúan la selección y no permiten que sus hijos vean otros, los ni?os no estarán exentos de que a mitad de programa les introduzcan unos mensajes publicitarios y de autopromoción dirigidos a adultos, y que antes o inmediatamente después se encuentre con programas informativos o programas dirigidos a otras audiencias. Este sentido programático es específico de la televisión. La televisión no puede ser analizada por programas aislados, sino en el conjunto programático. Es a través de este entramado como se transmite el mensaje definitivo de la televisión. Todavía se sigue, tal vez por inercia, comparando un programa de televisión a una película cuando ambos funcionan de forma distinta. Ni siquiera la película que se pasa por televisión es la misma que se ve en las salas cinematográficas. No sólo hay una transformación técnica, sino que se la introduce en unos contextos modificadores parcialmente de su sentido autónomo como película. <br>  <br>  Se pierde además la perspectiva de que la edad infantil y juvenil, aunque fundamental en la construcción del hombre, sin embargo, es un tránsito rápido hacia la edad adulta. Si los programas infantiles y juveniles alcanzan desde los cuatro hasta los dieciséis, es decir, doce o quince a?os de una persona, los programas informativos a los que se expondrá cubrirán más de cuarenta o cincuenta a?os de vida adulta. Estos programas informativos son con frecuencia la fuente fundamental del conocimiento del mundo que gira alrededor de cada uno. Su personalidad no se construye en estos a?os, pero sí se desarrolla paralelamente a ellos. La escuela, los centros de educación ense?an la historia, pero apenas se les ense?a a mirar el mundo que les rodea. No se le ense?a a interpretar la información de la actualidad. Lo que sabe no es por la recepción crítica del plan de estudios, sino por la permanente exposición a los mensajes televisivos. Ve el mundo actual no por lo que le ense?an en la escuela, sino por lo que observa fuera, en la otra escuela: la televisión. El hombre actual recibe el conocimiento de su entorno gracias a los nuevos medios de difusión y en particular a la televisión como lo demuestran las encuestas sobre el uso del tiempo de ocio. <br>  <br>  Gran porcentaje de la población ve la televisión diariamente. Parte de la misma no lee nunca el periódico. La visión del mundo actual de estas personas depende de la información dada por la televisión. Por este motivo hay que atender no sólo el corpus de los denominados restringidamente programas educativos, sino también aquellos programas más seguidos por la sociedad y en los que subyacen unos mensajes educativos paralelos: los informativos. Se trata de captar la incidencia no sólo en el saber (experiencia transmitida por los informadores), sino también en la sensibilidad, afectividad, modelos de comportamientos y, en definitiva, en el desarrollo de la personalidad, en el ?aprender a ser?. <br>  <br>  1.1. Fomento de la sensibilidad analítica y crítica <br>  <br>  Tal embrión educativo hay que entreverlo en el análisis semiótico de los contenidos informativos. Las redes de signos, el cruce de ideas dulcificadas en colores y en representaciones lúdicas e hilarantes han tendido una malla que apenas deja ver la realidad directamente. La inmensa mayoría de la experiencia acumulada por el hombre actual no es elaborada personalmente, sino trasvasada por otras personas. Se tiene una idea del mundo presente —en su sentido espacial y temporal— no por conocimiento directo, sino por los mensajes emanados de los medios. <br>  <br>  La información televisiva es una práctica en la que confluyen la técnica, la comunicación y la pedagogía. Un ejemplo de tres funciones unidas en un mismo quehacer. Todo intento y provocación de división de fuerzas producirá inmediatamente una víctima: el destinatario. <br>  <br>  La programación televisiva es un canal de la ideología del grupo que la domina. Mientras el telespectador no ejerza un juicio crítico de lo que recibe los mensajes entrarán en su vida sin discernimiento alguno. Entre lo diversivo, lo persuasivo, lo informativo, se infiltran concepciones del mundo, puntos de vista de otras personas que intentan atraerle o confirmarle en la ideología mientras le ocultan la de otros. Ningún mensaje es neutral, ni inocente. <br>  <br>  Lo educativo en el ámbito de la información no es un apartado encasillado dentro del texto total. Es uno de los niveles en que se organiza. Un texto es susceptible de múltiples lecturas. Depende de la óptica adoptada. Aquí interesa examinar el nivel de significación educativa presente en los textos informativos. <br>  <br>  Con el análisis no se trata de separar y aislar lo que forma un bloque unitario. Los programas son la concentración de diversos textos cada uno de ellos con una carga emocional e ideológica peculiares. Será tanto más vivo, más atractivo, interesante y perdurable cuanto más reúna todos los valores. De ahí que lo que se pretende es optar por una perspectiva educativa y efectuar un zoom sobre la información televisiva, transmisora de un sistema de valores, orientaciones de la personalidad, incidencia de la sensibilidad, afectividad de las personas y de la sociedad global. La semiótica educativa se concentra sobre todos los códigos susceptibles de catalogación. Nunca se sabe cuáles son los que la audiencia heterogénea va a descodificar con mayor influencia en su vida, tanto en un sentido funcional como disfuncional, tal como lo ha comprobado la sociología. La semiótica se encarga de detectar la ideología subyacente tras los signos elegidos para representar informativamente unos hechos. <br>  <br>  1.2. Tendencia aseverativa e impostora <br>  <br>  La información televisiva dimana de una tecnología que afronta la realidad mediante la selección, valoración, tratamiento y presentación. Frente al criterio y concepción de la información como reflejo, como espejo de la realidad, se impone el de la interpretación. Se piensa que la televisión al emplear una tecnología, permite ver la realidad tal cual es por el simple hecho de instalar las cámaras ante la misma. Pero la técnica transforma la realidad, incorpora su ?subjetividad? interpretativa. El mito de la técnica objetiva hay que desecharlo desde el momento en que toda técnica, además de ser manejada por personas, a?ade modificaciones propias según los aparatos y dispositivos seleccionados para cada proceso informativo. <br>  <br>  Han cambiado también las posibilidades de acceso a la información. El conocimiento del entorno se ha ampliado a todo el globo. El ni?o puede recibir información elaborada en un país extranjero sobre otro país lejano. La experiencia directa del entorno inmediato, de pocos kilómetros de diámetro, se ve contrastada constantemente con la experiencia artificial e indirecta de la televisión por satélite. Su vida se ve, además, sacudida por esta nueva situación. Hoy es tan ciudadano del mundo como de su aldea o barrio particular y, sin embargo, por diversas dificultades apenas tiene posibilidad de adquirir una experiencia directa de hechos lejanos. <br>  <br>  Además de los cambios técnicos en el orden geopolítico hay otros internos que varían la capacidad de selección, tratamiento y presentación. La informática invade horizontalmente todo el proceso de producción informativa. Surge una manera nueva de ver la realidad. Las imágenes adquieren rasgos sintéticos, rotan sobre sí mismas, vuelan por la pantalla, se desdoblan, adquieren configuraciones efectistas y una sensación tridimensional superior. Las imágenes se asocian a sonidos nuevos. Se ve la realidad con unos sonidos peculiares e incluso identificadores, como sucede con toda la información relacionada con el descubrimiento del espacio sideral. El grafismo electrónico es capaz de simular la realidad de hechos no captados por las cámaras. La simulación dibuja guerras galácticas posibles pero inexistentes. Se adquiere experiencia de la realidad antes de que ésta exista. Se genera una preparación inconsciente antes del previsible cumplimiento de los hechos. <br>  <br>  Las informaciones se llenan de escritura fija o en movimiento. Nace una manera de leer una escritura fugaz e interrelacionada simultáneamente con imágenes y sonidos. No es la lectura sosegada de un libro, ni de la pantalla electrónica, sino una manera nueva que obliga a multiplicar los reflejos de descodificación audiovisual de manera cada vez más acelerada. <br>  <br>  La innovación técnica propicia nuevos recursos expresivos no sólo en la presentación de nuevas imágenes, de realidades nunca vistas, e incluso nunca producidas, sino también en la organización secuencial con que se muestra la realidad. Las técnicas del montaje multiplican las perspectivas de aproximación a la realidad. Hay un incremento de noticias, pero que por su corta duración apenas permiten entender su alcance; se acumulan los puntos de vista, la presencia de protagonistas y testigos, se contrastan hechos y opiniones, se sirven síntesis informativas con muy escaso tiempo para su análisis. <br>  <br>  Estos enfoques incrementan la característica esencial de la televisión de transformar toda realidad que capta en espectáculo. Incluso las situaciones más dramáticas como las de los hechos bélicos o terroristas las convierte en el espectáculo del dolor y desgarro humano tan subyugante. <br>  <br>  Tal espectáculo llega a confundirse, por la secuencialidad de la presentación, con el de las imágenes de ficción. La realidad se convierte en un relato en el que las técnicas de elaboración de lo ficticio y de lo real se trasvasan recíprocamente con facilidad y llegan a confundirse con el transcurso del tiempo en la mente del espectador. <br>  <br>  La cantidad de información televisiva satura la memoria. Hechos de enorme transcendencia son igualados y aún superados por otros de mayor trivialidad. El torrente de imágenes comprime la sensación del tiempo. <br>  <br>  Hay, pues, unas repercusiones en el conocimiento y formación de la sensibilidad y actitud de los espectadores. La realidad es percibida según los hábitos generados por la cadencia de las imágenes. Se percibe una realidad irreal por la ralentización, aceleración, repetición o concentración en determinados aspectos de la misma. Se habitúa a ver la realidad de modo distinto, de tal manera que cuando se vive la experiencia directa se echa en falta la experiencia indirecta y artificial. <br>  <br>  Es exigible, en consecuencia, desde la responsabilidad educativa social, una orientación de la información a los hechos que de verdad interesen para el desarrollo permanente de la vida humana en sus comportamientos personales y convivencia social. La televisión, nacida para difundir a todas partes el presente, no puede quedarse en un mero retrovisor con parabrisas empa?ado o roto. Su misión es la de propagar una información y, paralelamente, una educación sobre la actualidad, desde la actualidad y para la actualidad. La concepción educativa de la información exige la presentación de la multiplicidad de puntos de vista ante los hechos sin ocultar ninguno importante. <br>  <br>  Se modifica también la relación entre emisor y receptor por la aplicación de técnicas de consultas automáticas para la detección de opiniones sobre un hecho o unos argumentos que se presentan en ese momento. De esta manera se generan procesos de influencia en la propia construcción de las interpretaciones y opiniones de los hechos. Son situaciones renovadas que reclaman enfoques educativos nuevos. <br>  <br>  La televisión desencadena los factores de persuasión latentes en la información. Actúa como espoleta. La información sobre determinados acontecimientos provoca una gran concurrencia a los mismos. Se ha acusado a la televisión de trivialización de los temas. Y efectivamente actúa de esta manera en aquellos casos en que intenta presentar los hechos como algo dogmático. Con esta actitud usurpa el juicio de los espectadores. Apenas hay temas en los que todos los investigadores estén de acuerdo. Desde el momento en que la televisión plantea una perspectiva y oculta las demás no sólo trivializa sino que falsea los temas. Esto es lo más grave. Sin embargo, si la televisión no sobrepasa el punto del mero planteamiento del problema, siempre que ofrezca diversas pautas del mismo u ofrezca varias perspectivas que susciten interés por el tema habrá cumplido su misión. <br>  <br>  Los medios audiovisuales insisten en una pedagogía de imposición y aseveración por la carencia de plenitud comunicativa del medio. El sistema de difusión de la televisión es antidialógico. Va de una minoría (fuente-autor) a una mayoría (público receptor). La ideología expresada es la de esa minoría, sea cual sea la tendencia del grupo dominante: política, económica, religiosa. La tarea que se impone es precisamente la de la búsqueda de una comunicación que sacuda la tendencia a la pasividad mediante la participación y la interacción del telespectador con la emisora. Hay que indagar nuevos códigos de implicación. <br>  <br>  La información audiovisual al concretar mediante la representación icónica la realidad reduce las posibilidades de fomentar la imaginación del espectador, a diferencia de lo que realiza la radio. Sin embargo, la imagen presenta unos aspectos polisémicos que incitan y provocan al espectador a que proyecte en el momento de la recepción o posteriormente su imaginación y creatividad. <br>  <br>  Las peculiaridades de deformaciones que la mediación técnica impone a la realidad como se ha indicado con anterioridad, pueden introducir aberraciones en lo discursivo. El cine, y en general los contenidos de ficción, efectúan también una deformación de la realidad, pero se acepta como se admite cualquier lenguaje convencional para plasmar unas ideas. Sin embargo, en el caso de la información audiovisual a la que se exige, no convencionalismo sino fidelidad, se rechaza. Es la diferencia entre lo admitido como ficción y lo rechazado como sustituto de la realidad. La televisión difunde tan rápidamente la información que obstaculiza la retención y la reflexión sobre las noticias. Priva al telespectador de la valoración necesaria de los hechos. La realidad en la auténtica información televisiva le llega no por vía del concepto, del juicio y raciocinio sino por vía perceptual, sensible. Las imágenes no propician la reflexión, sino la emoción. Conmueven. De ahí que para corregir esta directriz la información televisiva tenga que acudir insistentemente a la palabra no sólo por su capacidad de concisión conceptual, sino también para delimitar, orientar, fijar, contrarrestar las imágenes. Lo que la imagen dice por sí sola es a veces muy poco, se agota en el momento en que se expone al telespectador. Las imágenes para mantener una informacion capaz de llegar al telespectador en toda su complejidad necesita la palabra. <br>  <br>  Los medios audiovisuales resaltan el factor consumista de la sociedad no sólo directamente con la información persuasiva de la publicidad, sino también por la presentación de modelos de vida, comportamientos y, en general, con la información que selecciona. Algunos medios presentan las informaciones cargadas de juicios de valor no sólo a través del lenguaje articulado por el uso constante de adjetivos, sino también a través de la selección de imágenes cargadas de ponderaciones y valoraciones. No se separa claramente lo que es noticia pura de lo que es opinión personal. <br>  <br>  El uso de las transmisiones en directo es restringido casi en exclusiva para los acontecimientos deportivos, taurinos y algunos actos políticos. Desde el punto de vista informativo los deportes llenan más horas en televisión que el problema del paro laboral. Acontecimientos que la información impresa resolvería en pocas líneas de páginas interiores, la televisión los exalta con una programación de horas como sucede con los acontecimientos deportivos. Se trata de hipoacontecimientos elevados a símbolos de hiperacontecimientos con repercusiones profundas en la conducta, comportamiento y hábitos de una sociedad: hogares llenos a determinadas horas, y calles sin circulación por un programa televisivo. ?Estos acontecimientos son los representativos de la sociedad durante ese día o durante esa semana? Por supuesto que no, pero estos son los valores que la televisión transmite con mayor asiduidad e importancia temporal desde la perspectiva de la programación. No obstante, no conviene olvidar que tal vez haya sido la propia sociedad la que ha caído en esta subversión de valores. <br>  <br>  La televisión crea nuevos mitos, ideales y valores dentro del sistema establecido. Tales modelos pertenecen además a una determinada clase social: media-alta y alta. Los análisis arrojan datos referidos a casas de lujos inasequibles para la mayoría de los ciudadanos, modelos de vida derrochadora coincidente en gran parte con la iconología de las revistas de corazón, presencia constante del hombre y mujer de gran belleza y atractivo; si no lo tienen por su natural se les refuerza mediante el maquillaje; es sintomático que todo entrevistador y entrevistado en estudio tengan que pasar previamente por los maquilladores. Los protagonistas de noticia, los presentadores, los personajes-noticia se refieren frecuentemente a políticos, personas bien apuestas, deportistas, estrellas. Por el contrario, se detecta la ausencia de investigadores, pensadores, artistas, trabajadores. Actúa educativamente como un factor de ejemplarización. <br>  <br>  La televisión insiste en la presentación del sistema de valores y de la ideología dominantes en una sociedad a través de las noticias más representativas. Es continuadora de lo establecido. <br>  <br>  En esta línea conservadora, la televisión en su relato informativo, tiende a la nivelación, a la ?generalización? de importancia de los hechos, no sólo por la continuidad con que aparece lo trivial, anecdótico y fútil junto a lo patético y grave, sino por la valoración que se puede hacer de los hechos, aunque profesionalmente se intente corregir mediante el otorgamiento de unos tiempos, unos tratamientos y un orden adecuados para cada noticia. <br>  <br>  Es preciso ampliar el marco del análisis a una esfera superior. En este sentido lo que denominamos macrosemiótica informativa, la que amplía su campo de análisis más allá del texto y sus contextos hasta instalarse en la órbita del ámbito de lo social, económico, político y, en definitiva, en la cultura de una sociedad, es la que entra en funcionamiento. En caso contrario, se perderá la dimensión definitiva del mensaje televisivo y, en consecuencia, su nivel educativo. <br>  <br>  A la hora de valorar la información no siempre se fundamenta en el contenido y en la importancia de la información, sino en otros apoyos de exigua justificación. ?Qué es más importante, la bajada por la escalerilla de los aviones de personalidades políticas sin que se informe de lo que vienen a hacer al país, lo que sería de provecho para todos los telespectadores, pero que no quieren informar de ello, o la información de unos trabajadores que se encierran en una fábrica que sí quieren informar de los motivos y objetivos de su actitud? En esta relatividad de valores es en la que se maneja toda la ideología y todo un sistema de valores establecidos. <br>  <br>  Esto conduce a la consideración de un posible distanciamiento entre la realidad que la televisión muestra en sus servicios informativos y la realidad de la sociedad en que se desenvuelve el telespectador. Un distanciamiento que va desde la misma esencia de la técnica que modifica la realidad y las imágenes perceptivas humanas hasta las interpretaciones procedentes de la mediación humana. <br>    <br>    <br>  <br>  2. La información audiovisual en el aula <br>  <br>  La transcendencia que la información tiene para la sociedad actual ha conducido a incorporarla dentro de los dise?os pedagógicos curriculares en las aulas. Primero se introdujo la prensa y una vez dominado su proceso informativo, como técnica más rápidamente asimilable, es preciso, para comprender de forma global los procesos informativos, centrarse también en la información audiovisual. El hecho es acuciante por la penetración, expansión y alcance de la misma. <br>  <br>  Pero frente al periódico que cuenta con la ventaja de disponer de un soporte fijo, manejable y utilizable en la forma y tiempo que uno desee y, en consecuencia, adaptable a los ritmos de lectura individual y cadencia de comprensión, crítica y contraste, sin sometimiento a aceleraciones ajenas, la información televisiva se basa en una exposición temporal, fugaz e irrepetible. <br>  <br>  Para obviar estos inconvenientes se emplea la técnica de registro y reproducción del vídeo. De este modo, la información televisiva adquiere características de manejabilidad en las aulas. <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, recientemente se han alzado voces contra el uso del vídeo en las aulas porque, según las mismas, se elimina la experiencia sensorial y comprensiva directa de los alumnos. Se sustituye la imprescindible referencia real por otra vicaria y suplantadora. Sin embargo, con este planteamiento, válido en una consideración abstracta, se olvida un hecho sociológico. Desde los primeros pasos el ni?o está expuesto a la televisión en el hogar. Conoce la realidad por las imágenes y sonidos antes que por su percepción directa. Y esto, tal como evoluciona hoy nuestra sociedad, es prácticamente insoslayable, salvo casos de encierro en castillos de cristal o invernaderos. <br>  <br>  El uso del vídeo como soporte de introducción de la información en el aula, lo mismo que el periódico, supone una suplantación de la experiencia directa, pero también sirve de apoyo para afrontar el hecho de la mediación técnica de la experiencia y conocimiento humanos. Cada vez es más inviable separar la experiencia personal de la realidad, de la experiencia mediada e interpretada por las técnicas. No puede caerse en una pedagogía de avestruz. Es imposible, salvo otros riesgos más graves, eliminar la percepción artificial del entorno. La cuestión radica, pues, no tanto en desgajar una experiencia de otra sino en contrastarlas y hacerlas frente globalmente. <br>  <br>  La consecuencia, no puede ser otra que la de la necesidad de reorientar la mirada: pasar de una mirada contemplativa y gozosa propia de los medios audiovisuales, a la mirada crítica y en tensión. Aprender a ver la información no es sólo cuestión de saber seleccionar las noticias, contrastarlas y asimilar o rechazar el conocimiento que proporcionan de la realidad, que sería una actitud de espectador, sino exigir una presencia en los puntos de la toma de decisiones para convertirse en copartícipe de la producción social de la realidad. Es pasar de receptor a usuario activo con exigencias de calidad. Es una toma de conciencia del papel de ciudadano de los procesos sociales en los que unas veces se interviene como protagonista, otras como testigo y las más como destinatario.

krHIiK85aa	Visual learning refers to a learning style.  Research has shown that we learn by what we see or visualize in our mind, what we hear, and what we do.<br>  <br>  Visual learners have a strong preference for learning by seeing things - charts, pictures, presentations, books, movies, etc.  And they also learn by creating pictures in their mind of the information they read or hear.<br>  <br>  Auditory learners have a strong preference for learning by hearing - lectures, speeches, conversations, speaking, music, etc.  And they also learn by replaying information in their head and repeating things to themselves.  In a classroom, they will often be the talkative ones.<br>  <br>  Tactile learners (also called kinesthetic learners) have a strong preference for learning by doing.  They like to touch things, manipulate objects, repeat actions and move around as they learn.  In a classroom, they will often be the fidgety ones who move around the room often and can't sit still in their seats.  (Many of these learners are diagnosed as ADD/ADHD because classrooms are traditionally set up for children to sit still and focus -- a very difficult thing for a tactile learner to do.)<br>  <br>  We usually are not exclusively one type of learner, but rather some combination, such as visual/tactile or visual/auditory.<br>  <br>  The U. of Georgia has a good online inventory you can complete to find your learning style and see what teaching and learning strategies work best for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ttc.coe.uga.edu/surveys/LearningStyleInv.html" rel="nofollow">http://ttc.coe.uga.edu/surveys/LearningS...</a>|`|6MKob5paaa	people who learn things by seeing them. like diagrams, charts....<br>  <br>  <br>  here's a website that has a survey you can take to find out what type of learner you are or you can find out more about different types of learning styles<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" rel="nofollow">http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.a...</a>|`|UgJtnut4aa	People who learn by visual things like pictures apposed to people that learn physically by writing notes and those who learn by sound(being told).<br>  Visual learners are more likely to have a pictographic memory.|`|ECnoUtXYaa	Visual learners are people that learns things quicker and faster when you provide them with pictures and diagrams of the subject. Showing and doing experiments in front of visual learners work too.|`|nioINr3Faa	A visual learner uses images, pictures, color and other visual media to help them learn.|`|pC5SWxC3aa	People who learn visually.<br>  <br>  You learn by seeing what is being taught, opposed to just being told.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	people that learn by seeing something be done.|`|MIF4HmBQaa	people learn by sight aka photographic memory|`|HoMd0XWeaa	Visual learners are people who generally tend to learn by 'seeing'.<br>  <br>  For example, a visual learner will retain information better by seing a teacher write the information down on the board instead of just saying it.  Or one will remeber your cousin's name and face just by meeting him or her personally better, other than you telling your friend about your cousin.  <br>  <br>  Seeing and learning from works of art are much more appreciated from being seen close hand, instead of reading about it in a book.   <br>  <br>  Also, its almost like monkey-see, monkey-do, kind of learning technique.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!|`|9PwS5gcVaa	If someone is a visual learner they prefer using images, pictures, colors, and maps to organize information and communicate with others. They can easily visualize objects, plans and outcomes in their mind’s eye. They also have a good spatial sense, which gives them a good sense of direction. They can easily find their way around using maps. They do better by seeing things done visually not just hearing something told to them, so they do not learn well through a lecture.|`|UxBL7K3uaa	visual learners are those who learn by observing something getting done. though visual learners learn by observing they may lack in experience.|`|CJWSYb9Raa	people who need to see pictures or something visual as opposed to hearing something explained.|`|aNKteFbYaa	They learn by what they see.|`|P85LVLCTaa	people who learn best by seeing what they're learning|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	when ppl can learn by seeing. im a visual and i also learn by hearing too (forgot what its called.|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	Like me, it is those people who learn how to do things by watching other people do it (specially if something is not self-explanatory like other type of people who learn in other ways). <br>  <br>  Basically I need someone to show me how something is done AND explain how and why it works.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	They pick things up by seeing it done rather than reading instructions, well something along those lines if you know what i mean, i'd need to show you, not good at written explanations if you know what i mean!|`|sPtx0bnQaa	?|`|jpqSnCpuaa	people who learn by seeing

SIhxrxD3aa	That's a bad idea.<br>  Getting a vet tech degree on a path to be a veterinarian is a waste of time. <br>  None of the vet tech classes you take will transfer over into your pre-vet requirements and you'd only be adding 2 years onto your schooling.<br>  You cannot just work your way up.  It doesn't work that way.  In order to be a vet you have to go to first take the vet school pre-requisites and normally earn a bachelor's degree.  Then you need to spend four years in vet school.<br>  You can take those pre-vet requirements at almost any 4 year school and you can even take many of the entry level courses at a community college.  I suggest doing that instead.  Yes, you will eventually need to move away to go to vet school, but that's the way it works.  Since there are so few vet schools in the country (28) almost everyone has to move in order to attend one.<br>  <br>  If you just want to be a vet tech, then you should choose one that is AVMA accredited because that is the best way to get a job.  Here is a link for the AVMA accredited vet tech programs:<br>  <a href="http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/vettech_programs/vettech_programs.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/education/cvea/vette...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a link to information about the 28 US vet schools and their requirements for admission:<br>  <a href="http://www.aavmc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aavmc.org/</a>|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Any college degree, but in college you should have a high GPA and very high grades in <br>  <br>  Biology I & II<br>  Cell Biology<br>  Anatomy & Physiology<br>  Chemistry I & II<br>  Organic Chemistry I & II<br>  Physics I & II<br>  Calculus I & II

All of my GREAT experiences have been as a result of getting an education.<br>  <br>  Please, don't HATE school. Children all over the world would love a free education or even the chance to get a textbook. Never take that for granted!|`|P85LVLCTaa	no because of the learning environment but it teaches u discipline! which is extremely important to be successful and at least you get to socialize with lots of different people there|`|NkHU8tEJaa	I hate it too. Because the teaching is very linear.<br>  <br>  They teach you what to think and not how to think.<br>  <br>  Most of it is rote memorization and regurgitation.<br>  <br>  I know tons of smart people who dropped out of high school and lots of braindead morons who have graduated from university.|`|z2OfsA0Jaa	I LOVE school.

The social side is very important because you would never have the opportunity to work out what kind of people you really get on with out of school at our ages, because the number of kids who are home schooled or have dropped out are limited in number and are generally similar to one another. <br>  I dislike school because of the pressure you end up putting on yourself and the stress of getting assignments done near the end of term can build up. When I was in grade 7-9 the bitchiness of some of the girls was stressful.|`|klh18Mmlaa	yes and no <br>  <br>  the upside: friends, learn new things, meet new challenges<br>  <br>  The downside: Some of the teachers, drama (gossip), boring stuff, have to sit in a desk all day, don't get to go outside all day (at my school), have to wear uniforms (at my school), and our ruling systems is a bit off <br>  (ex.) if we punch somebody we either just get scolded or lunch detention yet if you were the wrong uniform or you are late for classes more than 3x you get I.S.S. or something<br>  (another ex.) disabled kids (i am not trying to be offensive towards anyone sorry) i they do something because they can't control it because of their disability  they get in more trouble then you would if you punched someone or kicked them <br>  <br>  see it is a bit messed-up|`|co2EieU7aa	I like school, It gives me a place to socialize and to get away from my parents, yah you have work, which really isn't fun, just kinda chill all through school, doing your work at your best and you should have  fun kinda...<br>  <br>  I am sorry you hate it,|`|ItCOMhYGaa	Haha, omg!

5ef6d39b26ae74d18921a72c9e033ef7aa	Well, you can't use the quadratic formula because that only works for equations with x^2 as the highest exponent.<br>  <br>  For the first one, to factor it, you need to separate it into two parts, so it looks like this:<br>  <br>  (x^3 + 2x^2) + (11x + 22) = 0<br>  <br>  Then factor each parentheses individually.  So you get:<br>  <br>  x^2(x + 2) + 11(x + 2) = 0<br>  <br>  Then since the common factor between both those terms is (x + 2), you can factor that out, so you get:<br>  <br>  (x + 2)(x^2 + 11) = 0<br>  <br>  Then find the roots from those factors.<br>  <br>  Root 1: x = -2 (x = -2 + 0i if you need it in a + bi form)<br>  <br>  Root 2: x = i times square root of 11<br>  <br>  Okay, then for the second one, you can use your Difference of Two Squares (DOTS) procedure.  So:<br>  <br>  x^4 - 16 = 0<br>  <br>  turns into:<br>  <br>  (x^2 + 4)(x^2 - 4) = 0<br>  <br>  Then you can do DOTS again, which gives you:<br>  <br>  (x^2 + 4)(x + 2)(x - 2) = 0<br>  <br>  Then find your roots:<br>  <br>  Root 1: x = 2i<br>  Root 2: x = -2<br>  Root 3: x = 2<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
L8aeDrr9aa	there r some points <br>  Hello Friends. Here are some tips for facing the Interview in Good Manner -<br>  <br>  <br>  Dress appropriately in simple - comfortable clothes that reflect your personality. <br>  Avoid wearing new shoes (squeaking noises) and do practice wearing your tie. <br>  Be punctual - don't be late or even too early. <br>  Read up about the company - what business they are into, growth trends, diversification etc <br>  Read your own resume - be sure that you don't have to look into your resume to recall details during the interview. <br>  Carry extra copies of your resume and testimonials - you never know when you may need them. <br>  Make sure you know the full name and designation of the person interviewing you. <br>  Keep your references ready. <br>  Remember to make a note of your previous or current salary with all its components. <br>  Make a good first impression. <br>  Wish the interviewer(s) cheerfully and with a smile. <br>  A firm handshake is an indicator of how you are feeling. If you are a lady, then some male employers might not make the first move, but go ahead and initiate the handshake. <br>  Wait till you are asked to sit down. <br>  Look the person in the eye. <br>  Do not appear too nervous or overconfident - Your body language usually conveys more than what you are saying. Don't slouch or lean forward too much. <br>  Try to curb nervous mannerisms [eg. fidgeting or biting your finger.] <br>  Appear comfortable, confident and interested in securing the job.<br>  During the interview -<br>  Start the interview with a pleasant smile. <br>  Always remember to give a firm handshake. If there are women in your interview panel, wait for the other person to extend the hand while shaking hands. <br>  Listen carefully to what the interviewer is saying. <br>  Stress on what you can contribute to the organisation. <br>  Remember that the employer is in control of the interview. <br>  Don't be too long-winded, say what you want to convey in crisp sentences and use terms that would convey your job & achievements. <br>  Complete your sentences - don't answer just yes or no. <br>  What you don't know can be learned, tell them if you don't know something. But give instances of how quick a learner you are. <br>  Do not boast. People on the other side are shrewd and can generally see through you. At the same time talk about achievements giving due credit to others. <br>  When talking about yourself and your aspirations, do not sound vague or do not say that you don't know something. You should be very clear and precise about what you want to do, where you want to go etc.<br>  If you don't understand a question, ask for clarification, don't answer vaguely. <br>  Don't talk about your personal problems, why you need the job etc. <br>  Don't get personal, even if you know the interviewer personally. <br>  Don't be overconfident or too nervous. <br>  Don't badmouth your previous employer - you could do the same in the case of the prospective customer. <br>  Don't complain about politics, a bad boss or a poor salary - your reasons for change should be higher responsibilities, location etc. <br>  If the interviewer is interrupted during the course of the interview, don't pick up papers on his/her desk and read them. <br>  Don't ask about salary before the offer is made. <br>  Strike a balance between what you actually are and what you want to be, don't paint a picture of yourself as somebody who is not concerned about money, social status etc. <br>  Don't be in a hurry to complete the interview. <br>  Ask questions at the end of the interview, it could be about the company, the job or the next stage of the interview process. It will be an indicator of your interest in the position. <br>  Send a thank-you letter, outlining your interest in the job and why you are qualified for it.<br>  <br>  Be Positive and Confident - And the Job is yours. Best of Luck!

Yes, one of the two major political parties chose him to run on their behalf.<br>  <br>  Why did he criticize Barack Obama?  Obama is his opponent; criticizing one's opponent is an appreciable chunk of campaigning.  The actual facts behind the criticism are largely irrelevant: Obama supporters already think McCain is a nutty old man, and McCain supporters already think Obama is a soft-headed liberal fool.  If one criticizes the other, their respective supporters don't need much of a reason to agree.<br>  <br>  As far as "on-the-fence" voters are concerned, most of them will never do more than a rudimentary job of fact-checking anyway.  Obama could say that McCain voted against giving lollipops to kids after they get shots (or something equally ludicrous) and many people would never consult primary sources to determine if that charge was true.<br>  <br>  So, yes.  McCain is for real.  Do we need "none sense" in the White House?  No.  Ideally our next President will be intelligent, at least intelligent enough to surround himself with competent advisors.

You can paste text in and copy it out, or simply compose in the compose window. I tried the online demo, and there are some minor differences from the downloadable product. However, most of the main features are the same.<br>  More Details See: <a href="http://white-smoke.net" rel="nofollow">http://white-smoke.net</a><br>  <br>  So, what does it look like? It’s a bit like Word, Google Docs and other word processing programs. It’s got a simple array of formatting buttons across the top for editing style, font and font size, followed by buttons for bold, italics, underline, creating coloured text and a few more. The second row has buttons for alignment, bullets and numbering, and cutting and pasting. A cool feature is that it will paste text from Word or plain text depending on the button you choose.<br>  <br>  The top of the window has three tabs on the left (enrichment, dictionary and templates) plus two on the right for information. The templates window allows you to load one of 600 templates in the commercial, literary, medical or legal categories and customise them for your needs. The dictionary is a lookup window and the main window, where you write and edit text, is enrichment. At the bottom of a window is a WhiteSmoke button, as well as undo, redo and demo buttons. The bottom right allows you to select the type of writing you are doing (great for those interested in business and literary, less so for those of us who blog for a living) If you’re writing a speech, dissertation or letter, you’re covered too. On to the main window.<br>  <br>  Grammar Checking<br>  <br>  You can use WhiteSmoke with any application, since it works with cut and paste, and you can also set it to check as you type. When you paste some text in, and hit one of those two buttons you get some text underlined in different colours. The colour code is blue for enrichment/thesaurus, green for grammar and red for spelling, cleverly following MS Word conventions. Here is where it gets interesting. Click on or hover over an underlined word and you get suggestions for improvement. So, how did WhiteSmoke do? I used it to check three articles I was writing for a client.<br>  <br>  It picked up well on spelling errors. I use UK English, so it tried to convert them to US English. It found no grammatical errors - I had to insert a deliberate mistake to test that. That’s a major improvement over Word, which always finds grammatical errors where there are none. For me, the winner was the enrichments popup menu. That’s in two parts. The left suggests adjectives and adverbs you can add to enrich your writing, while the right suggests synonyms. Just click to add your changes. I liked some of the suggestions and can see where this type of software would help people who struggle with writing.<br>  <br>  There are several different WhiteSmoke products aimed respectively at general writing, business writing, creative writing, legal writing, medical writing and executive writing, as well as a language translator that offers instant translation into 20 languages. There are also pro versions with additional enhancements (currently on sale for $1 when you buy the main program).<br>  <br>  White Smoke is a useful product, especially for people who are new to writing or who have English as a second language. Even experienced writers will find it useful on a day when the words just aren’t flowing the way you want.<br>  <br>      |`|qJGcGSb4aa	Not if it is for a book<br>  <br>  Hint: underline your title, Put your city first, then a colon (:) then the publisher , 1993<br>  <br>  like this <br>  Steinbeck, John.

CJUWBxPYaa	M?chte ist eine sehr spezielle Form. Es ist eigentlich der Konjunktiv II von m?gen, aber man verwendet es wie ein normales Verb im Pr?sens. Es hat eine besondere Konjugation, n?mlich als einziges Verb in der dritten Person Singular ein -e:<br>  <br>      Er m?cht-e <br>  <br>  Man muss auch bei der Bildung der Vergangenheit von m?chte aufpassen. Weil es formal ein Konjunktiv ist, hat es n?mlich selbst keine Vergangenheitsform. Man muss deshalb wollte verwenden. Beispiel:<br>  <br>  Für die Gegenwart sagt man:<br>  <br>      Ich m?chte heute ins Schwimmbad gehen.<br>  <br>  Oder:<br>  <br>      Ich will heute ins Schwimmbad gehen.<br>  <br>  Aber für die Vergangenheit kann man nur sagen:<br>  <br>      Ich wollte gestern ins Schwimmbad gehen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Das ist im übrigen eine sehr gute Frage!!!!<br>  .|`|6516f3c548fd10ad7bd7ee1dbdcba9a8aa	ich mochte|`|CxAAoeRfaa	Die Vergangenheitsform von "ich m?chte" ist "ich wollte".<br>  Ich zitiere mal aus dem Link: <br>  "m?chten ist eigentlich Konjunktiv II von m?gen, wird heute aber im Pr?sens als eigenst?ndiges Modalverb verwendet (für die Vergangenheitsformen nehmen wir wollen)"|`|f5c4ddcfb7f583890121848fa45ff3e6aa	gute frage.<br>  <br>  wie w?rs mit "h?tte m?gen"?? <br>  beispiel:<br>  ich m?chte jetzt schlafen.<br>  gestern um diese zeit h?tte ich schlafen m?gen, konnte aber nicht.|`|6cad959e461684332fa58eb35df1194faa	Im süddeutschen Sprachraum geht :<br>  ich mochte, evtl auch i H?TT gwellt - gell !|`|TAOmD4ebaa	da sich m?chten, von m?gen ableitet, würde ich sagen, dass man trotzdem "ich mochte" sagt.|`|l3ZqyOXZaa	ich wollte = ich m?chte = ich habe|`|zACJGatoaa	Ich mochte!|`|06e9f808389953b3f7106966f7d3fddaaa	ich m?chte ist ein WUnsch, der offen bleibt für die Zukunft, eine Verfeinerung von ich mag.

Although I only have one degree myself I am facing the same difficulties, especially the higher you go up in echelons of salary, desired jobs, etc. I would say its the economy right now, people are freaked out and don't want to pay for additional payroll. That is one possibility. Another possibility is you are applying for jobs that are not hiring, which I suppose goes along with the first thing I was saying. My suggestion would be to apply to places you know are definitely hiring, or you have a lead, or a reference. These things help tremendously in your chances. Consider this as a time where part of your "job" is job-searching. Just do it for the sake of doing it, and eventually you will be happily surprised to find out that you will have several opportunities available.|`|qPj7p6D1aa	gosh with that many why not run for politics.

e7b0601032c4bbdaf8f307b4abdc26b2aa	While walking home, I....<br>  <br>  When walking home...<br>  <br>  While I was on my way home...<br>  <br>  When I was on my way home...|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	A more common way to put it is "when I was walking home."<br>  It's assumed that you're on your way.|`|F211fxNFaa	We understand this sentence because we commonly talk this way, although it is not well written. If you diagram the sentence you will discover that it means that you were walking something or someone and that something or someone is called "on my way home". So if you say "I was walking my dog," that is clear. If you replace "my dog" with "on my way home", you can see the true meaning of the sentence, although that is not what the writer really meant to say.<br>  <br>  Another example of this is "While dancing last night, his pipe burned a hole in his pocket." This means that the pipe was doing the dancing because the dancing is done by the closest noun or pronoun in the sentence, which is the pipe. The correct way to say this is "While he was dancing last night, his pipe burned a hole in his pocket."|`|AA10124391	It is incorrect because it is using two parts which would complete the "was" verb.  I.E. it could read "when I was on my way home" or "when I was walking home" but using both "on my way" and "walking" creates two of the same verb.  You don't need both, you use one or the other.<br>  <br>  It's similar to saying, "when I was walking as I ran home"  you were either walking or ran home, you didn't do both.

I can call you an idiot, but you do not have to accept that as truth, nor do you have to accept it as painful.  Insults can only inflict pain if there is emotion involved, whereas sticks and stones can cause pain no matter how you think about the person throwing them.<br>  <br>  Names and words do not cause pain unless the receiver allows them to.  Even so, once the pain is there (when chosen) it does not have to last i.e. do you remember when your neighbor called you stupid (when you were 5?)  Did it hurt then?  Does it hurt now?<br>  <br>  If names and words can hurt, then names and words can heal - sticks and stones cannot heal.<br>  <br>  Think about it.|`|McpKxnYaaa	The point of the saying is that words only hurt you if you let them.

HUBO corresponde a la 3ra persona del singular (el hubo venido, ella hubo cantado) y HUBIERON para los plurales USTEDES y ELLOS (ustedes hubieron saltado, ellos hubieron corregido) todos estos en Preterito Perfecto Simple (Consultalo si gustas en la pagina de la RAE, en el diccionario te sale la opcion de conjugar los verbos).<br>  <br>  ?Cuál es el problema entonces con HUBIERON? Pues que si bien es cierto SI esta bien usarlo en casos como HUBIERON VENIDO... Es INCORRECTO usarlo en casos en los que NO hay un verbo junto a el sino un objeto directo:<br>  <br>  * Hubieron cinco muertos en el accidente.<br>  <br>  En ese caso debe decirse HUBO cinco muertos<br>  <br>  (Recordemos que el verbo concuerda en numero con el SUJETO, pero ahi no hay sujeto - Oraciones Impersonales).<br>  <br>  ?Resumen de respuesta? Ambas formas - hubieron y hubo - existen y son correctas. Pero, ten cuidado con su uso.<br>  <br>  Saludos! :o)|`|kpg3wED7aa	cualquiera|`|lzPfONjLaa	se dice de las dos formas, solo que hubo se dice pasado inmediato y hubieron suele usarse para los pasados remotos|`|qHefa2oWaa	hush..... que no estudiaste! duhhh ambas palabras sirven!|`|rJVYSSPhaa	Se dice hubo
raanID3Paa	First, to cope with the extreme pressure you are under you need to learn how to relax yourself to a level where you are calm and focused and can take on anything. You will do the following technique every hour of every day right up to your exams. <br>  <br>  Breathe into the bottom part of your lungs ensuring that your diaphragm muscle is pushing out your stomach. (imagine inflating a balloon behind your navel). Breathe out and imagine the balloon deflating. <br>  <br>  Start with a breath count of 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out. Once you are comfortable with this you goal will be breathing 10 seconds in and 10 seconds out.  (it's akin to hibernating as your blood pressure and heart rate slow down).<br>  <br>  DO NOT OVERBREATHE OTHERWISE YOU WILL FEEL FAINT. IF YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL CONDITION SEE YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU DO ANY NEW BREATHING OR RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. <br>  <br>  This will help reduce the stress you are under.<br>  <br>  Secondly, buy a book on memory techniques. But for now try this. Everything you read or are being taught you must visualise. So 'see' everything in your mind. In this way you are employing another 'sense'. The sense of vision. <br>  <br>  This will help you assimilate the knowledge and recall it later when needed. When we run this technique in our courses we can have most people remembering 1 bit of knowledge every minute. Or, 60 per hour. The record is 127 in one hour.

831a7af670f2985636729db688219516aa	1. Medical care costs have increased due to some pretty basic factors: people are living longer because of advances in health care, thus impacting the health care system.  (Look up AARP, Medicare legislation, etc.). More and more people are abusing or misusing emergency health services for situations which do not warrant emergency room care; tax payers wind up picking up the cost(s). Many people are self-insured and pay cash for their treatments - one of the benefits of working hard.  Government doesn't want people to pay outside their system, rather, the liberal Government wants the money to funnel through their system. |`|AA10065077	Like state before people are living longer because of health care and people are misusing emergency services.

jmOHvRyOaa	Hola, hay varias formas, depende de la metodología que haya aprendido el profesor (a) durante su carrera, algunas veces aprendes varias y utilizas la que aprendiste mejor aun cuando NO sea la mejor o la más moderna.<br>  Algunos métodos se basan en repeticiones y memorizacones de sílabas y conjuntos de sílabas, otros se apoyan en la reflexion que los ni?os hacen sobre el lenguaje. Dependiendo del profesor y del ni?o estos métodos pueden ser más o menos efectivos.<br>  También hay quienes ense?an según su experiencia o lo que piensan que funciona. <br>  Es importante que el proceso de ense?anza y de aprendizaje de la lectura y de la escritura sea realizado por profesionales o por personas informadas en la materia ya que aun cuando algunos ni?os son tan inteligentes que aprenden casi con cualquier metodo, hay otros que pueden confundirse si no se les ense?a sistemáticamente y luego tienen problemas para aprender a leer y escribir convencionalmente.

5cef5b7fffe19af05a2309d5c9a9d24daa	A present simple statement does not have to be based on the verb "to be".<br>  <br>  e.g. They like my new dress. I have some books to sell. I go shopping every day. She sings very well. I want to meet him. We can go soon. etc. etc.<br>  .|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	because the verbs derived from 'to be' are:<br>  is, am, be, was, were, will be, are, been, has been,<br>  <br>  any verb that is a state of being.|`|PWxZQcBYaa	Sentences expressing the present are not limited to the Simple Present Tense, like "I write", "She works" and so on.  The Present Progressive Tense will do as well and here lies the connection you're looking for because this is where the verb "to be" is used, e.g. "I am writing", "She is working", "You are asking", and "I am answering".  <br>  <br>  am, is, are, are inflexions of the verb "to be" in the Present Progressive Tense.

(Before anyone gets excited and freaks out here, I do NOT support this concept - I am simply offering it as a provocative topic.  I am the sister of a woman with Down syndrome, and as a special education teacher, I look at my class of "severely handicapped" children and realize that, out of 12 students, the only one whose disability could have been predicted prenatally is the child with Down syndrome.  Ironically, the other students, including those with autism, PDD/ NOS, cerebral palsy, extremely premature birth resulting in blindness and cognitive impairment, birth injuries, and traumatic brain injury, could not have been diagnosed prenatally, and many of them have more severe disabilities than the student with DS.)<br>  <br>  3) What services are available in my region for people who have developmental disabilities/ mental retardation?  For babies and toddlers, preschoolers, elementary school level, middle school, high school, transition into adult life, adult life, old age.....<br>  <br>  4) What impact does a child with mental retardation have on a family?  Parents, including their marriage;  siblings;  extended family, etc.  Be sure to include the positive results along with the more challenging aspects.|`|H5s3TaG3aa	Preparing students for adult lives only for them to receive very little services after high school graduation / exiting. Waiting lists are often long (years) and case management, etc is a tough job  that is badly funded with a high turnover rate.  Follow-up for a "bad" case manager can often be a nightmare for a family member seeking help with their relative with mental retardation.  <br>  <br>  Another suggestion would be about how individuals with mild mental retardation are punished after committing a crime (or even fairly questioned).  Many, many adults in prison have very mild mental retardation or are severely learning disabled.  Many states require IQ testing and educational achievement once a person is sentenced.  This is one of those things where you wonder if you punishing a person with mental retardation who did not understand OR are you protecting the public from someone who can not function properly.|`|cPyLZwG7aa	how does one truly measure intelligence?

But if you want to scale higher, then CFA - chartered financial analyst- is the ultimate study.  it comprises of three levels - level 1, 2, and 3. it takes 2and half to three years to complete this course.  You may also do your first level while doing your MBA, as the level 1 has more of its curriculum based on the MBA syllabus. <br>  <br>  hope this helps.. all the best!
51pZKsQIaa	First of all, that comma doesn't belong in that sentence. <br>  <br>  That being said, everything else is plural--the first "addresses", "customers", "contracts"--so it should be "new addresses" to agree in number with the rest of the sentence. The singular form  "new address" makes it sound as if all the customers share a single address, which is pretty unlikely.|`|6oO5A0voaa	It would be more elegant to restructure the sentence to avoid the awkwardness. For example:<br>  A customer's contact address needs to be changed if he or she wants to use a new address.<br>   Or perhaps:<br>  When a customer wants to use a new address the contracts address list needs to be updated accordingly.|`|B7d3a4H8aa	Then why not make the subject singular to match?

83e8e4466e43340497d3c0ff4f179316aa	I felt the same way my first day of high school, but don't even worry about it. Honestly, yes, bullying does occur once in a while in real life but it's definitely not as bad as you see in the movies/on TV. Just don't get in anyone's face or say anything to upset people on purpose and you'll be fine. People aren't out to make things hard for you. Besides, if something does happen there are always teachers you can go to, plus you'll make a bunch of new friends, etc. so that you're not alone. Everybody can make friends, so don't worry about being rejected. It's actually an advantage of going to a big high school (I did too)- there are tons of people, of all different kinds. Just be yourself and it'll be easy to make friends- sounds like dumb or cliche advice but it's the only way to make true friends. <br>  Basically, the first few days are the only "bad" part because everything's still new, but you'll get the hang of it really quick, you've just got to get used to it. After I realized it was just the unknown that I was worrying about, I had a great time in high school. Don't forget about the fun parts! There are SO many more opportunities and things to do than in middle school (especially if you are coming from a small one), and once you get into the later years even the classes and teachers can be really cool. <br>  Try to enjoy this new phase of your life; after the first couple of days you'll wonder why you were ever worried about it.|`|2qjIcSY6aa	hah, i scoff at your claim to a crowded high school. mine was built for about 2000 people. my senior year we had 3300.|`|Cj78AzpKaa	No fear! High school will be stress full no matter how cool you are. However, the best way to get instant friends... join a club. anything that interests you. The theater crowd and speech and debate worked for me.|`|XZhmQjaCaa	dont even worry about it.<br>  i started my freshman yr of high school on monday [august 20]<br>  and OMG!<br>  it is soooo much better than middle school<br>  i am not even lieing.<br>  the teachers or atleast my teachers are so much nicer than middle school, they actually can take jokes, they arent strict and they help u out a lot more than you think they do.<br>  today was freshman friday for my school.<br>  i did not see one sophmore,junior,or senior do anything bad to a freshman.<br>  you will not get bullied.<br>  this passed week went by sooo fast, it felt like 2 days not 5!.<br>  i love high school its so awesome....actually i think middle school is a lot worse than high school. believe me!<br>  you will make a lot more friends too.<br>  plus u have more freedom+ more fun=]<br>  p.s my high school is very big too it looks like a college campus its very nice and its only 3 years old. its very crowded too but its nothing scary. no one says anything bad to you. <br>  the only worse thing i heard was a junior guy he kept saying "freshman suck!!!!!'...hes duumb|`|bbJIQcwHaa	dont be scared <br>  its not really that scary <br>  (im a junior) jus <br>  make sure u dont act big an bad to the upperclassmen <br>  an youll be alrite =)|`|pRXbuFthaa	Hey, don't worry - if anything, high school is a world of new opportunities. Of course bullying happens, and people are rejected. But you can't control these things from happening to you, aside from the obvious (keep yourself out of trouble, be nice to people, get to know people before you act chummy with them, etc). The thing that is most important for you right now is to be positive. I actually loved and still love high school - I'd made most of my friends here, and there are so many opportunities to get involved and meet new people.<br>  <br>  One piece of advice I will give, is to take any opportunity that comes along. Never turn down an opportunity to get to know someone new (unless if your instincts tell you it's not a good idea), sign up for everything you've always wanted to have a go at (eg. guitar, theatre, rock-climbing), make the most of your first year by networking with as many new people and groups as you can. You see, the best thing about your first year or two is that you start with a completely fresh slate. You can forge a completely new identity for yourself, and no one would think it strange - everyone changes dramatically in the first few years of highschool. Always wanted to be an actor, but was always considered the 'shy, quiet type' at your old school? You can start afresh right here. Want to be in a band and make music, but never found the time to learn your instrument of choice? Or had you never considered yourself to be one of the 'cool muso kids'? You can start now. At your age, you still have the time to do anything you want to - and that's the truth. By the time you get to your late highschool years, opportunties will not come by as easily, nor be as easy to take.<br>  <br>  So, make the most of now and enjoy your time at highschool. It's going to be great, trust us =). And remember, it's only as enjoyable as you make it!

Then contact the Ministry of Health about her being allowed to work in the our health care system with the US RN license.  I dont know which medical school you will be at but they may also be able help explain processes of local medical licenses because many of the students work with the hospitals and doctors her.  best of luck to you and hope you enjoy Dominica.

sjOelwhhaa	There are two types of phrasal verbs:  separable and unseparable.  Since you have only included two in your question, these are the only ones I can talk about.  <br>  <br>  Yours are both separable.  This means you can say "Wake him up" "Wake Mike up," or Wake up Mike, but NOT "Wake up him.  If the verb is separable, the pronoun always comes between the two parts.  <br>  <br>  You can say "work things out," "work our problems out," "work out our problems," but NOT "work out it."|`|WoQwxabXaa	This regards syntax of phrasal verbs where the second component of the phrasal verb is an "adverb". <br>  <br>  Rule #1 : If the verb is a transitive verb, common nouns and proper nouns occur either at the end or in between the verb and the "adverb". They can be used interchangeably with no difference in meaning.<br>  <br>  Rule #2 : If the verb is a transitive verb, pronouns occur only between the verb and the "adverb".<br>  <br>  <br>  Example set 1: <br>  <br>  work (transitive verb) + out (adverb meaning thoroughly)<br>  <br>  "Let's work the problem out." or "Let's work out the problem." <br>  BUT<br>  "Let's work _it_out." only<br>  <br>  The word "things" is a common noun; hence go by rule #1 (i.e. either word order is acceptable).<br>  "We can work things out." and "We can work out things." are both grammatical and mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Example set 2: <br>  <br>  wake (transitive verb) + up (adverb)<br>  <br>  "Go wake the dog up." or "Go wake up the dog." <br>  "Please wake Mike up." or "Please wake up Mike." (at 4 pm)<br>  BUT<br>  only "Please wake _him_up." (at 4 pm)<br>  <br>  <br>  Note: up and out in above phrasal verbs are adverbs, not prepositions. These words by spelling alone have more than one part of speech. It is the specific syntacticl pattern that is restrictvie within a sentence that lets you see their part of speech of the phrasal verb component.<br>  <br>  Some grammar books prefer to call them "particles" instead of "adverbs" as the wikipedia article on "phrasal verbs"; for an alternate explanation of the two rules and more examples of use, see the wiki article on "phrasal verbs > particle verbs" at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_verbs#Particle_verbs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_ver...</a>|`|g4QNDhQMaa	Well, in this example, there are no clear words. The type of verb you're referencing is a verb with a complement (something that completes it). The 'up' finishes the thought of the verb. Both ways you phrased your sentences seem correct to me.<br>  <br>  The only thing that would not make these two phrases, "wake ____ up" and "wake up ___" interchangeable, I think, is their position in a sentence. Because 'up' is also a preposition, some people have a cow if you use it to finish a sentence. Technically, I would disagree with anyone who said that "Wake Mike Up." is incorrect, but it all depends on who is the authority, I'm afraid =/|`|AA10124391	In the first example, it is not correct to say, "we can work out things".  It is the things that are being worked out, "out" is not being worked.<br>  <br>  As per "wake Mike up" or "wake up Mike" - "wake Mike up" usually sounds like a command you are giving a third person, as in "you, wake Mike up".

AA10124391	You get up the same way you got up the other seven times.  It is saying that no matter how many times you fail, you can still move forward to success.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if this is Chinese or Japanese, but my favorite adage is "My barn burned down, now I can see the moon."  <br>  <br>  It basically states that you shouldn't look at tragedy, but what gifts you get when perceived tragedy occurs.   In this, the barn was blocking the view of the moon - so the barn burning down gave the gift of the beauty of seeing the moon.  If you only look at tragic events, you don't see the gift of change.|`|e1N8xBmxaa	I don't know how you'd get up 8 times but it's obvious the saying is about perseverance.<br> Also I was sent, by my friend, a link to a web page with similar sayings in multiple languages.

AA11450203	Beach slope can change two different ways.  By erosion and by the deposit of sediments.<br>  <br>  Erosion occurs when waves erode the beach material away taking it out to the ocean. This decreases beach slope.<br>  <br>  The deposit of sediments can happen the same way.  Wave action deposits sediment accumulating more beach slope.

I remember being taught that shylock was portrayed as a perpetrator up to the point of which he had a poignant monologue, something that included " Hath a Jew not eyes" etc..., and at that point we begin to see him as a victim. There are other things I remember such as Shylock cursing his daughter and wishing she was dead. I think you should emphasize that Shylock did not show any sympathy and his refusal to take pity on Antonio is later contrasted with the mercy shown him by the Christians. I think if you look hard enough you will see how Shylock is portrayed unfavorably in the early stages as it is notorious that he is a villainous character, only arousing our sympathy in a later stage.

BC97yskSaa	Guitar - 6 strings, the standard for "guitar" can play lead or rhythm.<br>  <br>  Bass - 4 strings, only plays the bass line of a song, the strings are all lower.<br>  <br>  Which you want to play depends on which part in a band you want to play. Maybe listen to the different parts and what they sound like - especially go hear some live music, the bass line is sort of easier, but you really have to keep the rhythm, it's more like the drums in that way, the rest of the band depends on your keeping that rhythm. If you want to play lead, you know, all that fancy stuff, don't get a bass!<br>  Then rhythm is also played on a guitar, 6 string, but it's mostly chords played in the rhythm of the song.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	Guitar has 6 strings, Bass has 4|`|k0LZru50aa	<br>  well, electric guitar is strummed, you put your fingers in chord shapes on the fingerboard. A bass is plucked, you typically only pluck one note at a time on a bass. The bass is usually only a four string instrument and an electric guitar is typically a six string instrument. Bass, to me is easier to play, guitar seems more intricate. I play both, and guitar is much more fun to play on your own. Bass isn't that much fun to play unless you are with a band or a cd. Bass is a low end sound that enforces the electric guitar and the guitar gives much more room for treble sounds. It really depends on what you want to do. Plus if you like attention, guitarists tend to get more attention that bassists, so, if that makes any difference? I would recommend going to your local guitar shop and playing both. Also you will need a separate amp and strings for a bass.|`|AA10124391	Basically a Bass has a lower tone and is not a lead instrument.  The guitar has six strings and the bass has four.  Go to the store and look at both, learn what is needed to play both and watch bands (or play rock band, etc) to see the difference in what the instrument is doing.

dpczBPuHaa	Start with what you like to do. If you like drawing & design become an artist, an interior designer, a computer program designer, fashion artist, ect. If you like drama become an actor or something, but first start w/ going to college of course, and also get a job like work at Shoppers or Target or something.

Here's a good website to get you started:<br>  <a href="http://www.bridges.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridges.com</a><br>  For this website, you have to make an account (or 'porfolio') first, then you can take a quiz about what things you normally like to do and then it should give you a list of jobs that are suitable for you. <br>  |`|OybFfSovaa	same here x_X<br>  I really don't know what I enjoy or passionate about.

A good majority of people don't figure out what they want to do in life until about the second or third year in college. Some take even longer than that. My fiance's dad once said, "In college, you take as many different classes as you can so you can find out what you DON'T want to do for the rest of your life." Of course, not everyone has the money to spend that much time in school, but he has a good point. Many people also tend to switch majors around their second year.<br>  <br>  Take your time during your first year to explore things. Talk to as many department advisers as you can. You don't have to tie yourself down to one thing if you realize it's not for you.<br>  <br>  Use your first two years to get your GEs done with. Then when you figure out what you want to do, you can spend more time focused on your major classes.|`|St6Jvc3Daa	I'm a senior too & Idk what I'm going to do.

fPOg9DuXaa	I am a teacher also, and when it comes to summer jobs, it almost always has to be a kid-related job. Most retailers or employers are not willing to train someone for just a few months of work. And, kids are out for summer so there are many jobs relating to kids that are just seasonal positions. <br>  I have done summer camps, summer school and tutoring. I recommend summer camp because it is such a different environment and allows you to teach kids in a different way. <br>  Once, I also got a summer position in real estate for someone who was going to be traveling for the summer and so needed me to take her position while she was away. Maybe something like that could work out.|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	teaching summer school is a good idea but tell her to inquire about it now. tutoring is a big thing too.. especially for the kids that didn't pass there test and needed to be in summer school. tell her to try to post an ad on craigslist or in the local paper. if all else fails finding a job right now is kind of tough... retail might be the only place that is hiring. maybe target?|`|t5JHpDMtaa	Summer School Sounds Great!|`|iCQXuW6taa	How about a summer camp, it would be more laid back than teaching summer school.

v5SXqxo0aa	Your unweighted GPA should be 3.8 at the very least for Harvard, Duke, Notre Dame, and Stanford. Weighted GPAs differ by school, but off a 5.0 scale it should be at least a 4.6. <br>  For Cornell It should be a 3.7 unweighted/4.5 weighted at least with good work experience, and it should be a 3.5 unweighted / 4.1 weighted at least with some work experience in your intended major for NYU.<br>  <br>  Your SAT for all of the above except NYU should be at least a 2200, 2300 for Harvard, Stanford, Notre Dame. NYU should be 2000-2100, depending on your major.<br>  <br>  Historically, the best schools in the nation have been Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. However, this is no longer true. Many colleges that are not even known as Ivy leagues match or surpass them in certain areas. An example would be UC Davis' (a public Californian university) animal science major- arguably the best in the nation. Or maybe you want to study ancient languages- in that case, you'll be more interested in Brown than Harvard.<br>  <br>  Make a list of your qualifications. Example: I want to go to a school in the northeast or the west coast, which has single person dorms and provides food for students at all hours of night. It should have a good ______ major and fit my budget, which is ______. Then start looking. You might not find the perfect campus, but you can come pretty close. To check if the college is a respected one, look it up on collegeboard's college quick search and look at their admit GPA break down. If 40% or more had a 3.75 (collegeboard reports unweighted GPAs), then that's a fair marker of a good university.<br>  <br>  Here's a list of top non-ivy universities to get you started: <a href="http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/cc-top-universities/" rel="nofollow">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/cc-t...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fSkt7SgDaa	You better not have anything below perfect scored to get into those prestigious schools.|`|zaZibcGkaa	4.0 maybe 3.9 and you have to be in AP classes|`|emJ79qagaa	well...it depends<br>  <br>  when you are in a lot of extraciricular activities, like president of blablabla...<br>  <br>  your gpa could be a 3.0 or above<br>  <br>  BUT <br>  <br>  if you barely have extraciricular activities<br>  <br>  your gpa needs to be a 4.0 or above, I know lame!<br>  <br>  Try your best at school, maybe take an AP class here or there, BUT there are other great state schools and they end up getting the same jobs as those who graduate from Ivy leagues.

a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	There is no required major that you must take to get into medical school.  You could even major in theater and as long as you finished the minimum requirements in maths and sciences, kept your GPA at a 3.6 or higher, did well on your MCAT exam and have great references, you would most likely get in.  Majoring in a science is usually a quicker route to finishing the necessary maths and sciences.  Today, the science major that most people choose is biochemistry.  Biology is still most popular, but a degree in biochemistry has the potential to take you further because it incorporates both chemistry and biology and will allow for many other areas of study and career opportunities if for some odd reason you did not get into medical school.|`|77d8d8cd21849a9ea42ffd10b55a0c29aa	my twin majored in biological sciences and got in|`|lPO4D8PLaa	You can get any bachelors degree you want but having a bio or chem major is preferable in my opinion because you will take enough courses (like biochemistry, organic chemistry, genetics, etc.) to learn important basics necessary in med school and which will help you do well on the MCAT.<br>  -physics, bio, organic chem, chem, verbal are all parts of the MCAT.

Even these are in dispute and there is common acceptance that there are many more ways to measure intelligence and one who will score high in one will score low in another.<br>  <br>  The best knowlege {smarts} and cleverest of all is the one everyone forgets.

SIhxrxD3aa	Yes, without the area code there would be multiple people with the same phone number.|`|W2t9Dnf8aa	The area code is just that - a code designating the area a phone number is located in.  It actually has to do with line switching and directing calls.  It is also so smaller numbering plans in each area code can be carried out.  No two people should have the same number INCLUDING area codes, however, without area code many people have the same number.<br>  <br>  The North American Numbering Plan Administration set up these area codes and numbers.  They are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area (NPA) code, commonly called an area code, followed by a seven-digit local number. The format is usually represented as<br>  <br>  NXX-NXX-XXXX<br>  <br>  where N is any digit from 2 through 9 and X is any digit from 0 through 9.

I'd suggest teaching a younger audience, though. Maybe 6 and up? You'll get a lot more job offers if you start kids at young ages; parents will go for that.

The country elects a President, not a First Lady.  And, frankly, why should the country care what President-Elect Obama made in Freshman English?  The ONLY thing to come out of making a transcript public would be to give fuel to people who oppose him, give them a reason to make fun of, for example, a "B" in Film Criticism, etc.  As with any other job -- no one gives a flip what you did in college after your first job.

The way you dress can change how you feel about yourself, so a fashion designer who designs for lots of different people actually helps them feel better inside.  It's not about having the latest look; it's about having a good look for you.<br>  <br>  How does that work for you?|`|tG8tFRY8aa	Don't sound so negative about it.

NPtz1Y4Taa	Thomas Alva Edison was both a scientist and an inventor. Born in 1847, Edison would see tremendous change take place in his lifetime. He was also to be responsible for making many of those changes occur. When Edison was born, society still thought of electricity as a novelty, a fad. By the time he died, entire cities were lit by electricity. Much of the credit for that progress goes to Edison. In his lifetime, Edison patented 1,093 inventions, earning him the nickname "The Wizard of Menlo Park." The most famous of his inventions was an incandescent light bulb. Besides the light bulb, Edison developed the phonograph and the "kinetoscope," a small box for viewing moving films. He also improved upon the original design of the stock ticker, the telegraph, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He believed in hard work, sometimes working twenty hours a day. Edison was quoted as saying, "Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration." In tribute to this important American, electric lights in the United States were dimmed for one minute on October 21, 1931, a few days after his death.|`|zCHnMeXbaa	You need to write something that starts like this:<br>  <br>  Many inventors have left their mark on society.  Yet, one inventor stands above the rest.  He has influenced and impacted many facets of our society.

68fd68c756ace3979820e8ad03d4237daa	YES! The key is to make sure the college/university is accredited. I have three basic recommendations for everyone looking into online/distance education. They all have to do with exploring; after all, you have to defend your assets.<br>  <br>  1. Make certain that you have triple checked their accreditation. First, they tell you what it is, then you go to that accrediting body’s website (not through the link provided by the school), and thirdly you would visit the department of education to see what they have to say. Do your diligent research into the institutions once you have narrowed down to a couple. You can look at the Better Business Bureau for more information on the college.<br>  <br>  2. You must have extreme self motivation and be able to teach yourself per say. This means that you will not have someone telling you verbally, so it is up to you to get the information from the course room, text, and other resources. The best way to look at it is like a guided independent study course. <br>  <br>  3. Review your goals, personal and professional. Make sure that the school that you are going to offers the programs that match your goals. Do not settle. There are many programs that are similar, but you have to make the ultimate decision. Do not let it be based on finances and length of program, but the fact that when you are finished or near finished you will be able to assume your proper place in the career field sought.<br>  <br>  You should market yourself and not the degree or university. There are many traditional universities offering degrees that can be earned through online methods. Distance Learning Alliance has a list of these traditional online schools. Look at that if you are truly concerned with the name of the school. Good luck on your search!<br>  |`|AA10065077	I know that the University of Wisconsin- Whitewater is advertising an MBA online. I haven't really looked into it, but I'm sure that there are other schools and master degree programs available. I know that if you currently hold a RN license you can do online courses for BSN or MSN through the University of Phoenix.

AA11333398	This is a classic case where you have two variables and two equations.<br>  <br>  The strategy for solving this kind of problem is thus:<br>  1) rearrange one of your equations to solve for a single variable.<br>  2) replace all instances of that variable in the 2nd equation<br>  3) solve the 2nd equation<br>  4) replace all instance of the 2nd variable in the 1st equation<br>  5) solve the 1st equation<br>  <br>  So, let's go through this problem of yours.  You've got two variables, X and Y, and two equations.<br>  <br>  X + Y = 10 (first equation)<br>  3X = 8Y - 3 (second equation)<br>  <br>  So we isolate one variable in the 1st equation.  In this case, I'm going to isolate X.<br>  <br>  X = 10 - Y (first equation with X isolated)<br>  <br>  Now, we replace all instances of X with our new expression.  This is what makes it all happen.  Essentially we are turning all of our X's into something else.  This changes it from a 2-variable equation into a 1-variable equation.  Well we know how to solve for single variable equations.<br>  <br>  3X = 8Y - 3 (second equation)<br>  3(10 - Y) = 8Y - 3 (second equation with X's replaced)<br>  30 - 3Y = 8Y - 3<br>  33 = 11Y<br>  3 = Y<br>  <br>  So now we have a numerical value for Y.  We can go back to our first equation and use it to solve for X!<br>  <br>  X = 10 - Y (first equation)<br>  X = 10 - 3<br>  X = 7<br>  <br>  So our two integers are 7 and 3.<br>  <br>  Remember to use those steps when solving 2-variable equations and you won't have any troubles.|`|W4nEyav0aa	1.  x+y=10    =>  x=10-y<br>  <br>  2.  3x=8y-3<br>  <br>  Solve the system of equations<br>  <br>  Substitute 1 into 2<br>  <br>  3(10-y)=8y-3<br>  <br>  30-3y=8y-3<br>  <br>  11y=33<br>  <br>  y = 3<br>  <br>  solve for x<br>  <br>  x = 10 -y = 10-3 = 7<br>  <br>  Integers are 3 and 7|`|bGmB8RQzaa	Let x = an integer<br>  Let y = other, greater integer<br>  <br>  x + y = 10<br>  3y = 8x - 3<br>  <br>  x = 10 - y<br>  <br>  3y = 8(10 - y) - 3<br>  3y = 80 - 8y - 3<br>  3y = 77 - 8y<br>  11y = 77<br>  y = 7<br>  <br>  x = 10 - 7<br>  x = 3<br>  <br>  The two integers are 3 and 7.

owDSIWYwaa	That depends on what she is saying.  If she is using racial slurs or slurs about homosexuality, she can be suspended is some states.  Physical violence of any kind is not acceptable in any public school.  Tell your parents and have them lodge an official complaint with the school.  Write down everything that happens and when.  If nothing is done within a two week period, bypass the administrators and file a complaint with the school board.  I know all this sounds like a pain in the butt, but, if the school still does nothing, get a lawyer, you are about to become very rich.  Most schools will not do anything at first,  but once they realize it is going to turn into something, they will take care of the problem.  It sounds like it is not going to get worse, so why not let the people who are supposed to be helping you help you.

79742c6af3ce8b6a79acffa1c263de4aaa	"Bright" is a relative term.  There are many DIFFERENT ways to be smart, and not all of them involve IQ points or good performance in school!

7gpDLc6daa	Theres a chance if you get all As but bare in mind its not the end of the world if you don't get into Cambridge. Thousands of people apply, all of them will have 3 As, so they have to base their decisions on your personal statement & interview, your hobbiess and achievments and even if you're fantastic in all those areas you're still not guaranteed to get in. You don't need to go to Cambridge to get into politics.|`|SLFt8eHEaa	Obviously, your A levels will be the most important grades for getting into Cambridge and you will almost certainly need straight A*s (as they will be by the time you do them) to get accepted.  However, Cambridge will look at your GCSEs too because, with all applicants achieving high A level grades, they will need to look to GCSEs to ascertain who the really bright students are.  I went to Oxford and I can imagine that Cambridge is very similar in that most people who go there have a mixture of A*s and As in their GCSEs and so in that respect you are somewhat behind.  It's still worth a go though, especially if you have good A level results.<br>  <br>  One thing I would recommend if you are serious about getting into Cambridge is to revise your A level choices.  To be brutally honest, Cambridge is a very academic institution and prefers its applicants to have studied traditional academic subjects such as history, maths etc. at A level.  They tend to look down on non-academic, newer, some would say 'less challenging' A levels and it's likely that drama and psychology will fall into this bracket.  It might be worth you substituting one or both of these with something like a language or a more academic subject to increase your chances.

Also, make sure that the financial aid officer at your soon-to-be-school knows your family situation. You don't have to tell the financial aid officer everything you told us (in fact, you probably shouldn't), but just explain that your father had medical issues and that he will probably not make as much this year as he did last year.

OZdjhym6aa	Dyslexia is a learning disability and there are many different kinds. Some dyslexics have trouble with numbers and some have problems with reading and/or spelling, and some - like myself - have difficulty with both.<br>  <br>  The most common sign of dyslexia is a difficulty in taking in information quickly. If you can read quietly to yourself and recall all the information you read easily they I do not think you have dyslexia, you may simply need to practice reading out loud before you get better at it.|`|fHEebnMkaa	Dylsexia is when people can't read.

Many people think that dyslexia is just for people who can't read. That's wrong. Many dyslexia can read fine and have a hard time with numbers! That's just another form of dyslexia. <br>  <br>  Dyslexia isn't people who just can't read. We have problem with telling time from a normal clock, yet if it's digital we can read that only sometimes we do mix the numbers up. We can't do much math, maybe add but we need to use our fingers most of the time. We can read to ourselves but we might get a sever headache, eye aches, and feeling stomache sickness. Yet if you ask us ot read outloud we will have every excuss in the book.<br>  <br>  Every dyslexic is different. Some see words backwards, some see words blurry, ghost words, words that dance across the page. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't find out that you're dyslexic by the 3rd grade it can have a horrible effect on you through out life.<br>  <br>  If a child doesn't know they are dyslexic and the schools fail them the same way they did me, they will feel stupid, dumb, and put down often. Because if you're in the 5th grade and expected to read on that level and you know you are slow then you are going to feel stupid everytime you try to read out loud and you stumble words, skip words and lines. It's terrible.|`|H8FHx1HYaa	people that has learning disability that has difficulty with written language, particularly with reading|`|1VXHoQzUaa	my name is lexie and thats what people call me at school!|`|yx7030Ccaa	Dyslexia is a term that has been loosely applied to reading disabilities. Specific definitions for dyslexia vary with disciplines. Those in medicine define dyslexia as a condition resulting from neurological, maturational, and genetic causes, while those in psychology relate dyslexia on the basis of the specific reading problems evidenced and give no reference to causation. All disciplines would probably agree that dyslexia is evidenced by persons of otherwise normal intellectual capacity who have not learned to read despite exposure to adequate instruction. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  How Is Dyslexia Diagnosed? <br>  The diagnosis of dyslexia usually begins with an awareness by parents or teachers that a problem in reading exists. A physician is often the first diagnostician to explore the nature of the difficulty. The medical practitioner should investigate the cause of the reading problem by conducting a complete physical examination and obtaining a comprehensive health history. If indicated, the child should be referred for a neurological examination. If dyslexia is suspected, the physician should refer the child for further evaluation and treatment by a specialist in psychoeducational diagnosis. <br>  <br>  The major purpose of the diagnostic process is to isolate the specific difficulties associated with dyslexia and to suggest appropriate educational intervention. Usually the diagnostician will employ a battery of assessment instruments that explore the relationship of specific reading problems to the intellectual, achievement, perceptual, motoric, linguistic, and adaptive capabilities of the individual. Based on the results, an intervention plan can be implemented by a special educator or remedial reading teacher trained in specialized reading techniques. No one remedial reading method works for all reading disabled students. Therefore it is important that the teacher have mastery of many different techniques. <br>  <br>  Back to top <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  What Are Some Of The Characteristics Of Dyslexia? <br>  An individual is identified as dyslexic when a significant discrepancy exists between intellectual ability and reading performance without an apparent physical, emotional, or cultural cause. Common findings in the history include, but are not limited to: (1) family history of reading problems; (2) a predominant occurrence in males (males to females 8:1); (3) an average or above average IQ and, not uncommonly, a proficiency in math: (4) no enjoyment of reading as a leisure activity; (5) problems of letter and word reversal; (6) developmental history of problems in coordination and left/right dominance; (7) poor visual memory for language symbols; (8) auditory language difficulties in word finding, fluency, meaning, or sequence; (9) difficulty transferring information from what is heard to what is seen and vice versa. <br>  <br>  Specific reading problems associated with dyslexia include difficulty in pronouncing new words, difficulty distinguishing similarities and differences in words (no for on), and difficulty discriminating differences in letter sound (pin, pen). Other problems may include reversal of words and letters, disorganization of word order, poor reading comprehension, and difficulty applying what has been read to social or learning situations. <br>  <br>  Back to top <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  What Factors Contribute To Dyslexia? <br>  Ocular Problems <br>  Several reliable studies (Helveston 1969; Blika 1982; Keys 1982; Hiatt 1984) have found that dyslexic individuals have no greater incidence of eye problems than do individuals with normal reading ability. Such parameters as visual acuity, stereo acuity, ocular alignment and motility, fusion status (break point amplitude), and refractive error have not been shown to be significantly different in poor versus normal readers. Individuals with reading problems should, however, have a careful eye examination as part of an overall medical examination. There is no scientific evidence that visual training (including eye muscle exercises, ocular tracking or pursuit exercises, or glasses with bifocals or prisms) leads to significant improvement in the performance of dyslexic individuals. <br>  <br>  Language Problems <br>  According to Mattis (1978), the primary contributing factor to dyslexia is an auditory language deficit. Approximately 86% of the individuals identified as dyslexic evidence an auditory language disorder that prevents the individual from linking the spoken form of a word with its written equivalent. In light of this, any individual with reading problems should have a careful evaluation of his or her language capabilities and where indicated, appropriate speech and language intervention should be provided. <br>  <br>  Visuo-Spatial-Motor Problems <br>  In contrast to language problems, visuo-spatial-motor fact

hcpgD6hBaa	What is the most important English skill? What skill must you have to communicate well?<br>  Obviously, number 1 is Fluency. What is fluency? Fluency is the ability to speak (and understand)<br>  English quickly and easily... WITHOUT translation. Fluency means you can talk easily with native<br>  speakers-- they easily understand you, and you easily understand them. In fact, you speak and<br>  understand instantly.<br>  Fluency is your most important English goal.<br>  The research is clear-- there is only ONE way to get fluency. You do not get fluency by reading textbooks.<br>  You do not get fluency by going to English schools. You do not get fluency by studying<br>  grammar rules.<br>  Listening Is The Key<br>  To get English fluency, you must have a lot of understandable repetitive listening. That is the<br>  ONLY way. To be a FANTASTIC English speaker, you must learn English with your ears, not with<br>  your eyes. In other words, you must listen. Your ears are the key to excellent speaking.<br>  What kind of listening is best? Well, it must be understandable and must be repetitive. Both of<br>  those words are important-- Understandable and Repetitive.<br>  If you don't understand, you learn nothing. You will not improve. That's why listening to English TV<br>  does not help you. You don't understand most of it. It is too difficult. It is too fast.<br>  Its obvious right? If you do not understand, you will not improve. So, the best listening material is<br>  EASY. That’s right, you should listen mostly to easy English. Most students listen to English that is<br>  much too difficult. They don’t understand enough, and so they learn slowly. Listen to easier English,<br>  and your speaking will improve faster!<br>  Understanding is Only Half The Formula.<br>  Understanding is not enough. You must also have a lot of repetition. If you hear a new word only<br>  once, you will soon forget it. If you hear it 5 times, you will still probably forget it!<br>  You must hear new words and new grammar many times before you will understand them<br>  instantly.<br>  How many times is necessary? Most people must hear a new word 30 times to remember it forever.<br>  To know a word and instantly understand it, you probably need to hear it 50-100 times!<br>  That's why I tell my students to listen to all of my lessons many times. I tell them to listen to the<br>  Mini-Stories, the Vocab Lessons, The Point-of-View Stories, and the Audio articles everyday. I recommend<br>  that they listen to each lesson a total of 30 times (for example, 2 times a day for two<br>  weeks).<br>  So, the two most important points are: listen to easier English and listen to each thing many<br>  times.<br>  Powerful Listening and Excellent Speaking<br>  1. Practice “Narrow Listening”<br>  “Narrow listening” means listening to many things about the same topic. This method is more powerful<br>  than trying to listen to many different kinds of things. Students who listen to similar things learn<br>  faster and speak better than students who listen to different kinds of things.<br>  For example, you can choose one speaker and find many things by him. Listen to all of his podcasts,<br>  audio books, and speeches. This is powerful because all speakers have favorite vocabulary<br>  and grammar. They naturally repeat these many times. By listening to many things by the same<br>  person, you automatically get a lot of vocabulary repetition. You learn faster and deeper!<br>  Another example is to choose one topic to focus on. For example, you could read an easy book, listen<br>  to the same audio book, listen to a podcast about the book, and watch the movie.<br>  I did this with my class in San Francisco. We read “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”. Then we<br>  listened to the audio book. Then we watched (and listened to) the movie. Then we listened to interviews<br>  with actors in the movie. My students learned a lot of vocabulary in a short time, and their<br>  speaking improved very quickly.<br>  2. Divide Your Listening Time<br>  Which is better: to listen for two hours without a break, or to divide that time during the day? Well,<br>  dividing your listening time is best.<br>  By dividing your time throughout the day, you remember more and learn faster. So its much better<br>  to listen 30 minutes in the morning, then 30 minutes in the car or train, then 30 minutes coming<br>  home from work, then 30 minutes before sleep. In fact, this is the exact schedule I recommend to<br>  my students!<br>  3. Use an iPod or MP3 Player<br>  iPods are fantastic. You can put a big listening library on one. Then you can carry your English lessons<br>  everywhere. You can learn English while walking, while shopping, in the car, in a train, while<br>  cooking,.......<br>  With an iPod or MP3 player, you don’t have to worry about CDs. Also, you can find a lot of English<br>  listening on the internet. You can find lessons, stories, podcasts, TV shows, interviews, and audio<br>  books. Simply download the audio, put it on your iPod.. and learn English anywhere!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

v5SXqxo0aa	Your freshman year grades won't count, so disregard those. Your senior year grades won't count either, because UC applications are due in November, before first semester grades come out; this includes the grades from dual enrollment (although it will look impressive on your application). UC's do not accept any documents other than your transcript and the UC application, so your recommendations are not required nor taken  (Same for copies of any awards you have won).<br>  <br>  If you can graduate with a 3.8, and have an SAT of 2100+ or an ACT of 29, and have at least two AP classes, you should be fine. Those are impressive extra curriculars! Also, the fact that you have an upward trend is very beneficial; UC's actually reward upward trend students with more "UC admission points" than they give students with straight A's.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: Because your school does not offer AP classes, I should think that your duel enrollment should suffice in lieu of AP courses. Make sure you're getting college credit or GPA weight for those, and make sure you get them on a transcript! The fact that you are taking the hardest versions of classes available will be beneficial. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you are not counting courses such as P.E., Teacher's Assistant, or pass-fail courses in your GPA- those are not counted for UC GPAs. You must have 4 years of English and Social Studies, and 3, preferably 4 years of math, including Algebra, Geometry, and Algebra 2.|`|34a3a19a134a5fc8b4d1f79d77e30c56aa	Well you're from Michigan and from what I know, it is very difficult for out-of-state students to get accepted into UC schools. I'm not sure about USC, however. UC schools don't ask you for letters of recommendation. Just try to score really high on your SATs and ACTs. Take both of them... some people are better at the SAT, others at the ACT. 25 is pretty low for UCLA, seeing that the average admit's ACT is 29. Also look into college classes that will boost your GPA. I think you're fine when it comes to extracurriculars. Yes, extracurriculars are important but academics are more important.<br>  <br>  Freshman year and senior years don't count. Only certain courses ("A-G" academic courses) count into your GPA.<br>  <br>  If you want to look at the statistics/averages for freshman at UCLA, they're here: <a href="http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/adm_fr/Frosh_Prof08.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you|`|AA10065077	You should be able to get into Yale with all that.

XbiMFT07aa	Well for number 1 med school bound students can major in anything as long as they take the med school prereq classes.  But because of the heavy load of science classes I would say having a science major would be good.  You can be premed with any major basically, however if you major in a science you will have to take upper level science classes and if you do well then that looks good to med schools (kinda shows you can take the work load)<br>  Number 2:  Being a nursing major does not impress med schools at all and in some cases they frown on nurses applying to med schools because they have worked in the med field in a similar setting and it would be a lil hard to change that person if they are set in their ways about certain things.  PLUS it makes it seem like being a physician was not your priority...<br>  Number 3:  I haven't been to med school but when talking to those who have I have heard alot of diff opinions.  I heard that if you are an excellent time manager and are trulyy dedicated you can go to school, study, and still have some kind of a social life.  BUT there is alot of reading to do and at times you will feel overwhelmed, just remember everyone in your class feels the same way (even those who seem cool and collected)....so i would say a 10 just because it depends on you (but definitely not 1 - 7)<br>  <br>  Lastly, read Medical School Confidential....its a good read for someone in your position...|`|1PTzqzH7aa	First of all, I'm in Physician Assistant School, which is almost identical to medical school. So while it has it's small differences, the admissions process is identical. This is my recommendation for an undergraduate major-regardless of what people tell you, it does NOT matter what you major in. It ONLY matters that you fulfill all of the prerequisite courses. Your college will have pre-med advisiors that can help you, and I HIGHLY recommend looking at the admissions websites for the specific universities you hope to attend just to make sure. Of course, you're best route is something science based. I chose Exercise Physiology, but that doesn't matter. My advice is pick something that you can you as a Plan B if you don't get into school or if you change your mind. What I mean is I know people who were biology majors. Some got into med school, some didn't. If you don't, what do you do with your degree? Teach high school biology? You see what I mean? Don't burn bridges and pick something that you can't use unless you get into med school. Nursing is great. It will give you a great clinical background, however, the prerequisites for nursing are NOT enough to get you into med school. There are additional courses that you need to take that won't be satisfied by nursing. I go to school with med students and share many classes, and both of our programs are pretty close in difficulty. It is very challenging. You must be very dedicated. However, it is better, more enjoyable, and less stress than undergraduate. The reason is as an undergrad, you're freaked and stressed wondering if you'll ever get into school. Once you're already in, you study a TON, but you know you'll graduate and have a good life. It is a lot more work, but it's motivating to keep up, because all of your classmates are the same way. Hope this helps!|`|Sozc3MyFaa	I was a bio major & husband was a biochem major.  A Nursing major will not prepare you enough--you will need to do more advanced classes. You might consider getting an associates RN if you don't get into med school (you will have just the core classes--the pre-reqs will be covered) or a BS rapid bridge to BSRN program; rather than doing a BSRN & trying to fit in all the advanced pre-med classes.<br>  <br>  As to hard?  Probably the hardest thing you will do (encompassing med school & residency).|`|2uINYiMfaa	med school is hard, but its also very hard to get there. one step at a time. You should apply to Johns Hopkins or NYU. <br>  <br>  If you care about where it is Johns Hopkins is in a **** area or Baltimore but NYU is in soho, soho is an amazing place. anyone would love it there.|`|UV8bN0Giaa	There are too many MAKE or BREAK science courses like ORGANIC CHEMISTRY that one must always have a backup contingency plan based on YOUR STRENGTHS bec MED SCHOOL is a definite 10!<br>  <br>  Best Key to Happiness and/or Success is BALANCE!|`|a7f0a207efd4bfde7a89a1744872689baa	Most undergrad pre meds major in biology.

However, government grants aren't as easy to get as the commercial lets on.  They are usually very specific in their restrictions.  <br>  <br>  However, there is a book that can be found in the reference section of most public libraries that list what is available out there.

AA10988215	Undergraduate:<br>  Bachelors degrees such as BA (Arts), BSc (Science), BEng, (Engineering), BEd (Education), LLB (Law) to name a few are usually done as honours degrees and take 3 years full time in England and 4 years full time in Scotland.  Neither of these is better than another-they are all of equal merit.<br>  <br>  Postgraduate:<br>  Here are some you can do after an undergrad degree: Postgrad Certificates (PgCert) and diplomas (PgDip) take up to 9 months full time.  Masters degrees such as MA (Arts) and MSc (Science) take about a year.  Doctorates such as DPhils, PhDs and named doctorates usually take a further 3 years of full time study. Typically the longer a postgrad degree takes the higher the level of qualification is achieved at the end.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :-)

If you need 120 credits for both majors, then you will have to complete all 120 credits for both majors.  <br>  <br>  A major with a minor is different.  You will need to complete all of the required courses for your major, but only a select amount for the minor.  The minor will not lead to a degree.  It does however, get you enough credits and background, that if combined with an appropriate major, can enhance your career options.<br>  <br>  A concentration is like a special emphasis within a major.  In the Management major, there are subdivisions- human resources, operations management, etc.  You could choose a general major in Management and focus/concentrate heavily on Human Resources.

a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Well, you have a few options.  You could apply to the university and only send them a copy of the transcript from the online college, but there is a risk in doing this because if the college finds out that you attended elsewhere too and did not send a transcript, they could expel you for falsifying your application.  Many people have gone to college and not been completely honest and had no problems though, so it is up to you on this one.<br>  <br>  Another route is to just apply to the university and hope to get in.  If your classes taken before were 7 years ago or more, you'll be given academic forgiveness.  If they were less than 7 years, but you have a 3.8 now, it will show a maturity and the former grades will not matter too much.<br>  <br>  You could retake all of those classes and do much better.  This is your safest route because it shows that you care enough to fix your mistakes and are willing to go the distance for your education.  Yes, it is time consuming and costs money, but will have the best chance of paying off in the future.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Well heres the thing, most college transcripts stay permanent, there's no really "reset" button.  And even if you retake the class, it depends on the school.  Some schools will let you re-take the same exact course and if you get a better grade they'll replace it, however that F still remains on your transcript to show you did fail it the first time just isn't calculated into your GPA if you get a better grade the second time.  Also note, that many of the schools that do offer the "second chance" programs, they limit it to how many classes you can do it for so you don't abuse it...I don't think any school will let you do it 11 times honestly.<br>  <br>  But that's only if your school offers that.  Many schools will require you to take the class again for graduation requirements but the impact of the previous F is left unchanged.  You'll also have to check if your online school's credits will be accepted at whichever school you want to transfer to.<br>  <br>  Best chance to get into a school is just to apply, and in an attatched essay explain your circumstance that you made a mistake of not withdrawing and you are a hard worker and want a chance to prove it.|`|k8zOpFFXaa	Yeah, you're gonna have to retake them all. If there are classes where you feel confident already, you can ask if there's an option to "test out". They would give you a test, maybe like a/the final. If you pass, you'll get a passing grade for the class. It's an option for my music theory classes so maybe it will be an option in some of yours.|`|1iAQ4MRNaa	Yes|`|WshXL3zCaa	You don't have to retake those classes as long as they are not required for the field that you are majoring in. Also, make sure you have all the lower division major requirements completed before you start applying. Some colleges will let you apply while you are still enrolled in the classes. Also if your major does not require any lower division major prep, then you need to complete the GE requirements or the IGETC. UC and CSU have different GE requirements so make sure you look that up. And one last this, the Fs that you have on your transcript will probably make it very hard for you to get into a UC but I don't think you will have any problem getting into a decent CSU as long as you meet the requirements and your cumulative GPA is what they require. Also, it's best to talk to your counselor at your school, he might be able to help you out more and give you more information.

AA11046024	Wilhelm Schickard invented a mechanical calculator about fifteen years before Blaise Pascal started developing his Arithmetic Machine.<br>  <br>  Lee De Forest, (August 26, 1873 - June 30, 1961), was an American inventor with over 300 patents to his name. De Forest invented the audion, a vacuum tube that takes weak electrical signals and amplifies them. De Forest is one of the fathers of the "electronic age," as the audion helped to usher in the widespread use of electronics.<br>  Konrad Zuse (June 22, 1910 - December 18, 1995) was a German engineer and computer pioneer. His greatest achievement was the completion of the first functional tape-stored-program-controlled computer, the Z3, in 1941.<br>  <br>  The Z3 is sometimes claimed to be "first computer" as such, though this depends on complex and subtle definitional issues, as the machine was not truly general-purpose in the manner of later machines (see the article of history of computing for a thorough discussion). Zuse also designed a high-level programming language, Plankalkül, allegedly in 1945, although this was a theoretical contribution, since the language was never actually implemented within his lifetime and did not directly influence early implemented languages.<br>  <br>  In addition to his technical work, Zuse founded the first computer startup company in 1946. This company built the Z4, which became the first commercial computer, leased to ETH Zürich in 1950. Due to the circumstances of World War II, however, Zuse's work initially went largely unnoticed in the UK and the US; possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM's 1946 option on his patents. In the late 1960s, Zuse suggested the concept of a Calculating Space (a computation-based universe).<br>  <br>  There is a replica of the Z3, as well as the Z4, in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.
