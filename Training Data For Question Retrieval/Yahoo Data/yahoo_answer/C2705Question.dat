20090304092442AAtOG0N	Pets;Other - Pets	What is a "rehoming fee" when trying to find a home for an animal?	I am looking for a kitten & I was browsing Petfinder & Craigslist. On Craigslist, in a couple areas under the pets I noticed people requesting "rehoming fees" & another complaining that those are breeder selling fees, not "rehoming fees." Those ads also were looking for new & good homes for pets no longer wanted for whatever reason. If one is desperate to find a new, good loving home for a pet, why charge a "rehoming fee"? Is this standard proceedure? Because I don't think I want to pay anything like that, especially when I'm looking under free to good home ads, then I see something like that casually slipped into the ad. I'm looking for a free unwanted animal & I would rather spend the money at the vet to benefit the animal. Am I being unrealistic? lol       Thanks for all answers. =^..^=

20090304093329AAHlxqr	Pets;Cats	Why do people get so rude about having a cat outside?	for ONE: not ALL cats do best inside. my cat is VERY aggressive when kept inside (he will literally attack & injure people) but is very friendly when he's outside.      for TWO: the economy is bad. the shelters are full (though i wouldn't take my kitty to one because he'd likely be euthanised for his attitude). people's housing situations are not ideal--and it is difficult to find (and afford) housing that allows indoor pets.         i just asked a question about moving my cat & getting him accustomed to the new place--outside--and got a couple very insulting answers.       yeah, i know cats are usually safer inside, but sometimes it's not possible, notr BEST for EVERY cat.      i keep him fed, groomed, and he's got a warm bed. (he's also neutered & has all his shots). considering i'm laid off & have lost my home--but he's never missed a meal--i don't think i'm being negligent.       can't a person get some slack ?? sheesh!

20090304094802AArqTEu	Pets;Dogs	Why do you think it is a much bigger deal when a mixed litter of pups is born than a mixed litter of kittens?	I've just read more and all around heard more in my lifetime about people opposed to people breeding mixed breed dogs. Yet when people have their intact male and female cats running around the neighborhood, and mama cat gets pregnant, I've never heard more than that they are just irresponsible owners. As to where if an intact dog gets loose and runs around the neighborhood, all hell breaks loose when the owner tries asking a question about what to do.         ....Or maybe I just don't hang around in the cat section enough to see this. :P      Why do you think?
20090304093440AAvaHTM	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone know about effective dog repeller plug?	Relative live with us (they own half of the house), but their dog has been biting around often. Last time he bite my hands and it recovered 4 weeks later. Then he bite my nearly 90 year old grandpa on the foot and made him fell down when he tried to feed my grandma medicine on bed. I told relative to lock dog in their room when non of them are home, but they think dog is more important than people. I guess the only thing I can do is to buy a dog repeller plug and put it at my grandparents room, at least their room is safe, but it can't be something come with collar because I can't make him wear collar. Does anyone know about effective dog repeller plug? Thanks a lot
20090304093422AACbpCh	Pets;Cats	Submissive urination in 4 year old boston?	I have a male Boston Terrier. He is an awesome dog, but with one flaw.. he can pee on people. The situations vary, but it can be VERY embarrassing.   One situation is when a man talks to him... he bows his head and pees in spots and spirals..   the second is when you meet him, or greet him, he gets so excited he jumps up for a scratch and it just comes out.   He USUALLY doesnt pee on me or my younger child..and he NEVER pees on my older one.    I correct him gently when he jumps up on people..but they go "oh its ok, I love dogs".  I want to tell them, "you wont 'love him' when he pees all over you" but its way to embarrassing to say anything.   He's not really into "MARKING" in a sense that he lifts his leg on things... but if anyone has had this problem and can help me out.. I'd really appreciate it.   NOTE.. he is 4 years old, the only dog (although he has "aunts" and "cousins" he visits regularly)   and we wrap him with a diaper and duct tape when we go to visit people, or have company....
20090304100346AArH1hN	Pets;Rodents	Strange question about a guinea pig and a tortoise :)?	Ok .. I have a male guinea pig he's a few months old and I have a hermann tortoise which is 4 years old.. (but obviously still very small)   They both like to eat grass and be outside in the sun...   I have a play pen inside and at night when its the guinea pigs 'floor time' I put the tortoise out with him too so he can have a walk about, obviously I keep an eye on them just incase but they don't really go near each other appart from the guinea pig sniffs the tortoise now and again.   My question is... when its summer and I put my guinea pig in the run outside obviously I cant stand there watching him for hours.. nobody does so he'll be alone, I'm sure the tortoise would like to go outside in there too but could I trust them together alone?   What harm could they really do to each other?   the tortoise has a hard shell and the guinea pig would run away if the tortoise went near him so should it be ok?

20090304071341AAT6rUF	Pets;Cats	New cat is acting strange?	I just got 2 young cats 3 days ago (they are 6 months old and both female). They have both adjusted well, they seem happy, play with each other, let us pet them and play with them, etc. Every night, though, one starts meowing about halfway through the night and will not stop. I thought it was because she was missing her old home, but when I pick her up, she is purring and wants to be petted. Even if I give her attention for a few minutes she starts making noise again as soon as I put her down.       So last night I tried putting her out of the bedroom where she likes to sleep to "punish" her for making noise, but she just kept on meowing in the hallway wanting to come back in. She also is waking her sister up and I end up having to put them both out in the hall.      I'm wondering if it's possible she is in heat or something? They haven't been fixed yet (will be soon though). Anyone know why she is doing this and what I should do to make her quiet down at night?

He's constantly farting and I am thinking it may be the food I have him on. I have tried different brands but I was wondering if ayone has used the Blue Buffalo brand? I heard it's good and on the website I use that rates the dog food it's a 4 start food. I priced it at Pet Smart here in Ontario Canada and it's $51.99 for a 30lbs bag. It's less than the current one I am buying him which is Eagle Pack Natural Adult dry dog food. He was sent home from the breeders with this food as well. But on the scale with this food it's a 2 or 3 star and no so good.    Please, if you have a Boxer can you tell me what is a good food that will cause less gas. Please only respond if you own a Boxer because that is the dog I have and I don't want to hear about other dogs. I am feeding him dry food and not interested in wet food or cooked food. Thanks.

20090304081931AAhabzS	Pets;Dogs	My American Pit bull Terrier hates men?	I rescued my pit bull when he was four weeks old, his litter was found abandoned in a property my friend owned and rented out.  He is now 1 year old, and the sweetest dog on the world.  Loves my cats, my mother, my friends, my husband, my brother, ect... but he HATES some men?  He runs and hides from them as soon as they walk in the door, and he barks from a distance.  This is very scary to a stranger because he does have an intimidating bark.  He never acts aggressive unless a male stranger raises his voice.  For instance, my uncle gets a kick out of yelling at him to "settle down".  He's kidding and there's humor in his tone, but that's when allllll the hair on my dogs back stands up and he shifts from hiding to taking a stance in the middle of the room.  How do I break this habit?  He is a sweet dog that everyone in my neighborhood knows and loves.  My little neighbor kids come over and ask to walk him because he's so well behaved and good with them.      How can I break this habit?  And why are my brother and my husband (who are the same age) accepted by him?  HELP!
20090304073432AA0jhK5	Pets;Dogs	Why is my dog peeing on the carpet?	We've had our dog for over four years now. He's been house-broken for quite a while and hadn't made a mess in the house for years. But for the past couple of month he's been piddling on a section of the carpet in front of our TV leaving it really stinky. We've tried putting different rugs down there and piddle pads, but he's still doing it. We can't figure out when or why.      I'm thinking it might relate to the arrival of our baby a couple of years ago, but are there any suggestions on how to get him to stop?      He's a twelve-pound terrier mutt.

20090304081459AADJoUP	Pets;Dogs	QUESTION ABOUT HEART WORMS AND HEARTGUARD..PLEASE READ!?	OK, I am very confused right about now. My old vet told me that heartguard (or any heart worm prevention) is very harmful to give to a dog that is positive for heart worms. She also told me that the ONLY treatment option for a heart worm positive dog is arsenic injections...(sorry I know arsenic is not the right word but I can't remember what it's called, but you know what I'm talking about). Anyway, I switched to a new vet because I couldn't stand that one, I felt like everytime I went in she would use big medical terms and not explain anything... to confuse me so I would pay any amount she threw at me. So I took my dog to the new vet yesterday and he was AWESOME. He said my dog has such a tiny amount of heart worms that another option would be to just put him on heartguard and test him again in a year, and pretty much just wait for the adult worms to die. OK WHAT? But my other vet made is sound like heartguard is going to kill my dog and I HAVE to get the $700 treatment asap or my dog is doomed.  (fyi, she also told me he has a very small infestation and he hasn't had them very long)      So what is the truth?       P.S. The money is not an issue, I would pay any amount to get those nasty things out of his heart. I just want to make an educated decision because I know treatment can be hard on the dog and that scares the crap out of me.  And I DO NOT want a vet to take advantage of me in order to have a bigger pay check.

I have 2 other rabbits. One that I bought at a petstore (forgive me!) and then one that I adopted from a rescue later so it wouldn't be lonely. Unfortounately, neither of them are litterbox trained.      I made them a really big cage inside out of cubes and coroplast and since they are a bit older and just mellow bunnies they don't really mind just chilling out in there.      My flemmie will be baby from a breeder and I won't be able to make another cage that big so I will probably put her (I think I am getting a girl) in a dog crate while she has to be confined but I REALLY want her to be able to be out running whenever I am around.       How do I got about litter training a baby bunny? When I set up the crate and there certain things I shouldn't put in there? Like I know I will want to get her a little dog bed or something to sleep on but should I put that in there at first because wouldn't she use it as the bathroom instead of a litterbox?

About 2.5 months ago I switched them off Whiskas etc. cat foods and starting giving them dry and wet Performatrin ultra. They are doing really well on it but it is hitting my 5 person, one income budget pretty hard at roughly $100 a month. Heres my question..could I just give Dry in the good brand and wet in whiskis or vice versa to help with high cost?. Currrently I have them each on half a can of food twice daily(breakfast and Dinner) and the rest of the time I offer the dry food   ( 1 cup each daily, which is bag instructions)      **yes, they are both fixed**
20090227062201AAAsFE9	Pets;Fish	Male betta always flaring?	I've had Spike for a little over a week now.  He's in a five gallon tank, gently filtered, 78 degrees, with three fake plants and a piece of driftwood.  He'd been flaring at his reflection nonstop for the past week, so I kept the light off at all times.  I had assumed that he was flaring at his reflection because it was the only thing he could see.  I added a background last night, but he's still flaring, even with the lights off!  He actually started attacking his reflection this morning!  What can I do to stop him from flaring so much?
20090304075648AAlfbMg	Pets;Other - Pets	Do you know of a good food bowl for guinea pigs?	I have 2 guinea pigs and one keeps tipping the food bowl over. Several times a day! I pick up the bowl and refill it but I'm going through food like crazy now! I can't afford to buy 2 bags of food in 1 week, it gets expensive! I only have a plastic bowl which has always been fine since the tipping is recent. Do you know of any GOOD ceramic or heavy plastic bowls that I can get for a decent price? The only ones I have been seeing at Target don't seem heavy enough so I'm a little scared to buy it.       The pigs drive me insane. The things we do for our little fuzzy friends :)
20090304082134AAJweLo	Pets;Dogs	If you are a Basset Hound owner (or puppy owner), what works?	This is my second Basset Hound but they all have different personalities, right?  If you look up Stubborn in the dictionary, there is a picture of my little "LuLu"!  A six month old bundle of energy.      My problem is she doesn't listen. I have owned 8 dogs in my 35 years and have always been the pack leader. But she is testing my abilities. I have a 4 year old male Yorkie that weighs in at 7 pounds. She jumps on him relentlessly. I dealt with this issue from the day I brought her home because I knew she was going to get big and I didn't want my Yorkie to be bullied. Well, he has resorted to hiding under the couch, the chair, the armoire - any place that she cannot fit.       I also have a Border Collie mix- 12 year old gentle giant. She drives the old man crazy!  He will not snap at her but "talks" really loud as if to say "get her away from me!"      I tell her "no", which she totally understands and as long as my eyes are on her she looks totally submissive, i.e. ears down low, head low. But as soon as my eyes are removed she bolts right back on top of whichever dog is closest. She rolls around under the old guy as fast as she can- in a submissive position and if it is the little guy, she stands over top of him and bites him relentless. I know she wants to play because she is so young, but she is worse than any toddler. I am up and down every single minute with "no, stop, stay". It was actually humorous the other day because my eyes were on her and she sat still then I turned my head away and then back and you could see that she was watching me and she was going from submissive look to ears up and ready to go. I did this several times because it was unbelievable. It would have made a great video.      I walk her every day 2x for 30 minutes. She comes home and is exhausted for about an hour and then the antics start all over again. I walk the other dogs with us in order to create a great pack connection.       She is so smart. When I get the leashes out all 3 know they must sit and are not allowed out the door until I walk out first. They all walk behind me and I can talk on the phone or whatever and never worry about them tugging and pulling. When I make their food, they all know they must sit at their special place.       So how can I stop the insane behavior of relentlessly driving the other dogs crazy?  While I am writing this, she is laying beside me "shaking" because I have made her stay by my side because she had the whole house in a barking and chaotic mess for the 50th time today.      Help!

I'm looking for something that is long in length.       4) What type of cat litter can I use for my bunny. I'm currently using kittty pine (i think that is what it is called)      I want to make a play pen and put it in my room to show my dad that my rabbit Abu is just like a cat. He's not fixed but he'll use the litter pan if he's in the cage.  Also I want Abu to be able to get out Again . He;s been in the cage for a long time now and since he peed on my dads rug . My dad wont let him come back out.       I asked my dad if my rabbit can get fixed but he's set in not paying more than 100 bucks . So the only way for Abu to get fixed is if I save up this summer. I was wondering if I take Abu to the animal shelter and see if they'll fix him up. My friend said they'll do it for free , yet my dad said that I'll have to pay . Do you know how much it will cost?       Our family vet will cost to much ( since im paying for it ).

20090304081444AAxyuJi	Pets;Cats	Why have my cats gone mad?	I have four cats (long story).  One of them needed some dental work, so I took her to the vet.  She was gone about 10 hours--sedated, with a couple of teeth pulled--and then brought home, still a bit groggy.      My cats normally get along reasonably well.  There's the occasional hiss and territory dispute, but in general, they tolerate each other.      When I brought the cat back last night, however, two of the other three went crazy.  I let the cat out, and two cats followed her around, not only hissing but also making a strange low growl.  I shuffled the three cats into one room (with food and litter) and focused on the drugged cat, giving her food so she'd take her antibiotic.  We then brushed her and used a cat-wipe on her in order to take away the vet smell, which we figured caused the problem.      When we let the others out, they were hissing and growling at each *other*.  Then one of them (the only male, of course) hissed and growled at *us*.  He's never done that.  He's never made that growly noise, either.      They seemed to be okay, although the boy cat was in a foul mood all night.  This morning, there were no hisses--until I picked up the cat I'd taken to the vet.  I took her into the bathroom to give her special food and a pill.  From the moment I picked her up, the hisses and growls resumed--and when I exited the bathroom (with the cat still in there eating), they hissed and growled at me again.      What the heck is going on here?!  Is all this because she smelled a little funny coming home?!

20090304080114AAKmugo	Pets;Dogs	Is he going to be a GIANT or a tiny tim?	A little background.  I have a darling little puppy, and to put it bluntly I brought home what looked to be a 1 week old puppy seperated waaaay to early from momma and I spent the next several weeks bottle feeding, stimulating, de-worming, weaning and now training.  Fast forward, he is a healthy 8 weeks old.  It is my impression he is a bull/terrier mix of some sort.      Can't really find growth charts to give me a generalization, but it would be helpful to know what size crate I need to buy for this guy, he's in a small/medium crate now, but will outgrow it soon and I don't want to keep buying crates.  He's approximately 8 weeks old and weighs 15 pounds.      Can't tell by feet, my last dog had teeny tiny feet and turned out to be 75-80 pounds until cancer took him.  This little guy has huge feet and is taller than he is long right now.  Head isn't really proportionate to body(smallish) but I know my bull breeds and know their heads tend to fill out later on.  Aside from the obvious which I'll say he'll be over 50 pounds, is there any other way to estimate or a growth curve I can track to project how much over 50lbs?  Master google didn't yield good results for growth estimates.

20090227062437AAhnkVP	Pets;Dogs	My dog's toenails keep falling out. Help?	First off, yes, I have taken my dog to the vet about this, several times.      Her toenails grow very fast, it's hard to keep them trimmed. But even the short ones fall off sometime. The nail actually slips off of the "quick" leaving behind a bloody stump of a toe.       The nails always grow back quickly, but it must hurt the poor thing. :(      The vet basically didn't care. Told me to keep them trimmed (which doesn't help), or have her toes surgically removed. I don't wanna let the vet go hacking her toes off!      Any idea what could cause this? Other than this problem, she's a very happy & healthy little mutt.

20090304083428AAcZ0gN	Pets;Cats	How long should i keep my cat enclosed after moving?	i just moved with my cat, and i have to keep him outside. for now he's staying in an outside pen & he seems to like it. (it has 2 solid walls & 2 walls open to the outside, though there's bushes on one open side. he also has a dog house that he likes to sleep in & his tree to play on). i'm a little worried about letting him out, because i don't know if he'll go back to our old house. (he once took a nap in the neighbor's pick up & jumped out in the next town & made it back!)      anyhow, how long should i keep him in the pen?
20090304094718AAC9u2n	Pets;Cats	Is it normal to love a cat the way I love mine?	Alot of people who've answered my questions before, will know about Rocky, my special boy.    Well I've had him since he was a kitten. His mother died during labour and his siblings were too weak to survive. Anyway, he follows me everywhere and I hate leaving him, I actually hurt when I leave him.  I feel protective over him and if anyone were to be horrible to him I would honestly kill them (although he'd probably get there first).   We're incredibly close, and as he was orphaned, I feel I've taken the role of his mother.   I don't look at him as a cat, I look at him as a person, which lots of people find weird.      Is it normal to feel this way about him?

20090304093457AATfYV9	Pets;Dogs	Are there any laws about leaving a dog outside?	My neighbor leaves his dog outside for long periods of time. The dog is only a few (maybe 4) months old, and is sometimes left out for 24hours. He does leave her water. She often crawls under the fence to come play at our house, where the dog is inside. I also bring her over with permission of the owner (who is a friend). I do talk to him, but he says he will do what he wants with his dog. I am just wondering if there are any laws out there to prevent this? I have read studies, and I know the effects of leaving a dog outside constantly.

20090304094545AAHW3ol	Pets;Cats	Why do you think it is a much bigger deal when a mixed litter of pups is born than a mixed litter of kittens?	I've just read more and all around heard more in my lifetime about people opposed to people breeding mixed breed dogs. Yet when people have their intact male and female cats running around the neighborhood, and mama cat gets pregnant, I've never heard more than that they are just irresponsible owners. As to where if an intact dog gets loose and runs around the neighborhood, all hell breaks loose when the owner tries asking a question about what to do.          ....Or maybe I just don't hang around in the cat section enough to see this. :P      Why do you think?

20090304085949AAw9aXz	Pets;Dogs	How can I potty train an 11 year old foster dog?	We are fostering an 11 year old beagle.We take her out on a schedule 5 times per day (7a,11a,3p,7p,11p).  She poops & pees on every walk. This is great except that she still poops and pees in the house.We keep her in the bathroom at night & usually when we wake up we find poop everywhere (it looks like she's walked in it).  She will also sometimes poop while she's eating. We took her to the vet and he recommended that we walk her for 20 minutes every 2 hours b/c she's already on a special diet for her stomach. This is impossible for us to do. She's not incontinent as far as the vet can tell but there must be a happy medium. The only other option he gave was to keep her in the bathroom all day except during walks. I don't want to do that. Is there a training method that I can apply for an older shelter dog that can teach her to hold it or let us know when she has to go?

When i go in what signs should i look for that it is not a good deal and or that the snake might be sick? I already have a 10 gallon tank i used for fish but i gave my betas away. So im left over with the tank, pebbles, 1 10 gal filter and 1 20 gallon filter ( i know they cant be used for the snake ) One heater and a thermostat.. Can i use the thermostat in the snake tank? its a glass one the sticks to the side of the tank through a little suction thingy. Okay so i need help with what kind i should get, how much should it cost, the prices on baby mice ( i think they are called pinkies and they go up in size, and how to keep and care for it. Knowing that they do not have poison in them i will pick them up. How shall i do that? This will be my first pet snake so.. Anyone have any ideas? ( i googled but almost every page i looked at gave me the same four answers )

Last night I was putting together a new chair.  I was on my knees so the bottoms of my legs were sticking straight out behind me.  My dog loves to be near me so he grabbed his favorite toy and layed across my legs (he's only 7 pounds).  The next thing I knew he was curled up in a ball sleeping!  It was so cute I didn't have the heart to move him so I just made it work until I was done with the chair - it just melted my heart to see him like that!

20090304091727AAy8pG1	Pets;Horses	To train..... or not to train.....?	So being an amateur I know that I cannot not exercise or ride others horses for money, or that would be considered professional status... correct? That is always what I have heard. Knowing that I still want to show in the junior and amateur classes I have never accepted money or anything for riding a horse for someone.       I really want to start riding for money though, because I want to be able to show my horses more, but the finances haven't been there to be able to. So since I am still a teenager, I could charge for riding, because I doubt I'll ever make it to the Maclay's or something, and I can just show my horse in non junior classes or what not.      But my question is.... is it worth it? Should I just accept money, or just keep riding as a junior and not charge anything. And if I did start riding for money, I know many people that would pay me, so that isn't really an issue. So I am just confused, and by the way I am 14, almost 15 in like a month, so if that adds any affect on your answer, there it is. Any way, thanks for your time!

The problem is, especially at night, I can't see any poop on the ground, especially since the ground is covered with brown leaves or poop hidden in snow..and at night I just can't see it at all, and I can't hold a flash light because I walk 2 dogs at once.      When I see him put his head down to sniff, I try to see if there's poop. IF there is poop, if the dog sees me looking, he scarfs it down. If I say "leave it" he just eats it fast too. Even when I pull the leash away, it's too late.       Nothing works. no high value treats (hotdogs, cheese, apples)      If he's off leash, and I see him trying to eat poop, I say as firmly as I can "Leave it! COME!" but he sees me coming and runs away while swallowing. When he finishes eating, he comes to me with his head down and tail wagging to appease. What can i say???? I just say "good dog (for coming). ok"       When he's on leash, I do say No when he eats it.      He keeps getting hookworms from this. So I really need help. My neighborhood has a lot of dogs, apparently they aren't picking it up, which makes me mad since I have poop bags in every pocket I have on.      and I take them to an off leash woods trail for their main exercise. so there's poop all over there.      any ideas what I can do to get him to listen to "leave it" for poop???? He does "leave it" perfect for anything else.

20090304103913AAiMYDy	Pets;Cats	Cat is an extremely picky eater?	My 7-year old female is an extremely picky eater. She has had Urinary problems in the past, that were controlled with diet. She has since decided that she doesn't like that food any more. She also doesn't like Royal Canin Urinary either. I have tried different wet foods (Blue Buffalo, Newmans Own, whichever canned foods I could find with the first several ingredients being meat) to see if she liked any of those, because ideally I don't want her to eat dry food anymore. So far, she has smelled the new food, and shook her paw at it and walked away. She is very picky and the only food she wants is the Nine Lives Growing years food I got for my kitten (which I know isn't very good either-would like to find a good food for both). In addition to being prone to urinary problems, she is also a barfer, and has allergies, and sees the vet periodically for those throughout the year.  So I have to be very careful and do things gradually. Any ideas on types of food I can try? Also, anything I can do to help with her urinary problems before they flare up would be appreciated. Thank you!

The store said i had one of each but when i look at photos online and try to compare them with what i got they look like girls. I don't see any testicles on the male if it is a male...I know they wouldn't dropped yet anyways. So The vet i am going to next Friday said they will sex them for me and will fix the male if i do indeed have a male...But isn't it too young for them to be spayed or neutered yet?? I thought/read somewheres 4-6 months cause their sexual organs are not mature enough yet.
20090304094800AAmVC2m	Pets;Fish	What`s wrong with my aquarium?	Hello   We cleaned our aquarium a few weeks ago because it had lots of brown stuff everywhere...not sure what to call it?  Gunk?  Algae?  Mold?  Anyway, after scrubbing the tank, rocks and plants (not with soap, just with a sponge), we refilled it with water, treated it, then put the fish back in.     About two weeks later, it is back to the state it was in before we cleaned it!  Usually no mold grows in it for months at a time.  Why did it all grow back so fast?  Also, our fish has been very lethargic for about a month....he hardly every swims, he just lies down in the shells or behind plants (he is a Betta).   We know the basics, but we are not seasoned fish owners...what`s going wrong in our tank?  Is it a problem with the water that needs to be treated, if so, with what?  We have well water.
20090304102612AABMoVH	Pets;Dogs	Our 4 year old female dog is very aggressive towards strangers, advice?	Our female dog tries to attack any person she does not know when they come up to our house, if she is outside. We live far, far off the road and in the country so she is outside running free most of the time. I hate to keep her kenneled all the time when she wants to be outside. She barks and growls and bites at the strangers ankles/legs. This is becoming a problem. She attacks the delivery person (UPS, FEDEX) or anyone she is not familiar with. We have tried squirting her with water to get her to just run away from people when they come to our house (Read about this online) but it isn't working. Any suggestions to break her of this habit?      She is a very small dog, weighs about 5 lbs.
20090304095952AAKM2wd	Pets;Dogs	Dog behavior question?	I have a young Pit bull, not aggressive, but when I take him out for a walk whenever he comes across another dog he acts strange.      He sniffs like a normal dog, wags his tail, but then all of a sudden he starts swinging his body into the dog, like his bum into the dog so he's facing backwards. He then starts to turn his head and snap, not viciously but playfully, I don't understand why he swings himself into the dog and then snaps while facing backwards? Its confusing.      Any ideas?

I have a 12 months old Dalmation x puppy, she has had one season, which after the season she had a phantom Pregnancy and mastitis, we dealt with this with medication from the vet but it made her poorly and she wasn't herself, and when the we were nearly at the end of the tablets again, she started to bleed again, it has been 3/4 mmonths since that happened and she has mastitis again and i wondered if anyone knew of any herbal remedies i can give to her instead of the vets medicine.      She is still a virgin and never likely to have any puppies, i know after her next season, i have got to have her done, i never wanted her to have any puppies but i didn't ever want her to be done either.

20090304104037AAtH0B6	Pets;Cats	Food for intolerant cat?	My cat has become intolerant, to what I do not know (the tests are too costly), by I suspect to chicken products.      His symptoms : on normal food he pukes twice a day. I succeded, by trial and error, to bring this down to once every 5 days, by giving him Fromm's Salmon à la Veg. (I did try the vet's recommanded brand, but he was worse on it.)      Anybody has an idea of a food that would bring this down to a complete stop of the puking?       (For history the cat is a male, 9 years old, fixed and spends most of the winter inside. He is also sensible to magnesium, he did have some rocks in his kidneys at some point)

She is healthy & well =) she can still climb up & down the stairs, jog around, & of course she is less active now, but she is active in her own way. I am impressed with her! =)      I have been feeding her: Senior Nutrience Dry Food (which I strongly believe it is the reason for her healthy-well life style now). I used to work at a pet store & I learned variety of dog's food there.

20090304105946AAYfQ3V	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog do this?	My 1 1/2 year old male is getting used to our new little kitten, yet I cant trust him around the kitten alone yet because of his prey drive. It's been 1 week now. He yawns constantly when he is right in the kittens face. And just stares at him. His pupils dialate but I stay calm. I know tensing could set him off. Ive kept them seperated, and allowed them to smell and touch. When he is gentle, and inquisitive, I say, "Nice, Good boy, baby" and I pet him even more than the kitten. I believe we are making progress, and I have read alot from other sites, but nothing quite catagorizes this particular "Yawning" thing. so, any suggestions would be great as to what more I could do.

20090304100406AAniDu3	Pets;Horses	My horse is acting up?...?	I have a Mustang gelding (captured by the BLM in 2000) that I bought from a good friend of mine, who is now sadly deceased. Anyway, the horse will act perfectly fine for the first few minutes of riding him, but then he'll start doing a sideways-dance and trying to turn around, and when I attempt to turn him back where I want him to go, he'll just continue going sideways until he runs into a ditch/tree/street sign/river/dangerous something.      I'm quite a competent rider (I have been riding constantly since I was 6, and I'm 45), so when he first started doing this I checked all his tack to make sure it wasn't bothering him, and that his feet were OK, ect.       I fixed the problem (somewhat) by adding a tie-down and changing out his bit for a harsher straight one, as well as tightening the curb chain, but I just can't figure out why he would do this. I think it may be herd anxiety, seeing as he doesn't do it while in a group.      Any tips on how to solve this?

20090304111639AA7UFtL	Pets;Rodents	Why does my guinea pig keep on hiding?	It started about two days ago. He was out of his little house in his cage asking for food. When I walked away, I heard a loud noise coming from his cage, like he bumped into something. The only things in his cage are his cardboard house and his porcelain bowl. I doubt he tipped his plate over because he puts his paws on it all the time when asking for food and it never tips over, as it's too heavy.       After that incident, he hardly comes out of his house, not even to ask for food anymore! I have had my guinea pig for over two years now and he's always been comfortable around us, but I can't figure out what's wrong with him. The only thing I can think of is that he got hurt somehow when he was jumping around for food, and is afraid of going out now. :(

Yesterday evening, I found one alone in the bushes and then a few minutes later I found another in a different bush. Put them in a small box with some paper and left them outside overnight. Because it was cold-ish (65 degrees) and I didn't want the cats to get them, I closed them in the outside dryer to sleep. BTW: I have no experience with birds. I thought they would be okay :(  I was hoping that when the hen returned this morning I could just let the two I found go and she would take them back. This morning however, one is laying down very close to dead and the other, although still peeping, doesn't look so good either. It's sluggish, not walking, eyes closed. Did I kill them!?  Was it the dryer? Was it the cold?  Were they abandoned because they were sick? The hen returned this morning and of course looked at them and walked away. :( Sadly, they will probably die...

My cat has not eaten in almost 4 days, in that span he has vomited about 15 times in which its just liquid. He has been drinking water a little more than usual but he basically won't eat anything... not even his favorite treats. We took him to the vet last night and he gave him a blood test and a needle to stop the vomitting. He has vomited 4 times since the needle. Also has not gone to the bathroom since he has not eaten anything. The blood test came back this morning and the doctor could not find anything wrong with the results. I am going to take him to get x-rays today. What could be wrong? does anyone know a site that could tell me possibly what's wrong? this is bothering me so much, I know after awhile from a lack of eating it causes liver damage.

20090304104824AAbXDbY	Pets;Rodents	My guinea pig is scratching alot and looks as if she is itching, could she have mites?	I just got a guinea pig and I have never had one before so I am very unfamiliar to their behaviors.  She is very very small and the place I bought her from wasn't very clean.  I have had her for about 4 days.  She is still very skittish and when I hold her I can't check her for mites cause one she is very small and two she still isn't use to being held.  At first I thought she was happy and just doing a lot of popcorning and running around but now I wonder if its because she is itching.  She will scratch herself and then will popcorn and sometime run around and then stop and scratch and do it again.  And she also makes a noise when doing it.  I haven't figured out her sounds yet.  Any suggestions?
20090304111056AAZmCA2	Pets;Birds	How to care for duck thats nesting?	There is a small lake outside our building at work w/ a couple ducks and one fo them has built a nest in a large potted plant in our breezeways next to this pond. She has been nesting for the last couple weeks or so and people started getting concerned about how she eats since she is constantly sitting on this nest, so some of the women have been placing bread by her which this duck has no problems gobbling right up, so now she constantly being monitored by my coworkers adn on occasion given pieces of bread. Now, the question has risen as to whether we should place a bowl of water by her? If she's eating the bread, wouldn't she need water as well? What should we do if anything? The male duck which swim nearby seems to completely oblivious to her.

20090304113526AALHJg6	Pets;Dogs	Why does my puppy just sit there and stare at me?	My puppy, whom I've had for about 6-7 weeks now, just sits there.  He stares and stares... and does nothing.  He's fairly well trained for a four month old, he knows "Sit," "Down," "Off," "Wait," "Come here," and his name...  but when I'm busy making dinner or working on something that's not him-centric, he just looks at me.        At this point I'd like to point out, that I try to devote about 2-3 hours a day to him.  This includes play time and a walk.  His feeding and potty breaks are just built into my daily routine. Anyways...      He has tons of toys in all varieties and when his half brother (my boyfriend's dog) comes over- he'll play with them like its going out of style.  When I sit down and hold him for a sec he'll decide to finally play with the toys that I play with, but yeah.  This dog, contrary to the boyfriend's is not very active, nor does it feel the need to entertain itself.      Any suggestions on how to get him to occupy himself?  Oh, and he apparently doesn't like peanut butter, so that's out of the question...  his kong just sits there...sigh.

I have a dwarf pleco(he is about 3 inches and hasnt grown in about 2 months) in my 20 gallon tank with 6 guppies and 4 platties. I have a few logs in my tank and all my pleco does is live on one log. He hasn't moved from the corner only to get food. My brother has a 10 gallon tank and wants to get a pleco but plecos can live in 20 and up depending on size.

20090304121007AA9bMlR	Pets;Dogs	Dog neutering question...?	I am getting my puppy neutered next week.  The vet that I use is over an hour away and the hours are not that great.  I know that they suggest leaving your dog over night, but to do that I would need to take another half a day off of work.  I asked the vet if it would be OK if I picked him up the same night instead.  I live alone and can keep my puppy calm for as long as needed, there are no distractions at my house that would cause him to get hyper.  The vet said it should be fine, but are there any reasons that I should let him spend the night?  I am extremely limited on vacation time so I need to use it sparingly.  Thanks for your help!      Side note - I live about 5 minutes from another vet and they have a 24 hour emergency number so I can get emergency help if necessary.

20090304122129AAscUvx	Pets;Dogs	What action can be taken to protect my falsely accussed dogs of an attack in the local park?	My dogs have never left my yard however they have now been accussed of attacking someone in the local park and now branded as "Dangerous Dogs".  They do bark ( but never snarled, growled nor shown teeth) when anyone walks close to my fenceline but have never bitten anyone in the 10 years I have had them.  They do this now due to the fact that they had been teased by numerous and varied people who find nothing better to do than agrivate dogs for fun.  Apart from this I have had no further complaints concerning my dogs during this period of time.  I had understood that there was someone who had difficulty concerning a dog within the past month and I have been informed by the co-ordinator of Neighbourhood Watch in my area that there has never been any issues with my dogs and that they have never been out of my yard however there are a number of other dogs of similar breed (Husky cross) but white and fluffy (my dogs are neither of this discription) which has been causing concerns for the area.     My dogs and I now face a bleak future of wrongful nomination (dangerous animals) and financial hardship (pensioner) due to this outrageous claim.  I am now required to pay a fee of $265 per dog registration, place signs all over my property, microchip the animals (at my expense) and supply this evidence to the local council. Mind you, this has now the situation we face even though the local dog inspector had done a perimiter check and found no evidence of any kind to say that my dogs have left the yard by any means including digging under the fence.   I am not taking this lightly and am willing to fight the local council on their findings and labeling for my dogs rights not to mention, for wrongful acussed.   I just wonder what legal rights my dogs have  (and for myself for that matter) from this situation and if local council can be sued for their incompetant ability of wrongful accusations.  If this continues I will be taking the matter to the media, that's for sure!!
