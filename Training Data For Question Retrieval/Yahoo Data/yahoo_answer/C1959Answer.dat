Is not compatible with iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod Classic (1st generation), iPod touch. check out the Xbox site for a full list.    If Xbox does not support a player, there's no way to MAKE it support it. Maybe, at some point, Microsoft will do the voodoo they need to do to support others.|`|GxLpWJZNaa	there is no way to do that because the xbox 360 is a microsoft brand and its not compatible with ipod. the xbox is compatible with the ZUNE player. hope i helped|`|5q5ftpfmaa	the xbox has a usb plug. plug your ipod into it. you should be able to play your music.|`|XiyrpRvnaa	you already answered your question

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	windows live in terms of computer games is the same as the XBOX Live service, so yes people with PC copies of XBOX games can sometimes play along with people on XBOX.  I think it depends on the game|`|MGyzOIKqaa	windows live is hotmaail, and you can use xbox account to log into hotmail and also windows live chat is other feature|`|8PivjDYgaa	Windows Live is the XBOX Live service for PC's. Only a select few games are cross platform (play on xbox against people on PC.) One of those being Shadowrun. As for Call of Duty, Halo, Gears of War those big name titles only go platform to platform. So if you play it on xbox you will only play people on xbox not those playing it on a PC.

k8MaZA6haa	It sucks so much  the screen can break very easy
n3Mk3cvCaa	do this exactly. i had the same problem if it is an itouch or iphone than reset it by holding the button that brings you back to home every time and the sleep button at the same time for a while before letting go. This will trigger a reset of your itouch or iphone. if you have a scroll wheel ipod unplug then plug it in over and over again or rotate the wheel pressing fairly hard on the wheel while pressing the middle button. if this doesn't work try trouble shooting with your usb drive. or try using another usb drive on your computer to plug the ipod into. Oh i didn't see ipod nano. my nano appeared in the window after a while leave it in the itunes open and the nano plugged in before trying the other things. maybe and hour-a day. it will appear! usually! otherwise apple.com has suggestions.|`|vssM8RDdaa	STOP TALKING IN ALL CAPS

hSxpAPNkaa	HTC Touch Max 4G? What, 3G isn't good enough for you?
SDHvDNGJaa	Ve a Telcer, Movistar o Unefon y ve los modelos que tienen...<br>  Salu2 =?) <br>  ?
VrO0i7rpaa	Wow...Iphoneros...No, el iphone "touch" no es completo, ni es todo en uno, es un ladrillo enorme (o sea no es practico), no es eficiente. Quiza este bonito pero no tiene nada de eso. Aqui te va una guia que en otra pregunta respond√¨ de porque no es el mejor.<br>  1. No graba video.<br>  2. La camara no tiene flash ni ninguna funcion adicional.<br>  3. No puedes usar tu musica como tono sin pedir permiso a Apple<br>  4. No soporta videollamada, ni siquiera el ichat tan popular en las macbook<br>  5. Su bluetooth no sirve para intercambio de archivos<br>  6. No tiene soporte (ni lector) adobe<br>  7. No tiene reproductor flash<br>  8. No puedes bajar imagenes de internet<br>  9. No soporta envio de mms<br>  10. Es lentisimo en 3g (hasta 21 segundos para abrir una pagina)<br>  11. No tiene altavoz estereo.<br>  12. Solo reproduce 2 formatos musicales (y estan lejos de ser los mas practicos y de mayor calidad)<br>  12. No tiene funcionalidad VoIP<br>  13. No soporta grabacion de voz<br>  14. No soporta comandos de voz.<br>  15. No tiene teclas de acceso a la musica sin antes minimizar otra aplicacion<br>  16. No soporta java (ni juegos java)<br>  17. No hay msn messenger original.<br>  18. No puedes usarlo liberado sin hackearlo e invalidar la garantia.<br>  19. Para cambiar la bateria necesita pasar forzosamente por servici? tecnico. Claro. Si no invalidaste la garantia<br>  20. Las aplicaciones EN SU TOTALIDAD deben ser COMPRADAS por itunes o invalidas la garantia<br>  21. Las actualizaciones que mencionas son solo para soporte de software, no a?aden nada nuevo.<br>  22. Algo que olvidaba. Su pantalla no tiene antireflex (para luz intensa pues, para la solar)<br>  23. Olvidaba tambien que no puede copiar y pegar texto en el navegador<br>  24. Tambien olvidaba que no tiene Radio Fm ni puedes oir estaciones por red en tiempo real (pues solo funciona via podcast)<br>  25. Ojoh joh. Algo importantisimo! No tiene una memoria de respaldo! Solo la interna y la RAM!<br>  26. No tiene funcionalidad qwerty alfanumerica.<br>  27. Su gps funciona solo con red y lo peor del caso es que sus mapas no pueden ser consultados offline. jajaja (Risa sarcastica a los que osaron decir que yo no tenia razon)<br>  28. El push mail requiere una cuota adicional a la renta. No puedo negarselos, es un negociazazo.<br>  29. No soporta redes HSDPA<br>  30. Esta es nueva para mi. No puedes mandar mensaje si estas haciendo una llamada.<br>  31. No lleva (y aun no hay aplicaciones) para hacer conteo del tiempo que llevas en una llamada.<br>  32. Por supuesto tampoco graba llamadas<br>  33. No puede usarse como modem<br>  34. Tampoco es compatible con teclados bluetooth<br>  35. No puede usarse como webcam<br>  36. El unico modo offline es el modo avion<br>  37. No puede abrir paginas al mismo tiempo, las paginas extras que abres se agolpan una tras de otra y tiene limite de 8<br>  38. Algo muy evidente y que ha sido una queja de los mismos iphoneros. No se puede expandir la memoria (pues no, se les va el negocio)<br>  39. Ni su ecualizador musical ni sus contactos de agenda soportan video<br>  Asi que como veras, los iphoneros no tienen ni idea de lo que estan recomendando, el mejor sin duda es hasta el dia de hoy el Nokia N96.<br>  Porque? Aparte de tener todas las funciones del iphone (sin la pantalla tactil que de todos modos es una inutilidad si tienes los dedos enormes como yo o si estas comiendo con las manos) no tiene NINGUNA de sus limitaciones y ademas.<br>  1. Camara de 5 mpx con lente Carl Zeisz flash led dual multiformato, autofocus, estabilizador de imagen, estabilizador de video, editor de fotografias y video (optimizados por Adobe Photoshop), modos de escena, modo de rafaga, iso ajustable, zoom 20x digital, etc.<br>  2. Camara de Video que garaba en calidad Divx<br>  3. Salida a televisi√≤n para que veas en pantalla grande tus fotos y videos.<br>  4. Bluetooth estereo con funcionalidad de audio 5.1y definitivamente si sirve para intercambio de archivos (no como el basuriphone)<br>  5. Reproductor musical, te reproduce cualquier formato de musica, asi que por giga puedes meter hasta 1500 canciones (eso es lo maximo que le he podido meter) y mejorado con audio DSP (substituye al altavoz cuadrafonico que traia la demas serie N)<br>  6. Reproductor de video (tambien te soporta cualquier formato, aunque lo tienes que ajustar al tama?o de la pantalla)<br>  7. Memoria de 16gb internos y con slot para expandirlo (soporta micro sd de la cual ya existe de hasta 32gb que te soporta sin problemas, y si le particionas la memoria interna y le compras esa memoria ya de entraba tendras 64gb de memoria)<br>  8. Definitivamente no es un ladrillo como el iphone, sus dimensiones son 103 x 55 x 18 mm.<br>  9. Tiene sintonizador digital de televisi√≤n, usa la red para sintonizar, o sea que por el momento solo te soportara unos cuantos canales pero al menos lo hace y en gran calidad<br>  10. Slider dual, eso te ayuda para tener accesos directos a la musica y al video(no necesitas minimizar una pantalla para usar el reproductor como con el basuriphone)<br>  11. 3.5 g CON capacidad para Videoconferencia<br>  12. Wi Fi<br>  13. Gps con antena interna NO dependiente de red y los mapas SI los puedes revisar en modo offline, pero tambien tiene funcionalidad agps por si quieres usar la red para mejorar la navegaci√≤n. Y sin embargo los mapas se actualizan con la red satelital!!<br>  14. Radio FM con conexi√≤n visual y a podcasts que permiten interacci√≤n con el DJ<br>  15. Acelerador grafico<br>  16. Pantalla que rota con el movimiento.<br>  17. Sistema operativo symbian Os s60 3d edition con Feature Pack 2, el mejor sistema operativo conocido en celulares completamente customizable y con hasta 1 millon 750 mil aplicaciones descargables, mas de la mitad gratuitas.<br>  Ese si tiene todas las caracteristicas que pides|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Iphone Touch....<br>  Salu2 =?)|`|0f9ac8277cfc31dbe3e7592b1a865a0caa	Hola<br>  <br>  Estaba copiando la respuesta de Rhuomble en una pregunta que realice para destacar porque el iphone no es buen equipo y dista de estar como el mas completo, por lo que gracias me ahorrate mucha escritura :)<br>  Regresando a la pregunta y ya sin el punto de percepcion y sobre bases claras de porque no el iphone pasamos a la parte del cual si.<br>  En mi opinion el mas completo etc etc etc es el HTC toch diamnd<br>  Procesador  Qualcomm?

VCzsfVM5aa	it works really well, and for the price it is unmatched.  I can call anyone on a cell or landline.  I noticed after a 4 hour call it tends to drop the call, but it has only happened a few times.  I would recomend it.  You only pay once a year and can make unlimited calls in the U.S.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	It does not affect your regular phone, nor bring its base cost down. If you have a per call/minute LD service you can reduce or eliminate that with MagicJack. It will use some internet bandwidth.<br>  <br>  Since it relies on your computer being on and operating, I would not use it as a replacement for a more traditional home phone service, but as a supplement to it. I might be tempted to use it to replace long distance though.
VpWyDdGraa	Sometimes it's for for your safety and their peace of mind. So many things can draw and get you out of focus, Do not worry about who has what when your parents feel you are ready then they will grant your request, other than that use the home Phone and don't worry.

kgTPnjhkaa	Harmonix and its parent company MTV Games/Viacom recently declined Activision‚Äôs offer to reach an agreement that would allow the use of Guitar Hero guitar controllers with Rock Band. We have been and remain open to discussions with Harmonix and MTV Games/Viacom about the use of our technology in Rock Band. Unfortunately for Rock Band users, in this case Harmonix and MTV Games/Viacom are unwilling to discuss an agreement with Activision.‚Äù<br>  <br>  So you acknowledge that you have the update your customers want, but you are not going to release it until the competition meets your monentary demands. Sounds like Harmonix is not giving in to your extortion tactics. I‚Äôve already paid Activision for their stuff. What justification does your company feel it has in seeking additional money, besdides the obvious desire to keep your GH customers from enjoying a competitive product.<br>  <br>  ‚ÄúActivision‚Äôs top priority is to provide consumers with a seamless marriage of best-in-class hardware and software. We are focusing our efforts on innovating hardware and software that are designed to work together, work flawlessly and provide an enjoyable gaming experience.‚Äù<br>  <br>  I notice customer satisfaction is missing from your mission statement. By the way, when it comes to technology that‚Äôs good for customers, any ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù between hardware and software is the exact opposite of a good thing for customers. Closed and proprietary technology is a bad, expensive and ultimately un-enjoyable thing for customers.<br>  <br>  As a consumer of your products, I am hoping that your company will see the light and give up on this fight with Harmonix. Look at it this way: If the heart of the matter is compensation for your technology, then why don‚Äôt you just ask your GH customers to pay an additional rights fee to Activision enable the Guitar Hero controller with Rock Band?|`|EpvHhbByaa	They will work with Rock Band 2, but not Rock Band 1|`|lVlmKgKiaa	it won't work for rock band 1 but it does for rock band 2|`|rv7rzYMlaa	maybey
qWicVoU9aa	If you have not already done so try turning it off and back on.  If that does not work then with the device on take the battery out for about 2 minutes and then put it back together and turn it on and see if it works.  If still not working you need to contact T-mobile
AbRfd29Haa	There is really no difference between a "Data" DVD and a "Video" DVD, other than the format. <br>  <br>  Regular everyday DVD players are only guaranteed to understand the DVD-Video format. This is at the low-level just a data disc (unlike CD, there are only two formats on DVDs... ISO9660 and UDF, at least for all intents and purposes), but it has specific files in specific places, which are known to the DVD player as the essential characteristics of a DVD-Video disc. This includes top-level VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS directories, and "video object" files (.VOB files), which are stored in the VIDEO_TS directory. You have to make a DVD-Video directory structure using some kind of DVD authoring program. <br>  <br>  Some DVD players and all advanced media players (Sony PS3, X-Box 360) support other things, more computer-like data. But while a DVD-Video disc is well defined (eg, there's a menu or video on the disc that's the starting point), there's no way to specify a default "thing to do" on an unstructured data DVD. So most devices will simply land you in a file brower, and give you options to play any files they support, MP3, AVI, MPEG, JPEG, etc. But this is not any part of the DVD spec, it's just extra stuff the designers put in there. So it's a bit different for every player, and you can't assume which files they can play.<br>  <br>  There are a few exceptions... a couple of formats have some extended support on some players. Obviously, game consoles understand their own game formats very well, and can often be set to auto-play those. Some DVD players support the Microsoft WMV/HD format, and can play these... at least if they're not protected (HD-Net used to sell some of these... I have a documentary about Enron on WMV/HD format). Some players are certified DivX players, and may auto-play an appropriate DivX file... if they're DivX 6 players, they can also give you menus and interactive options in a DivX 6 file (assuming they're in there.. go to <a href="http://www.divx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.divx.com</a> for more information).|`|jxdMIAoBaa	I have definitely been trying this for a very long time.I have tried DVD-R's and DVD+R's but cant get either one of them to play in a DVD player.The only way it would work is when i put it in my computer and opened it up like a folder.So im hoping that someone can help me with this as well.

1d193a581f413c8f01296a8f36389636aa	Yes Target does sell T-Mobile service with contracts and without contract (Prepaid).  However they don't have a lot of phone selection.  Your best bet would be at a T-Mobile store.  If you want to activate your own line with a contract at Target then you would have to show them a driver license.  They will do a credit check before activation.<br>  <br>  If you mother is the primary person and holder on the T-Mobile account then it is unlikely Target will sell you the phone and have it activated.  The primary person needs to be present when they activate the 2nd line to the account.  <br>  <br>  On prepaid phones with T-Mobile at Target you don't need to show any identification and you can purchase the prepaid phones there as well.

XcF4L6KMaa	Dumb question, but did you download the correct theme for that phone? what I mean by that is are you sure you didnt download a curve theme for the pearl? If not, then the only place my downloads go is the downloads folder on my home screen. If you didnt move the folder,, it may be in the applications folder, under downloads.
nhYABprkaa	finalize the disc then it will be playable on your computer, do it on the cameras menu.  After this is done, you can drag and drop all files to your PC<br>  <br>  no finalize = no see the disc on the PC<br>  <br>  <<<edit>>><br>  <br>  should be 2 folders, 1 with videos - .vob  files and another with JPG as picture files. open the disc, open the folders, highlight the files you want, and "drag" them to your "my documents" <br>  <br>  if everything is intermixed, look for the jpg or jpeg files highlight and drag & move to a folder.  Learn to use the ctrl button, it is for selecting items.

jLTDqVHsaa	Go ahead and switch, you'll be fine, you won't mess anything up.<br>  <br>  Some steps to take:<br>  <br>  -After hooking up the TV, switch the TV to HDMI input.<br>  <br>  -Make sure your cable box is outputting 16x9 video.  This should be in a cable box settings menu somewhere.<br>  <br>  -Then, make sure your TV is set to display widescreen video in a widescreen format.  Depending on your TV, you may have to set the display to "WIDE" or something similar.<br>  <br>  -If you've done it right, your TV will show HD programming on HD channels in widescreen format, filling the screen.  On SD channels, the video should be "pillarboxed," with black bars on the left and right.  This is normal, as SD channels are shot with regular TV sets in mind, and were never intended to fill a widescreen TV.  So, when you watch it pillarboxed, you're watching it as it was shot, with no distortion.<br>  <br>  -If your cable box gives you the option, you might wish to de-select the option to output in 1080i, so the cable box will convert to 720p before it gets to the TV.  Otherwise, the TV will do the converting on its end.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~<br>  As for 1080i vs. 720p, one is not necessarily "better" than the other.  1080i is interlaced-scan video (look up the tech details of this), which might look a bit blurry in fast movement, such as sports.  It does, however, have more lines of resolution.  720p has fewer lines, but it shows progressive video, showing each full frame in its entirety at the same time.  Note that ESPN has chosen 720p as its format because of its sports programming.  Channels that use more stationary shots, like Discovery, tend to choose 1080i.  In short, each has its benefits and drawbacks.|`|08a542503113638ff89e9695a92c2c8baa	if you have a TV that supports 720p, it will support 1080i without any problem.<br>  <br>  The cable box will send the proper resolution (which is channel dependant) to your box.  <br>  <br>  For example, ESPN is in 720p, where USA and SCiFI HD are in 1080i|`|4b0ee2917c957760d982e3082b0bb44eaa	Depending on if you have a Scientific Atlanta box or not it is very simple. Switch the line from component to HDMI and make sure you unplug the old cables. The box will automatically try to use the composite or coax first. <br>  Then turn off the box.<br>  hold guide and info at the same time until a screen appears on the TV<br>  hit B to use HD mode]<br>  then follow the instructions, it is very simple.

So you called XBox or Microsoft or whoever and they sent you a box to ship it back in.  They should have had some paperwork in there listing what to send and what not to send.  If it said to remove the hard drive before shipping an you just forgot, then i would call them or try to contact then in anyway telling them your dilemma.  Maybe there is a simple resolution to this problem.  I'm sure this happens way more then you think.  I would be surprised if they didn't help you.  Hopefully everything works out for you.  Good Luck.|`|VlmN3TLeaa	Um its ok.<br>  Ur suppose to remove the Hard drive otherwise they would not return it back to u.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|m4Adh6tUaa	id call them and tell them ASAP<br>  <br>  its 50/50 that u get it back

79SuxyPkaa	Well any online content (besides demos I think) have to be played online.  I downloaded some online stuff for bioshock and i coudn't even load my file without being signed into live.  Try going to oyur download history(where is has account managemt and then i think history or something like that) and try to download it again <br>  p.s. you HAVE to be signed into live|`|7lmfkZgfaa	Hey, well there is still hope. What you can do is go back, connect to xbox live, and perform a license transfer (NOTE: both xbox 360 AND computer must be connected online). It lets you tansfer licenses from dlc to your xbox, if that DLC was downloaded through another xbox. This lets you play DLC on your games, regardless of being on- or offline. This helped me out when I had rock band content, my xbox eventually died out on me, then got a new one. the content said it couldn't access it for whatever reason nor could I play any of the content songs offline. So I performed a license transfer and everything was back to normal :)<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped you out in anyway, because The Lost and Damned content is really amazing and wouldn't want you or anyone missing out on it.|`|cHh0PTTsaa	DLC works only with the machine the HDD was connected to for offline usage.  So what you should have done was bring your console with hdd and downloaded it in the first place.  Your account on the XB servers now has that machine's ID attached to it for that particular DLC so even if you delete that DLC and re-download it again onto your own console, it maintains the original machine ID.  Therefore, anytime you want to access that DLC you will need to be connected to Live so that XBL can verify you are the proper owner.<br>  <br>  We can no longer help to fix this other than contacting MS support.  It is now an internal problem from what you have told us.

UtUK53Vyaa	Its nice and light. Battery isn't that well because if you use it a lot then it will last for like 2 days. The camera is really good. 3.2 mega pixel. It's as if you have a portable camera in your pocket just sitting there. Especially if you have a facebook or myspace.  you can put music onto it. So you wouldn't really need an ipod but ipod is still perferred.|`|SKkE3fK1aa	No, it is slow and only has dumb cellphone features such as calling, texting, music, pictures, video and bluetooth. It's not a smartphone, so I don't like it. It doesnt have GPS, Productivity tools (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Adobe PDF and Adobe Flash). You can only install Java appications on it so you cant get a descent good app or game for it.<br>  <br>  I still like the slow N73 Music Edition that is a SMARTphone (Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition; Symbian OS 9.1) rather than a slow CELLphone.

4pApG5Kqaa	There's another way:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ventones.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ventones.com</a><br>  <br>  If you do not wish to register for an account there which requires your mobile phone number, go to www.bugmenot.com and enter www.ventones.com for some Ventones accounts you can try (usually the ones with over 60% accuracy work).<br>  <br>  Once you've got onto Ventones with an account, it will be very easy to get started. First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.<br>  <br>  Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)<br>  <br>  Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)<br>  <br>  (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

7ajz1w2Raa	This is the best I have for you. Not sure if it works. I found this online.  This is how you use the auto program<br>  <br>  1. Turn on the device to be programmed.<br>  2. Press and hold SET for three seconds<br>  3 Press the corresponding Device Button (TV, SAT, VCR, DVD,CBL,Audio)<br>  4. Aim the remote at the device. Press the power button once and release. Each time the Remote searches for a code, the device button LED flashes twice. When the device turns off, immediately press ENTER to save the code (before the device button LED flashes again) This could take several minutes.

VgIBEANxaa	Yes, that is normal, especially if you have large TV, like above 42 inches, and you're sitting very close to it.  Without an HD signal your HDTV is nothing but a huge and glorified standard definition TV.<br>  <br>  Standard definition means the picture only has a 640x480 progressive signal, or maybe even only a 320x240 interlaced.  Widescreen high definition is 848x480 progressive, 424x240 interlaced.  With a big TV, you can see how these resolutions would look blocky.|`|us8isFmiaa	What does blocky/bad mean?

TBsVmUoCaa	Unfortunately there is no simple way of fixing it. The cause of the black spot is due to bending the screen inward, consequently changing the shape of the screen- inside the screen are multi-layered pixels. The only way is to send it back to the manufacturer and have it replaced/repaired, if they offer that service. If they don't offer that service, I'm afraid you're stuck with that black spot indefinitely.<br>  <br>  PS: water, dust, and outside material may also cause black spots on screens, and cleaning it is not possible for consumers.

6aWhKl1Laa	You do not need the Wii Balance Board. All you need is the remote and nunchuk to play, or just the Wii Remote by itself. But frankly, it is much, much easier to play with the Wii Remote and nunchuk. Both the Wii Balance Board and single Wii remote controls are sort of wonky. It just doesn't seem to work out that well.

n0rJH0l6aa	Yeah you can easily get an extention off of ebay or you could go for the more pricey option of getting a wireless modem and an xbox wireless adapter.|`|SBcxooLsaa	i dont understand question|`|ewswVOrTaa	Whether you go wireless or wired you are going to have to buy a router.<br>  <br>  You can get one for about Ôø°30-Ôø°50 but make sure you ask the person in the shop if it is suitable for Xbox Live.  I paid Ôø°38 for mine and it is fine.<br>  <br>  An Xbox wireless adapter means you won't have to run a wire but to be honest, I had one and it didn't work.  Your cable obviously reaches the O2 modem now so you would just have to plug the cable from your Xbox into it, plug the PC in as well and away you go.  I did have some problems with mine setting the NAT to "Open" for it to work properly but did it in the end, just Google away or look in the manual that comes with the router.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

SKkE3fK1aa	you can always buy a phone from a Nokia Store (or any other store of your cellphone company) JUST NOT FROM A NETWORK SERVICE. If you buy or get a phone from Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and all the other service providers out there, then it will be locked. After buying a phone that you like from the store of your phone's company (like Nokia Store for Nokia Phones, Sony Erricson Store for SE Phones, etc.) then you can just use your current sim card on it.<br>  <br>  Also, prepaid or pay-as-you-go means you will buy credits for your phone. Unlike a plan or a contract where in you have to pay monthly and have a number of texts and a number of minuites of call, PAYG or Prepaid is the opposite of it. You will get a SIM card and put it on your phone and then you will buy credits for it (it is sold on cards and there is a number you have to dial in order to 'load' the credits). Then you can use the credits to call or text or internet or any other thing that a phone can do until your credits run out. Also, you dont pay monthly for it, you just buy credits when you feel the need.|`|ntYEImPlaa	you can switch the phone, but it would be full price if you didnt by the phone. its  free to do it by phone or the computer. but i think its like 20 dollars at the store? and prepaid means you pay for minutes and then when the minutes run out you just keep doing it.

50e35f59d583e60676c361432850e608aa	the only ways to get games on your ipod is to <br>  a. buy off itunes (preferred)<br>  b. download illegally off websites. (hard+complicated)<br>  <br>  I suggest you buy them off itunes.<br>  There is lots of free games on itunes that most of the time are better then the paid ones. All of my games were free|`|Vy4jvBjDaa	Really all you have to do is get the software update that costs $10 (unless your iPod came with it.) Then just tap the App Store icon and browse games. Some are free, some cost. (Usually alot of paid games have a free "lite" version for you to try it out.) There is no need to plug in your iPod into your comupter and get the games from iTunes. You just tap the App Store icon and find something you like. Click buy/install and type in your account password.
us8isFmiaa	Connect the video and L-R audio jacks on the VCR to spare audio and video inputs on the TV. If you have used up all the audio and video inputs on your TV, you can always hook up a standard piece of CATV cable from the RF out of the VCR to the TV antenna in connector. VCRs usually put out a signal on channel 3 or 4 so just switch your TV to one of those channels and you're in business.

c231bbpTaa	If you don't have a HDTV, then your tv might have a yellow, white and red slots that are next to each other. Some tv's only have two. Mine only has the white and yellow slots. The slots are colored so you just match the colors. Then you need to find the input channel which could be a button on your remote or if you flip through the channels down past 1 or 2 it might come up. If you don't have an HDTV and you don't see these colored slots, which could be in the back or the front of your tv, then you have a really old tv and need an adapter of some sort.If you do have an HDTV then you might need an HD cable.|`|Li45o7ovaa	its different with every tv but i suggest getting an HDMI cable its alot simpler. note it will only work if your tv has an HDMI slot in the back of it (almost every HDTV has one) HDMI cables are pretty cheap about 30 dollars or so at walmart|`|jxpV13rTaa	hdmi cable is the best, but your tv has to support hdmi to have one, so if your using RCA plugs (red white and yellow plugs) the there will be video inputs throughout the tv. some have them located in the front, back, and side. the white and yellow are the only two that you need. the colors will match up so there will be no way you wont know where they go (unless your tv is ancient). if there is no red slot dont worry, it doesnt really matter but if there is use it. the must be inline with eachother (i.e. yellow directly above the white, and red directly below the white, not all over the place)|`|QMbi1VuIaa	the colors and slots should be in a straight line, up and down. Just first plug in the yellow one into the yellow slot and ect. then after you have finished doing that flip through the inputs like video 1 and such. You should see it after a while. main thing remember the cables always go up and down. yellow on the top, white in the middle, and red on the bottom. dont put the red one in between the other colors like the blue and green. It should be right below the white one lol. Hopefully that can help!
0NueS3Whaa	Um, I don't understand... Text messages are never charged for by megabyte size. <br>  You might be looking at the Data for your internet part of your phone bill, which would make sense, since Verizon charges by megabyte for their internet browser.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Out of those it is a no-brainer.  Definitely the 450D.<br>  <br>  Consider the Sony Alpha A350 too.  There are loads of Minolta AF, Sigma and Tamron lenses on eBay for the Sony dSLRs.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Andre M Is right. <br>  <br>  Firstly, they are about the same size, so no, there is no huge difference in size. In theory, the 450d is a better camera. It has a larger screen, a few more megapixels, an unbiased AF motor, and of course live view. The D60 is a good camera, but technically not up to scratch with the Rebel. At Andre's suggestion, go into the dealer and handle both cameras and see which feels better to you.<br>  <br>  From a technical standpoint, the Rebel is better.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Not a huge size difference, but they are two very different cameras just by brand so try holding both of them to see which you like. I would have to say that the 450D is slightly better and it also has an AF motor built into it which is nice to have for some lenses that dont have one built into the lens itself.

N2rntAqvaa	It is not confirmed, but it is expected.  Sony had never said that it will happen.  But people keep saying they will.  <br>  <br>  But don't lose your hopes, because even if Sony is planning on making a price drop, why would they announce it?  More and more people would just stop buying it knowing they can wait.  Sony wants people to think that there will not be a price drop and that they should buy it now for an expensive price.<br>  <br>  It is expected to be on April.  If you are planning on buying one, I am HIGHLY recommending you should wait till April.|`|SsIVKLrdaa	yes there is going to be a price drop<br>  cause eventually somebody will come <br>  out with a new gaming system|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Yep, they are going to give it a price drop, good luck buying one.|`|URpSHVF9aa	Whatever you do dont trust the first answer i tried to do it once and it is to complicated they recieve the ps3 not you<br>  <br>  There have been alot of rumors of the ps3 dropping to $300 but Sony has denied those rumors but you never know what will happen.<br>  I do hope so that it drops because then the people will start getting ps3 and see how it has already amazed people who have bought it|`|mPaqhgUuaa	That's just a rumor and Sony has yet to confirm it. Personally, I don't think there will be a price drop until 2010, the only thing Sony earns from you guys is from the games. The PS3 itself is worth over $399, considering the good quality Blu-Ray and it's basically a multimedia device.
45aG5rNQaa	Hm.. well how old are you?<br>  <br>  Anyways, I know you said you'd pay for it, but also say you'll help pay for the monthly bills. And since this will be your first cell phone, you should start out with a prepaid phone. An env2 is a verizon phone (i have the env2 in black) and your parents will need to sign a contract. And also since it will be your first phone, you really have to be careful. When I first got my phone, I did many things with it that made our monthly bills pretty high. So convince them to have you start out with a prepaid phone and help pay bills. But Im gonna take a guess and say youre 13. And you dont need an env2 now.<br>  But I hope this helps a little =]

w31ZGnHRaa	There is no need for an application.  All you need is a memory card in the BlackBerry, connect it to your computer via the USB cable it came with.  The BlackBerry should ask you if you want to use it as a mass storage device and you should select yes.  Now in Windows Explorer will find a new drive under the My Computer which is the memory card of the BlackBerry.  In this drive, you will see a folder labeled Music and that is where you can just copy and paste you MP3's, AAC's (unprotected), WAV files.  When you finish, just close the window on your PC and unplug your BlackBerry.  Go to the Media icon on the Berry and select the music option in it and all your music you copied will be there.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	No please|`|RXtiPBNjaa	Flickrmusic has been a great place for me to obtain a great deal of music.

AA11644298	I don't think it makes a difference.

But if you keep the reciever on, chances are it will broke just like if you turn on your tv for too long, it will broke or just about anything machine that can be worn out.|`|rrrE1MA9aa	It doesn't matter. What you see is artifacting, and that is caused by the television being on and frozen for a period of time.

HYn3044Caa	When the Mogul is being charged, there is a steady -orange- light showing, not steady red. If it changes to a flashing orange LED, it means that the phone is now using up more battery than it can charge. Turn off things like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and if you're using CPU-intensive programs like WMWifirouter, you'll need to stop that, as well.<br>  <br>  Also, shut down the phone, pull the back cover off and make sure the contacts on the battery are clean, as well as the contacts on the phone. Use a Q-tip and gently wipe them if you see any dirt or grime.<br>  <br>  There is also speculation that this problem arises when your phone gets too hot while it's charging. This can be alleviated by taking off the back cover while it's charging, shutting it down while it's charging, or propping it up and open (hardware keyboard is slid out) to get the most airflow. It also helps not to lay it on a carpet or something similar while charging it.<br>  <br>  If all of these things don't work, it means you need a new battery. Google for them and you should be able to find them without any problem.|`|FrrJj0Y3aa	The HTC MOGUL is the hottest phone out there.

b69Gm5fPaa	Just run two cables from the LNB of the dish directly into the receiver. That's it. Do not use a splitter, it kills the signal. If you have other receivers, then use a multiswith, not a splitter.|`|AA10179458	Get a splitter specifically marked for satellite TV. They all run off of Coax. Make sure you use quad shield Coax.

The service agreement you're on is only because the company is recouping costs for leasing equipment to you at reduced/no cost, any installation included that wasn't charged, etc. <br>  <br>  Once it's done you go on a month-to-month agreement. The only renewal you have is if you get new leased equipment, and the only thing you pay is any applicable upfront leasing fees (plus any fees for the services for the receiver, such as an additional receiver fee, HD or DVR)
xgVe3zQMaa	You cannot change your AIM away messages on a G1 but since the G1 has an open source software, it is possible for developers to create an application to make that possible.<br>  <br>  When I had the phone, it didn't show the away messages but all of my buddies there were available for me to access.  The phone is a good phone if you are an avid internet user, its internet is pretty good.  I liked the phone but the email capabilities suck, which made me go back to my blackberry.  <br>  <br>  It really depends on the different features you would like to have on a phone. If the AIM capabilities are that much important then I would suggest the sidekick.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|L0rnAJKFaa	I have the G1.<br>  I really like it. It can be a little sluggish at times.<br>  But probably from me abusing it so much.<br>  The phone's original AIM is wicked slow.<br>  There's a Market which everything you download on there<br>  is free and there's a good AIM thing you can download on there<br>  which I like a lot better.|`|rSwce38saa	I do have it!<br>  <br>  It is GREAT! You can download/develop nearly ANY type of application. This phone will gradually improve with time.<br>  <br>  As for your IM, you have the option for AIM/MSN/Gtalk/Yahoo, as a built in client. You can download others in the market.<br>  <br>  I prefer to use a custom built AIM client that I think works and looks a TAD bit better. BUT the built in one is very good.<br>  Just remember, if you are going to use AIM, you'll definately wanna get unlimited texts, because using AIM costs Texts. <br>  <br>  Great phone though!

A home folding operation is something that was designed by Stanford University to use the massive computing power of the PS3 to simulate something called "protein folding." This, combined with the power of all the other millions of PS3s (and computers), unlocks dramatic new possibilities for the curing of diseases like Alzheimer's and Cancer.

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Each technology has certain pros and cons.  You have to choose what's right for you.    LCD:  Lighter  Brighter - best for brightly lit rooms or rooms that have lots of natural light  More energy efficient  Poorer viewing angle - picture degrades as you move sideways away from the tv.  More expensive in larger sizes  Doesn't display dark scenes as well  Motion blur can be a problem, but not as bad as earlier generations  No burn in problems  More easily damaged screen    Plasma:  Heavier  Not as bright - less suitable for brightly lit rooms or rooms with lots of natural light.  Less energy efficient and runs hotter  Wide viewing angle  Less expensive in larger sizes  Displays dark scenes better  No motion blur  Subject to burn in, but not as bad as earlier generations  More durable screen    Many don't know it, but LCD screens are more subject to damage.  My kid threw a pacifier at our brand new 52" LCD and knocked out a small group of pixels.  Poke the screens in the store with your finger.  You'll see what I mean.      As for Plasmas, Samsungs and Panasonics are very very good, and pretty reasonable in price.  Both will have enough inputs for what you list.  Others have mentioned Pioneers.  Pioneers are absolutely top of the line, but they also cost significantly more.  Not just a little more, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE, and not in your price range.|`|SMrH4VD4aa	LCD is the way to go. 2 years ago, many stores mostly carried Plasma tv. Now all stores carrie mostly LCD Tvs and a few plasma TVs. The technology on the LCDs have improved alot. The best Brands for LCD tvs are Samsung..  Sony Bravia  & Sharp Aquos...  Go to any store and you will see what i mean...|`|5Wie7d3caa	Pioneer is the best Plasma TV.  You can get a 50" within your price range at Abt Electronics.

Go with something like this one: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    Samsung and LG are ok for Plasma's but better for LCD's(which i don't recommend for 42" or larger)! Panasonic Plasma TV's are the  2 best selling Plasma TV in the world behind Pioneer's Plasma TV's(which are expensive)!    You'll love the picture and overall quality!!!|`|RyvKws7Laa	Pioneer Kuro Elite and Pioneer Kuro are the best Plasma options on the market right now.  Their picture quality is second to none.  But you pay a HUGE premium in cost for them.  So while amazing to look at, I don't know that you get the whole bang-for-the-buck there.    Panasonic Viera Plasma is  2.  The 800 series (look at the model numbers) are the better ones.  You get more inputs and you get better contrast.  And I think you could snag the 50" one in your price range on sale (I think regular, it might cross that threshold).  But, the 85u (Future Shop is the only CDN retailer that carries it) is a really strong option too.  It has 800 level contrast, but I think just one less HDMI input (but it still has 3, just not 4).  And I'm pretty sure you could do that in your price range.  Finally the 80 series is there too and often on sale.  Again, an amazing picture and you could still knock off a few more dollars.    Lastly I would do Samsung.  I don't know the model numbers for Samsung, but their Plasmas do rate very good in reviews and tests.  You wouldn't go wrong with a Samsung Plasma.    You should also check out London Drugs.  I got mine on sale from them and it was the best price in town for the model I got.  But obviously you might need to wait out a month (as they cycle through the sales).

I'm guessing that it is just the regular NES version of the game.|`|ncCWnApDaa	The first 3 and Lost Levels are all NES versions, Allstars is not available on VC, probably because they can make more money selling them separately, the only SNES Mario games are those designed specifically for the SNES like Super Mario World.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	nes has 3|`|AA11045021	If I remember correctly, Virtual Console has both.|`|edIUAbCxaa	it would be on the NES version
