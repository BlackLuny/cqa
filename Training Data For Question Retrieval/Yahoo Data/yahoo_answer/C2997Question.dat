I would like to hear from those that are currently using soy based inks in their printers. especially lexmark. I have just about decided to give up my trusty lexmark. It's great but the price of the cartridges astronomical .We are getting ready to publish a chapbook of my husband's poetry. We want to put it on recycled paper and use an environmentally friendly ink.    Any drawbacks?   Quality?   Photo quality?   What websites are best?      Any help would be appreciated.

20090131155008AAIhAr0	Environment;Green Living	As far as Wind Turbines go...?	Does anyone know about how many rotations it would take to make any given amount of energy.. heck.. even an equation would do me good, as I'm trying to make a stationary bike, and want to know how hard I have to pedal.      I'm thinking about just straight up buying one of the really cheap 200 watt wind turbines to attach to the bike to make some output (as they already come with regulators..) but, I really wanted to know if anyone had tried that, or if anyone has one.. or if anyone could find that somewhere on the interwebs.. i've been looking.. but not finding, and I feel like I just haven't been looking hard enough..      THX =D

20090131162434AAvjhOq	Environment;Global Warming	Scientists announced recently that the global sea ice levels were exactly the same as they were in 1979...?	...when they began keeping Satellite image records of such data.  The amount has fluctuated up and down since then, but it has now climbed up to the same amount as it was in 1979.      What does this say about the so-called "global warming" crisis?      I've always suspected that it was just a bunch of BS to warrant more government control over people, and had nothing to do with real science.      Your thoughts...?       http://www.dailytech.com/Sea+Ice+Ends+Ye...
