kqNlq4MGaa	sounds like the "professional" did not do the job right,  i'd take a close look at the owners-manual and check the wiring. usually a car-stereo has these wires: 1- red for positive power 1- black for negative/ground 1- for clock/memory 1- antenna,  8 wires for speakers (front, back, left, right),  if any of these are not hooked-up properly then you have probs, i'm thinking your professional guy hooked up the antenna wire of your radio with your car remote unit.|`|5JI64hBnaa	If you paid the shop to put it in, take it back to them and tell them to fix it.

e937e557dfb15b0a24dda39df4305abaaa	could be a number of things but if I were to take a blind stab in the dark Id say have the fuel pressure checked. That sounds like a failing fuel pump. Other than that... it could also be your TPS *throttle position sensor* it adjusts the fuel signal and the computer can tell how much gas to give each cylinder.. if the tps is bad that signal isnt being sent.. you might think but it works when I barely give it any gas... A TPS can have "dead spots" where certain ranges in the pedal get no signal and a default signal is then used but since the computer doesnt know whats happening, you get your "sluggish" response. <br>  Like I said tho.. I would get the fuel pressure checked first<br>  Hope this helps and good luck with it|`|cl2ci9A4aa	your problem will most likley lie in the fuel pipes./diesel filter...change di filter and give it a go..also some pipe onions to the filter have gause wire in the unions that can also be blocked.....hope this helps..

You can find complete ratings for all kinds of cars, both new and used, on websites like Edmunds.com.<br>  <br>  If you do find a used car that you are really interested in, I would recommend getting a carfax report on it.

3MTYGEbWaa	Actually leasing is a pretty good solution to getting out of an upside down loan situation -- but ONLY if you stick out the lease until the end, at which time you simply return the car and you are done with the upside down loan.<br>  <br>  Since you are asking about trading a car with an upside down loan, you are demonstrating that you don't stick with a vehicle very long, which will backfire on you if you lease with a rolled-in negative equity. You MUST stick out the entire lease if you want it to work. It is also necessary that you understand leasing and when to lease, and when not to. It's too easy to make mistakes. Here's a web site that might help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaseguide.com/index2.htm</a><br>  <br>  . |`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Leasing is for when you are very experienced and are sure that you will never get into an accident and damage THEIR vehicle because you are not the owner.  And promise that you won't go over 12,000 miles a year or your wallet will be emptied. And don't let it get dirty or dings or you will pay.<br>  If you can do that, lease is great and the payments are low..|`|Ocyz6pbQaa	The ONLY way I suggest to get out of a car when you are upside down is to lease.  If you roll your negative equity into a purchase rather than a lease, you are still upside down and you have to keep that car for the full term of the loan.  In a lease, the negative equity is rolled in, just as in a purchase, BUT you pay for all the negative in the 3 years (don't lease for more than 3 years) and you can start over.  <br>  <br>  When the lease is over, you can purchase that car for the residual, which you will know the day you sign the papers.  OR you can just turn the car in and lease another one.  Or, in rare occasions, the car is actually worth more than the residual.  In that case, you can sell the car and pocket the profit.  In this rare instance, for example, if you have a 3 year, 36000 mile lease and the car at the end has only 20,000 miles, you may have EQUITY, the exact opposite of what you have in your current car.<br>  <br>  There aren't any negative aspects of a lease in your case.  Go and lease yourself a Toyota or Honda (the only cars these days that lease well), roll in the negative equity, drive the car for 3 years and start fresh at the end.  THEN you can decide what to do after that (buy the car, turn it in, or even sell it).<br>  <br>  If you live near Nothern Indiana, I can help you with this :-)<br>  <br>  From your friendly Toyota Salesperson :)|`|Bp7t3L15aa	It's obvious that mccoyblu doesn't have a clue about leasing. However Rob R has given a rather good case about the benefits of leasing. To expound on it just a little more though....If someone wants to be in a newer car car under factory warranty, leasing is the way to go. You have many more options available to you. Examples: shorter term agreement, no negative equity at the end, buy it, sell it, trade it, or just turn it in.<br>  <br>  Also just a side note, I hate it when people say they get penalized for the extra miles. There is no such thing, you're just paying for what you use. For example, if you "own" a car and it has 20,000 extra miles on it, don't you think it'll be worth less, of course it will.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|TbiSBXclaa	Ther is only one pro to leasing. You get to drive around in a car that you can't afford to own.<br>  <br>  Everything else associated with a lease is negative.

3MTYGEbWaa	Dealers make more profit on used cars than on new cars. It depends on the dealer's commission structure, but there is greater commission potential on used cars due to the higher profit.<br>  <br>  With the bad economy right now, new car sales are down as much as 50%-65% for some makes and models. Many people are shifting over to used cars as a way to be able to afford a car. The volume of used cars being sold is higher that this time last year.|`|isXRGupDaa	You'll tend to make more money in used cars because most of the customers that are serious about buying will come in and ask "What can I get for x$?"  The new car customers are generally better at negotiating your paycheck away.  Plus there're generally more looky-loos in the Shiny New Bling section, especially the sporty/popular/luxury categories.  <br>  <br>  Other things to beware of:  Some dealers expect the salespeople to totally live FOR the dealership.  That means they don't care if you have no life of your own.  <br>  Most dealerships will be very easy to get hired at (can you fog up a mirror?) and figure the real interview is if you can hack it by selling your quota.  <br>  Many dealerships don't let you work the internet sales angle until you're a Senior Salesman.  <br>  Car dealerships generally $pend Big Buck$ on advertising, so need to make sure they turn a profit.  Most people don't understand what it costs to sell a product (Imagine the overhead on a department store, for example.  How much is your electric bill?  Now figure for 20000 square feet with lights, AC, etc.) so the dealership will have a quota no matter what they say.  If it comes to the dealer principle (owner who has the contract with the manufacturer and holds the business license) to laying off staff or going out of business, guess which way the wind will blow.  <br>  <br>  All this implies a commission pay structure.  If you don't have personal financial discipline, this is not the gig for you.  Having consistently inconsistent paychecks means being able to build up a reserve (ohshit) fund for WHEN the paycheck is zero.  This also means going about having to plan your spending farther in advance.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't want to just point out the less glamorous bad points.  There are plenty of good points to a sales career if you find that you can hack it.  Once you've built up your clientele you will usually have all the schedule flexibility you want.  This will take quite some time;  Berkshire-Hathaway wasn't built overnight either.  You will learn to become a master negotiator, which is a skill you'll find useful in all of life.  You will learn personal finance and gain knowledge of how a business is run.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, and maybe most importantly:  If you wouldn't spend your own money on it, don't even consider trying to sell it to others.  What's inside you will tend to come out.  <br>  <br>  I'd recommend reading some of Joe Girard's books and talking to friends, acquaintances and relatives you may know in this field.  <br>  <br>  (May you make your own) Good Luck1|`|xCde3mh6aa	i actually sell cars and the worst place to make money is through internet sales. the cars online are usually at the lowest possible price in order to lure customers in. new cars you can make some off of, some dealerships have spiffs or bonuses you can get off selling cars that have been on the lot for a while. i personally get $100 from the KIA company for every new car i sell. it kinda depends but most profit is def. within used!!|`|DoUb5uV1aa	I would say used cars because people who are desperate for a car quickly for a short period of time will want no fuss and will make a buy, this works if you're paid on commision

WO68RZdIaa	UCANTCME- I hope you have that statement saved so all you need to do is copy & paste it as your answer and not type everything word-for-word over and over every time this question is raised. <br>  Yes, this question is getting old and has been answered hundreds of time. (Just use the Y!A search box right above this question!)<br>  Like UCANTCME stated, with the design of modern school busses comes with them a built in safety feature with the high seat backs and close positioning of the seats.<br>  Cost is one big factor for school districts. Another large factor is if the belts are installed for the average size student to be able to belt up 2-3 students per seat, how are you supposed to belt up little Timmy who weighs 85 lbs and then little Billy who weighs 250 lbs on the same seat? The placement of the belts cannot be moved, so in an attempt to belt little Billy in, you may in fact create a more dangerous safety environment for him in the event of an accident due to  critical injuries sustained from the device that was supposed to protect him.<br>  I have during my life worked as an EMT, Law Enforcement and as a School Bus Driver. So I've seen a lot of accidents, some involving school and commercial busses. If the students remain in their seats correctly, life threatening injuries will be reduced to any student riding in a modern US school bus.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Compartmentalization, a concept seen frequently on commercial airplanes, involves seating passengers in rows of padded seats with cushioned backs. <br>  <br>  The belief is that during frontal or rear impact, the most common types of wrecks involving school buses, passengers would either be pushed back into their seats or thrown forward into the padded backs of the row ahead. <br>  <br>  The use of seat belts might require stiffer seats, which would negate the theory of compartmentalization. It is also feared that some students would receive internal injuries from seat belts through a process called submarining, the tendency for a body to slide downwards during impact.<br>  <br>  Seat belts on school buses may also hamper rescue or evacuation efforts, as adults or older students may have to spend precious minutes unbuckling young or disoriented passengers. <br>  <br>  Unruly students could also use the heavy buckles as makeshift weapons, creating even more of a safety hazard. There is also the argument that seat belts would only protect passengers of school buses during unusual events such as roll-overs or flips, not other possible accidents such as fires or submersion. <br>  <br>  Considering the expense of retrofitting current school buses or replacing entire fleets with approved seat belt systems, the benefits of seat belt use do not currently outweigh the liabilities.<br>  <br>  One problem many school systems face with the prospect of mandatory seat belt use on school buses is compliance. <br>  <br>  The bus driver already has a significant amount of responsibility, so schools would have to hire additional monitors to ride on all the school buses. <br>  <br>  In light of sexual misconduct concerns, both male and female monitors would have to be hired in order to avoid any allegations of impropriety.<br>  <br>   Besides the added expense of hiring qualified monitors, there would also be a question of liability if even one student removed his or her seat belt and became injured as a result.<br>  <br>  |`|tRx0wDzgaa	 I drive a brand new 2008 Thomas C-2 Saf-t-Liner school bus in Saskatchewan, Canada. I have a lovely three point safety harness.<br>  <br>   The little 'monkeys' in the back have none. There are seat belt attachments but there are no belts installed. The Government safety gurus have determined that our most precious commodity do not require them. Among my other responsibilities it is my job to assure that they remain seated while the bus is in motion while attempting to do all the other tasks required to keep from hitting another vehicle or getting hit. Yeah; right!<br>  <br>   Regardless of what the bean counters claim, if this bus gets in a severe accident there are going to be dead kids scattered all over the highway because they were too cheap to legislate seat belts into school buses. And guess who gets to take the blame for that?|`|z6ffxxTlaa	when i was in school they never had seat belts and i disagree with this because it is teaching kids not to wear seat belts and plus if the bus wrecks there is nothing from stopping kids flying out of there seats.|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	aaaahhhhh yes the old seat belt question on school buses again and again and again and again. sigh|`|JKQhSGEEaa	ok you could put them on the buss you know how many kids would wear them next to none and how would on guy keep track to make sure all the kids are wearing seat belts|`|kxEl2TvRaa	See my answers to this same question here-<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArSLArNgWEMjUlROvvVc9hXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081024134424AAg7sJx&show=7#profile-info-iFuO8gy7aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgcRPlKfCvMbo1KaJJ_765bty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081016155436AAdYZFS&show=7#profile-info-CmgZpSVhaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  - David|`|c11a4863e0a3bf7b69d4fa0827eb37beaa	In Alberta, answer is no on Public.

pZvJpuJTaa	You've lost the money for back months only due to the fact the carrier had no clue you didn't have a vehicle.  In essence, you had insurance the entire time.<br>  <br>  When you put your new vehicle on, you'll have to advise them to remove the old one.|`|6EVNhcNLaa	You can delete the vehicle you no longer have & add the one you have now.

Your money is long gone I would think, sorry. Why not put the money in a savings account instead of paying non existent insurance!|`|tLilNlptaa	I have purchased several cars and can tell you from my stand point is that when you pay 100 per month for issurance on car A, then you buy car B and it's premium is 80 per month, they credit you for the 20 dollars over payment at a prorated basis. For example lets say that you paid the insurance for  car A then a week later you traded the car in for car B, they will prorate you 20 dollar over payment for the remaining 3 weeks of the month, so you would get a credit of about 15 dollars. But in your case, I would talk to the insurance company because you shouldn't be paying for insurance on a car that does not exist any longer, they are just ripping you off, because you just paid insurance for nothing.|`|dyIyJqauaa	No.  You should have canceled that policy when you crashed your car.  You would have received a pro-rated refund.  It is too late now.  I don't understand and have never heard of being required to "pay several hundred dollars upfront".  If I were you, I would ask why you were not treated as most others and have been required to pay only the monthly (or semi-annual or annual) premium .  Better yet, find a different insurance company.

cAGv5evLaa	If you're at a light, you'll get revved - that's the way they all do it.<br>  If you're on the freeway, they will pull up beside you and do some kind of swaying back and forth or speeding up and slowing down to get your attention|`|7h9UOsrgaa	Dono sry.
cAGv5evLaa	If you don't want to use water, or if water isn't strong enough to get the dirt off, go to OReillys and get some Engine Degreaser - it's a spray can of stuff that dissolves dirt, very cheap. Just be careful not to spray any water into the air intake or up into the distributor from underneath|`|2t0LorBXaa	washing a engine bay with water shouldn't do a thing<br>  <br>  only thing you might worry about is the distributer|`|jieKgKF1aa	buy cans of degreaser in a pressure pack only about 2 dollars a can spray over everything and hose off. afterwards engine might run a bit rough to water drys out but it wont hurt anything.|`|SY9hPeROaa	i use ez off  and water at the car wash

Gn0kJXHpaa	Do everything Marvin A says then drive slower (like a little old lady) lol .You might want to get a vacuum gage installed & practice driving keeping the needle on the highest number possible. The higher the # the better the mpg - the lower the # the more power.|`|d9d1d65f22347b79022f9485df072ffeaa	It may be something as simple as changing your spark plugs if you haven't done that in a while. The next most obvious culprit would be the O2 sensors which tell the computer to optimize the fuel mix according to what they detect along with throttle position and RPM. These 3 components are part of the fuel mix equation. Otherwise the car has many other sensors that tell the computer to respond accordingly depending on what the sensors are detecting. Int that case you'd need to have a computer diagnostic run on the car by your favorite mechanic or buy your own diagnostic tool.|`|JG9rdV2Uaa	 take it out on the highway and run all the carbon out of it.<br>   Change the air filter if it is dirty. <br>  Clean the EGR valve ( check the web for how to clean one)|`|4MtR8MLpaa	It may not help but try running a couple of cans of Berryman's injector cleaner in a couple of tanks of gas. Also by now the oxygen sensor should be replaced. They are less than $100 installed|`|TREuo6hKaa	could try goin about 3-7 psi over on your tires, that should help a bit but it could have adverse effects in bad weather|`|pMz6nKPIaa	Most cars with a 2.0L 4 cyl. that have an automatic transmission do not get as good of fuel mileage than the same car with a 5-speed manual transmission. The size of your car has a lot to do with the mileage as well. The age and mileage of your car also have some influence on fuel economy. Of course checking your air filter, and keeping it clean will help fuel economy somewhat, but there isn't much more you can do for your older car. |`|GIjuCLKhaa	Besides the other advice given, check the cylinder compression of all 4 cylinders and see if it is near spec. After 138,000 miles your piston rings might be worn enough to significantly reduce compression and thereby efficiency / fuel consumption.
tKWwZpOAaa	The current RS6 got the V10, so Im going to say thats fastest stock, however the new RS4 with be turbo charged, so if you put the money saved in buying an RS4 instead of an RS6 into some big turbos your going to have one hell of a fast car.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	The fastest right now is Audi R8 V10.<br>  <br>  The fastest one under 80k should be Audi S8.

I wonder how fast the next RS4 would be, should be killer, and perhaps equaling or beating the S6 time.|`|nEXvzhw9aa	Not sure but I love them.|`|xgXzTWa5aa	s class
TEmR2Oc2aa	  It depends on the year of the vehicle. An oil leak would not give you false readings on your fuel gauge. My father owns an 86 Nissan Pathfinder that will read like it has low fuel levels when it is first started, even if the tank is full. Sometimes the gauge is just old and needs to sit for a few seconds to give the proper reading. The same thing happens in my 1974 Chevy Blazer and I have noticed a trend for this in other older vehicles; especially in cold weather.|`|REdcuFwOaa	Your fuel sending unit in your gas tank may be faulty.  Kind of rare b/c your car ain't that old??
dVQdswtTaa	Diesel pickups get better mileage than gasoline powered ones. <br>  <br>  They are a more expensive option than gasoline engines, but they make up for it with longer life, higher mileage and greater torque. <br>  <br>  A diesel will handle a little different than you're used to with a gasoline engine. They are higher torque and lower revving, so the transmissions are geared a little different. <br>  <br>  They are more sensitive to contaminants in the fuel, so they have a larger filter system, but that is covered in your routine services.<br>  <br>  You should take one for a test drive, and see if you like it. Personally, I prefer them.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	When it comes to pulling power you will get better mileage with diesel engines over gas engines and depending on how you drive without pulling anything you should get a little beter mileage. But let me warn you if you live in California you will pay more for diesel at the pump.
c11a4863e0a3bf7b69d4fa0827eb37beaa	Driver side of the engine...if it is a four. No cap, just two coils. A change of the plugs and new wires does wonders for the four.

4biGrjPkaa	Assuming you got the fiat to start (a miracle in its own right) it would be marginally quicker up to about the 3rd gear change (if it hadn't broken down by then), at which point the jag would eat the uno and spit out its remains. <br>  <br>  Didn't think I'd see the day a fiat and a jag would be compared in any way in the same question . . . .|`|APtZhqAGaa	Which one would you want to be in if you were speaking about a head-on?<br>  <br>  Which one would require serious servicing first.|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	I have had 2 fiat uno turbo's great cars, fun to drive and quick.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Yeah, another vote for the 230. It is all the power you need for normal trail riding. If this is something you really get serious about you can look at buying a 250 a couple years down the road.|`|4AbXxowTaa	I would say any one of the 250's.  You don't need a high powered dirt bike for most trails, and until you have some more experience you really shouldn't be using any more power than what a 250 would give you.|`|XJSWRHdiaa	The crf 230f would be the perfect size for you. Its very reliable, durable, and low maintanence. Perfect bike for the trails especially for a begginer. The next step up would be a crf 250x and below the crf230f would be the crf150f.<br>  I am 5'10 and iv been riding the crf230 for 2 years now. Im at the point where i want more power. If you have been riding for a few years then go with the crf 250x because the crf230 is a begginers/amatuer bike and it doesnt have insane power. But when on the trails i never need insane power so the 230 is awesome on the trails and for the slow tricky stuff.<br>  Good luck!|`|30jQQ9Rgaa	I would go with the TTR-230, the CRF230F.  Those two are by far the best trail bikes.  And unlike race bikes, they come with a 6 month warranty if you buy a new one.|`|xmldMIWOaa	CCM 230 is the same bike as the CRF230 but a cheaper alternative.<br>  Yamaha TTR225 is a good trail bike as well.
fIQeWMWOaa	More than what the car is worth.|`|UIH51T2jaa	depends if you want stainless steel or do you want a welded system and it also depends on what kind of mufflers you use.I did my Dual Exhaust for about $125.00 Ive aslo seen custome exhaust go for about $400-500.00 so you got lots of choices |`|qzyyOEYAaa	depends on what kind of muffle, what size exaust, X pipe or H pipe.

A6DSrxHWaa	Let me start out by saying I'm not the smartest person when it comes to auto repair. Last month I had an accident with my Chevrolet Equinox and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the web for help, but the procedures were too difficult for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations (car insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me. Maybe you can try calling auto repair shops in Indiana to see if they can help you. <a href="http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Indiana-Auto-Repair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autorepairshoplocator.com/Ind...</a>|`|IC4C8khVaa	We may be able to help.    www.usaturntable.com   Got it?

Everything you buy at a store costs more b/c of the high price of delivery. The makers of everything have no choice but to pass along the cost of fuel to what we buy. |`|6xyeYjkkaa	The government drove the price up by requiring the diesel to have ultra low sulfur content. Costs more to refine it. Prior to that the government also vastly increased the road tax on diesel. Diesel in Mexico is still below $2 a gallon.
AA10255017	If you are sure it is coming from the distributor, pop the cap off and look for wear on the plug contacts from the rotor. That would indicate a worn shaft bushing and the shaft is wobbling inside under the cap. Also check the magnetic pick-up for wear. Something should be obvious|`|94YQjKIHaa	well start off with checking the plug wires an easy way to check them is at night raise the hood and start the motor then look and see if the wires are sparking where you can see it if so  problem found if their not  remove distributer cap then the rotor bug if the cap or bug is discolored usually black another problem if not put the bug back in place  and try and turn the bug back and forth there should be very little slack here usually quarter of an inch  if there is more then your distributer gear or cam gear has a lot of wear on them the distributer gear is easily replaced with a small round punch and a hammer just tap out the roll pin remove the gear and slide new one on and reinstall the pin 
BWeYt33Jaa	It will be expensive until you turn 25, then it will come down some. Depending on the type of vehicle you are insuring, your rates can vary widely. Things taken into consideration when getting insurance include, credit check, make/model/yr of car, if you live in a high crime area, is your model car often broken into, does the description of the car include the words turbo, sport, coupe. If you don't change anything on the policy except for the name, I would guess your rate will be 2 1/2 times what your mom pays now.<br>  <br>  Also, a good place to check is...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.knowledged.info/go.php?link=insurance" rel="nofollow">http://www.knowledged.info/go.php?link=i...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|w6rWVArcaa	For car insurance the quick way to get a good quote is do a rate comparison on auto policies. Make sure that you pick similar policies with the same limits, car make, zip code, etc so that all things are an accurate comparison.<br>  <br>  What I always recommend is an online comparison quote at <a href="http://www.lowratetoday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lowratetoday.com</a> since they have big name insurers and can give multiple prices on auto insurance polices.|`|tLilNlptaa	It depends on your age, vehicle, driving history, and policy limits. I know where I am at for someone 17 with a typical insurance policy on a honda civic(an example) with clean driving record and has own policy would run about 250-300 dollars a month.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	It depends on where you live and the type of car you drive but a guess estimate would be about 3 times what your paying now.

You should just call up there and ask them.
rBcC0ricaa	Have you removed the tailgate cover to have a look, Is the solenoid stuck in the open position?<br>  if the solenoid moves when the button is pressed then the fault is down to the rear lock mechanism costs approx ￡30.00.<br>  You will also need 2 new bolts as the head will break if you try to refit the old ones.

0u4l0bTEaa	Yes, car dealers will charge for damages on a leased vehicle.  But, have her check her lease agreement and find out what exactly the policy is.<br>  <br>  She will want to get estimates of her own and try to get as many of them fixed as possible.  Since dealers are, historically, more expensive, she may find someone who will do it cheaper.<br>  <br>  Start with the front end, that sounds like the worst of it.  May also want to check on another bumper if it's really damaged, check with a junkyard to if they have one you could replace it with.  Don't worry about the other stuff, that could be considered normal wear and tear, which is usually forgiven with a lease, especially on a SUV or a truck.|`|AA12230046	Lease is a fancy word for rent.  Your aunt has basically rented a car, and when her "lease" is up she will have to return it in the same condition that she got it in.  If she doesn't want to claim any of the damages on her insurance then she should go to different body shops and get estimates, and pay for the cheapest repair.  The dealer will charge her to make it into a brand new car.

csmEH6qsaa	The best way to learn about fishing is to just go. Go to a sporting goods store and tell them you want to go fishing and need to purchase some basics.  Set a limit on the amount you wish to spend and stick to it.  You could get all you need to get started for a few dollars or a lot of dollars - depends on what you want to spend.  Then go to the lake, the marina, anywhere there is water - ask the store clerk where you should go.  <br>  <br>  Now for sailing - you can volunteer to crew for races, events, and so on.  <a href="http://www.sfsailing.com/cgi-bin/CrewList/crew_main.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfsailing.com/cgi-bin/CrewLis...</a><br>  is a only one of many I found by just typing in sailing crew in a search engine.  You may want to do some reading on the subject and study the subject before making a leap into the sailing world.

AA10259181	If you cannot spray paint outdoors you must live in California.  The best paint to use is OIL-BASE.  You must first sand down lightly with a 180-200 grit sandpaper, clean off residue, then use a good primer(don't skimp on the primer), after good & dry then lightly sand down with 240grit only to remove any high spots.  Wipe off residue very well, any residue left will appear on your finish.  Spray your finish coat, always spray several light coats rather than one heavy-coat.  Always strain your paint, & thin properly with recommended thinner.  You can roll it on using a fine-nap roller if you choose not to spray...

OQQRMdJWaa	Ce qui est certain, c'est que la culture moto en France est en train de changer.<br>  <br>  Certes, il reste encore une majorité de motards "traditionnels" avec une culture de la frime et de la vitesse proche de celle des pays latins, qui considèrent la moto comme le moyen de s'affranchir des pesanteurs de la circulation en voiture, notamment sur la vitesse.<br>  Il reste à mettre en place, progressivement, par la formation et l'incitation, une vraie culture de la sécurité à moto, comme dans les pays d'Europe du Nord.<br>  <br>  Cela vient, tout doucement, notamment par la mutation du public motard. Le noyau principal d'hommes entre 20 et 30 ans est peu à peu débordé sur tous les fronts. Il y a de plus en plus de motards très jeunes (14-20 ans), de vieux motards (plus de 40 ans, voire 50), de femmes (on est passé de 10 à 20% de motardes) et d'urbains actifs, qui voient le deux-roues (moto ou scooter) comme un moyen de transport utilitaire, et non comme un objet de passion et de loisirs.<br>  <br>  Il y a des avantages et des inconvénients à cette mutation, tout dépend du point de vue. Ce qui est certain, c'est que de plus en plus d'utilisateurs de deux-roues motorisés (motards ou non) demandent à pouvoir se déplacer en sécurité.<br>  D'où la présence croissante des dispositifs d'assistance au freinage, le succès du scooter trois-roues, etc.<br>  <br>  Et les motards ne sont pas plus stupides ou indisciplinés que le reste de la population. Même si la mortalité moyenne reste plus élevée (à proportion égale) que pour les automobilistes, elle a baissé en 2006 par rapport à 2005, et même plus baissé que pour toutes les autres catégories d'usagers <br>  <br>  La culture d'insécurité qui subsiste provient avant tout d'une méconnaissance, d'une ignorance totale des règles de conduite en sécurité, de protection, de cohabitation avec les autres usagers de la route.<br>  Le jour où sera mise en place une formation efficace tournée vers le "bien conduire en partageant la route" et non plus "réussir un examen", on aura fait un grand pas...<br>  <br>  La sécurité à moto, elle vient avant tout de toi-même.<br>  Un motard vivant et en bonne santé le restera en faisant attention à sa conduite et à celle des autres, sans attendre que eux fassent attention à lui.<br>  <br>  C'est à nous de partager la route et de remercier ceux qui la partagent avec nous dans la courtoisie et le respect mutuel.<br>  L'agressivité, que ce soit celle des motards contre les caisseux imbéciles (souvent par ignorance plus que par réelle mauvaise volonté) ou celle des automobilistes contre le méchant biker violent et borné, ne sert à rien.|`|500ad3789703591af52a697c9a3b43b0aa	leur sécurité s'améliorera quand ils auront conscience qu'il est nécessaire qu'ils respectent scrupuleusement le code de la route et qu'ils sont plus vulnérables que les automobilistes <br>  <br>  la plupart des accidents seraient évités s'ils roulaient à une allure raisonnable et s'ils arrêtaient de se croire sur les 24 heures du Mans ...|`|xSrq0oRBaa	Je respecte les motards, mais c'est souvent d'eux meme que vient le danger. <br>  Doubler entre les voies, sur la bande d'arret d'urgence.... quand toi automobiliste t'es deja a 130.....C'est sur qu'une fois y'a une voiture qui se rabat et paf.<br>  Et quand tu laisses pas assez de place certain te filent des coups dans la voiture avec leurs bottes....<br>  <br>  Bref tu peux passer le permis tranquille, si t'as une conduite responsable, je pense qu'il y a peu de risques.|`|zD2Xq2Bxaa	Petite vitesse et grande lenteur, j'ai envie de répondre.

The parts aren't meant to last that long so that's why your having problems.  Fixing might be good or bad, because with that much mileage many other things might be about to break.  First of all the overdrive automatically turning on is not bad.  You should always have overdrive on for better gas mileage when you are at high rpms.  It will only make a difference on high rpms so it turns on at 3k rpm.<br>  Also the slant could be your shock absorbers.  Look at the suspension on your other wheels and try to find any differences like displacement, height, or where its at.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	1.  The trans has a DTC in it.

Captain, First Mate (would probably also be required to have skills as the engineer), Steward.<br>  <br>  If the owner is cruising extensively, there will probably be a Captain, Engineer, 2 Stewards, and a Chef.  Some of these positions such as stewards will help in the galley at mealtimes, and the engineer will be sometimes needed to help clean cabins.  Flexibility is key on a smaller vessel.<br>  <br>  The larger the boat, the more specialized the different positions become....A 100ft boat is pretty small when you are talking about crewed yachts.

x4zIhnneaa	Heresmy perspective on it.  Im a Long Haul Truck Driver  with about 12 years experience.  More and more over the years, I've seen more trucking comp. jumping on the "bandwagon" in letting some,not all of their trailers ride the rails.  Face it, a train is SOOOOOOOO much more efficient about moving freight than a truck--its not even funny.  The ONLY advantage I see is that a train obviously cant deliver to your loca stores---like a truck can.  Ive seen the Long Haul (coast to coast) trucking dwindle down to nothing.  Those days are over.  <br>  <br>  I predict that if Amtrack and all the other train subsidiarys can possibly start working together--they WILL be the freight moving powerhouse that they SHOULD have been all along.<br>  <br>  This economy hasn't hit bottom -yet.  when it does---expect trains, both freight AND passenger service to experience a QUICK and a Strong recovery.
dUN468v3aa	I sense that you're primarily interested in the situation in the US, so I'm afraid that I can't help. However, here in the UK driver-only operation (DOO) has been common for many years. Admittedly this is primarily for commuter lines rather than longer-distance passenger services, but it is still often the case that the driver (engineer) is the only member of staff on quite a large number of trains. However, even where there is a guard (conductor...?) on the train, the driver will still be alone in the front of the train.<br>  <br>  I know that the introduction of DOO was an emotive issue when it was first mooted, but it hasn't proved to be the huge problem that many predicted. Drivers (engineers) are professionals and take pride in their work. They are conscientious and guard against mistakes as best as they can because they know that their livelihoods depend on it.<br>  <br>  Now I appreciate that working conditions could be very different in the US. We have very strict controls over the number of hours you can work on a single turn, rest periods and the number of days without a day off. Our routes are probably shorter too and we have to learn them before being allowed to drive them and sign to say that we are familiar with the route including the locations of stations, gradients, low adhesion areas, the type and method of signalling, all the possible shunt moves and any local instructions. If any of these things are different in the US, I can entirely appreciate that it will make the job much more taxing and why this requires an additional person in the cab with the engineer.|`|WsKUEgQraa	We have all two man crews on the UPRR.I work out of Texas.I hope they never go to a one man crew.I think when they get positive train control it will be much tougher for the unions to fight off one man crews though.I'm glad i'm nearing the end of my railroad career as there have been too many changes(not all for the good).It used to be a fun job once upon a time.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	When you think about it it is a lot safer with 2 or more, do to what if a health issue comes up with one, or falls asleep, or text-ing like the one bone head that when head on with another train and killed what 26 people. If there were two on board don`t you think one would have seen the warning lights to let them know that danger lies ahead? It`s not like you have to drive a train and steer it but you do have to pay attention to whats going on around you. There is a lot of steel behind them, and sometimes people. It`s not like a cost issue, how much money is being made by hauling that much product/people across the country? (lot`s) How much does the engineer make? (not much in comparison)<br>  This is just my thoughts on the subject.<br>  How many do you feel/want conducting the train?<br>  Just one,,,,, that is Text-ing?

nAzbLdBCaa	There are many factors that go into fuel consumption. In my experience I'd load the boat with all the stuff we'd take to the lake and go skiing.  That meant 3 / 6gal. tanks of fuel or 18 gal.      We almost always had 3 gals left when we got home. <br>       For a more technical answer:  the most fuel efficient range for a Merc 115  (80') is 38-4200 rpm and   max 52-5400  with a 17 ' runabout with 2 passengers and about 12 gal. of fuel.      Just out boating in the 10 to 12 GPH range,  but pulling a skier more like 14-16  If you are at max fuel consumption of 21 GPH that would be pulling a tube.|`|946109a893be7ef89b872c04100dd058aa	I used to run some boston whalers with merc 115s on them. They averaged 6-10 gph. We ran them in the 3800-4200rpm range. You should expect to burn slightly higher tubing etc because of the stops and starts.|`|Y6f7HMqSaa	Always shoot high on your fuel burn rate.  I'd say 12 to 14 GPH is a reasonable estimate for what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Remember, that is 12-14 GPH at optimal RPM range.  That number is basically saying if you ran it at optimal for 1 straight hour, it would burn roughly 14 gallons.<br>  <br>  However, you will have many periods of slowing, idling, shutting it off, etc. that will reduce your consumption rate somewhat.<br>  <br>  When I do watersports with my 140 Mercruiser bowrider I/O, I average about 5 gallons consumed per hour on a regular watersports boating day.  Yes, I get excellent fuel economy on it.<br>  <br>  That hour usually involves an average of 3 to 6 minutes staying on top the water, doing the tricks and wipeing out, added with about 2 minutes of idle manuvering and positioning to start per run.  Then add about 10 minutes to that hour of shutting the engine off to switch out or fix towing equipment.<br>  <br>  I regularly break up the watersports every 2 hours with a 20 to 30 minute break so the victims, I mean riders can rest from getting thrown everywhere into the drink.  That extends the day and keeps from the towed riders from getting too tired too quickly.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents about tubes...  From my many years of being on the water, I personally deplore and loathe tubes.  They're buggers to keep the inflated tube in good condition, far too bulky, and do nothing but drag down the boat's performance.<br>  <br>  <br>  All boats drink down gas fast, but 2 Stroke Outboards outright gorge on it.  So be prepared to shovel lots of money into the pump when you pull up to the gas station.
nAzbLdBCaa	If you think of what most people call winterization, the Instruction Manual actually calls it a "Storage Procedure".  If your not going to use the boat for 3 months or more, you need to fog the engine, and do annual maintenance in the engine.   Due to the recent changes to fuels they don't store as well as they did just a couple year ago.   You need to keep your fuel fresh, and don't store it for over 30 days.   That includes fuel in the carb. With some of today's engines, like DFI and VOR etc. you might need to check the instructions on how best to store the engine.|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	Talk to some other long time boat owners in your area and ask them what they do.  Winterizing the boat is no big deal and covers a lot of annual maintenance that should be done anyway. You have a nice place to work on your boat so it won't be a lot of trouble for you.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	If you store your boat for the off season, then yes you need to winterize it.<br>  <br>  Aside from protecting your engine, winterization is also preventative maintenance. The gear oil gets changed, grease fittings are greased, fuel is stabilized, etc etc.<br>  <br>  At my dealership, we offer to replace the water pump, thermostats, poppet valves, install new spark plugs, rebuild the mechanical fuel pumps, and change filters on top of the basic winterization.<br>  <br>  When you let an outboard sit for any long period of time, you are taking a risk by not doing any kind of basic winterization first.|`|Y6f7HMqSaa	Here are some questions, if you answer yes to any of them, then you need to winterize your boat.<br>  <br>  Has the temperature ever dropped below freezing in the last 20 years where you live?<br>  <br>  Does your boat have an inboard engine?<br>  <br>  Will the boat sit unused for 4 to 6 months or more?<br>  <br>  <br>  You might ask, why winterize?<br>  <br>  When temperatures approach near freezing or below, condensation becomes a major issue.  This water moisture can go from vapor to water in the engine and cause cylinders and bearings to rust and corrode.  Winterization lubricates these parts with fogging oil to protect them from corrosion.  <br>  <br>  This will also protect the cylinders and piston rings after many months of not being used when you first start the engine.<br>  <br>  If you have an inboard or I/O, winterization is 100% mandatory any time you even have the threat of freezing.  All it takes is one good freeze and kiss $7,000 of engine goodbye.

Xc9Nu30eaa	I JUST bought a used car.  The questions to ask before even going to see the vehicle (you don't want to waste your time going to see a car if it's not what you want):<br>  <br>  1. Has it been in any accidents?  If yes. What kind (front-end, fender-bender, etc)?  Was the repair work done by a professional and do you have receipts for work done?<br>  <br>  2. What's the longest/furthest you've driven the car in the past 6-12 months.<br>  <br>  3. Does the car smell like cigarette smoke?<br>  <br>  4. Does the car have a current smog certificate?<br>  <br>  Don't ask too many questions over the phone b/c the sellers get annoyed and don't have a lot of time to waste.  They may have other buyers on the line.  So, ask the important questions and get down there to see it and test drive it.<br>  <br>  Once you drive it and it feels sound you can start talking about price.<br>  <br>  VERY IMPORTANT:  When test driving and considering older cars with high miles you want to ask if all of the engine and other important parts (radiator, transmission, brakes, etc.) are original or replacements.  If they are original ask when the last time they were serviced.  If they are replaced ask if they have receipts for the work done.  Actually, it's not a bad practice to ask for receipts on everything.  If the person is selling a good car they shouldn't be afraid to show you receipts.  If they get mad they have something to hide...<br>  <br>  Another tip:  Buying a used car look for Honda and Toyota with under 150,000 miles or Nissan under 100,000.  You should be able to find a decent car under $5000.  Before committing to anything, look up the Kelly Blue Book Value for used cars Private Sellers and don't pay over that amount.|`|dCuWCbRkaa	Ask them if they can present you with a Carfax history report.  That should show if the car had any major service or was in any accidents.  Then just inspect things like how it the engine sounds when it runs, if there's any loud noises when it does this.  Then just get a visual on some things like the tire treads to see how worn they are and also check upholstery on the inside for any skuffs or anything you wouldn't want.<br>  <br>  Some other good things to ask the person is how well they drove it and how old the tires are, how long have they owned it, were they the first, second etc owner.<br>  <br>  It may be tough to grasp the concept that this car won't be perfect since it's used, but just check some of the basics that I listed to make sure the car is still in decent shape.<br>  <br>  Also, when it comes time to buy, make sure you try to bargain with the dealer/owner.  See if they will clean it for you, fill the tank, fix any minor parts, lower the price, etc.  If they really want to sell you this car, then you can convince them to do some of these things, and you'll feel good that you got a good deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun choosing!|`|AA11216883	1. take the vin number of that car and go to carfax.com to check if its a lemon.<br>  2. go to siftin.com to make sure, you are paying the right price|`|H4dswqRlaa	Ask "what's wrong with it?".|`|JReYGwQgaa	Ask about any kind of recalls it has gone in for.

tLilNlptaa	There is a possiblity that you will need a cosigner, but if you put down 5k on a 10k car, you could be able to get approved without cosigner. You are at that point putting down 50% and banks will look at that, but will also consider the lack of credit history, and the fact that you are in the military and move around a lot.|`|06cadd03487b295a4976db9f27d72074aa	You wont need a car in the military, save it until you can pay cash, or at least until you really need one. Otherwise you will be in another country on some mission and your new car will be sitting(which is the worst thing you can do to a vehicle).|`|yiux97Wbaa	Actually, I sold cars for a short time and if you are in the service, have no other bills, it won't be that hard for you to get a car loan on a brand new car, and I think you should go this route.  Just try to be realistic as to what you can afford, your bills should never be more then half or your income.  Years ago, you used to be able to inure your license, but I don't know if there are any companies out there that still do this.  The best advice I can give you is to decide what kind of car you want to buy and find out what it will cost you to insure it, you can do this on your own without any help from family,then make plans to have the insurance ready when you buy.|`|KOXcw4klaa	it all depends on your credit.but i believe as long as you put a down payment down and can prove you have an income(which you do have)then i see no reason why you wont get approved.as for driving away in the car that day,well it depends on if they can get it registered or if they let you use their dealer plate or not.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	It's doubtful in today's market. Even though you'll be in the army with a guaranteed pay check, you still haven't established a credit history or a history in employment (Army). You need to show stability in both for a lender to seriously consider you. Even with 50% down, you could still get turned down because of lack of credit and employment history. That makes you a high risk.<br>  <br>  Lenders no longer approve high risk loans. Those are greatly responsible for the economic crisis we're in. They've caused thousands of bank failures, lenders going broke, millions of people without jobs and have pushed us to the brink of depression. <br>  <br>  Lenders will not consider any military personnel unless they're E4 or E5. Large down payments no longer will get you approved for a car loan today. A minimum of  5 years credit history with a previous car loan in good standing, 2 years at your present job or an E4 ranking, no derogatory marks, $2500/mth and less than 34% debt to income ratio is what gets approval now. Nothing else. <br>  <br>  It sucks. But its reality.
AA11264416	don't do what you was told because thats going to f*ck up the transmission over time, since its front wheel drive and an auto all you can really do is engage the E-brake and stomp the gas enough for the tires to start smoking and then let go of the E-brake while still holding the gas down, if you had a stick shift all you had to do was hold the clutch down and floor the gas all the way and the pop the clutch out, same thing with a stick and rear wheel drive to, if its rear wheel drive and an auto you power brake it, thats when you hold the brake (regular brakes not E-brake) and gas long enough to let the tires smoke and then let go of the brake<br>  <br>  to get a good start for a race, since its an auto, hold the brake as hard as you can and give it just enough gas to where you feel the torque converter load, you'll feel the car lift a little, but don't give it enough gas for the wheels to spin, when you go just let off of the brake while pushin the gas all the way, and there you go|`|SohrsIBoaa	yeah man, put it in neutral, redline for 45 seconds and then put it in park then R then D4.

My advice it get something that is safe and reliable and once you get some experience then get a sports car.|`|yiux97Wbaa	Personally, I would love to have a porsche for a first car, but a car like that also demands a lot of responsibility and if you don't think you can keep your foot out of it, then go with the cheaper car.  The police don't like to see a young person in a car like that and they will harass you if they think they have a reason to.  Also, the parts for a porsche are expensive and they can be costly to fix an insure.  Ya, the porsche could be a lot of fun, but it would probably be more practical to have a small economy car.|`|wO56y9BYaa	Take the Porsche.<br>  <br>  My first car out of college was a 1988 Porsche 911.  Buying that car was a great decision as it both made commuting fun and held it's value so when I traded up I got almost all my $$ out of the car.<br>  <br>  That said, the cons are higher maintenance and insurance costs along with a slightly higher likelihood you'll do something that will get you pulled over.  The pros are you get to roll in a cooler and much more fun to drive car than a civic and, when you're going out with more than 1 other friend you'll never have to drive.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to make sure your Dad's car is a reliable Porsche model (e.g. 3.2 liter 911 and not something like a 928), that the service history is up to date, find an honest local mechanic, and head out in your Dad's Porsche!|`|06cadd03487b295a4976db9f27d72074aa	Dude, take the Porsche! <br>  We all know Daddy is going to take care of the up-keep, AND its a MAJOR chick magnet.<br>  Besides you would be envied by every swinging #&*@ out there!!!

The 4.3 Chevy V6 originally came out as a 229 cubic inch engine which was basically a small block V8 with cylinders deleted but those ceased to be made in around 1985 in favor of the 4.3 V6.  Pretty long winded for a simple "no, it won't work within reason.".|`|fefea25d32d84e4e20a7a00602d67062aa	A 3.4 is an over grown 2.8. <br>  A 3.8 is a 5.0 ( 305 ) missing two cylinders. <br>  There is nothing on these motors that will interchange.<br>  <br>  You are thinking of the old 231 Buick 3.8<br>  The Chevy 3.8 is a 305 missing two cylinders. Just like a 4.3 is a 350 missing two cylinders.<br>  <br>  You are correct the 3.4 is a 60 degree engine. It is the same basic design as a 2.8, and a 3.1 V6.
cAGv5evLaa	No, it would be ridiculous if Lexus voided the car's warranty for going a certain speed. However, if you redline the engine (make the RPM go above the redline on the tach dial), that could void the warranty. These newfangled cars have onboard computers that log things like max RPM, and if something happens to the car's engine and he takes it to the shop, they might plug it in and read that the RPM went over the redline and tell him it's out of warranty - and you're in big trouble if that happens.<br>  However, I trust you didn't redline it. Right? If not then you're probably okay. Just be more careful next time! What if a cop pulls you over for going double the speed limit in your dad's new car? That's game over right there. <br>  <br>  If you're really freakin out about it, you can always call a Lexus dealership and ask their mechanic over the phone. That would be anonymous of course, and you could just ask him flat out and he would be able to tell you for sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck kiddo, you and I are cut from the same die.|`|kbGjEeoLaa	If you were on a new Harley Davidson, the warranty would be voided.  New harleys are monitored for the first 500 miles.  At 500 miles they get serviced and they check the computer to see if they have gone over 55mph.  Time is needed to break in the engine.  For a 4 door sedan, you should be fine!|`|a9212654f8034cb23a9a805de952825baa	Excessive speeds will not automatically void the warranty.

JlJb3rckaa	Ok, before I tell you what a lease is, let me warn you, do not get a lease. A lease is when you pay a monthly payment for a car, but return to the dealer in x amount of years. It is like a prolonged rental. You do not need a loan for used cars unless you don't have the cash. In your case, yes you need a loan even for a used car. Go to a dealer and find a car, get it inspected at a shop and make sure its the car you want, and then take out a loan from the bank or the dealer, but beware of the interest rate, it should not be any higher than 10% with good credit. You will then pay the monthly payment until you pay off the loan. I recommend going with a parent or relative, even a friend who knows about cars and financing to help you through the process. good luck|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	carbuyingtips.com<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  That site ironed things out for me my first time out buying a vehicle for myself.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	If you don't have cash saved up for a used car, you must get a loan from a family member, a good friend, or a loan company or bank. You will repay that loan with monthly payments, which will include finance charges (interest). You'll also pay sales tax and some official fees. Don't forget insurance, gas, maintenance, and annual inspection/tag fees.<br>  <br>  What is a lease? Here is a good explanation:<br>  <a href="http://www.firstcarguide.com/lease/basics-of-car-leasing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstcarguide.com/lease/basic...</a><br>  <br>  However, used car leasing is not very common.

I have a CBR 1000 and if you go test ride bikes at the dealer you should try one out just to get a feel for it!

Q2wdm3spaa	I'm not going to tell you not to buy a bike, but I am gonna tell you to follow the math a little further and look at how much the interest is going to add up to on financing a new bike. I'm a big believer in paying cash for the things I buy, and using the interest I save to buy the next thing. As my Dad told me when I was a kid, the way to have the cash to pay for things is to pay cash for things, if you follow that.<br>   Having been through college, I have to agree with the posters that say not to spend yourself broke on this bike. Being broke in college sucks, flat out. There's always something else you need money for.<br>   I could go on, Dearborn weather, additional parking if you have a car, on and on, but you get the point. It sounds like you're trying to be responsible, so if you still want a bike, get a used one you can pay off now and still have a little stash left. There are some nice ones out there right now.|`|i6NGGj73aa	Okay - but I hate doing this.If you question buying a Harley the gods are telling you that you ain't worthy of one and should get a pogo stick instead.Save boy then go in with a fist full of dollars and say '' that one right there''.You owe it to yourself to live a little on the dark side - just time it right.|`|T0ia6FK0aa	Im 21, I bought my Sportster used with cash.

So, do your research, and maybe you can get a really good deal. But don't let yourself be seduced into it. Do it for hard-headed reasons. <br>  <br>  Like saving gas (you can keep it in your dorm room over the winter, because Michigan is no place for winter biking!). Or you could start a delivery service for other students, picking up their pizzas and groceries, and hauling it back for a percentage. (You could get a little trailer for the bike, too.)<br>  <br>  (-: Sorry, not very good at convincing you, am I?<br>  <br>  Seriously, it won't do you much good in college, and will be a burden during the winter months when you can't ride it. You say you are a musician -- think of the serious equipment you could buy for what a Harley costs. And you could make more money being a musician than you could being a motorbike errand boy.<br>  <br>  But, you are only young once. If you were going to a university down south where you could bike most of the year, I'd say go for it. As it is, maybe it's best to keep negotiating for a used one. Did you try Craig's List?
BVaCJkxzaa	You have most likely been using the enrichener to warm up your bike. You should use the throttle lock to hold it at about 1000 rpm. The enrichener/choke floods the engine with too much gas and it ends up in your oil and fouls out the spark plugs. Really the best way to warm up the bike is to let it run for 30 seconds and drive off slowly for the first few minutes. Clean the plugs, change the oil, and don't warm it up so much and if you need to warm it up use the throttle lock screw on the bottom of the throttle control. It's the black 3 sided knob that screws in and out.|`|i6NGGj73aa	I was told by my dealer not to warm my sportster up just fire up and ride.But I would change the engine oil and filter - then see if it happens again.A new set of spark plugs wouldn't be a bad thing.How many miles on the clock since the last service?Good luck with your sporty.|`|tJEfMmhjaa	Do not follow the advice to not use the enricher. This is bogus. The Factory Manuals, both the owners manual and the Factory Service manual recommend using the enricher over the throttle lock. <br>  <br>  For temps above 50 degrees F, Start the bike with enricher fully open and ride for 1 minute before closing <br>  For temps below 50 degrees F, Ride with the enricher open for 3 minutes. <br>  <br>  As for your problem, Not all sportsters are the same, but the most likely culprit is leaking fuel into your oil system. As already stated, Changing out the bad oil and putting in new filters will probably eliminate the problem. You can also check the petcock to ensure that it's working properly. <br>  <br>  For more information regarding the Sportster check out www.xlforum.net  dedicated to the Sportster Blowing away big twins since 1957..|`|UbXfcgL3aa	I wouldn"t think that the short little trip you took would have caused any major damage. Two ways that gasoline could have mix with the oil can be easily fixed.  1) If the sparkplug was already fouled or in pour condition it can cause that cyclinder ( essecially a cold cyc.) not to fire. So now all the unburned fuel stays as a liquid & can pass by the rings down into the oil.  <br>   #2) Always turn the fuel pitcock off on a motorcycle !! (Especially with a carburetor) Dont trust the auto shut-off on the pitcock. The fuel system on motorcycle usually is gravite feed to the carb with a needle vavle that is connect to a float. A park motorcycle leans to one side making float lean. This can let fuel by & it just keeps going down hill to the manifold, then down the cylinder dripping past the piston rings again into the oil.<br>  So give it A new set of plugs , a tune up & change the oil. <br>   H.D.'s are a dry sump oil system so you can drain the oil tank not the crankcase.  So take a ride for a few miles to make sure it is running good checking the oil & then you may want to do a second oil change. (The crankcase could of had a little fuel traped in it.) <br>        Keep the rubberside down !!     David

G3fuWkPZaa	Listen man, not to alarm you or anything but these kind of questions can be lethal to you and everyone else's health. Theres a new disease going around, its called new age cancer and its the big boy in these parts of town. This things stronger, faster, deadlier, creepier, and blacker than any other kind. This thing is so powerful, it can tear peoples heads off, eat lava, kill ronoson chirogodas, nexus rape people, and even turn into a dragon. Now nexus rape is an entirely new different type of rape altogether. Nexus rape is when the rape victim becomes the rapist and the rapist becomes the rape victim. Usually when this happens, a super ape infects the rape in progress, and gives the rape victim an overwhelming amount of strength. They are actually able to turn the tables on their opponent, and have been known to grow 90 feet. The thing i would be really worried about is ronoson chirogodas, literally living gods. If i could tell you all the stuff ive been through because of these things..... Ronoson Chirgodas once infected the town i was living in, killed the entire population including mice. Ronoson chirogodas can not be killed, they can only be stopped. These things are stronger than adrenaline fueled cheetahs, and have been known to create super fighting television speakers. Super fighting television speakers have been known to make someone explode, and creates extreme russian jihads. One thing you should really be careful about is super arthritis, this stuff can literally make you fall apart. Another thing to worry about is ultra alzheimers, which is like alzheimers except it affects everyone from every age. Ultra alzheimers once made a man forget how to breathe, and he died a painful death. He fell on the floor saying why? The thing you should really, really be afraid of is mexican ronoson chirogodas, even stronger than ronoson chirogodas. Mexican ronoson chirogodas carry guns, and travel faster than the speed of light. Usually they reproduce about 900 a minute and can infect the entire population in mere seconds.

9D1EHgEkaa	Did you mean "tachometer"?<br>  <br>  A tachometer (also called a revolution-counter, rev-counter, or RPM gauge) is an instrument that measures the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analog dial, but digital displays are increasingly common.<br>  <br>  Tachometers on automobiles, aircraft, and other vehicles show the rate of rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause excessive wear and other damage to engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analog tachometers speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by an area of the gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of "redlining" an engine—revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a rev limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.<br>  <br>  In vehicles such as tractors and trucks, the tachometer often has other markings, usually a green arc showing the speed range in which the engine produces maximum torque, which is of prime interest to operators of such vehicles. Tractors fitted with a power take off (PTO) system have tachometers showing the engine speed needed to rotate the PTO at the standardised speed required by most PTO-driven implements. In many countries, tractors are required to have a speedometer for use on a road. To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle's tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed. This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient. Tractors with multiple 'road gears' often have tachometers with more than one speed scale. Aircraft tachometers have a green arc showing the engine's designed cruising speed range.<br>  <br>  In older vehicles, the tachometer is driven by the RMS Voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator tachometer output. This is a special circuit inside the alternator to convert from rectified sine wave to square wave, and the electrical potential difference is directly proportional to engine speed. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) also exist- usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent engine management systems found on modern vehicles, the signal for tachometer is usually generated from an engine ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.|`|ZfRnC4rAaa	Uh, what he said.  As far as how to use it while changing gears?  Not too sure, I learned how to drive a stick from a truck driver, and he taught me to listen to the sound of the engine.  Since then, the tach is just another gauge that I can do with out.|`|dVQdswtTaa	In simpler terms, the tachometer is a gage that looks just like the speedometer, but shows how fast the engine is turning.<br>  <br>  Engines work best withing a certain speed range, and watching the tach helps you know that the engine is turning either too slow (downshift) or too fast (upshift).<br>  <br>  After a while, you will get used to the sound and feel of the engine, and will probably go by that to shift.

Except while in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less or while turning, each person operating an aircraft under IFR in level cruising flight in uncontrolled airspace shall maintain an appropriate altitude as follows:<br>  <br>  (1) When operating below 18,000 feet MSL and—<br>  <br>  (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any odd thousand foot MSL altitude (such as 3,000, 5,000, or 7,000); or<br>  <br>  (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any even thousand foot MSL altitude (such as 2,000, 4,000, or 6,000).<br>  <br>  (2) When operating at or above 18,000 feet MSL but below flight level 290, and—<br>  <br>  (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any odd flight level (such as 190, 210, or 230); or<br>  <br>  (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any even flight level (such as 180, 200, or 220).<br>  <br>  (3) When operating at flight level 290 and above in non-RVSM airspace, and—<br>  <br>  (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any flight level, at 4,000-foot intervals, beginning at and including flight level 290 (such as flight level 290, 330, or 370); or<br>  <br>  (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any flight level, at 4,000-foot intervals, beginning at and including flight level 310 (such as flight level 310, 350, or 390).<br>  <br>  (4) When operating at flight level 290 and above in airspace designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) airspace and—<br>  <br>  (i) On a magnetic course of zero degrees through 179 degrees, any odd flight level, at 2,000-foot intervals beginning at and including flight level 290 (such as flight level 290, 310, 330, 350, 370, 390, 410); or<br>  <br>  (ii) On a magnetic course of 180 degrees through 359 degrees, any even flight level, at 2000-foot intervals beginning at and including flight level 300 (such as 300, 320, 340, 360, 380, 400).|`|VyAHw76daa	ATC will assign, but the general rule is even westbound through 400, odd eastbound through 410. Have flown westbound many times at 430 and 450.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	B.  Ask the controller.<br>  <br>  (The even/odd rule is for UNcontrolled airspace).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thrust reversers, engines set to N1, flaps set to Full, and autobrakes Medium--these are NOT needed to slow an aircraft after touchdown.|`|pWnvpLyCaa	A<br>  <br>  BTW, in class A airspace (that above FL180 in the US) you will always be assigned an altitude due to ATC considerations, and it may not always conform to the hemispherical rule.<br>  <br>  Are you also seeking an answer to the second question?|`|BeLOqghLaa	When IFR abover 18,000ft, you will always file even-numbered flight levels when traveling West. (A)<br>  <br>  After touchdown, you would not bring the aircraft to full flaps, so I would eliminate C.
GgHYpASIaa	I don't know if this will help much.<br>  But when my boyfriend's windshield got busted out (it was with a bat) it sounded like a gun shot, or like someone hitting the dumpster with a bat.<br>  Then when my driver window got broken out (was with a crow bar, and the window had tint) it went straight through and didn't even shatter.<br>  Barely made any noise at all.<br>  It kinda depends on what the surrounding are I believe as to what it will sound like.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	The side and rear windows are made of tempered glass.  The glass is made by rapidly cooling the glass which creates a great deal of internal strain in the glass which is what makes it so strong.  When the glass is chipped all the energy stored in the glass is suddenly released and the glass literally explodes into hundreds of small pieces.  The principal is similar to how stiff a rubber band becomes when it it stretched almost to the breaking point, but if the rubber band gets nicked at that point it snaps releasing all the stored energy.  Tempered glass is used because the small pieces are much less likely to cause severe severe cuts like the shards of regular broken glass which can kill.
rBcC0ricaa	If the radio is a CD30/CD30 mp3 then this will almost certainly the cause of the battery drain, Vauxhall do an exchange program and a reconditioned set will be around ￡80. + fitting. In the meanwhile you could remove the fuse at the back of the set.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	sorry never heard of the aerial causing problems have seen the stereos switch themselvs on but it was more common on the astra h but it did happen with the corsa too try pulling the radio fuse out. the best way too find the drain is too hook up an amp clamp any thing more than 0.5 is excessive and pull the fuses out too the reading drops but check all interior lights including boot and glovebox too make sure their turning off. is it still the original battery in car who checked it as it is at the right age too start failing!
rBcC0ricaa	The most common cause of juddering is a Dirty Throttle body.<br>  Symptoms:  Low Idle & Judder<br>  To clean removed the throttle-body clean the whole thing with "carb" cleaner and a toothbrush.  Then....this bit's important, clear the very small breather hole with a small drill bit.  Refit using a new gasket.  Start up applying light throttle.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	is it juddering constantly or just underload
ampkZtrXaa	I think you need to be more specific as to what is juddering. It could be your clutch, but that will only judder when you move off.
5BiBamrxaa	No it should be raised.<br>  In most European countries it is the equivalent of 85mph.<br>  <br>  a|`|ZEwAalKPaa	No, just enforce it, as it is routinely ignored by large numbers of motorists. I was driving at 70 this morning on the M1 and was passed by a woman in an Audi A6 who must have been doing about 90 - with her mobile held up to her right ear!<br>  <br>  Despite its size, much of USA has a 50mph limit. <br>  <br>  To me arguments in favour of raising the limit because cars have better brakes and road holding just do not hold water, a moments inattention at 90 can obviously get you into a predicament more quickly than at 70 or lower. And lessen your chances of walking away from it. Now on average, i drive a little over 30k a year and have seen hundreds of near misses' on the motorways and of one thing i am certain, the average driver thinks he/she is far better behind the wheel than he/she actually is! The number of times i have seen people pull out of the middle lane into the outer lane without warning or signal is quite frightening.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello<br>  <br>  I think they should govern all cars to 70 MPH, They can do this by the gears in the gear box which would in fact increase the pulling power for caravans etc.<br>  <br>  Andy C|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	No and at the end of the day most people don't even stick to that. I think the motor way is fine as there should be no little kids etc and when there is its mainly there fault as they should not be on the motorway!!!!! I think it is fine as it darlinn xx =]<br>  <br>   x =] Have a wkd sunday x [=|`|AA11220909	YES - Vehicles do NOT need to go over 30 mph.<br>  <br>  The faster you go, the higher the risk of someone dyeing when you hit them.|`|HVVTyfSgaa	WHAT  ? Your saying there is a LIMIT? well well well .|`|fox5a3ePaa	no|`|a1cd334b7460b658a7720d64ea8dabd8aa	No.<br>  The present speed limit of 70 was introduced in December 1965 following a number of accidents in poor weather. Since then, road design, vehicle design, and driver training has increased. <br>  Today's limit should be increased to 80MPH, with conditions.<br>  These conditions, could include compulsory motorway driving tuition when you have passed your basic driving test. ALL motorists to under go compulsory 5 yearly testing, to ensure that their driving meets the required standard.<br>  Stricter enforcement of the speed limit and more stringent prosecution of those that break the limit, to act as a deterrent to others.<br>  New drivers to be limited to engine capacity of cars for a defined time period after passing their test, as I believe motorcyclists are.<br>  In addition, the government needs to review the speed limit of all vehicles on the motorway. How can they impose a maximum governed speed of HGV's of 56mph, but have a national speed limit of 60mph!.Also, how can they allow coaches to travel at 65mph, but not go into the outside lane, therefore effectively limiting there speed to 56mph as they cannot overtake trucks in the middle lane.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Simple answer is no.<br>  The Police actually want to see it increased to 80MPH as they think it would be safer because of the way cars are now built. The problem is not the cars or the speed limits it's the idiots behind the wheel that drive without any skill thinking they are great drivers we all see them at times on the motor ways an around the streets we live. They are the couldn't careless brigade who think the laws do not apply to them.<br>  I would lock them up an only let them out to help clean the roads after the scene of an accident to see what devastation such idiotic driving can cause to other peoples lives. An when they see the light then let them out lesson learnt.|`|b4024d33f9c323fe1341ea128e08adccaa	no the speed limit should in fact be raised to take into account the modern design of brakes on cars that go can a lot faster than when the speed limit was set years ago, would should happen though is that car drivers eye sight should be tested more ofton to see why they keep hitting things.|`|oBkxcqaRaa	No. Although I have never driven on a motorway, I feel the objective is to get drivers to their destination as quickly as possible. Lowering the speed limit would cause people to get even more frustrated.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	no, 70 mph is too slow. it's very hard to stick to, and car made these days handle so well. There are only a  few idiots that drive faster than they or their car can handle and ruin it for everyone|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Possible but only when the "Police" enforce" the present speed limit and stop every car and fine etc.|`|de292ad47a31aedcb683cf279d2cb997aa	Definately not!<br>  <br>  If anything they should increase it to 80 MPH<br>  <br>  Motorways are the safest roads.|`|uq6x2UzSaa	No. In fact it would be great if they increased it. Then again i think people won't even stick to that. (most people do 80!) Even though cars are built better in terms of braking. Its this whole new 'environment' thing. They think to reduce the speed is better as it won't cause too much Co2 and kill the planet off. (funny how the UK seem to be the only one doing something about it) <br>  In Germany the Autobahn was reduced to 80 i think?...reason: environment. <br>  <br>  Besides with the congestion on most the motorways with the badly worn roads resulting to an endless lifetime of roadworks the motorway speed limit is usually 50.|`|LhXjYFNYaa	No point.  Would probably just piss people off and provoke them to drive faster and more recklessly.  The 70 MPH Highway speed limit is perfect in my opinion.  People just need to be more careful when its raining and snowing.|`|a5EgiLSWaa	no, you should wash your mouth out with soap for even suggesting it.<br>  <br>  motorways are statistically the safest roads, it won't happen.|`|TZSLoHeVaa	The speed limit on a UK motorwar is 70 mph max. not that any body obays it.|`|tNk6j437aa	No the congestion does that already|`|6cd1507b379ac1d62519cc04dfd9b28eaa	NO|`|5KGiumXNaa	No. It takes long enough to get to places with 70|`|qBwrMO7Maa	in short NO.|`|hkToz85eaa	no
AA12230046	You would be better off getting the whole car painted at once.  No matter how good they try to match the paint nobody can get an exact match.  That is unless the car is brand new.  The reason being is sun fad, chemicals in the rain, waxing the old paint.  All of these can change the color slightly and unevenly.  However, unless the car will increase in value of the overall paint job, which is unlikely, then just paint the new body work to as close as possible.|`|kJcItSOYaa	just paint it yourself dude. thats what i did with my body kit and it turned out fine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dailyhaha.com/_pics/cardboard_body_kit_car.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyhaha.com/_pics/cardboard...</a>
