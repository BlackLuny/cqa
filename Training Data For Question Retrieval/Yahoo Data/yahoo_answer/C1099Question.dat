I heard cologne's last an even shorter period of time!    3) How much do you need to spray for people to smell it well? I get the impression nobody is able to smell mine...    Please try and answer all the questions, thanks in advance, and I will be choosing a best answer!

20090204223511AAlzqIi	Beauty & Style;Hair	I need ideas for a hair style?	I have long hair.  It is in the middle, almost the lower part of my back.  The front stands are about two inches past my shoulders.  The last hair cut I got was a layered look.  The last hair cut I got was last Feb.  Yes, I know that is a long time to go with out a hair cut, but I really didn't have the time nor the money for it then, but I have it now.  The thing is I don't know what style to get.  I don't look good with bangs, so that is out, and I want it to still be a little past my shoulders.  My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I sometimes straighten it with a flat iron.  I am also a low maintenance type of person, so I don't want anything that requires a lot of hair spray or hair gel or moose to style it in order for it to look good..  Any ideas on what style to get?  Pictures would be wonderful if you have any.  Thank you for your time and help.

20090204190425AAqhN3H	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why do beautiful girls always think they are better than the Average looking girls? What makes them better?	First of all I'd like to point out. I am a dude. Secondly, I'm freaking tired of all the so called "Beautiful" girls at school looking down on the so called "average" girls. You know what makes a girl really attractive? That's right it's NOT just looks. It's the OVERALL package. That overall vibe that she sends out and the way she treats others and the way she carries herself. And most importantly, what is inside her brain. Her intellect. Because intellect = good control of facial expressions.      And, the so called "average" girls, don't be so down and don't ever feel insecure about yourself just because you don't fit the meaningless popular HIGH SCHOOL cute girl image. Only the immature high school dudes whose balls haven't dropped would treat girls differently just because their looks. We dudes get smarter as we age! Trust me. I am a perfect example of that. When I was in high school I thought I'd never become what I am now.      So, just be you, keep your chin up and your head high, enjoy everyday, be happy, be active, and EARN good grades. Because you can trust me when I say, you will find your PRINCE one day.      Good luck.

The front stands are about two inches past my shoulders. The last hair cut I got was a layered look. The last hair cut I got was last Feb. Yes, I know that is a long time to go with out a hair cut, but I really didn't have the time nor the money for it then, but I have it now. The thing is I don't know what style to get. I don't look good with bangs, so that is out, and I want it to still be a little past my shoulders. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I sometimes straighten it with a flat iron. I am also a low maintenance type of person, so I don't want anything that requires a lot of hair spray or hair gel or moose to style it in order for it to look good.. Any ideas on what style to get? Pictures would be wonderful if you have any. Thank you for your time and help.

Thanks in advance ^ _ ^      What I wanted to add was this; how do I hold/use the curling so that I get nice 'spirals' like that as opposed to the 'flipped' look that I get otherwise? I have never used a curling iron before, so please be as specific as you can hahah. Also, if you have any youtube videos of this kind of stuff please SHARE!! Thanks so much!!!

20090205003014AAqyOrz	Beauty & Style;Hair	I bleached the hair on my arms, going srange colour at roots?	Well im 14 and im asian, so the hair on my arms is black. I used Nair face and body bleach, and did it all over my arms. It said to do it for 7 minutes but I did it for 5 because I don't want super blonde arm hair, just lighter than it was.      It lasted for about 3 days, and then the roots of the hairs started to go black again?? So its like 1/4 black hair, and lighter at the tip. I thought it could be because hair was growing, so the unbleached bits were coming out, but i havent shaved or waxed or anything, so why would my hair be growing, and why are the roots changing colour?      does anyone know nd can help please?

20090205002836AAJY0Ln	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Bow or stars tattoo on my foot?	the bow would be small and near the top of the last two toes with the ribbon going down part way on the toes. I love the bow but i tested it out with markers and everyone thought it was a butterfly.      if i chose stars I would probably get a few, maybe three, of different sizes but the tattoo overall would still be pretty small. my problem with the stars is that its a pretty common design, although having it on my foot and adding different colors might make it more original.       what do you think?  :)

It sits just below my shoulders but she tried to do 'layers'. It looks like I have two layers - one ending above my ears and it sticks out a bit.. plus it's terribly uneven.. It looks real bad :S       I hate short hair, so here's the question.. if I go to a hairdressers would they be able to fix it without chopping alot off? I want length, but if the hairdresser has to take length off I wont go.. also, how would a razor cut effect it? I don't know much about hair, but my friend has a razored haircut and it looks sweet...

20090205021256AA4jQoI	Beauty & Style;Hair	Tips & Tricks for the hair dye newbie?	I have finally decided to color my hair, after much consideration.    I have never dyed it before, so this will be something entirely new to me.      I browsed my local supermarket's hair color section, through the several brands, and endless amounts of colors, until I found the perfect one, which was from Garnier. Unfortunately, the color was sold out, so I opted to buy the next shade, which was only a slight bit lighter, called 'Dark Golden Brown'.       My hair is naturally black, well technically, it's just a really really really really dark brown, that looks black, unless strands of my hair are held up in the sunlight, and it's quite short.      I visited the Garnier website, and read their hair color section, and watched the application videos, so I have a fair understanding of how to apply the dye.      I would just like to know, are their any important tips you professionals can give me?             Thanks.

20090205030102AAtkj6c	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	WhIm donating my eggs to save money for my breast augmentation, what do you think?at would you like to ask?	hey, so i want to have a breast augmentation and tummy tuck after having my son who is 6 months old now, the extra skin on my tummy is gross, and the girls are hanging lower than ever now (though hubby doesnt care - its not really for him, jus want to have my body back) . i know that donating eggs is a relativley good/easy way to make 5-7k in about 2 months, so i figure i do that 2 or 3 times and i can get the money i need without taking out of my personal savings, plus some left over. besides, it helps an infertile couple have the baby theyve always wanted. what do you guys think? me and hubby think its a good idea.

20090205034122AAbIGAr	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	What are these red spots on my face?	Yesterday morning I woke up with about 9 little red spots on my cheeks and sort of near my ear (but not on my ear) which actually looks like pimples. I though they were but they were flat and didn't seem like them. I recently bought a new hat for my school for lunch (we have to wear hats at lunch) and it was sort of dusty and smelled awkward (and the colours are very deep blue and white with a school emblem). I wore it before Wednesday to try it because I only just bought it the previous Tuesday and then the spots showed up.      When I was at school, I tried to ignore the spots, but when I checked in a mirror, there were more and my cheeks were becoming more red and inflamed. They were starting to itch too. I was also wearing my new hat at the time!      I bought an antiseptic cream and some tablets that my pharmacist recommended for flare-ups and rashes and that sort of thing. I used them after washing my face with a cleaner in the shower and the spots cleared up a little bit.       Today, before I wore my hat, the spots were mostly cleared but as soon as I put my hat on, I started getting the same red dpots on my cheeks, and also smaller ones all around my body. Again, I switched on and off with my hat and the spots flared up and cleared in time with my hat.      I am suspicious that the hat might be causing a reaction to my face because it has a flap at the bottom which can actually cover my whole cheeks. If anyone knows what's going on or has an answer please let me know. I still have the spots but they are clearing up a little.

Hi, i barely know anything about this industry and i have no clue why i applied for a runway show but i got invited to attend the casting call.      First off, the dude told me to bring my walking heels. now, do these heels have to be at least something inches? i'm 5'3 so how many inches of heel should i get?      Second off, he said in the e-mail "this will be your chance to showcase your talent." does he mean that i have to have a talent like singing, juggling, magic tricks, etc.?      i just also want to know what a casting call is like. thanks!
