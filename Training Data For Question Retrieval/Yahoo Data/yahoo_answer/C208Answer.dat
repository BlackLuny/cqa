GMIsOYYCaa	Don't worry, he just like every other 16 year old boy. You are not alone!<br>  <br>  If you are really worried, ask him if he'd be interested in doing a mentoring program like Big Brothers/Big Sisters (I intern for them) so he'd have a positive male model in his life.|`|ecBx744aaa	let him!<br>  he will come around,<br>  when he notices he needs you more then anything!<br>  but dont show him you dont care!<br>  EVER!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I dunno my son is close to me, because his father is a deadbeat|`|hNr3GFvlaa	I imagine how difficult this could be for you. I presume you want your son to continue with school and not drop out. <br>  <br>  Speak with him very honestly, in a moment when neither of you is triggered. Possibly, find someone you both trust and respect (fear is not respect!) and have that person speak with him or mediate your conversation.<br>  <br>  You may want to find out what he hates about school. Maybe there are pressures there you don't know about, like gangs, etc.<br>  <br>  Stay connected, find out more, be honest, work with him. <br>  <br>  And before all that, find a way to address your own pain, disappointment, anger and frustration. These are your own feelings triggered by the situation and if you enter the conversation with them still present, it may be very difficult for both of you.<br>  <br>  Also know that at this age in his development it is natural for him to feel a strong need for autonomy and understanding. These are feelings he does't have control over.|`|wUWvO5r6aa	You need to push him into doing some type of after school program usually boy's enjoy some type of sports, I know economy is bad but really push him into baseball,Football,soccer whatever it takes his mind from hanging just around with friends,He will be tired by the time he gets home and won't have any time for that.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Take a belt and ware his *** out ...NO IM JUST KIDDING ..<br>  <br>  Honestly this is difficult he needs firm disclipline but he also needs allot of patience compassion and he needs a hug more often than you would think he might also need an objective stranger he can talk to ..|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Kids do need space, but they also need firm guidance and real parenting.  If he's just being sullen and stubborn, but still goes to school, gets decent grades, does what is expected around the house etc, don't worry too much.  If things are slipping and you are worrying about who he is hanging out with, grades, drugs, safely issues - take action.<br>  <br>  You have the power, and you have to be willing to wield it to save a floundering kid.  Sometimes this means a major chance in your life while you help keep him on the right path.  Sometimes it means being willing to have him hate you short term to get him safely to adulthood.  Don't be afraid to be the boss - it's your job!  Good luck!|`|SeuAdzclaa	Take advantage of a nearby church.  There are many upstanding men in the community willing to serve as good role models, and will help young teens develop good friends that have tradional values and respect for their parents.  A teen program in a church would be good.  They'll come around and pick your son up at home on Sundays, and keep him busy during the week in other activities.  Often camping, concerts, and sports are included.  Changing friends would be a good idea.|`|CsIwiZRoaa	dont hover. my nephew is 16 and when my sister in law tries to be in every aspect of his life, he snaps. you cant make him stressed because I know also that when kids get stressed, they also snap. youre in my prayers
wObFm9B4aa	y  Y  y   Y  :|  the procedures cures damage to your body <br>  however if you are a SMBC single mother by choice and you are using a known donor any IVF clinic will help you the cost vary <br>  but if you JO in a cup and use a Catheter to put in u'r service at home can cost as little as $12
L0EKlaZ8aa	you are only 5 weeks along when they say your 7 weeks they are counting from your last period well u didnt get pregnant the week your on your period or most likley a few days after so there for you are not acutally pregnant those two weeks, so u are only 5 weeks pregnant i know its complicated but thats how it is.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	my sac didn't measure up to how far along my doctor said i was.|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	My doctor told me I was 7 weeks along based on my last period too, but I ovulate 2 weeks later that I should, so when she did the ultrasound I was really only 5 weeks along. Now I am 9 weeks and feeling like crap from nausea all day! I hope that everything is okay and works out great! Take care!|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	I will never get this stuff either! I had the same thing too, my LMP was November 28 2008 so at the Doc appointment I thought I would be 9 weeks, I was all excited! But she said I was measuring 6weeks6days. It sucks to find out your not as far as you thought. Dont prepare yourself for a miscarriage just yet, Try to be patient and rest and take care of yourself for now until next appointment. Also maybe ask your Doctor about your Progesterone levels where they are standing, I have issues with that and had to be on progesterone suppositories.Just a thought. I hope everything goes well for you! Good Luck!!
Tjr9aObNaa	Just tell him, you will feel way better after!<br>  He made that baby with you and you seem mature enough to handle it.|`|pauzBlpgaa	sit him down at home, don't look worried and don't say "i have to tell you something" or "we need to talk"<br>  <br>  that'll make any guy nervous and make it seem like there's something wrong. keep a postive attitute. your attitude towards it will affect his, believe it or not. you should feel excited to tell him, not worried, even if that's what you feel. <br>  <br>  also sit NEXT to him, not across. it's a fact that men feel more comfortable talking about more serious things sitting next to you.<br>  <br>  ..why do i even know this|`|YO1w7gpiaa	When you are adult enough to do all the things adults do...<br>  You're adult enough to speak what is true<br>  regardless of the other person's reaction.<br>  <br>  clue:  allow him some reaction time of a few days, <br>  as this may require some adjustment on his part.<br>  <br>  And...congratulations new Mommy!|`|B3jpU4Jraa	just tell him and it will al work out|`|SA6dCr0Laa	Ok, he needs to realize that if he didnt want kids, it is his responsibility also to use protection... If u really want this baby then that it, its your decision. do not do anything u dont want to do. Tell him as soon as possible and also let him know how u feel. If you havent already gone to the doctor then u should go first and then show him the test results and everything else. IF he really loves you than he should respect your feelings about the situation.|`|h1AIzD9baa	if your pregnant you have to tell him.. obviously he is going to find out some time.. a pregnant belly is hard to hide .. but a screaming baby is even harder.. if he's upset .. oh well.. he needs to know.. even if you are not going to live together or further your relationship he still needs to step up and take responsibilty..   your responsible for a whole nother life now.. its time to grow up and realize people get mad and upset but they also get over it..|`|AA10196172	Well, as long as you weren't stopping the pill behind his back (I assume you weren't) then he can't blame you any more than he can blame himself. It takes two to tango.<br>  <br>  I guess there will be some adjusting to do, but I bet in the end he'll be happy. There's only so long you can keep it a surprise, so tell him.|`|AXOOuK5yaa	Why would he be upset? He might be overwhelmed in the beginning but he really doesn't have a choice now.  He is eventually going to find out whether you tell him or not so you need to tell him sooner not later.|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	The fact that he wants kids at some point will soften the blow. When you're in a sexual active relationship you always have to allow for the sh*t happens factor so just tell him. I'm sure it will turn out okay.|`|HoonZJMgaa	they never come when you want. they come when the Lord sees fit. He may be upset for a minute but he should come around if he truly loves you. Do not worry! Just speak to him and have faith that everything will be ok|`|iFBZA9mxaa	If he cares about you and the baby he will be excited. Tell him. Congratulations!|`|ibeYAlwpaa	then have the baby....|`|XaRaP5Ahaa	you do need to tell him but if your scared if he might be angry and he could potentialy hurt you/the baby do it with a friend or family member around ! but no matter what do NOT let him influence your decision to keep this baby in the end think of this as YOUR BABY! if he doesnt want a child do not just get rid of it youll regret it for the rest of your life! remember everything happens for a reason! i wasnt ready for my baby but she turned out to be the most amazing thing to happen to us! and we both love her so much! [[and im only 19]]<br>  good luck and do what YOU WANT!|`|rSIF5jtSaa	You need to tell him. If he wants kids, he'll be fine. And, you know what, if he says that you need to get an abortion and you want this baby, the screw him. You deserve to keep the baby if you want it. I don't think that he'll be mad or anything. But, you have to tell him. It's not like you can hide it and he deserves to know. He might be more hurt than you not telling him.|`|9ITLWEqnaa	You will have to tell him eventually sometimes its better to just do it sooner rather than later. However he feels about it he played his part in you becoming pregnant and should share the worries and responsibility with you. People can change their minds and feel differently when its for real he may surprise you.  Good luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|7pYVDyfUaa	You are going to have to tell him at some point, and in this case, sooner rather than later is the best policy.<br>  <br>  And unless you did something like lie to him about being on the pill or something like that then there really isn't anything for him to be mad/upset about.<br>  <br>  Everyone should know the risks of having sex.  Sex was intended for procreation, and no form of birth control is 100 percent effective.<br>  <br>  He may be temporarily unsure, and upset...but not at you, and he will have to get over it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Ya know what.....NO ONE is ever ready for their first child. No mattter how trained and financially stable you are, There are still things you arent ready for. Both of my friends got pregnant at your age and of course werent even consideringa baby. But theyve now adapted. One of the friends has a 3 year old now and still carries the same life she had before she was preg (just with no father).<br>  <br>  I'm 7 months preg now and NEVER EVER wanted a child.....but after the denial and constant worrying Ive calmed down and really look forward to seeing my little girls face.<br>  <br>  I think its best to tell him whether hes ready or not. There are more better reasons to have him involved and even carry through with the pregnancy than having life long regret and wonderment.<br>  <br>  He'll be ok. He will fall in love once you get the ultra sounds done.|`|a2O4qDpnaa	You HAVE to tell him. If you are concerned he will leave you than maybe that is the best thing that could happen. There is nothing wrong with being a single mother, there is a whole lot wrong with having a husband who doesn't love you/treats you (or your baby) wrong. Tell him, and tell your family, or close firends so they can help you. Having a baby is not a small deal.|`|7LRPvZkhaa	you obviously need to tell him and if he loves you and wants kids eventually then he probably will only be upset for a little bit. but you need to tell him, its the right thing to do|`|5serOo00aa	are yall pretty serious? and if you are and yall love each other, than there is no need for him to be upset. and if he is, then there is something wrong with him.|`|EZdHWa4taa	Well.. I mean since you guys did it unprotected you knew what you may be expecting. <br>  so, you're going to have to tell him sooner or later.|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	1st... You NEED to tell him, he has the right to know.<br>  <br>  2nd... Never have sex with someone whom you think would be 'upset' if you got pregnant.|`|8a3gbCbKaa	You need to tell him before he sees a baby bump and question why you haven't told him. Whatever you do, keep it!

Better sooner, though. He will understand, if you have a good relationship :( <br>  This is a tough situation.<br>  I wish you the best of luck <3.|`|c2kopbo6aa	tell him and if he doesn't like it then too bad....you nad him created this baby and its your job to take care of it...who cares what he says...if he has that much of a problem about it then leave him....don't let him persuade you into anything you do want to do...if you want it than that's it...end of discussion.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Surprise surprise... you had sex and now there's a baby!  Just tell him!  At 23 y/o, he knows how this works!

It's great to hear positive news from people!|`|krnShgqnaa	Congrats :) Im so happy for you!|`|Yz9tGmKFaa	Congratulations!  We have been TTC for 12 cycles now (currently on CD 14).  Since you have a + HPT, and because it took as long as it did to conceive, I would call your OB and have him/her give you a lab slip to have your progesterone and HCG levels checked -- I am a big fan of preventing problems instead of waiting for them to happen.  It can't hurt to check your levels and if they come back normal, GREAT!  If they don't, you can get supplemented sooner rather than later.  It never hurts to error on the side of caution.  Best of luck to you!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Awww congrats!!! I bet after 15 months of trying you are just beside yourself! Try to not to worry too much and just enjoy your pregnancy, it goes by fast!|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Wishing you a happy and healthy 9 months!|`|6igjX2cnaa	Aww congrats hun!!

Jf3DIPcNaa	My first pregnancy was twins. I don't really remember my belly being any harder, but I certainly looked bigger than someone with a single. I looked full term at around 6-7 mos and then I just kept getting bigger. LOL. But it wasn't too bad. <br>  <br>  I remember feeling a lot of movement, but also times when they were calm and not moving. When I got further along, one was head down and the other was head up and they would kick each other in the head all the time. LOL. But I could actually tell a lot of the time which one was moving by where the movements were. My one daughter had hiccups a lot and the other did not. <br>  <br>  It's such a neat experience. Certainly more difficult than a single pregnancy, but also worth it. Good luck. :)|`|ux6j2OIeaa	Mine didn't feel any different to my 1st preg which was a single, however my tummy felt tight from about 4 months on both times.  And yes sometimes they are both moving or sometimes its just one, usually as you get further along one will wake the other and they will both be moving more often.  In the last few weeks mine didn't move a real lot, i think they'd run out of room at that stage.
3ZnjKIuAaa	hm. well being a parent they think differently. like when your grow up and have a child i doubt youd let her watch it when shes 13.  but it sounds like its a great movie and i really wanna see it too.  we should just get kaitie to rent it for us that way your mom wont have to find out.  but i think go for it for sure.  but it would be best if we watched it at my house  on the laptop because your house has like huge tv that everyone walks past.  but id say go for it as long as you think you can handle it all( sex,drugs,alchahol,cutting all that)  good luck!|`|J0PTYGAmaa	she already has DUH|`|DkT8znckaa	I've been wondering that too. I've been wanting to see that movie. I read somewhere that it was co-written by someone who was thirteen. I'm not sure if that's true or not..... I figure it can't be that bad if someone who's thirteen helped write it.... But from previews I've seen, there is some gross/weird stuff that I haven't seen in movies before. There is obviously drug use and sex in the movie. My mom hasn't let me see it yet. I just don't get how you can make a movie about thirteen year olds, and yet it is rated R.|`|NEV1P783aa	It deals with serious subjects. Sex, cutting, eating disorders, drug abuse, and underaged drinking.<br>  If you think you can handle that, then watch it. Maybe you and your mother could watch it together, and could talk about it. It would help you two bond :]<br>  If it were my child, though, I would definitely let her watch Thirteen. It was an amazing movie.|`|Ae0MwCPxaa	im 14 but yeah i would lol xoxo|`|mpq95NF9aa	No, I personally wouldn't. It's very dark and disturbing with content that is meant for adults. It's rated R for a reason. Wait till you're 17.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, you probably wouldn't even like it. It's not that good and it leaves you with a really hopeless feeling in your soul. I don't even know what the point of that movie is, seems like sheer exploitation and shock-value to me.|`|5zSAPU52aa	lol im 11 and im going to see it soon lol ttyl (email me!!!!)|`|YVppLt0taa	Most definitely not, I watched when I was Fourteen and it freaked me out completely! I would wait until your 15. There are some horrific scenes (slitting wrists, drug abuse etc) that really creeped me out after wards. It has a good moral to the story line, but other than that, I would advise you not to watch it!|`|t043WEDIaa	nah it's rated r and i'd make them wait until they were 15|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	Uh...is it rated PG13 or below?|`|gGNof8NHaa	It's not very realisitic. AT ALL No matter if you live in the skankiest, trashed up neighborhood it's all " wwwttf??" but uhm sure go for it, but there are nasty graphic parts where she cuts her wrists. i would shut your eyes its UGHHH!.|`|f4krIbjeaa	alot of people are thinking of the movie "13 ghosts"<br>  but i think i would<br>  its not that bad<br>  the movie is meant to show what bad things can happen from doing those things|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Negative, way too much for a 13 year old to watch, 16 year old maybe. I thought it was way too much when I saw it and I was 19|`|cbEOXkugaa	It depends on the parent. My mom let me watch it.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	no becuase its a pretty bad movie its got bad stuff in it.<br>  probally more like 15|`|l9bNCR6maa	yeah i watched it when i was 12|`|mW1EcKOPaa	Hm.. that's entirely specific to how you parent and prefer you child to watch things. It's PG-13. It has no nudity, however there are sexual topics, though it does not show any of it. It has drug references, as the main character, Tracy, takes a like to marijuana.<br>  <br>  I'd say watch it WITH her. It's not probably not the best idea to let her and her friends watch it together. The ending is sad, but it's definitely the way to tell thirteen year olds to stay away from drinking, drugs, and sex!|`|ge4p1LLZaa	Woman stands fully nude in a shower (we see bare breasts and pubic region).<br>  <br>  Boys and girls kiss in most scenes (a boy and girl lick each others tongues).<br>  <br>  Two underage girls try and seduce a man.<br>  <br>  An underage girl sneeks out with an older man and it is implied that they are going to have sex.<br>  <br>  Two underage girls remove their tops and sit on boys laps and kiss them.<br>  <br>  An underage girl does a sexy dance them flashes her chest to an underage boy.<br>  <br>  Cleavege showing tops throughout the movie.<br>  <br>  Underage boys and girls run throught sprinklers late at night and they boys remove their tops.<br>  <br>  A mother climb on top of her boyfriends lap and they kiss passionately.<br>  <br>  It is implied that an underage girl preforms oral sex.<br>  <br>  An man asks an underage girl if she wants to have sex.<br>  <br>  A girl is seen wiping her mouth, implying that oral sex was performed.<br>  <br>  A girl says that oral sex was performed on her by a much older man, but it turns out she is joking<br>  <br>  It is implied that two underage girls have sex.<br>  <br>  Two underage girls french-kiss <br>  <br>  <br>  If you consider that acceptable for a thirteen year old to watch, than yes.|`|lClLXMdbaa	na!|`|1vhPwRRFaa	I think people are talking about a few different movies. lol. I'd let you watch it. Its all about lessons and mistakes and hopefully it'll make you never want to do drugs because you see the trouble they cause.|`|z1YwRbcSaa	No...it's a really bad movie<br>  not just that there's bad parts, but it's not a good movie AT ALL, so don't worry, you're not missing out on anything good<br>  <br>  answer mine?|`|6YPtZcBxaa	Are you serious?! That movie is ALOT worse than MANY rated R movies.|`|zdCfg12saa	well i mean the movie is pretty bad...|`|8ClVIXjsaa	sounds cool.<br>  id watch it.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes to show her what not to do or act like and make sure she knows that is in no way cool|`|yV8fog7Paa	No. Unless it's rated PG or G. Other than that, for PG-13 they have to wait till they're 16 for most movies unless accepted by me, rated R they have to wait till they move out.|`|A3zAXntxaa	No, I saw it when I was twelve, it actually made me want to be like her, as sick as that sounds. Now I'm older, and I'm happy I'm not, but I'd definitely make your daughter wait, because it's like.. sexdrugssexviolencedrugsdrinkingdrugssex... Pretty much.|`|pJeFpC7qaa	I saw it when I was 12<br>  <br>  I thought it was a really good movie. It's a good story, I liked it <br>  <br>  But I wouldn't recommend it cause I was always like "What the heck is she doing!?! Why is she cutting herself!!?" I was so clueless D: haha|`|pcjOQDymaa	yes.<br>  i love that movie.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	I saw it.|`|5z36WuS1aa	are u talking about the 1 that comes on lifetime??|`|4SV4bz69aa	i'd probably wait till i was a little older, maybe 14 or 15 cuz its pretty intense and a little hard to watch, but many ppl do go through it.<br>  i saw it when i was 12 though =]|`|RK04Jktraa	Wow... irony.<br>  <br>  I suppose... it isn't unecsessary with it's content or anything.|`|b6QzfsMUaa	My parents made me the day I turned 13.<br>  Well, not really made me because I wanted to, but as long as you promise to not follow her example it should be fine lol.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I don't think that watching the movie will make a 13 year old think "hey, I wanna be just like them!".|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I don't no,<br>  Haven't seen it or heard of it|`|7XweQxIUaa	yea, it's a little hardcore, but it has a good lesson in it...|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	nah, i'd make her wait.

I think it's more important to worry about how you're going to feel emotionally.  Do you really think you are emotionally and intellectually mature enough to deal with it?  Have you thought about protection, what you'll use and who'll get it?   What if you don't like it and he does?  He will take that personally and be hurt, and if you don't tell him, you'll be stuck doing something you don't want to.  Or what if he is the one who decides they don't want to do it again?  Would that hurt your feelings?  He will probably tell his friends and they will probably tell people.  Things like that don't stay as private as they should.  Will it bother you if people know?  How would you go about telling your parents if you got pregnant?  Do you have jobs to pay for medical care in such an event?  Does he want children?  Do you?  What are your opinions on parenthood, abortions, and adoption?  How do you plan on raising and disciplining your kids?  <br>  <br>  If the two of you have talked all of this over and agree on all of it, if you really think that you are ready to deal with whatever consequences come of it, then maybe, just maybe, you are ready.|`|bVCcPYFAaa	My first tim eit hurt when it went in but then after it felt good.

uj1A73ZGaa	That is completely normal for twins. I am a twin and me and my sister when we were younger we always wanted to dress alike. Even in high school we had our hair the same and always wore the same thing.

Her brother is not educated, smokes 2 packs a day, and sits on the couch watching sports all day.  They are two separate people...but then again, who would want them to be the same?|`|bacgwHhOaa	Me and my twin brother....we are TOTALLY different... ( ferternal....age 15 ;P)|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Sarah and Hannah are four, and they are TOTALLY different. Sarah, has curly curly dirty blonde hair while Hannah has short blonde hair (bit lighter than sarahs) with bangs. They hardly look a like sometimes too, but sometimes they look just a like. Depends on the day lol.<br>  <br>  Sarah loves dresses, dolls, helping mommy, and coloring. She listens better than Hannah, and is really...just my easy child! She just sits there and plays by herself, and talks in this cute little quiet voice that is so thoughtful.  I could dress her up and put make up on her, and make her model for me and she'd think it was the best thing she's ever done. But Hannah would have a fit if i tried to put a dress on her. <br>  <br>  Hannah is crazy crazy! She tears into things, runs around the house, plays with trucks and hot wheels, will occasionally play doll house but not for long. She doesn't like to color or do long term projects, she just wants to play play play! She has to have a buddy too to play with...so thats one of the major disputes between them not wanting to play the same game. She's also VERY VERY loud! I can hear her talking from upstairs. lol.|`|RxhBUkwSaa	:) Twins aren't almost completely separate people, the ARE completely separate people!  Even identical twins develop their independent and separate natures.  It's part of the age-old nature vs. nurture puzzle!  <br>  <br>  Part of the reason they might seem to be even more different lately is because they are gaining a greater sense of self, and striving to make their own little mark in the family and the world.  Let them express themselves and enjoy everything they each bring to the world!|`|P544Sbmqaa	You act like they are one person.  Their genes may be the same, but they ARE two different people with two different minds.

5yAsj29Vaa	Either an epidural or a spinal block, yes.  You can't do it without one of those.  You wouldn't want to, either if you know what is involved with a c section.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Yes. You do not want to feel what they are doing!! I had a very long labor that ended up in a c-section because of the baby's position. My epidural wore off during the surgery, and I could feel them pulling out the placenta. NOT a good experience. They had to knock me out after that. I'm so hoping for a vaginal birth this time! :)|`|gPg7qYGIaa	normally yes but i'm terrified on needle and can just handle having one in my arm an no more so i got a general aesthetic and got knocked right out but general is a wee bit more risky for the baby as it can knock them out to but me and my baby boy robb where both fine|`|AA12033653	Typically with a C-Section they give you a spinal block not an epidural.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Yes or you could be put to sleep instead|`|4gqeQB1naa	yes. and you wouldn't want to go through that pain and pain that's not from the having the baby can't hurt you baby. talk to the doctor|`|azE51WGRaa	Not if you don't want one. You can always get a spinal block or they can gas you and put you to sleep.|`|L0EKlaZ8aa	you will get that or a spinal block or something like that beucase its a MAJOR SURGERY it will hurt without anything.|`|35kVNi5oaa	If you want to be awake they give you the epidural, but if not they'll give you a gas mask.|`|CVtmd0h3aa	yes!  You wouldn't want to feel them cutting on you.  It is that or morphin and that is bad on the baby.|`|XnJtW8iwaa	they need to give you something to numb you.|`|krnShgqnaa	You get a spinal block|`|wUWvO5r6aa	NO|`|7pYVDyfUaa	A spinal block, or a epidural yes, unless you have to have an emergency c-section with no time for that, then you will be put to sleep for the c-section.|`|EsXe7S1oaa	they can put you to sleep through an iv but then youd miss the first cry and such... it wasnt so bad, just kind of a strange feeling|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If you already have an epidural in place and then have a c-section, they use the epidural to give you pain relief during the surgery.<br>  <br>  If, like me, you had no pain relief until the c-section, you get a spinal block, which is a different thing, but so far as I can tell the same basic experience - needle to the spine.
yw7AeZn2aa	That prev answe is untrue.  Most children are sedated for MRIs bec they are loud and long.  My son who is 3 gets them every 3 months since he was 18 months. Its not that bad except they may have to have an IV before they fall asleep depending on which sedative they use.  The IV is traumatic for everyone and is the worst part. Ideally they can get the mask to fall asleep and put the IV in after. <br>  <br>  They are usually asleep for about 30 min after scan and then wake up in the recovery room, need to eat or drink befor ethey can go home.  Most kids are groggy for a bit and very few are nauseous.  Bring toys and entertainment as you may be waiting in that room before sedation for a long time- bring a dvd player if you have one- its a good distraction for little ones.|`|wUB1mz1Maa	you can't sedate someone in an MRI, it changes the functions of the brain, thus invalidating the test.
86g1v9hWaa	I heard that you have to be a bit patient. Because things would ease up after 3 - 6 months from the first day u had it inserted. That is when you body gets used to the hormone level. I like to get it implanted too. Many women have constant bleeding for months. Some are lucky, their period are gone for months ( i would love that)<br>  <br>  In Sum... you should give it a few more months before you have it removed.<br>  <br>  After removing implanon, you would be very fertile (you can get pregnant within 3 weeks according to my gyno)|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You should be able to ovulate right after having it removed. If you normally can get pregnant easily you should have a decent chance of getting pregnant by summer.
gMQruJUTaa	Wow!! I could've been the one asking this!  I am going through the exact same thing.  My little girl is 9 months also (on the 6)  Same thing, but no fever.  She started early Feb. w/cold like symptoms-stuffy/runny nose,cough, chest congestion.  No fever, eating and drinking ok and peeing and pooping. I waited 2 weeks before I called the dr. b/c I didn't want to waste time/money to hear them say wait 7-10 days and if it's not gone call back.  So, at the end of the 2nd wk. I took her in, she had a slight double ear infection and they put her on an antibiotic for that and the neon green snot that started clogging up her nose.  The antibiotic took care of that but she too has lingering cough/congestion.  I took her back 2 other times, plus she also had her 9 mo. physical w/in this frame-3 different dr.s.  They all said her lungs are completely clear, her ears look good(now) and it's just a bad virus.  This last time I took her, the dr. tried a nebulizer treatment on her b/c I told him her breathing seemed wheezy and labored at times.  It did before too but I never said anything b/c they said her lungs were clear.  Anyways, she still has the symptoms but they are not near as bad and her breathing is a lot more smooth/normal sounding.  <br>  <br>  Sorry my answer is so long-I'm glad I'm not the only one going through this w/my 9 mo.old though I wish both of them would get better. It is worrisome.  However, infants do to get allergies! That's why we cannot give them certain things until after they are a certain age.|`|EsXe7S1oaa	you may want them to check her ears. my 14 mo has been fighting an ear infection since november. i can always tell when it gets bad again when her nose starts running....dr said thats her reaction to it. good luck and hang in there!|`|fa641908cae350e97f3d9f50335dc90eaa	I hope your daughter gets better! im only a 12 yr old so i have no advice..... but to make u feel better thats what happened to me too! my mum told me|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	I would check for teeth.  otherwise, i too would be worried.

Yesterday and today I have been having these vertical, 1 second shooting pains down low and my doc said that it's stretching pains from the round ligaments.  I had an appointment today and she found the baby (he/she was hiding) and 'it' had a good strong heart beat which was a relief to hear. It gets a little scary when you're not showing yet and your symptoms start to go away too because, you don't have much proof of pregnancy left.   <br>  <br>  Have fun and congratulations!!!!!!!|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	I think I'm pregnant and my boyfriend is pretty sure that I am [I need a blood test]. If I am, I'm currently 13 weeks 2 days [my LMP was December 6] and would be due around September 12. I haven't had many symptoms other than headaches almost daily, being gassy, being bloated [my boyfriend said my stomach looked rounder] and rounder/fuller breasts. Hopefully, I get a BFP soon. Congrats on the baby :].|`|GdjfU5Saaa	my sister is due at the beginning of september and she is having her second child too, she said this one was way better than her first because her first one, she just kept on throwing up and her second one she only feels nautious.  the second one is alwys better than the first!|`|kEhcVZKmaa	I am due sep 9 and i am almost 14 weeks.

I'm 14 weeks. At this stage, I have been extremely sick. I have lost 10 lbs. I've been moody and tired. I was in the hospital. It's been a rough first trimester. I also find myself "forgetting" things. I'm hoping the second will get better.
YQrKQ5PAaa	I think it's good that you returned it. You may think the bunny is cute... but every other girl is going to think of what a slut you are. (I'm not saying that you are but that would be a common misconception)<br>  <br>  And... being 14... I would say that is inappropriate subject matter for other people that you hang out with or even just go to school with.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	sure why not <br>  i was wearing maternity clothes when i was 14 <br>  i think ur parents would weather u were that then maternity clothes|`|AA12005593	no, its not a big deal.<br>  it's just a bunny.|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes, its innapropriate for a teenage girl.<br>  <br>  Its very innapropriate for school.  The shirt would be fine if it didnt have the bunny symbol.. but the symbol represents sex and pornography.|`|4SV4bz69aa	its kinda slutty in a show-off way if you wear or use any playboy stuff in general, just saying.<br>  but its cute, wear it.<br>  :)|`|5z36WuS1aa	YES  THAT STANDS FOR NOTHING BUT HORRIBLE THINGS THAT THE DEVIL PUT IN THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UGH : (|`|mPTBU0QDaa	Yes, I think it is unacceptable. I mean, I understand that bunnies are cute and it's not really fair that Playboy ruined it for you, but you have to understand that everything you do sends a message, whether you like it or not.<br>  <br>  I used to think I could wear clothes as tight, short, and low cut as I wanted and it didn't matter. However, now that I am a bit older (in my 20's), I realize the effect it has on men... and not just on cute, young men - on nasty, perverted, old men, molesters, rapists, etc. You do NOT want to be turning on a gross 40-year-old or be the subject of his fantasies.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Yes I believe so. While the shirt is cute and I myself own playboy apperal you have to be carefull when you wear it, because there is an image that comes along with it. Its steryotypical but it comes with the symbol and when wearing it you are repersenting it, even if your only wearing it for a cute saying.<br>  <br>  I think there are times and klaces to wear stuff like that, but at 14 I wouldn't want a trashy image being portrayed. And I'm glad you realise that =]|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	Plenty of girls wore that crap when I was 14 (I'm almost 17).<br>  No one said it was "inappropriate", they all wore it to school.<br>  But everyone thought they were ...representatives...of the symbol.|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	well the shirt is k<br>  but like dont only wear playboy.<br>  cause you'll look like a playa. (x<br>  <br>  i love the shirt though x|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	lol<br>  i have a playboy necklace <br>  and a playboy shirt<br>  and i'm only 15|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	nah it's fine tons of people are having sex at 14 you just wanna wear a shirt with a bunny on it lol|`|H0sPCJQPaa	wear it <br>  Its not that horrible|`|9LTWa08Laa	my opinion? i think it's trashy when girls wear it<br>  like they're trying too hard to become "sexy"|`|7p9qgkSFaa	I like it but then again Hugh Hefner has made everyone think in the last fifty years that the sign of that bunny is pornography and nudity. So, I bet if anyone just saw someone your age wearing it they would immediately think of Playboy's nude spreads over the years. Unfortunately, that bunny symbol has now been given a sexy in a bad way reputation by Hugh Hefner and its reputation is too sexy for young girls.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Nothing wrong with it. It is just a symbol. However you would probably get a bunch of smart a** remarks sent your way, if you did.<br>    <br>  And your right about your parents going through the roof. Our society is really weird on the subject of sex. On the one had it is used to sell just about everything. On the other parents can't even talk to their children about it. <br>  <br>  Paranoid and multiple personality doesn't even begin to cover it.|`|cbEOXkugaa	I don't think its so bad. I mean, as long as it wasn't just because it was Playboy, I really don't see the big deal. It's just a little bunny on the side of a shirt.|`|7BYlUqobaa	i think its really cute in my opinion.<br>  thats good though you felt uncomfortable wearing it so you returned it.<br>  very smart.<br>  do what feels right.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. =]|`|I5akxBfhaa	hey, well i mean if thats wat u want people to see u as. i personally think it isnt tht bad, but ur school might be a little concerned because u r underage and they might think ur getting into playboy. just wear wat u want! :)|`|AusPef8Yaa	I think the playboy bunny if cute in sense you aren't wearing it for 'certain' purposes.|`|NEV1P783aa	I don't think it makes you look easy, but I probably wouldn't wear it if I were fourteen.|`|dMLLQruOaa	yah its innappropriate, and wouldnt create a good image for you. there are ways to be cute and sexy without wearing porn symbols|`|mNVipd2Maa	It's not that bad unless your school is strict|`|l9bNCR6maa	no|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	It depends on the type of clothing in my opinion. If the clothing is something like bras or underwear, then I would find that to be a little provocative, but of course that's just my opinion. I don't think there should be any saying on it, because at 14 you still may not know what that means and could end up getting unwanted attention. <br>  <br>  As for if it is just a bunny and not that noticeable (on a hat, socks, shirt, etc), I don't see the problem. I once knew a girl in the 1st grade who had a bunny on her hat. I can remember in 5th grade seeing girls with bunnies on their shirts. To be honest, at about 11, I had two pairs of bunny socks. I don't consider them to be unacceptable, because they don't look it and I think that they are fine.<br>  <br>  However, some people may have different views and stereotype you as a "slut" or "skank" or "whore", etc. Ask your parents for their opinions, and if you can send an anonymous email to your school regarding the dress code.<br>  <br>  If you are not comfortable with wearing it/unsure, for all means you're better off not. To many of this population, the bunny is sex or naughtiness, but it's up to you to decide and your opinion.
tzPEckiZaa	I like it. I think it's a beautiful name, and Eleanor works well with it. Madeline is an older name, but it doesn't bring to mind "old people." It is very beautiful.|`|HMPdnhApaa	I like Madeline but not Eleanor..|`|AA11329282	It is old fashioned, but nice. Something one would 'grow into' as they say.|`|TNytY4XBaa	there pretty <br>  but not sure if they flow just right together.|`|dNtnYBblaa	It's awesome! Old-fashioned, but cool! If you are pregnant and expecting a girl, name her that!|`|vbO4edaraa	Yes, I think its very pretty and to honor your mother as her middle name is wonderful. I was named after my 2 grandmothers who I love alot :o)|`|OQQMIaSraa	i'm very much for unique and uncommon... i like it alot!!|`|NlrkknVwaa	I like it, and old fashion names are pretty and unique.|`|eCViB3eYaa	: (|`|lxXOkc5Kaa	i love madeline but i'm not so fond of eleanor|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	great name|`|yw7AeZn2aa	love it - goos choice|`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	I really like Eleanor!  Madeline is kind of tired right now with the *addy fad.|`|9WovIk3maa	Aww i really like that name :):)
c6RGmMGjaa	I would let her get used to the day routine for at least six months before you start on the night time. Between the ages of 3 and 4 is usually the norm but every kid differs. Don't listen to what other people are doing, take absolutely no notice. The only way to start is to let them go pee before bed and hope for the best, you'll know when she's nearly ready if you start doing this but with her nappy still on, when it's been dry most mornings for over a week then it's time to take it away, if not then there's no rush, I think my son was fully dry at night by about 3 1/2.<br>  BTW my son's nearly 6 now and still has the occasional accident.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My oldest was fully day-trained by her 3rd birthday (mostly day-trained by 2 1/2), but she continued to soak a night diaper every single night up until a week before her 4th birthday.  Then, she suddenly declared that she wasn't wearing diapers to bed anymore.  We spent the next few months going back and forth between diapers and panties, having lots of wet beds (probably 3-4 per week at first and gradually decreasing).  I'd say she was fully night trained by a few months after her 4th birthday, but even then, we'd have the occasional night accident.  Heck, she's 5 1/2 now, and she had an accident just last week, but the one prior to that was probably 3-4 months ago.<br>  <br>  My younger daughter was fully potty trained by her 2nd birthday.  (Yes, I know I got lucky with her.  :-)  )  She's only 17 months younger than her sister, so when big sis decided she was wearing panties to bed, little sis (at age 2 1/2) decided she was, too.  She had actually had some dry diapers at night prior to that and had fewer wet beds afterward.  She just had a much easier time of it than her sister did.<br>  <br>  All kids are definitely different.  If your child starts consistently waking up dry or if she reaches a point where she wants to start wearing undies to bed, then you can work on night training.  Until then, just go with the diapers.|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	My son will be three in May and started waking up dry for an entire week so I got a water proof mattress cover and decided to let him wear his under-ware to bed. He is doing pretty good. I do not let him have anything to drink for three hours before bed. This yields the best results and having him potty right before bed. And expect some accidents. Do not punish them for having an accident. You may have to wake them up before you go to bed and let them potty again. Just see how she does and go from there. You may be surprised.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i have a 2 1/2 year old boy that is potty train too so YAY FOR US!!! i wouldn't push her into potty at night i think that's something you let them do on there own my son sometimes wakes up dry and he sometimes wakes up to go potty during the night. i have a friend that has a 4year old that still sometimes wets the bed so its no big deal yet.|`|AA11789493	Well, I think you two are doing great, GREAT!!!!!  Me, I'd put her in Goodnights because I can't take washing the bedding every day and I can't control my disappointment.  But you never know with girls--make sure her mattress is covered with a waterproof mattress pad, make sure she doesn't have much to drink a couple hours before bed (and no watermelon!! for dessert) and get her up to go potty just before you go to bed and see how it goes.  Whatever you do, do get upset with her is she doesn't make it through the night.  My boys we well over 3.  Best wishes!!|`|frpCK0utaa	it's different for every child. my friends little girl wasnt in underwear at night until age 3. and she still had accidents. usually because she waited til the last minute to go poop.<br>  <br>  Whereas my other friends little girl was trained at the same age, and almost never had an accident.|`|Uu9a1TtOaa	Of course every kid is different and some kids, even long after being potty trained, wet the bed. I definitely wouldn't worry about it at 2 and a half, though! Let her wear pull-ups or something at night, limit her drinks in the evening, encourage her to use the bathroom before you tuck her in... and give it some time.<br>  <br>  If bed wetting continues for several years, you should first eliminate any physical causes with your pediatrician. Also, sometimes the simplest solutions work. For example, my boyfriend wet the bed as a child until his grandmother said, "Just wake up when you have to go." From then on, he did!<br>  <br>   I would definitely try not to make a big deal out of it. Especially not yet.
Bqc86DRQaa	Keep your thoughts on staying healthy and not so much on the scale. If you are eating healthy foods and exercising, taking your prenatal vitamins, and all that stuff  then that's what counts.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	According to the weight charts the doctors gave me, the official amount of weight they recommend you gain depends on your BMI before you concieve.  If you are underweight, 30-40 lbs is considered safe.  I am in the normal range of BMI, so they recommend about 25 lbs weight gain for me (we'll see if I miss the mark, lol).  If your BMI classifies you as overweight, they recommend fewer than that.  Here's a website that explains it and lets you see where you fall: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/article.cfm/pregnancy_pounds" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...</a><br>  <br>  If you're eating healthy and exercising, I wouldn't worry too much.  You don't diet when you're pregnant, so just share your concern with your doctor but don't change anything unless he/she says so.  Congrats on your little one!|`|BIDy92Dwaa	I'd say if you are eating healthy and keeping your fluids up, its probably mostly fluid in your body, thats what happening to me apaprently (I'm a first tiem mum so I'm only going by what people are telling me lol).|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I wouldn't worry about it. I gained 42 pounds with my first pregnancy, and my doctors gave me a hard time about it, but I lost it all (plus another 5 pounds) within a few months. I had lost about 20 pounds by the time I went home from the hospital. The biggest concern with gaining "too much" weight is that it will make the baby bigger. But if it's healthy food you're eating, it shouldn't be an issue. Try not to stress about the weight... It takes the joy out of the pregnancy. This time, I've decided screw it! I gain what I gain! :)|`|nfLyS1toaa	i am 31 weeks and have gained 40 lbs. see it can always be worse. i am having a girl and i believe the stories about gaining all over with girls cause with my boys i gained 35 lbs the whole pregnancy. there is no reason to worry about it cause you cant do anything about the weight you have already gained until after the baby is born. you should probably loose 10-15 lbs by the time you leave the hospital.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	hahaha 27 lbs man i wish i could have just gained that much.. I'm 30 weeks and i've gained 70 lbs!! my doc said it was fine due to the fact that i was under 100lbs before i got preggers|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	everyone is different. your body will crave what it needs. i gained 65 lbs & had a 10lb baby. some women can do all they want but will still gain more than drs want them too. its ok. :)|`|9bPzzoIFaa	its just how your body is this time around, a lot of people try to make you feel bad, but a lot of women gain 30 or 40 pounds during pregnancy while trying not to gain that much, sometimes its just out of your hands, if your really worried about it, check out the best odds diet plan, it can be found in the book, what to expect when you are expecting, and u can probably google *best odds diet* and have it pop right up, it will let you know exactly what you should be eating in a day, but you are probably eating right anyway but the sound of it, it may be just out of your control, perhaps hormones have just changed your metabolism.|`|BnWf3f39aa	Are you naturally thin?  Thinner women tend to gain more weight with subsequent pregnancies.  I would say that as long as you're eating healthy, and exercising then try not to concentrate too much on the weight.  <br>  <br>  Also, are you bloated?  You may be retaining water.  See what happens if you cut back on sodium and drink more water.  Good Luck in your pregnancy!|`|AA11523560	Talk to your Doctor, your main concern is your health and the health of your baby.  Stay away from all junk food, non-nutritious snacks, soda's, fast food and fried food..  Let your plate be half vegetables, 1/4 protein and 1/4 starches.|`|qBEt621jaa	That's not a horrible weight gain.  You will most likely lose the first 25 or so pretty easily after birth.  The rest will take more work.|`|fDi3gaDdaa	I don't really know..but you shouldn't be asking on the internet. Go see your doctor or something.|`|cic4J2hzaa	its okay...your prolly havin a boy this time...they tend to do that too ya... :)
xVTIjYreaa	HI, I just want to give you and your husband a glimmer of hope.....I am married to a man that has only one sibling, a brother...his brother has 3 boys, and our first 2 were boys, however our last child was a GIRL!!  Finally!! <<at least that's what my mother in law says....lol.<br>  It is possible for your new addition to be a boy.<br>  Best wishes!!|`|CVtmd0h3aa	I have three boys!  I would like to have a girl someday.  Good luck!  Keep us posted when you find out!<br>  <br>  BTW- My husbands family now has 10 grandsons and NO granddaughters!  LOL!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I am pg with #4.. all 3 are girls.. I don't know what this is. I reccomend waiting to find out this time.. that way... if it is a girl, you won't be so upset because you JUST got done with labor and are happy to see yoru baby and be over labor.

I doubt i will try again, i might adopt a boy if i have a very strong desire for a boy.<br>  <br>  I am grateful i can conceive, some people cannot even have a child talk less of dictating what sex of baby they want.|`|kyqhMuSiaa	I have three boys. The sonographer I had told me that it was highly likely that the more you have of 1 gender the more likely you are to have more of the same In saying that though my sister has 2 girls then her boy and another boy on the way.<br>  It all depends on when you conceive. If you have sex before ovulation they say it's a girl. Who knows. Good luck for a boy.|`|OUwyHduraa	Well, my parents had two daughters (me included) and then their third and last child was a boy. <br>  Me and my sister were "unexpected blessings" but my dad wanted a boy so they tried again, and they got a boy.<br>  Eh...it's a matter of chance. Although I've heard of some strange things that can influence what the gender of your child might be...but i'm not sure, so you might want to check into that.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, btw! :-)|`|64OsCr8laa	sorry i know you dont wanna hear this but with my mom it was 3 girls she really wanted a boy to<br>  <br>  good luck i hope it works for you.. i do know people with 2 girls and 1 boy though

Can I be pregnant if I never had sex before? grrr Its like duhhhh|`|AA11724307	The "Do you think I'm pregnant?" or "How soon can I test?"  Nobody knows if you are pregnant...take a test if you think you are and nobody knows how soon you will test positive if you are pregnant as its different for everyone.  When I come to the pregnancy section I like to read and answer questions about pregnancy...like problems or symptoms or doctor questions...stuff that I can relate to or might experience...not the " yesterday I sneezed 3 times in a row and usually I one sneeze 2 times....could I be pregnant?"|`|ux6j2OIeaa	About 87% of the questions are... <br>  <br>  Can't say too much, i got reported for telling someone to go to sex ed for idiots, i tried to appeal but was told i was in breach of the code!  So now i try not to get on here unless i'm totally bored and have nothing better to do.  It is so frustrating especially when there are 15 questionss in a row asking if i'm pregnant and all the answers are the same.  Maybe yahoo should inform these people of the "Search for questions" application.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for the rant but i used to get on here to help people and now it seems to be mainly 12 y/o with nothing better to do than waste peoples time.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	"Am I pregnant (without taking a HPT)"-honestly how are WE suposed to know.<br>  "I'm 13 and pregnant help!" -seriously I'm sick of trolls on here.<br>  "Am I in labor?"

xK5lWU3qaa	No, no, no. 7 is definitely not too young to have a child-guided discussion about sex! However, please consider skipping the boring and awkward books.<br>  <br>  A child-guided discussion begins with you asking her questions about what she already knows, and gently approaching her about what else she might be interested in knowing. I wouldn't handle it as a full "birds and the bees" conversation though, which is awkward and easily forgotten with time.<br>  <br>  Instead, I would handle it as an introduction to the "it's OK to talk about sex now" era. This will allow you to have several short conversations that are based on what she is ready to discuss. You simply foster an environment where it is OK for her to ask questions of you, and expect to get honest answers from you consistently.<br>  <br>  Open communication about sex on an ongoing basis is much more effective than one awkward conversation about how "mommy and daddy hug real close and a baby is born 9 months later".  You will probably find that if you start now, the progression will look something like this:<br>  <br>  7 years old: She knows the basics. Babies come from sex, and sex should happen when two people are committed and in love (or married, or whatever supports your morals beliefs). She also knows all about boobs and periods and what those tampons under the sink are actually for.<br>  <br>  8 years old: She may ask you for more details about what will happen when she starts to get boobs or her period. She may get curious about deodorant and shaving and bras too.<br>  <br>  9 years old: Questions about birth control were pretty common with my kids during this time. I adjusted our conversation content accordingly. I also began discussing unplanned pregnancies, HIV, and other STDs around this time. Completely candid, but not alarmist style.<br>  <br>  By 10 years old, your daugher should be a well-informed person already because the school will start taking with kids about sex by then. I really wanted to share my views with my children before the school did. I don't regret my decision for a second.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	No it is not.  Teach her, before her friends teach her incorrectly.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you tell them in an age appropriate manner when ever they begin to ask..its basic human knowledge eggs sperm ..birth, lactation ..even cats are doing it|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I do not think it is too young.   Mine actually asked me questions about sex at 5, I was horrified.  She had heard other kids at daycare talking about it, and wanted to know.  I paniced and got these from Amazon.com.<br>  <br>  Book:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Did-Come-Peter-Mayle/dp/0818402539/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236666251&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Where-Did-Come-Pet...</a><br>  <br>  DVD:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Did-Come-Howie-Mandel/dp/B000BITVGU/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1236666251&sr=8-11" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Where-Did-Come-How...</a><br>  <br>  I'll be honest they were too much in detail.  I got embarrassed reading the book, and actually hid the movie (after watching it), until she is older, because you can sorta "edit" the book in your own way, but not the movie.<br>  <br>    But now that I think about it, I think I'm happy it covered all the basics.  She's almost 7, very informed but not ashamed to talk to us about sex.  (If she sees or hears about it on TV or at school).  This makes me feel better, hopefully when she is older I can elaborate on the subject with condoms & birth control and she won't look at me like a freak because she's already been able to talk freely about it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	it is ABSOLUTELY NOT to young to begin the open dialogue. I think sometimes parents think talking to kids about sex is something that happens once or twice. It takes years of talking to get our kids to fully understand all they must. Brain based research tells us that we must give kids messages about things like sex, drugs etc, 5 years ahead of when they will really make the decision because when they are in the process of making the decision, they are not receptive to your ideals and beliefs. I applaud you for seeing the needs of your child and being receptive. As for the book..I have no idea.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	I think that is really too young. If you feel it is important, you could give her the PG run down... basically let her know there is something adults (married, if that is the value you wish to install into your daughter) do that make babies. That way it opens the door. If she hears something at school, she can talk to you...but she doesn't need to know everything at 7. Try about 10.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	It's up to you not Y!A.|`|GU3RauKOaa	That is NOT too young. If she is inquisitive she NEEDS to know. Would you prefer she ask some kid at school who came across Daddy's porno stash and get all kinds of gross and horrible information?<br>  <br>  Not to mention the fact that a lot of girl's these days start their period as early as 8 or 9 years old. She needs to understand before blood starts coming out of her.<br>  <br>  You don't need to tell her all of the nasty details but she needs to understand that humans and other animals reproduce by a process called sex which involves a male and female private parts. The woman has an egg inside that gets fertilized by the man's little things called sperm and the it grows into a baby. Every month if the egg isn't fertilized the body throws it away through the vagina and a little bit of blood comes with it. That's really all she needs to know at 7 years old. Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW - I remember kids in school talking about sex as early as 4th grade so don't think if you conceal it she won't hear about it, because she probably has already. I also knew kids in school who had experimented sexually around 11 years old so the sooner she knows the FACTS the better.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	I think its good to introduce children to SOME concepts of sex early on.  Its not just so they know, but so they can protect themselves if someone is being innapropriate with them.  It will teach them the appropriate names for body parts and let them know what is okay for someone to do and what is NOT okay.  A basic children's book on the subject will be a good way to start, so they know the basics of conception, but don't get overly complicated.  As they get older the conversation you have with them should match their maturity.<br>  <br>  Its happened where kids have tried to report innapropriate behavior of somebody, but because they didn't know the proper names for the body parts it was misinterpreted by the adults they were telling as a harmless game.  <br>  <br>  I did a quick search on amazon.com and found quite a few books on the topic.  Since they have reviews it would be a good resource to decide on a book you'd like to use.|`|6f2c903eae4fc8a81f741a6b9dc5f770aa	no.  don't go into every detail.  it's never to early for sex education.  <br>  my one advice ask her not to tell other kids.  some parents just don't "get it" and be come offended.  my 8 yrs old told one of her little friends that she did know how babies were made.  well the mom was upset and questioning me.  the only thing i could reply was, "did she give the correct answer?"  the mom was  mad because it was and she felt the material was wrong for young children to know.  seriously just when are young kids suppose to find out about sex.  it's something that doesn't jump out from the closet and yells surprise!  If YOU feel you daughter ready then find age appropriated material for you and her.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	I haven't read that book, but here is another good book to explain "where babies come from" to a younger child. At 7 you don't really need to explain in details or anything. Right now all that would be appropriate is "Mommy's have eggs, an Daddy's have sperm, and when they get married they can put the egg and sperm together and that makes a baby" Also, you should discuss what parts of her body are private and to never let anyone touch. (But by 7 most kids already know about that)<br>  <br>  Here's some good books:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671783440?tag=siecus&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0671783440&adid=1FQK0CTCTVKV8SAVHJ67&" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671783440?tag=...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316109150?tag=siecus&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0316109150&adid=1YQT1EXTKQ3Q7GMZF2WA&" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316109150?tag=...</a>|`|0gChS7z8aa	it depends. do you think she's mature enough. do you think she will be grossed out by it and have nightmares for like a week. i dont think any age is too young. if she's exposed to it at school and she's already hearing about it, you might as well just tell her about it.|`|XjAJM73zaa	Talk to her now. Have you heard about that 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy that just had a baby together. If their parents have talked to them maybe that wouldn't have happened.|`|DkVofG9paa	ya think?|`|SxPhldhhaa	No, I really don't think it's too young at all. I say this only because soon she'll be hearing about sex from her friends - or what they think is sex - and it's better for her to know it from you than from them. I wouldn't be surprised if one of her friends starts talking about what they think sex is within the next few months.<br>  <br>  Of course, I'm not saying that you need to give her all of the details about sex, but I don't think that a brief overview of what sex is and where babies come from would be too much for her. She should be satisfied with that for now.<br>  <br>  Also, just as a warning, you won't really be able to keep the information from her for long. As I mentioned above, her friends will be talking about it soon, and besides, her period could be starting soon and it would probably freak her out if she didn't already know. Besides, you don't want her to be sexually harrassed without her even knowing what's happening. And I remember being taught about sex in a sexual education class when I was 9, so it's coming!<br>  <br>  And finally, I just want to point out that if you're willing to talk to her about this at her level, she'll trust you more to talk about uncomfortable topics (even if not sex-related) in the future if she knows she can count on you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9ehfz3Gzaa	The earlier she knows the basics, the safer she is... how is she to know if someone out there is touching her inappropriately if she doesnt know what is what? You don't need to get into the gory details but it's a good idea to tell her the correct names of body parts etc, if you haven't already. My parents used the Where Did I Come From book to help educate us and it was great, not too graphic/detailed or frightening but accurate and easy to understand.|`|AAlB49iraa	explain things in a very broad way. don't go into much detail. less is more here. 7 is very little. way too young in my oppinion. but you are right you shouldnt ignore her questions. sometimes they are satisfied with short answers. and "we'll talk more about it later" if she's in public school she'll hear all about it anyway soon enough. probobly already has hence the questions. i'm all for keeping them innocent as long as possible.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Yes, my kids and i had that book years ago.  but i did not introduce it to them at 7 years old.. i think they were 10 or so.<br>  <br>  I believe it's a good idea to give kids the right information about sex, but at seven years old?  If she is asking questions, give her short, but truthful answerrs .  .... how are babies made, Mom?  answer:  you have to have a mom and dad.<br>  <br>  sometimes kids will just accept these short answers and then go on their merry way.  if she is insistant then let her see the book, but maybe she could be innocent for a while longer.|`|77CjF9tkaa	No age is too young to talk about it. Of course not giving children vivid in depth information is good but talking about it opens the doors for later. She needs to know that she can talk to you!|`|UyUZ5SiGaa	I would wait a few years. Maybe kind of let her know about it now if you REALLY want, but i would talk to her about it no youngerr than 10 or 11. IF that.|`|FNVbetnqaa	I dont really think she needs to know at 7 unless she is persistant and actually want to know things like where babies come from or something but she doesn't need details or anything like that.<br>  <br>  i think you should wait a few more years|`|GYsWOb5faa	If she is getting inquisitive, then I think you should talk to her.  If you don't she'll just find out some other way.  It might be awkward, but just do your best.|`|JnosRXlGaa	i would wait till roughly 11-12 yrs old but if your daughter is smart enough to understand this kind of thing then i would say go ahead...the more you know the better in my opinion|`|8H97U1qDaa	yes and no<br>  <br>  you have to choose<br>  <br>   to tell her so she wont be asking anybody else<br>  <br>  or let her find out sooner or later but with the wrong information?|`|bYVsQKVZaa	my cousin knows and shes 9 so i would wait

OLW0Irbhaa	Just take what you've got. No reason to buy anything else.  The airline personal will stow the stroller for you when you reach the door of the plane.  They will take it and put it below with the luggage.  You guys won't have to do anything but fold it up.  And when you get off the plane they'll have it for you.<br>  <br>  No way would I depend on carrying my child the whole time (and I am a devout sling user!) especially while pregnant or depend on him at 18 months to walk for more than just a few, few minutes.  I would bring the Ergo but you def. need the stroller.|`|AA10097817	There will be all kinds of comments for this, but I have a reason. My son was almost stolen from me, in his stroller. Keep your baby attached to you with a tether, like a leash. We were in an airport. He was in his stroller. Right next to me. I was talking to people at the counter. My son cried and I looked to see a woman trying to pull him out of his stroller while she was telling everyone watching she was his grandmother, waving at me like she was trying to calm me down. I smacked her with my hand and she ran. This was in a USA airport. Yes, you will need a stroller. But use a leash, too.|`|AA11789493	You are going to need something to move the baby.  We got this "crazy" folding seat on the internet that can be attached to a carry-on pieces of luggage with wheels that we used in the airports and we rented strollers where we could.  I think you should invest in a small, but safe stroller with a canopy.  You will be exhausted if you try to carry the child and you will be able to use a new stroller for the new baby as well.|`|AA12033653	I would say yes you need a stroller, especially if you are planning on spending a lot of time sight seeing.  <br>  <br>  Call the hotel that you are staying at and see if they know of a service that rents baby gear.  Here in Kansas City, the Hotel that I work at has some fliers from a local service like this.  They rent everything from strollers and car seats to cribs.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Yup just get an umbrella stroller.<br>  I bought one at babies r us and it has a Little hood on the top...mesh net that hangs from back for a little bit of storage and I bought a hook on snack tray.  It was only like $20 and It's VERY light weight and little.|`|dPmK83UYaa	Why not try an umbrella stroller, they are so much easier. You can find like a travel thing to strap to it too. I hate traveling w/ too much it's too difficult and leaves me in a sweat. The umbrella strollers are awesome because they are so small. Only like 10-15 dollars depending if you go to a consignment store or like walmart. I really recommend it! Find a good one w/ high handles so you don't have to bend over to push it. Also, a good small pillow or neck pillow for when they fall asleep, which in an umbrella stroller is cool b/c u can just tip it back on two wheels to lay them back. Good qualities of an umbrella stroller:<br>  <br>  High Handles<br>  Good Sun Shade or one you can drape a blankie over well enough<br>  any extra pockets<br>  maybe a tray for snacks or a cupholder? (optional)<br>  <br>  Best one I've seen out there is the Mclaren Volvo Umbrella Stroller.|`|t6jYdWJkaa	an inexpensive light stroller would be a great investment, especially as you are having another child who will use it in the future. You can get ones now that fold up and take very little space. Especially on long trips your little one will get tired easily and sleep in the stroller. An 18 mth old is too heavy to carry for very long. We used one when we went to New Zealand and it was a god send! Have a great trip!|`|BjEr7FGUaa	Id recommend bringing a stroller, if yours is too big try a resale shop, you can get a decent one for a good price.|`|02xxwMRBaa	you need an umbrella stroller for a trip like that. it weighs very little and its a stroller, lol. not to mention its very inexpensive.

If the man doesn't have a job and he isn't getting a pay check that is garnished.. then you dont get any money! Yeah they will suspend his license, freeze accounts, put him on bad credit, and even throw him in jail, but if he is not sending in any money...then you aren't going to get any! I live in PA too and know these things! They will take money out from unemployment, but not from thin air!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I would go to court and get MORE ..25 a week wont keep a kid in boxed mac & cheese for 3 meals a day for a week never mind all the other needs|`|HGqmsaM5aa	I wouldn't do it! thats not enough to raise a child and it your choice how you spend the money on your child!|`|fHjSonssaa	Yes I would agree to it- and he can't question every purchase if it's for the child.  I am mean he can, but he's be an idiot to do that.<br>  <br>  The reason I would agree with it:<br>  <br>  my boyfriend currently pays court ordered child support.  The state finds ways to take part of this child support- they also have control over part of it.  It's processed completely through the courts/state- and his ex is always complaining that the $ isn't coming....and whenever there is a problem, you have to go through the state to solve it.<br>  <br>  Therefore- if you have an ex that will actually follow through with his word- and you are happy with the agreement, then agree to it.  Have him sign a written statement that states what his intentions are.  Even if you don't have him sign anything, you have nothing to lose to try it out.  If he breaks his word, you can always file for child support later and he has to pay the arrears.  <br>  I don't know if your child is arleady born- or not yet, but $25/week is not very much money these days to raise a child, so you might want to think about asking for a little more.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	no way i'm a full time step mum two 2 kids when we get there mum child support money it up to us what it go's on<br>  for example my step girl needed ballet stuff so i got her it but that left me short for milk for my baby so some of the the child support when on that as it ant all black and white in the real world|`|qJBMdL7gaa	I would go strictly through Domestic Relations. That way, the child support always gets paid. And $5-$25 is not that much. If you go through the court-you will get more than that. I am not sure about other states, but here in Pennsylvania where I live-you get $ even if the person paying it doesn't have a job! I would only do it if you know that the person is trustworthy enough and if you are comfortable doing it that way!<br>  <br>  Amber-I am not sure if it is different in certain areas, but here if the person paying it doesn't have a job, they still have to pay $50 a month. I know from experience. It's the law-if they are ABLE to work, they have to pay regardless of if they have a job or not. They only way this doesn't go into effect is if the person is disabled or whatever and isn't able to work.
wRHhpanmaa	Oh my gost all the things I love about my husband...... I could write a million...<br>  <br>  1)He knows how to make me laugh and smile, even when i want to be mad at him, so it is impossible, therefore we never fight.<br>  2) He spoils me rotten<br>  3) although we are married, he hasn't lost his romantic touch, he still hugs me from behind, loves for me to hold him, he holds me, he strokes my hair etc.<br>  4. When I am tired and not feeling well, my husband does the dishes, washes clothes, and cleans the house<br>  5) even though he can't cook, he tries anyways<br>  6) he gave me my son<br>  7) He is not afraid to fight for what he wants/believes in. He fought his parents to make me his wife, and he fights for our country.<br>  8) He gives in to my every whim and tells me money doesnt matter, he just loves to see me smile (ex. my dad is going back to college, and I wanted to do something special, so my husband went out and bought him a brand new laptop. I was so happy!)<br>  9) He buys me roses, and pays attention when I talk. He bought me a vase filled with red skittles and red and blue jolly ranchers, and stuck a dozen roses in them<br>  10)He gave me our son<br>  11)He has confidence... he may not be great looking to everyone else, but he has a good heart, and he has lots of confidence.<br>  12) He supports me no matter what i want to do... I have changed my major four different times, and each time he has stood by me...<br>  13) he loves me.... I was a wild teen who had no intention of settling down, and somehow he made me want to be a better person. He just loves me so much, and sometimes I just dont know why.It may sound simple, but loving someone more than yourself is a hard thing to do<br>  14) He always tells me he loves me, and isnt afraid to show it.

Qhyovyj8aa	I agree with Geo. Personality is everything. She could be a beauty queen but if she's got a crappy personality, I won't find her attractive.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Not many girls have the "perfect" body. I don't believe there is such thing as the perfect body. That's not what I look for in a girl.|`|46IOQ2QGaa	Personality has ALOT to do. If she's annoying, arrogant, rude and ect. and yet she's pretty than yeah. Answer number 4 is WRONG.|`|ZDB9Jermaa	The way she treats people around her. Guys don't like bitchy women and no matter how good looking some of them are,if they are nasty, rude and always trying to humiliate others men will see them for how ugly they truly are.If they are friendly and give people a decent amount of respect girls shine.<br>  <br>  You asked for pretty not atractive. Girls with flat stomachs and big boobs are the ones we would like to fool around with, not because we think they're pretty but because we're horny. A pretty girl isn't necessarily atractive but they are they kind of people we will stick around with and care about their opinions/ideas/emotions.If you're too introverted it will be hard for teenaged men to see if you are pretty or not.If you say a few friendly words they will notice you but yeah,men will not investigate you or guess.<br>  <br>  Pretty and attractive are different in my dictionary. Attractive are the people you look at as soon as they enter a room. Those girls with a ton of makeup,big boobs thay like to dress like porn stars.We are attracted to those women because we think they're easy and they,generally speaking are. Being pretty is different.A pretty girl is hard to notice at first because men usually think about making out before we think of anything else, at least me and my friends do.Regardless, if a girl is friendly to us and they have good feelings, they make us laugh or can carry a conversation we will stop thinking about your underwear for a minute and see that you are a pretty girl.Pretty can be an average looking girl who adorns herself with a smile and has good feelings.<br>  <br>  ...well, if you already know what men want why are you asking? we can be dense about some things but how can we tell your personality or your qualities if you're always quiet and thinking that we won't care because you don't have boobs?we are not mind readers and we are in puberty.All I can say is better luck in college when hormones aren't the only factor,then may be men appreciate the quiet and reserved types,some might at least.<br>  <br>  Hey, some guys are jackasses. I do feel bad for nice girls whose feelings get hurt but if you're determined to stay the way you are more power to you, the more unique you are the harder it will be to find someone who is not average.So its up to you, settle for the guy next door and don't be lonely, or stay alone until you meet someone who is more like you. and don't think we're all the same because girls also freak out when we say all women are cazy, moody and pmsing. Bye now.|`|nhRSjWhpaa	Well.. I think many attractive girls need to realize that if they are attractive, that is only an asset. The personality is the important part, so  don't go around being a jerk when you are "hot." There is a girl in my school that is exactly like me, but she is not all that attractive. I think she is attractive because of what she is like on the inside. Edit: The guys at your school must grow up then, they must realize that those girls are most likely fake. Those girls will be prostitutes and you <br>  will be successful as long as you do not worry about it. You <br>  will find the right one. Just remember that you are not alone!<br>  Edit 2: You say you donot talk. Just think of yourself ten years from now, regretting. If people think you are a snob because you do not talk, then the only way to fix the problem is to talk! I used to be afraid to talk, but I got over my fear and realized I only have one chance, and now the popular people like me even though I hang out with "nerds" and "geeks."|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Guys don't always look for blue-eyed, blonde hair girls!

He is also probably not eating that whole time, just lying there close to mommy.<br>  <br>  When he is feeding, if he is starting to slow down of drift off, sing to him or rock him back and forth so he falls asleep, and you can put him in his crib.|`|AA11056379	his hunger has nothing to do with your hunger.<br>  <br>  Your baby is growing fast..you have a big boy..whose body demands more food....but..if you find your son feeding for over 2 hours, or seems not to be satisfied after feeding..you might want to check to make sure your flow of milk is good. My son went thru frantic phrases of eating, and it was found my flow was very slow.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That's called cluster feeding, its exceedingly common in the evenings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fussy-evening.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/fus...</a><br>   Cluster feeding, also called bunch feeding, is when babies space feeding closer together at certain times of the day and go longer between feedings at other times. This is very common, and often occurs in the evenings. It's often -but not always- followed by a longer sleep period than usual: baby may be "tanking up" before a long sleep. For example, your baby may nurse every hour (or even constantly) between 6 and 10 PM, then have a longish stretch of sleep at night - baby may even sleep all night.<br>  <br>  Cluster feeding often coincides with your baby's fussy time. Baby will nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry, nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry... on and on... for hours. This can be VERY frustrating, and mom starts wondering if baby is getting enough milk, if something she is eating is bothering baby, if EVERYTHING she is doing is bothering baby... It can really ruin your confidence, particularly if there is someone else around asking the same questions (your mother, your husband, your mother-in-law).<br>  <br>  This behavior is NORMAL!    It has nothing to do with your breastmilk or your mothering. If baby is happy the rest of the day, and baby doesn't seem to be in pain (as with colic) during the fussy time - just keep trying to soothe your baby and don't beat yourself up about the cause. Let baby nurse as long and as often as he will. Recruit dad (or another helper) to bring you food/drink and fetch things (book/remote/phone/etc.) while you are nursing and holding baby.<br>  Does this mean that baby needs more milk than I can provide?<br>  <br>  No. Don't give baby a bottle -- supplementation will only tell your body that you need LESS milk at this time, and that will not help matters. Also, keep in mind that formula fed babies experience fussy periods in the evening, too -- fussy evenings are common for all young babies, no matter how they are fed. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine spells this out in their supplementary feeding guidelines:<br>  <br>      There are common clinical situations where evaluation and breastfeeding management may be necessary, but supplementation is NOT INDICATED including... The infant who is fussy at night or constantly feeding for several hours.<br>  <br>  Why do babies fuss in the evening?<br>  <br>  One frequently-heard explanation for baby's fussiness in the evenings is that milk volume tends to be lower in the evening due to the natural cycling of hormones throughout the day. However, Dr. Peter Hartmann, a breastfeeding researcher, has said that in the women he has studied, milk volume is not low at this time of day. Even if milk volume is lower in the evening, fat content is typically higher in the evening (particularly if baby is allowed to control this via cue feeding), so the amount of calories that baby is getting should not be significantly different. Milk flow can be slower in the evening, which may be frustrating for some babies. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200...</a><br>  2. How babies enter sleep. You're rocking, walking, or nursing your baby and her eyelids droop as she begins to nod off in your arms. Her eyes close completely, but her eyelids continue to flutter and her breathing is still irregular. Her hands and limbs are flexed, and she may startle, twitch, and show fleeting smiles, called "sleep grins." She may even continue a flutter-like sucking. Just as you bend over to deposit your "sleeping" baby in her crib so you can creep quietly away, she awakens and cries. That's because she wasn't fully asleep. She was still in the state of light sleep when you put her down. Now try your proven bedtime ritual again, but continue this ritual longer (about twenty more minutes). You will notice that baby's grimaces and twitches stop; her breathing becomes more regular and shallow, her muscles completely relax. Her fisted hands unfold and her arms and limbs dangle weightlessly. Martha and I call this "limp-limb"  sign of deep sleep. Baby is now in a deeper sleep, allowing you to put her down and sneak away, breathing a satisfying sigh of relief that baby is finally resting comfortably. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/comfortnursing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...</a><br>  "You are not a pacifier; you are a Mom. You are the sun, the moon, the earth, you are liquid love, you are warmth, you are security, you are comfort in the very deepest aspect of the meaning of comfort.... but you are not a pacifier!" -- Paula Yount<br>  <br>  <br>  ========<br>  The Human Pacifier<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBJanFeb02p14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBJanFeb02p14.htm...</a><br>  <br>  ====<br>  <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/touchhgr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/t...</a><br>  Touch Hunger<br>  <br>  Linda J. Smith, BSE, FACCE, IBCLC<br>  <br>  Some babies have very high "touch hunger." Ashley Montagu describes the first 9-12 months postbirth as the time of "external gestation." I've experienced a child with a very high need for touch - who literally cannot or do not sleep unless they are touching another human body. You can either (1) cope with it, (2) rejoice in your ability to meet this child's unique needs, or (3) resent the situation and fight it. #3 is the worst choice for the baby, of course. In most of the world, continuous contact is the norm. Expecting otherwise is actually quite unrealistic, but a problem nevertheless where velcro babies are not the "cultural norm."<br>  <br>  When I was a young mother, a wise La Leche League Leader in my area suggested I make the best of my high-touch-need baby and master the fine art of baby-wearing. (Thanks, Peggy Loyd.) Years later, I'm convinced that this type of child is probably very allergic and/or very intelligent. Mine was both. She attended a "magnet" school for gifted children in late elementary school. I met dozens of parents of very bright kids who described similar patterns in their babies. Does the smart child insist on all the skin contact they need to thrive? Or does the high-need child demand a lot of contact, which pushes their intelligence to extra-high levels?<br>  <br>  I think I see this more often in girls than boys. I also see an exceptionally high need for oral and physical experiences in these children - years of breastfeeding, nursing all night, chewing on buttons and clothing, etc.<br>  <br>  Touch your baby a LOT. It matters a lot.<br>  <br>  ==========<br>  Lactation consultant Diane Wiessinger of Ithaca, New York, agrees. “I once led a meeting where I told the mothers — all experienced breastfeeding mothers — that we were going to write the real baby book, one that told new mothers what they needed to know,” she recalls. “One woman said, ‘New mothers need to know that newborns will nurse every hour.’ Another mother spoke up and said, ‘Yeah, and the feedings will last an hour.’ Everyone laughed, and I think that laughter meant that this is a common experience. Babies don’t really nurse all the time, but it can sure feel that way — especially at first.” <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>   Wiessinger believes that counting and timing feedings may only make a nursing mother feel more stressed about what she thinks she needs to accomplish during the day. The reality, however, might actually be quite different since, as Wiessinger points out, frequent feedings tend to be short and easy to fit around other activities.<br>  <br>  Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler from Texas A&M University says that nursing a lot is typical of babies around the world. She cites a study done in 2000 that looked at the feeding behaviour of infants aged three to four months in three different communities: families from Washington, DC, the Ba’Aka hunter-gatherers and the Ngandu farmers, both of the Central African Republic. They found that the Ba’Aka babies nursed 4.02 times per hour, the Ngandu babies nursed 2.01 times per hour and the American babies nursed 1.6 times per hour. Certainly the American babies nursed less often than the two African groups, but they nursed more frequently than many new parents expect.<br>  <br>  Wiessinger reminds parents that babies are growing faster in the first year than they will at any other time in their lives, and asks, “How often would you eat if you were trying to double your weight in less than six months?” She adds that breastfeeding is more than a way of getting food into the baby. “A baby doesn’t necessarily nurse to eat,” she explains. “Breastfeeding offers so many other wonderful things — skin-to-skin contact, warmth, the reassuring sounds and smells of mom, suckling — the milk is just a bonus.”|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	No your hunger has nothing to do with his hunger. He not only is helping you make a good supply but it also very comforting for him. And he is very young and could be getting a growth spurt too. This is normal for his age. Keep up the great work! Congrats on your sweet new baby boy.|`|WT56iKwZaa	He likes to be snuggled . newborns also have a routing and sucking reflex. If you put something against their cheek they will root for it and suck when something is in their mouth. Your baby may like a pacifier to suck on.|`|z6IekuwSaa	It'll get better. The more he nurses the more effecient he'll get. And he also may just be comfort sucking, which will help with your supply. Good Luck hun, hang in there|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yep my son is 8 days old and did the same thing tonight.  I think he is using me as a pacifier.|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Its ok my mom says I had sucked on hers for about 4 hours sometimes|`|KYkoPHpsaa	hes still so young, maybe ur milk hasnt fully come in yet|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i doubt it- sounds like it's for comfort which is fine. it's good for your milk supply. babies don't just nurse for food they nurse for comfort too just like a pacifier. totally normal, doesn't last forever though|`|yB5go5wbaa	mine did this too.  he would feed for an hour or two at a time - and around 2 to 3 weeks, he'd feed for 45 minutes and then scream and cry 20 minutes later and the only thing that would calm him down would be nursing.  I wondered how he could possibly be hungry.  it does help build your supply and make your milk come in faster so that he can be more efficient later on - now that he's a month old, he usually nurses about 20 minutes and goes 2 to 3 hours between feedings all day long.<br>  <br>  it helps if you don't plan on doing anything but being there for when your baby wants to nurse.  make sure you've got everything you need near you (food, tv remote, computer, water, etc.) and just plan on nursing for as long as he wants to.  this also helps you heal from the birth too.  I wouldn't have chosen to be confined to the couch for 3 weeks, but since I was, I feel better now than I probably would otherwise.<br>  <br>  congrats on your baby and for breast feeding!  it gets much easier.

HNCD3TJtaa	My daughter is 1 year old today and frankly I let her use it whenever she needs it. She's got 4 teeth coming in on top, and a molar on the bottom. She will not accept teething rings, frozen washcloths, or anything cold in her mouth and believe me we've tried. She rarely puts toys in her mouth.... the only other thing she will put in her mouth occasionally is her fist or the washcloth when we are cleaning her off after a meal. We do try not to have it in all the time, but she's still a baby and at some point, she won't need it anymore.|`|NuIFsjA0aa	I have a one year old son whom I just stopping using them when we went out of the house then only at night and naps..so now just at night and when we wake in the morning and he has it as I am lifting him out of his crib I say bought paci to bed..  omgoodness its so cute he takes it out and drops it in and we say nite nite.. he just started saying nite nite.. its night time use only and he gets.. try it..  just house...then..nap n  night and then night..   with new foods no more formula..  new cribs etc..  i just wanted him at night to have alittle secure feeling and he does and hopfully by summer we will be done!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JCsnDu47aa	My cousin is 2 and is breaking from her pacifier.

But if you dont want to do that, dont give it to her for long periods of time. <br>  cos if its in her mouth for 2 hours thats to long to try and wean off it.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter dropped the pacifier habit for good at about 8 months. Leading up to that we were giving it to her less and less and she was wanting it less and less.|`|kjgonYlgaa	My daughter started walking at 13 months.  With that, everything changed.  She got pull ups and a potty, a big girl bed, a sippy cup instead of her bottle and lost her pacifier.  She was soooo addicted to it, we had about 5 of them.  We stopped using them when we were out of the house first, then I got rid of them all, but the one she kept on her window ledge she had it alone for a couple days but then one day I took it and replaced it with a small stuffed squirrel.  When she went to bed that night she went to reach for it and saw the toy.  She was confused and asked where suss was. I told her it must have fallen out of her window and a mommy bird took it for her babies.  (She was in love with the nest of birds at her grandma's house).  I picked up the toy and asked her if she would like to sleep with it instead and she took it.  I had to tell her stories of the baby birds with the suss for many days, but she never once asked to get another one.  I was so amazed.  I thought it would be so hard for her, but it wasn't.  When she had it she would wake up several times a night screaming for me to find it.  I had to wake up and crawl under her crib in the middle of the night.  My new little one wouldn't take a pacifier so I never pushed it.  I'm so glad that I didn't.  once she's asleep there's no waking her for the world, life is so much better without it.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I only had 1 out of 3 be a binky baby.  I never let  her have it walking around or playing.  She was allowed it for TV time, naps, in the car, and then bed.  Then I stopped allowing it at TV time.  Then we tried giving it to the 'binky fairy' but that only got rid of the one in the car.  <br>  <br>  Truth be told, she had it until she was 3 1/2 years old.  No lie.  But it was strictly at bedtime and she had to leave it in her bed.  I really didn't worry abut it too much  - she was a much more sensitive child and really needed the comforting.   When she was 3 1/2 she was trying to talk me into allowing her to chew gum (our house rule is age 4) So we worked out a deal that she would 'give' her binky to the neighbor who just had a new baby and then she'd be able to chew gum.  Worked like a charm and she never threw a fit for it.  But she does still think about it - every once in a while she says, I wish I could have my binky back.  She is 5 now.  It kind of breaks my heart a little that she longs for that comfort still.|`|68cc82283542fb9e45877505681f26ffaa	Maybe she's not ready to let go yet? I wouldn't know, neither of my children used pacifiers.<br>  <br>  I know quite a few people who cut the tips off the pacifiers and let their children wean themselves.

hKJIDdVqaa	um your mom does sound rather odd. She did abuse you.  Why does cutting yourself feel good?  I will never understand that. It sends shivers up my spine thinking about it.  Geez, I do not like blood.  You guys need counseling, both of you.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	wow ..she shouldnt do that.<br>  throwing out your clothes..thats abuse<br>  CPS would agree<br>  I have a friend who did that to her teen<br>  mom got in trouble..once they buy you something<br>  its not theirs to throw away <br>  thats theft|`|AA11055057	Did something ever happen to her? (divorce?)<br>  She's taking her anger out on you, and she shouldn't!<br>  I don't think she's fit to be a parent! You should definaltly talk to someone about what she's doing to you, and you have got to stop cutting. You're hurting everyone around you, not just yourself, and yes, that does sound cheesey, but it's true! Do you think your friends would be fine with you intentionally hurting yourself?|`|lNJvhkJaaa	If you cut to any degree then seek help from a school counselor or any adult that you trust. Throwing out your clothes was rude to say the least. But all of the other things she did to you are not OK!!!  If she is hitting you so hard that it makes marks on your skin then it is considered abuse. Tell someone immediatly!|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Yes, if she hit you and pushed you down it is considered abuse, maybe try and go to counseling or something. I'm sorry.|`|64OsCr8laa	honestly she was so wrong a mother should respect your privacy really.. my mom did my mom was a great mom she was not per say my friend but i knew i could go to her anyway, a mother should understand people need privacy and to me my child will have it unless it does something to break the trust of that<br>  <br>  some people just dont understand what it takes to be a mother to a teenager you could have reacted differently yes but she should also respect you and that is the major problem here.. if you hit you hard and left bruises yes its abuse but if not unfortunately its not abuse<br>  <br>  good luck with her and is you dad in the picture could you maybe go to him about it or to a relative you trust?|`|IVHs6B7waa	go tell your dad,guidence counsler or principal because thats abuse and the next time that you talk to her,ask her why she did that and its your clothes,not hers<br>  <br>  you should do the same exact thing to her!! teach her how it feels to have all of her personal belongings thrown away!!! just say "you did it to me,so i should be aloud to do it to you!!"|`|7pYVDyfUaa	First and foremost if you are cutting yourself for ANY REASON you need to speak with some adult you can trust so that you can get some help.<br>  <br>  Now there are two sides to every arguement, but from the sounds of it it seems as if your mother has an anger control issue.<br>  <br>  Speak with someone, about your concerns with your mother, and most especially your self injury.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.  Take Care.|`|wUWvO5r6aa	by what your saying she souds kinda off scary, You need to talk to someone because cutting your self ain't cool. If you ever to to talk to someone I could give you my e-mail ani wirtte you right back. Don't do that to your self I am sure someone in your family cares for you a lot and they could help you.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Throwing your stuff out? No hitting you? Yes call the cops and press charges!!!!|`|14G5iyRSaa	dont cut yourself you sicko|`|iMHbAkmPaa	clothes are women best friend so lock ur room|`|G5Wnd1KDaa	It's really hard to say if something is or is not "abuse" based only on the information that folks give on here.  However, that said, it sounds like your mom may have gone a slight bit overboard.  There definitely sounds like there is a breakdown in communication between you and her.  I would suggest that you speak in private with your school counselor and ask for her recommendations, as she will have a better knowledge of you and your particular situation.  <br>  <br>  Hurting yourself makes no sense whatsoever.  You are mad at your Mom for hurting you so you are now going to hurt yourself?  That makes very little sense other than that when you hurt yourself you feel like you are in control, and when your Mom does it you feel helpless.  Again, talk to your school counselor.  You might be surprised how much they can help you out in situations such as these.|`|MsLKIJWJaa	I think that your mom is either going through a faze or she is in her  menopause. I think what she is doing is abuse and probably you should talk to your counselor. Maybe your mom needs help. You need to know how to control your anger. You are still underaged and your mom can go through your things however many times she wants. I think you also need help because cutting yourself is not going to solve anything and its better to talk to people and vent your anger than cut and have pain.|`|oOBEbOiSaa	Run away from home seriously. Your mother is a ******* ***** and she needs help and it's not your responsibility to give it to her.<br>  <br>  Wow, your mother does have issues.
AA10624857	It is no problem to take the base with you. You can either check it with your luggage or you can take it with you through security and have them gate check it for you. When you get through security and are at your gate have the agent at the desk there give you a gate check tag. When you get on the plane, leave the base with the tag attached at the door at the end of the walkway. They will hand place it under the plane and when you land they will bring it back to the same place for you to pick up when you get off the plane. Many airlines are now charging for checked items so ask when you check in if it will cost you extra to check it at the desk. If so, take it with you and gate check it. We've gate checked my grandma's walker, my son's cello, and a stroller with no problems at all. We just flew last weekend and I saw several car seat bases being unloaded with the baggage as well as being gate checked. Airlines are cutting back the number of flights and the last few times we've flown, the planes have been completely full.  ADDED:  I highly recommend that you check your airlines web site for luggage restrictions.  We just flew Delta this past week and checked baggage is limited to 50 pounds as well as measuring 62 inches (h + w + l).  Personal care items such as strollers, car seats, walkers, etc. are not typically subjected to additional fees so there is no need to try to fit your car seat or base into a suitcase.  Just put a tag on it and it will go under the plane without any problem.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I personally liked flying with my daughter in my lap...I wouldn't have it anyway<br>  <br>  I wouldn't really trust not bringing the base for the car seat. My graco car seat just doesn't look like it would stay in place without the base...better be safe then sorry|`|9WovIk3maa	I would bring the base , I hate hate hate  not having my base i'm so paranoid.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Nope...I would bring the base.|`|AA12058041	personelly i would i feel safety for the little ones is so very important i have 2 car seats in mu truck and i have them installed by our state police i want them done right and secure i see so many people who dont use babys car seats properly your baby is a passenger as well and deserves the best accomidations on your flight good luck and be safe|`|z6IekuwSaa	The last time I flew I had my baby girl with me. The flight attendent told me that as long as you ask them if you can use the car seat if a seat is available they will let you. Just make sure you say it is FAA approved.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	Definitely bring the base along with you. I would not feel comfortable driving in the car any other way.|`|Gz1XccKVaa	Take the bottom too. Better be save than sorry|`|vKEYa8aeaa	my baby isnt born yet but this july were flying to visit my husbands family, our baby will be about 3 months old. what im going to do [the airline were taking allows one full size bag per person and 1 carry on per person] is pack one BIG suitcase with both of our clothes and another big suitcase with the car seat, base, and the babies clothes [we have a big suitcase that it all fits in, i already tried lol].<br>  <br>  EDIT: of course we will have to put the car seat and base in the suitcase once we get to the air port and take it out once were at our destination|`|aEpPt9koaa	You can use the Graco carseat without the base but I always brought the base when I traveled on a plane with my daughter. A base is easier to strap me to me. What I did was I checked her carseat with the base attached at the ticket counter with the rest of our luggage. They sell bags to that you can put your carseat in to keep it from getting dirty and all the pieces together. I suggest you get one because I have had to wash dirt and oil out of my daughter's seat after checking it. They sell these bags at babies r us. But once we checked her carseat I put her in my infant carrier, the one that straps to your body and went through security like that. And if I took a stroller I would push her in her stroller until we got to the gate. Hope that helped.
azE51WGRaa	Devastated? I hope not! You're so lucky to only have one! My stomach looks like an offroading track (lol)! It all depends on if the baby drops more and how much longer you'll be pregnant to determine if you're gonna get more or not. Just think of them as love tracks from your daughter (it helps the devastation =D lol)|`|bGRexKPyaa	Not a big chance.<br>  <br>  Im 8 and 3/4 months pregnant and I have a tiny little light pink stretch mark next to my belly button tooooo!!! I think its cuz i have my belly ring in still.<br>  <br>  Try the pure vitamin E oil. ASAP.

Stretch marks fade with time, and just one will be minuscule.<br>  <br>  Your health and the baby's health are far more important than any stretch mark.<br>  <br>  No cream can prevent stretch marks.  Either you have skin that does it, or you don't.<br>  <br>  Health is the primary concern, everything else is peanuts.|`|HAueVh8Naa	you most likely wont get them anymore .i used this stuff called bio oil  you can buy it at any department store and it worked really good i used to have stretch marks on my thighs and butt and there totally gone|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I didnt get a single one until like 33 weeks and by 36 weeks I have like 15!! I lotioned like crazy and all it did was waste my money and make my hands soft LOL!<br>  I wish I only had ONE like you!|`|78FXygtoaa	haha i got my first @ like 35 weeks and was sooo upset<br>  i HIGHLY doubt you will get anymore.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I only got one on my belly button (Or close to it) <br>  I had more in other places but usually you will get stretch marks when your skin expands and then tries to go back, like an accordion, you open it and then close it and there are lines.<br>  <br>  You may see some more after she comes, when the skin is trying to go back....it's stretched out so just make sure you keep that cocoa butter on!|`|slzx5202aa	Aww this makes me nervous lol. I am 37 weeks and am yet to discover a stretch mark on my belly *touch wood*, i thought if i got this far i would be home free but obviously not.<br>  <br>  I hope that it stays just one lone stretch mark.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and i hope aliyah comes soon, you must be feeling so ready to meet your beautiful baby girl.|`|z6IekuwSaa	There's a huge chance. I got every single one of mine the last two weeks of pregnancy, and I even lotioned up 3 times a day everyday. I thought I had it beat. If she would have came on her due date I would have been pretty good with not so many. Good Luck I hope they don't hit ya all at once like me|`|XvqZyOpYaa	LOL! You should count your blessings because I'm only 31 weeks and I've got a few around my belly button and on the right hand side of my belly. Not many and I was surprised it took this long. Since your due so soon I would say chances are you might get one more before friday or none. Congrats on your baby.|`|ypJt6poOaa	lol my mom got her first stretch mark when she was like 20 weeks pregnant. she was huge by then. a bit ago there was a forest of stretchmarks on her belly, but not they don't seem to be tehre, but she's going to have the baby soon|`|CVtmd0h3aa	LOL!  You went so long without them!  That one will probably get a little bigger.  Not much bigger, but you probably won't get anymore.|`|Nhje1U06aa	You should be okay . I only had one with my pregnancy . Just keep putting on the cocoa butter. My mark is not even noticable<br>  Good luck with your delivery|`|w9jx0JYLaa	i had none until 31 weeks, within one week i had them everywhere :(
AA12033653	At your first appointment they will check your iron level, along with your babies iron level (simple prick of the finger), they will weigh both you and baby.  You qualify also if you are breastfeeding.  Even if you are doing both formula and breastfeeding you will receive a food package as well as a food package for the baby.  <br>  <br>  Any time there is a change in your income you just have to let the office know (at your appointments) then they will re evaluate if you are still able to qualify for benefits.  As far as I know as long as you qualify for WIC you don't have to pay the assistance back, but double check with the WIC office at your first appointment.  <br>  <br>  Remember that unemployment only pays a portion of what your hubby used to make.  My husband is on unemployment right now and he is bringing home $240/week when it used to be $500/week when he was employed.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	WIC provides a food package for children under 5 years old, pregnant women, breastfeeding women up to 1 year and postpartum women up to 6 months.  That means you will get a food package in addition to your child getting a formula package.  The packages differ from state to state, however it should be something along the lines of 9 cans of formula for her and for you: 5 1/2 gallons of milk, 6 bottles of juice, 1 lb beans, 1 can peanut butter, 2 dozen eggs, 2 lbs cheese, and 32 oz cereal.  <br>  You do not have to pay back this assistance received, only welfare and foodstamps make the other parent pay for the assistance, but not sure how it works if you are together for those 2 programs.<br>  different states use different brands of formula, but she will be able to get the soy.|`|fHjSonssaa	I live in another state, but I imagine the rules are the same, even if the figures are different.<br>  <br>  At your first appointment, they will measure and weigh your baby, ask you questions about yourself and your baby.  They will give you nutritional info.<br>  <br>  If you are STILL below the income requirements when your hubby is getting unemployment (if he gets it)- you will still qualify for WIC.<br>  Otherwise, it is not REQUIRED that you tell them- they will check your eligability again either at the first of next year or when your child hits the 9 month check up-<br>  if your child is on medical assistance, you the child will automatically qualify for WIC.  <br>  If your hubby starts bringing in a lot of money and you feel guilty using WIC, you can always update your situation- they will walk you through each step.<br>  The first appointment is the longest- with all the questions and setting you up- and weighing, etc...<br>  Then they will give you your WIC checks on you will be on your way- they will explain how to use these before you leave, and give you a list a of WIC approved baby/mam food- if you also qualify.  They might also check your hemoglobin- if YOU are recieving anything from WIC<br>  They will not check baby's hemoglobin until the 9 month appointment,|`|ca9dEvSAaa	No you don't and won't have to pay any of it back.<br>  <br>  My first appointment was really long, about 2 hours. They have a 'class' at every meeting. You will need to bring your baby with you, as they will document things. You will get your first checks at the first appointment. Remember to bring everything listed on the automated information.<br>  <br>  ~It's a little boring. My appointments are an hour long now, but the first one was 2 hours for processing all the information.|`|nfLyS1toaa	you will get milk and some other things and she will get formula,baby cereal, and juice. at your first appointment they will weigh you 2 and check your iron by pricking your finger. every couple months you will have a class to go to to learn more about your baby but they only last like 10 minutes. i am on it also cause my husband had his hours reduced.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Your first visit they will have you fill out paperwork about what you and daughter eat. You'll need proof of income (pay stubs) and your ID, and proof of address (a bill works). They needed mine and my sons birth certificates. They will let you choose a few options (like beans of peanut butter, etc) and get some info in the computer. They may have you and baby both be tested for anemia (just a simple finger prick.) Then they should give you your WIC checks (mine was for 3 months) and I just go back every 3 months for more. You will not have to pay back any assistance. :) <br>  Oh, since she is 4 months old you qualify for 2 months. (after having a baby you get 6 months post-partum WIC, and if you breastfeed I think you get it as long as your breastfeeding-or perhaps a year I cant remember.) Good luck!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Your first visit they'll do a nutritional session with you usually one-on-one, it's really informative and good advice too ifyou're breastfeeding.  You will qualify and you will all receive more food; cereal, juice, milk, eggs, cheese, peanut butter or some type of protein like lentils or peas.  I love wic, you won't have to pay it back once you get above income guidelines.  Usually the first one will last a year, maybe less for you if you aren't breastfeeding.  Hope you guys get unemployment and start work soon.  Best to you.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	The program is for pregnant women, and children under the age of five.  Once you get the appointment you bring in the paperwork they had you fill out, proof of income, and birth cerfitances.  Once you do that you're good for a year.  The next year the repeat the same process.  If you guys will be a household of 3 making under 30,000 you will qualify.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	No, you do not need to pay back the assistance. At your first appt. you will turn in your paperwork, and then watch a short video. Then you will speak with a woman who will manage your file. She will explain what food vouchers you will recieve and you will get them at the end of your first appt., Then she will make another appt. to receive your next months vouchers. Each set of vouchers is good for around 30 days or so...|`|bGRexKPyaa	In san diego C.A WIC is totally free. Its for you and the baby. <br>  <br>  Milk, juices, beans, peanut butter, cereal, frozen juices.<br>  <br>  When you go in I believe you get to leave with the VOUCHERS...<br>  <br>  the may weigh you and the baby and I think you were suppose to bring a paper of your doctor saying your blood information on it..|`|h1AIzD9baa	wic is amazing.. you will get a seperate wic for you and the baby..  i and they will do all the paper work (which isnt much) do a finger stick on you and baby.. get weight and lenght for baby.. and do a nutrional consult..|`|Hhd2TPL2aa	no wic is a public health  and you you don't have to pay back anything|`|58G7ZAJpaa	This is a great question, and I'm glad someone was willing to ask.  (most people seem to be ashamed of having assistance).  I'm a 2nd time wic user, and LOVE the benefits.. especially after the baby arrives.<br>  <br>  First appointment: make sure you have your ssc/ID, proof of address, and proof of income, or lack thereof.  You will go through several different "stages" as you may call them.  You'll go through the financial stage where they check your income and see where you stand.  They pretty much just verify whether you are within the income qualifications or not.  Then you'll see a nurse.  They'll prick you and your daughters finger to check for Iron levels. They'll check weight and height of the two of you.  You'll see the nutritionist in regards to where you and your daughter stand "health" wise.  They'll go over your benefits and what you are eligible for, etc.  -recently, I'm not sure if you'll have to do it, but you might, you'll watch a video in regards to your wic card that holds your benefits.  i.e. how to use it, etc.  I know Texas does uses a smartcard instead of vouchers now.  You'll get your card, your "receipt", schedule your next "class" and you'll be good to go.  I may have forgotten something, so if I did, I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  Seeing that you have a 4 month old daughter does qualify you for wic.  I'm not sure what they meant, but seeing as though she's of breastfeeding age: whether you do or not - you are eligible for the extras.  If you are breastfeeding, you get tuna and carrots.  If she is using formula you get benefits for formula.<br>  <br>  You WILL have to notify wic when and if your husband gets unemployment, but you will NOT have to repay the benefits.  Seeing the new income, they will run it through finances and see if you are still eligible.  If not, they simply take away your benefits and are left on your own.  FYI - your daughter is eligible for wic until she is 5, as long as you meet the guidelines.<br>  <br>  I hope this came as some help to you.  Good luck!!|`|xqqYXUNHaa	You will get milk,juice,eggs,beans or peatnut butter, cereal and everything must be natural, no sugars added, 100 % juice, and cheese... They is a limit to all the items and you get them on a monthly basis... For the 4 month old, you will get checks for 32 or 31 cans of formula which is Similiac in my state NJ Advance or Isomil at her age I believe you start getting 2 boxes of cereal(plain grain only) and 2 bottles of juice... If you're breastfeeding tell them you do alternate or that you are doing so now, buth may take a break soon, or else they won't give you the formula...<br>  <br>  First Appt, you may have to see a nutrionist and complete a form of what the children eat on a daily basis as far as the food groups... You will be asked for Income information or verification, insurance cards, immunization records, baby will have to be tested for hemoglobin and lead at a certain point... recertification is usually every 6 months where you have to bring the child and pediatrician has to complete the recertification form with weight, height and etc... you are given your WIC checks there for (3) months and then an appt for another (3) months then that day you will be given an appt for recertification which makes up the six months... Some summer seasons they distribute checks for fruits and veggies at local farmers market don't know, if they do in Michigan.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/wic" rel="nofollow">http://www.michigan.gov/wic</a><br>  If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me...|`|fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	No, you do not have to pay any assistance back. Also, at your first appointment (depending who all you are applying for) you will go over basic information, be weighed, check iron (needle prick to finger) and also answer basic health questions. They will also ask about your diet and the food that you consumed in the past 24 hours. If you are applying for your child, you will have to report what they ate in the last 24 hours, birth weight and length, have them measured, answer basic health questions about them, have their iron checked and mention any health problems they have. WIC is a great resource to make sure that you and your family receive adequate nutrition, if your baby is on formula, they will also help with that.|`|AA11368796	I live in Louisiana and can tell you my experience. I was on WIC for 4 years. The visit will be pretty long so bring stuff to keep your baby content. First they will get your information, then you wait to see the nurses there. They will test your baby's iron levels, weight, height, and ask you the usual questions of allergies, problems, vaccinations, etc. Again you will wait to see the nutritionist. Once you have talk to all of the above, you will wait again to see the agent the will give you your vouchers. The vouchers will have what your baby needs and you must get everything on the voucher, even if you think you don't need it. For the time being, you will get formula and cereal if you are not breast-feeding. If you are they might give you what they think you will need (milk, eggs, cheese, beans or peanut butter - if iron is low, cereal, condensed milk, and I believe that's all.)|`|LZk3z2ilaa	The appointments are fairly easy.  I know that once you have your baby if you breastfeed you will recieve 12 months on WIC items, if you dont you recieve 6 month.  You dont have to pay back any assistance  You should also apply for food stamps and TANF its not much but it can help out on diapers and some of the small things.  Good Luck!  I know how it is.  My husband got laided off in Dec of 07 and he just found something.|`|cERkHBHNaa	I don't know if it's the same everywhere but at my first appointment I was taken into a room along with other people who were there for there first time and we watched a short movie about WIC in general and how to shop with the WIC coupons. After that we met with a lady who asked a few questions and gave us our first set of WIC coupons for that month.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	If I can recall correctly, on the first visit they ask you a bunch of questions about your health, and your babies health. And about your life in general, so that they can asses what your current needs are. They'll weigh your baby, too, and check your blood just by poking your finger. I'm not sure if they do that to the babies too.<br>  And may I suggest that you also apply for Food Stamps? I'm not sure how is works in Michigan, but where I live our Food Stamps in on a card like a debit card. It's better because you get more money, and have more options when it comes to the food. Like, you can only get certain types of food with WIC. But you can get basically anything you need with Food Stamps, including organic food, and good quality cuts of meat if you so chose, which is very important to my husband and I.<br>  I also think it may be possible to have both WIC and Food Stamps. <br>  You should check with your state.<br>  EDIT: My son's doctor advise that because he was so colicky that we try giving him soy formula because he thought that maybe the milk based formula was upsetting him, though at the time he was mainly brestfed. Then when my son stopped breastfeeding out of nowhere, all we had was the free soy milk formula that we had from the doctors, and immediately we noticed he would spit up more often. Especially with the Enfamil Soy. And then on other soy formulas, it was the same. Because when babies are so young, the only thing they can really process well is breast milk, or a milk based formula, which I know may be hard if you are a vegan. Humans in general have a hard time digesting soy, and often times will give adults, and especially babies, terrible, and smelly gas, along with the very frequent spit up. It's because the soy milk will just be sitting in their little bellies forever. So if your little girl is spitting up a lot, that may very well be why. It's also very high in estrogen, another thing to rethink, because we have  a son.<br>  I hope you found this helpful!|`|aBWu7tyHaa	every state is a little different as far as things like that are concerned but for the MOST part......if you meet income requirements you receive WIC if you are 6months post partum, if you are pregnant, or breastfeeding.  Children in the household will receive WIC until they are 5 yrs of age.  If you collect unemployment or find another job and do not meet the income requirements anymore, NO you do not pay back what you've received thus far, you simply don't receive checks anymore.  You will need to bring your identification, ID and SSCard if you have one, birth certificate anything like that.  Bring some sort of electricity bill or cable bill something with your name and address on it for proof of address.  You will need paystubs or unemployment paperwork....something verifying income or lack there of....anything from work stating he was laid off.  you will need identification for the baby, SS card, birth certificate, AND shot records, they usually use the shot records no matter what other form of ID you bring.  They will weigh and measure both you and the baby, they will ask you about eating habits for both of you.....formula/breastmilk, what types of things you eat and how often you and the baby eat.  They may do the finger prick for IRON to make sure you aren't iron deficient.  Other than that just a bunch of paperwork.....they have you fill out questionaire's about your health history and the baby's and things about the type of living situation you are in.  It's not a big deal really, once you get used to it, it gets easier and goes faster once you are in the system.  Just ask them about the unemployment, depending on how many people live in your household you may still qualify.  my husband is military and we qualify and receive it here in NY.  that should be about it.  good luck|`|gZcXQnTYaa	i live in louisiana, and when i went for my wic appointment it was super easy. they just put you in a room with a group of parents and you watch a short nutrition video, then for your first appointment theyll probably also bring you into another small room and ask a couple of really quick questions and then they prick your finger for a blood test. they measure and weigh the baby and send you to another section where you talk to another nutritionist who will ask you some questions as he/she puts together your vouchers (we have vouchers here, they may give you the food there in michigan, i know thats how they do it in mississippi) and then you're done. the questions usually pertain to whether or not you're breastfeeding, if you are how it's going, etc. by saying you may also be eligible for wic, they are saying you will get your own food, as well as the formula. this is usually a couple boxes of cereal, milk, cheese, juice and maybe a couple other things. you may want to bring another adult along for the time when you're talking to the nutritionist, though. good luck! P.S. You don't have to pay it back!
OLW0Irbhaa	God, for his sake I can only hope so.  I'd jump off a bridge if I had to live with her.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	While there are things about the Gosselins I do not agree with, IF this is fact the last thing they need is their problems passed around like an hors'ordorves tray.

It's never a good thing when something like that happens. <br>  <br>  If it's not true, which is probably more likely, then I think it's a cruel rumor to start about someone because that kind of thing can really hurt the people it's about and cause problems that didn't previously exist.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	no they are raking in 75g an episode. why would they do this.|`|nCFnFLCDaa	No.|`|0YIiQvOlaa	Well not suprised.

YRBIXTCJaa	I think its normal, I was always tired, still am and he just turned 1year yesterday. Are you breastfeeding? I am still and I think that is suppose to make you tired. And whenever he naps I, I know I should sleep too but it's just so nice to have a break, its just hard to just lay and sleep exactly when they do. If he is a newborn, your mind is probably just constantly running so it's hard to turn it off right away to sleep. Just try even resting on the couch or in bed, it seems to help a bit. I have noticed little cat naps seem better than like an hour nap, like 15 minutes here and there when they are napping. It will take a while, don't know how old your baby is, but I am still exhausted after a year! Good luck!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i feel the same way..at first i had lots of energy to deal with the every two hrs now in the past 2-3wks i just crashed...can't make myself fall asleep when baby sleeps but feel exhausted all day and nite...i drink coffee and still be very tired. i just figured i did too much too soon after having my baby and now my body is on shut down mode....now that my baby is more on a schedule sleep and once he falls asleep i know he will be out for 6-8hrs i take tylonol pm..me and baby be knocked out together|`|IlIjGTdiaa	Wow, don't hate me for saying this but an answer is exercise. It both wakes you up and lets you sleep better. I know it's the last thing anyone feels like doing when they're tired but it works. It's weird but true.
HqOkC2YHaa	because you actually are pregnant for a whole 10 months<br>  <br>  your 9th month still has 4 weeks in it and you have to go through your whole 9th month (unless the baby comes early of course) so therefore when you hit 10 months it should be your due date|`|CzKrqgmgaa	because 40 weeks generally equals 10 months.<br>  9 months is just a generalization because a lot of women dont know the first 4 weeks (or a month) that they are pregnant but it is still counted|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Most due dates are determined as 280 days after the last menstrual period.<br>  <br>  280/30.5 = 9.18 months|`|tivpa7Vlaa	thats just the way the doctors do it and i guess they are right cause i had my baby on his due date so basically i was pregnant for 40wks and thats about 10mths..sucks|`|hw3OMoeZaa	If you are confused, you're not alone. While some people talk about pregnancy being 9 months long (divided into three trimesters), most health care providers refer to pregnancy as being 40 weeks long, starting with your last known menstrual period (LMP). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A normal pregnancy lasts 280 days from your LMP which is about 266 days from conception to birth. The first two weeks of your pregnancy includes the time of your period, ovulation and fertilization. Conception occurs approximately 14 - 16 days after the first day of your period.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	Simple answer.  1 month is not equal to 4 weeks.  1 month is equal to 4 weeks and 2 or 3 days depending on what month it is.<br>  <br>  40 weeks is not equal to 10 months.  Do the math.<br>  <br>  40 weeks X 7 days =  280 Days<br>  <br>  9 months X 30 days= 270 days<br>  9 months X 31 days= 279 days<br>  <br>  Understand?|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Because its a full 9 months, not the beginning of 9 months.<br>  <br>  You are pregnant for 40 weeks, 40/4= 10 months.<br>  I don't know why they world just says 10 months, it makes it so much easier to understand.|`|fTYuYDKXaa	pregnancy is sometimes 10 months. usually if the baby is smaller.|`|9WovIk3maa	Cuz pregnancy is actually 10 monthes .|`|dPmK83UYaa	Yes it includes it all|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	You have to go all the way through month 9.

z6IekuwSaa	Eye color is not a dominate recessive type gene Only. It is more of a sliding scale, it's kinda complex. Your child could have absolutely any color eyes. I learned this in one of my Pre-Med classes when I was in college. But it makes it so much more fun because their color seems to change everyday.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I have no idea what color they're gonna be, I just wanted to look at the pics!  She is absolutely adorable!  My little girls are the same way, one day they look one day like they're definitely gonna be blue, and then the next day they look hazel.  My nieces eyes were that newborn slate blue, until she was like 11months, and then they turned to a golden, almost honey brown color.  So only time will tell!|`|6C24kJhaaa	probably since it loses pigment, just a lighter less dynamic version of what it is now.|`|68cc82283542fb9e45877505681f26ffaa	Try this link, it is a baby eye color calculator.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	my sons eyes looked like that when he was lil then they turned green then a light brown and that's where they stayed at light brown|`|hYL6LJWeaa	They will probably stay that color! My daughter has the same eye color!! Absolutly gorgous!!|`|9WovIk3maa	hazel?|`|AA11732721	"My husband and I have light brown eyes with a little of green in them."<br>  <br>  That will be your baby's eye color, same as you and your husband. <br>  If both parents have brown eyes, the child will have brown eyes.|`|dNtnYBblaa	It's a probable chance her eyes will be light brown, because it's a dominant gene. Green and blue are recessive genes. There may or may not be a chance your daughter will have blue or green eyes.|`|8Og11giIaa	oh she is so cute! <br>  <br>  brown is usually the dominant eye colour gene. so if you and your husband have brown eyes id say she would have brown|`|Gc7JZV8daa	awww how adorable. im going to guess like a bluish/green but more blue than green.|`|TJusfEnlaa	I would think brown, to match all those gorgeous hair!! She's adorable!
AA10624857	I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th baby. I had to test 4 times each day. When I was out in public I used the restroom, but I didn't hide in a stall, I just did it at the sink. Many public restrooms even provide a sharps disposal container for your lancet. We recently traveled by plane and all the airport bathrooms had the disposal containers. The main bathroom at our mall also has a sharps disposal container. If you are worried about testing in public look for bathrooms that offer a family restroom. Than you can go in and have the privacy of being in a single use bathroom. At someone's home, you can go to their bathroom. You wouldn't even have to tell anyone what you are doing unless you are close to the people giving the party and you want to mention that you have to test your blood glucose. As long as you take precautions with the blood there is no problem testing in public. Once I had to test at a church that wasn't ours when my son was in a concert. The bathroom had no counter so I found an empty classroom by the bathroom.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Having been a type 1 insulin dependent diabetic for the last 25 years and testing my sugar 4 times per day and now 7 time per day while pregnant, I pretty much test where ever I can sit down.  There is no need to be embarrassed to do it in public and most people that notice you doing it will know what it is for anyway.  If people have a problem with it, tell them your diabetic and to p*ss of and mind their own business!!  You'll be surprised how good it is for getting a conversation started :)  Don't be worried about others.  Just remember that it is for the health of yourself and baby.|`|fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	if you can, check it in your vehicle, before you go in. or you can go into the bathroom. if it is a public restroom, just do it by the sink. or you can lock the door to the public bathroom, if no one is in there. Sometimes I step outside and find a quite place where im alone, sitting my stuff on the ground near me to check it.|`|7B1jccjVaa	my mom has diabetes, and she went through this. if you do it in your car, PLEASE go to the bathroom, and wash your hands thoroughly (although i'm sure you know all that). you can get little to go kit things. i don't think you need to go in a stall, though. just get a few paper towels, set all of your equipment on them, and go to the farthest sink. bring antiseptic wipes, too, just to wipe down the faucet handles and whatnot.|`|am906CQcaa	I have just done it in my car if I can. Easier than trying to balance things in the bathroom stall. If you're at someone's house obviously the counter in the bathroom is easiest, but I've also used the bathroom counter in public restrooms before. You gotta do what you gotta do. I didn't have too many strange looks. Hope this helps in some way! And hope you have a good, healthy, pregnancy! =)|`|OBn4a7rzaa	go out to the car...or put your stuff out on the table right in front of you, and prick your finger kind of in your lap under the table so it doesnt turn out to be a big deal.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	I would look for 2 dozen of diaper service quality or DSQ Indian or chinese cotton prefolds and some diaper covers.  I would use the prefolds at home and the Bumwears at night or when you go in public.  The AIOs are SO expensive and babies grow so fast.  You can try to sell, buy trade on <a href="http://www.diaperswappers.com//" rel="nofollow">http://www.diaperswappers.com//</a>  It's a comunity just for clothe diapering moms.<br>  <br>  This is the best I found.  And I tried alot of different kinds from different sites!  I also suggest the Prowraps they are less expensive, and work awesome!   <a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Granitesmiths-Diaper-Store__W0QQ_armrsZ1" rel="nofollow">http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Granitesmith...</a><br>  <br>  I can also suggest g-diapers for out and about. They combine clothe and disposables.  They are all natural and easy on the little ones tush.  I used these in public, since in inner liner is disposable.  Nothing like a soiled clothe diaper stinking up your diaper bag. <a href="http://www.gdiapers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gdiapers.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can set up a bucket full of soapy water in your bathroom to put dirty diapers in.  Then when your ready to wash they will be pre-soaked.  And if you get a good quality diaper the solid waste will just fall off, unless it's diarrhea.  I used the pink plastic tub I got from the hospital, I got it when I had my baby.  It's the prefect size to lay a dipe in.(picture not me, found on internet)<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HOvwDkPWCAE/SPaKH7Xik-I/AAAAAAAACDE/maZJ4WM7BP0/s400/102_4497.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HOvwDkPWCAE/SP...</a>|`|WT56iKwZaa	I used cloth diapers. I just used the regular diapers both the prefolded and the flat  type and doubled them at night. I think I changed them about every 2-3 hours at that age. And at night only when they woke up<br>  <br>  I also used a diaper service. If possible that is the way to go. Cheaper then disposables, they deliver and pick up, Each babies diapers are washed separately from all the others and they can adjust the PH in the water to match your baby urine and prevent diaper rash.<br>  <br>  Im not sure what a bumwear is. possible you can use a reg. cloth diaper as a liner for the bumwear?|`|pQj8GNQqaa	We are also happy Bumwear users based in Singapore :-)<br>  <br>  Don't worry, your boy will outgrow the phase of using 12 diapers a day. We have about 12-15 Bumwear diapers and it's just nice for us.<br>  <br>  Prefolds, we used them before too, but a bit more troublesome as they have to be changed at every wetting
DiqDCZU4aa	they can never tell  how far along you are precisely so they count it from your last period, if you cant remember when that is they gotta usually kind of guess till you have an ultrasound, but you usually ovulate two weeks after your period so thats when you concieve, hope this helps if it makes any sense, good luck and congrads... and im guess your about 19 weeks, look up pregnancy calenders and you can put your due date in and its tell ya how far alone you are|`|AA10196172	Doctors usually count from what should be the last period start; add 2 weeks for conception date.<br>  <br>  So if he said 4 weeks 6 days (where did he get that number from? Ultrasound?) then you conceived 2 weeks 6 days before the appointment, if he was using "doctor counting". That would put your fertilizing event about Nov.11th; is that about when you and the hubby had kissed and made up?<br>  <br>  I would ask the doc what he was basing his dates on. Usually, they base them on an ultrasound and measuring the size of the fetus. I don't think he can tell to the day, just by looking.|`|K1lRZmxXaa	they will have to do an ultrasound before they can kno for sure so just wait because they told me i was due in august, then july, and now august....yeah it is crazy i just got my ultrasound and they told me i was due in august|`|AA12047432	go the www.askdramy.com that's how I found out when I conceived all my kids the 2 girls i have now and the one I'm carrying now.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	when you get an ultrasound done they will be able to tell you how far along you are..

vGxipYJnaa	Put his playpen in his room and put him down for a nap. Hang around until he falls asleep. That way, he's used to the playpen and having you and will feel more secure in a new room. Get him comfortable in the room, and then switch him to the crib.|`|1cJjGNOBaa	well, you could just decide to have a few tough days and simply start putting him in the crib and reassuring him for a bit and walking away. Go back for a back pat every few minutes- but NO talking- as long as he continues crying. It will take about 3-4 days, but after that he'll sleep like a baby in his crib in his room- problem solved. He won't remember a thing! Next time, start the baby out in its own crib in its own room!|`|DDFSITiYaa	Can you temporarily put his crib in your room and let him get used to it next to you, in the spot he is used to?  Then you can start easing it towards the door, out into the hall, to his room.  Perhaps once he is used to the space, the room won't matter so much.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	You need to get him on a routine. He should sleep the same place all the time. Here is a trick that worked for me:<br>  <br>  How to Get a Baby, Toddler or Child to Fall Asleep<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-toddler-child-fall-asleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-to...</a>|`|4FQrXiylaa	maybe try putting the play pen where the crib is.......or try sitting quietly next to the crib until he goes to sleep and gradually every few nights move a bit further away|`|DdLfaEzNaa	My son slept in a play pen until he was 14 months old, because my oldest was still using the crib.  When we transitioned  him, we moved the play pen into the room with the crib and let him get used to being in a different room away from us.  Then we let him choose which bed he wanted to sleep in.  Sometimes he would cry later in the night to move back to the playpen when he chose the crib, but that didn't last very long.  We put his favorite lovies in the crib, we kept them there during the day instead of his play pen, and gradually, he slept in the crib.  Then we moved, and when we did, we didn't bring out the playpen at all, so he couldn't regress.  He did spend a few nights crying some, but even my kids who didn't have to make that transition still spend some nights crying when they really don't want to go to bed!|`|wRHhpanmaa	My cousin had this problem as well. Try letting him fall asleep with you, and then moving him into his crib. That way he gets used to it when he wakes up.<br>  <br>  you could put his toys in it, that way he can keep himself occupied a few extra minutes after waking up,<br>  <br>  or my son hated his crib, so i got him a mobile, and he absolutely loved it. He would cry, and I would start the music, and he would shush, i would put some warm milk in a bottle and give it to him, and then leave the room. He may be upset for the first few days, but after a while he will get used to this routine. <br>  <br>  Also try the mother's heartbeat bear, or the two way monitors, that way you can encourage him, and tell him to go to sleep from your room, and then after a few days you won't need them anymore. A baby just likes to know you are near, and loves the company. Makes sure he has all his favorite stuffed animals in the crib so he isnt lonely.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|02xxwMRBaa	put the play pen in his room and let him fall asleep there. once hes asleep transfer him over to the crib. then close the playpen and hide it and get him to play in his crib, get him used to it by putting some toys of his in there.
SEzIkGNiaa	Around 7-8 dollars per hour sounds good.  You should ask the parents what they have in mind, and that way you can both come up with a reasonable rate for the both of you.<br>  <br>  =]|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	3 dollars per kid so 9 dollars a hour.|`|vP3Tu9SVaa	If they have three kids at the ages of 1,5, and 7 I think you should ask for 6.50 and hour per kid. Mycousin and I used to babysit back in t he 80's and we asked for 3.50 per hour per child. That was a pretty good amount o money back then but I think since the economy is bad you should a sk for $6.50 per child per hour.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	it depends on how experienced you are, if you dont have the experience then you shouldnt charge as much as minimum wage. but if you are experienced and have been recommended then you could up the price to minimum wage or a little over minimum wage...but thats all opinion. i personally ask the family or the parents what type of service they can afford. im not gonna charge the same price for someone that is living on paycheck to paycheck....so i charge differently with every person. be generous but fair...|`|sXfw3qxdaa	It depends on how experienced you are, how much you need and how much the parents are willing to pay. It also depends on your age. If you are in your mid teens, about $6-$9 an hour is suitable.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Depends on how much experience you have. If you are First Aide/CPR certified.  I'd say minimum wage is ok if you have no experience and are not first aide/cpr certified.
DDFSITiYaa	This is a good one.  I have never had this problem and but you are in a predicament.  She is very young to potty train so she is doing what a 17month old would do with something she was proud of -show it to you! <br>  <br>  You don't want to overreact since you do want the awareness but do you have another word or sign for 'yuck' or 'don't touch!"  Like if she was going to reach for something else she should not touch?  Then can you teach her a more satsifying sign for 'poop'?  Maybe she really want to make it dramatic?|`|wOLoYW7jaa	My daughter did the same thing - she would get it all over her hands, but sometimes wouldnt show it to us right away...HUGE MESS....anyway - we let her know that it isnt something we should do and that it belongs in her diaper or potty and she eventually stopped|`|AA11865529	It isn't disgusting to her. It's something she has made and she is proud of it. And she is proud to know that it means it's time to go potty. <br>  <br>  I'm glad you aren't going to spank her for it. (You should never spank her anyway.) Just sign no poo to her and tell her poo belongs in the toilet. She will get past that when you praise her like crazy when she puts the poo straight into her little potty. Just have her take it to the toilet and put it in there so she will make the connection. Then wash her hands a lot.|`|fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	its her way of figuring things out, don't worry she will out grow it. i bet if you ask other moms they will say their kids did it too. i would just continue to wash her hands and make sure you get her diaper on tightly. you may gently smack her hand or shake your head no. Be firm and she will learn.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	that's just her saying shes ready for potty training it will go away eventually just be patient|`|EsXe7S1oaa	the good ole silver duct tape.....
prqrQcd1aa	First I'd make sure there were very high ceilings.. Then commence to design my own bunk beds that were 3 beds high. <br>  <br>  How many girls are there? How many boys?<br>  <br>  All the babies would be, for now in one room, it would be set up like a nursery in a hospital... The older girls would be in one room, and the older boys in the other, that leaves one more room for her!<br>  <br>  EDIT" In the next 3 years all the kids would have to be in bunk beds, and I'd have dressers built into the walls to save on room.. If bunk beds aren't feasible, then the beds would be going into the walls as well. You know the pull out ones that can be put back up to leave room to play as the kids get older. The 8 kids that are now babies would be divided into the room they are in now, and her room according to gender. She would then sleep on the couch or have her own pull out bed in the living room!|`|yQ0OzEbZaa	I would get 4 cribs a room, the babies would take up 2 rooms, and then the other 6 kids have to share. I feel a woman should first be married and financially stable to bring a child into the world or even a whole litter of kids.  She’s still jobless and husband-less with 14 kids. On welfare. Splurging on video games. Moving out of a home owned by her mom, who’s $20,000 behind on mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now Octo-mommy is moving in to a half-million-dollar southern California home arranged for by dad and reportedly paid for with the cash she’s been raking in from her Octo-mom notoriety. <br>  <br>  I know I’m not the only one with the sick feeling that taxpayers will be on the hook for this financial basket case sooner rather than later.  o_O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-new-house/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-ne...</a>|`|2ydF6OTAaa	it'll probably be a tough one. She may have some of them (like the older ones) sleeping on couches and such. W/ that many kids so close in age, it's impossible for ANY of them to have their own room. I guess, she'll have to get alot of beds(small ones at that) for each child. <br>  <br>  she will need to have alot of baby cribs for the eight that she just had.|`|OYy82bAYaa	Put 4 cots in the biggest room for the babies 2 to a cot, 3 of the big ones in one room 3 in another... And her in the lounge.<br>  <br>  The poor babies god bless them...|`|PW3hcVZiaa	First, I gotta bash for a sec- that entry with the stairs into the foyer?  BAD idea.  That would have turned me away from that house instantly- can you imagine all those little ones tumbling down those stairs onto the hard floor?<br>  Second, I hope the bedrooms are huge.  She's going to have to share her room with at least half of the little ones- maybe the neediest ones (assuming they even let her take them home!).  The older kids should be split 3 and 3 in 2 bedrooms (with a bunk and a single in each), then 4 of the octuplets in another bedroom.  It will be a maze of cribs in that house, for sure!  At some point, she'll have to have 2 sets of bunks in each room and at least 1 set in her own room.  She'll have to probably sleep on one of the bunks.|`|OxFV92hJaa	For all intesive purposes, (depending on sqft). it may be impossible to fit beds for that many in the house. <br>  <br>  To me it would be most logical to have 3 bunk beds in the 1st room (sleeping 6 total).<br>  4 cribs in the 2nd room.<br>  4 cribs in the 3rd room.<br>  Then her in her room, will all the dressers for everyone crammed in there. <br>  <br>  Reasonably speaking, you'd have to have a traditional "master bedroom" size room to do that....for each of the bedrooms. Which from having looked at 100's of homes prior to buying ours....that is impossible to find unless you have it built. <br>  <br>  I'd hate to be her or her kids, because that is beyond cramped like sardines. <br>  <br>  Her problem, not mine.

We have 7 people in our house but we could easily house-36-40 people in 9 bedrooms.|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	I would arrange it by putting the kids bedrooms in someone elses house. Heh..sorry I know you said no bashing, but I just had to say that....for a real answer...<br>  I would try the bunk-bedroom idea. One for the girls, one for the boys. The Duggars (18 and counting on TLC) just have big rooms with beds for the older girls and sturdy playpens for the toddlers to sleep in (at least that's how the girls room was)

CdJtH0xdaa	A great personality, at least in my opinion, is a funny personality, but also a loving and caring one too. They need to be cheerful at times, but they need to be angry too. A great personality isn't snarky and rude and b!tchy and mean, but a great personality can sometimes be ugly. That, in my opinion, is a great personality.|`|Qydtjz2naa	I notice how much guys smile.  I like somebody whose happy, and funny.  I don't take myself very seriously, and I love a guy who can make me laugh!  I also notice how well he treats others.  If he acts nice around everyone, that's a huge turn on.  I like a guy who takes school seriously.  I don't need somebody with straight A's, but somebody who tries.  I hate when guys brag about drugs, sex, and things like that.  I actually liked this guy, and he kept telling me about how drunk he's gotten, and how he gets high, it made me look at him in a different way.  <br>  <br>  1. Sense of humor<br>  2. Caring<br>  3. Intelligent<br>  <br>  Those are the three main ones, just somebody who can make me laugh, and be a shoulder to cry on.|`|MFKgVsoAaa	someone who's interesting, who's not afraid to be themselves but doesn't flaunt themselves in an arrogant or snobby way. someone who's open-minded, who's able to share what's on their mind but also to listen to what's on the mind of others. someone who instead of rushing to be the first at this or the best at that, takes a moment to really look around them and appreciate what they have. everyone's personality is different, and that's part of it- having a great personality also means that you have flaws, but instead of just ignore them, you try to improve them and learn from your mistakes. also, and i yeah i know this sounds real deep and kind of cheesy, but i think the best personality to have is a personality that's wide open- someone who's able to make observations and decisions without using judgement, negativity and fear get in their way. hope this helps!|`|w6tQEuKCaa	someone who has all the charasteristics i like in a person..someone like me actually...as long as they not<br>   stuck up,bossy,hard-headed..or anything else i cnt stand they ok<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As5kotNI07zqg1M4rQ_5xTPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309181059AACRsYS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Friendly, kind, non-annoying, honest, sincere|`|gP0gYbBaaa	caring, understanding, loving, accepts you for you and only you|`|Bz6IZnoFaa	i think its different for everyone:)<br>  for guys i like more nerdy types and i think its adorable when they are shy/get embarrased. i especially love it when guys stutter. i just like shy guys with little quirks, its hard to explain:)<br>  i think this question follows the same principle as the quote "beauty is in the eye of the beholder'|`|kTQbEskraa	Responsible, caring, understanding, kind, accepts you the way you are =]

Tell your dentist. He can make you a thing that goes in his mouth so the teeth do not get destroyed.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	some do some dont ..all they can do is give you a nightime mouth guard they ALL spit out in their sleep
z6IekuwSaa	You shouldn't put anything but formula/breastmilk in a bottle|`|pXSKSS3daa	No, that's not okay.<br>  <br>  Solids are to be given to your baby via a spoon, not in a bottle. If your baby isn't old enough to be able to feed from a spoon then she doesn't need solids.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Just sounds like your setting her up to be over weight to me!|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	At most you could maybe put a tablespoon of rice cereal in a bottle (but you have to make sure to get a bottle with an X in the nipple, to make sure it all goes through okay), but jarred baby food should always be fed with a spoon, never from the bottle.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You shouldn't add any food to a bottle unless directed by a doctor. Especially if your baby is less than four months old. You don't say how old she is. After four months you still wouldn't put it in a bottle, you'd put it in her mouth with a spoon.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I don't think that sounds like a very good idea.  Baby food is meant to be fed with a spoon.  Your child isn't underweight.  I just don't understand why you would want to do this.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i dont think thats ok.<br>  and probably wouldnt taste very good...<br>  mixing cereal into formula is a choking hazard, i would imagine baby food would be the same thing<br>  why not just feed the child with a spoon?|`|heDtLdz5aa	i wouldn't do that...how old is your baby..the only thing i have ever heard of mixing with formula was baby cereal..and i only did this because i was advised by my doctor to do so because my son had acid reflux|`|YUNE5QReaa	is your child waking up in the middle of the night still hungry??<br>  <br>  I would only ever add a small amount of farex if it's suitable for your baby's age group otherwise there isn't a need to do so.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	How old is your baby?

I sat down in the wheelchair at hospital admitting to be wheeled to the OB floor and soon as I sat down i had a warm flow and i said, "My water just broke!"|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	No, your water can break it any position.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	nope but mine broke while walking. good thing i was just one block away from my house and i was wearing black|`|rFwGnZIJaa	No you don't. If you are standing you are most likely going to feel a tinkle like peeing. If you are laying down a gush. That's what my nurse told me in childbirth class. My water was broken by my doctor while I was laying down and it felt like a waterfall.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	nope i had a little gush at 28 weeks (the doctor said the membranes repaired themselves) and i was sitting in a car! i didn't really notice till i stood up and the seat and me were soaked!|`|klTgOEcpaa	nope not at all i was sitting up and i felt my water break get ready for really warm water|`|5h8bYsKdaa	no but 3 out of my 4 pregnancys i just stood up and thats when it started. the other one, i ws in the hospital bed and had to push and they told me not to and i did and it gushed across the room lol|`|s8Hr7zDqaa	Mine broke when I rolled over in bed.|`|E6kDa5P9aa	Nope, mine broke while I was sleeping.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Nope|`|ZK0uaSWeaa	no u dont need to stand up.
af96mcl1aa	My son does the exact same thing. Especially if i shake my head, he loves to copy me. They think its fun!<br>  <br>  About the head banging, my son also does this, especially when he's tired. I asked his Dr. about it, and she says its a self-soothing mechanism. I wouldn't worry about it, and he will probably grow out of both soon. :)|`|0Sqyt9Jraa	I know how you feel on that one my son is 16 months old and he does the same things and he has been doing it for a while as well. He also will run into things and it will not faze him as well as hit his head on things real hard (hard enough to leave welts) and doesn't even cry. He has a doctors app. coming up next week and I am going to ask about it. I will let you know what the doctor says about it. They are probably just going to say that it is normal that they are boys. But I will let you know any way.|`|CVtmd0h3aa	How long is his hair?  My two year old started doing this when we let his hair grow out because he liked the feeling of it swagging around.  He also puts his head up to things like the wall and to our heads.  I'm not really sure why he does this.  Maybe he is just testing to see how close he can get to something before he touches it.  I guess they have to learn these senses somehow.  Maybe that is how they do it!  My son is perfectly normal though so I'm sure your son is fine too.  Ask your doctor the next time you see them to make sure.|`|fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	totally a normal stage, my son did it too. a lot of times, they love to make themselves dizzy, it's a new feeling. dont you remember spinning and stuff as a kid? also, the banging of his head may be his expression of his feelings, when it hurts, he will stop. just watch that he doesn't accidentally bang his head on anything too hard. relax, it's all apart of the growing up :)|`|5QsOkS5Saa	It's totally normal. My baby has almost 2 and she did that, I think they are exploring their movements.|`|2eoAqicdaa	ha ha :) my little one does that too (14 months) <br>  <br>  Its a way of them showing you affection by putting their head on yours you'll soon be getting cuddles a slobbery kisses from him lol<br>  <br>  He's just learnt that he can move his head side to side give it a month or two then he'll try to nod his head..... sooo funny!!!<br>  <br>  Boys are crazy! lol|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That is definitely something to bring up with his pediatrician at his next well baby visit.   It's not terribly odd, but if it presents with other things it could be an issue.|`|fHjSonssaa	Strangely enough, banging thier heads on something can be soothing to iinfants as long as it's not causing pain.  Strange, I know, but I read this on a parenting website.<br>  <br>   I don't think you have reason to be concerned....unless he has symptoms that indicate something else....he's exploring what he can do- and soothing himself.|`|BRpzCFQlaa	I think it's just normal 1 year old behavior. My son just turned 1 on March 5, and he does these thing too. He especially likes toput his forehead on things. He tries to plow over his 7 month old cousin when he sees her--using his forehead. It's completely normal behavior. They just discover all the different ways their body parts work,and they want to out them to use.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	my friends little boy was doing stuff like that and the DR keep telling them he was fine. until he had a grandma seizure they found out he has mild epilepsy. he might have epilepsy is his eyes rolling back as well? get him checked out just to make sure|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Well he might have discovered what "dizzy" is...and the fore head on things well I did that when I was a baby.
wiAVa1H5aa	Most basic reason - they are fearful and do not comprehend the science, and most who do not vaccinate are well educated - in the arts of course, not the sciences.   Second reason; they're selfish and do not wish to help protect our society.<br>  <br>  This action along with those who drink when trying to conceive or even after finding they are pregnant, boil my blood.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I would rather my child catch the Measles Mumps Rubella naturally and have natural immunity rather than false immunity that wears off in late life. The prognosis for these is good-excellent with only bedrest and fluids.<br>  I don't want to inject my child with chemicals that are proven to be toxic. I don't want to inject my child with aborted fetus,monkey and calf kidney cells.<br>  It is my right as an American citizen to practice my religious beliefs without persecution.<br>  **Selar- I wasn't vaccinated as a child<br>  Ethel-If your vaccines work why do I need to vaccinate my child to protect you? Aren't you already protected since your vaccinated?<br>  ***Thanks Destinee!|`|vGxipYJnaa	No idea. I think it's best to leave the medicine to the medical professionals. Our kids were vaccinated - I'm not a doctor so I don't think it's really my place to go against what's recommended all over the world by thousands of doctors.|`|AA11055057	I never got the flu shot when I was a kid. <br>  And the one year I did, I got the flu. :P|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Some religions like Jehovah Witnesses don't allow blood transfusions or vaccinations. Even if you vaccinate your children, vaccines don't always work and your kids can still get sick even when vaccinated.  Some people may fear that their kids will develop autism if they get vaccinated & they don't want to take that risk.|`|113FoyMFaa	I don't have my kids get the chicken pox vaccination.  That, to me, is just a silly money maker.  Studies show that the chicken pox is a good thing for your child to go through.  It sucks that they get sick, but it helps their immune system learn how to fight.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I'm not having my child vaccinated for chicken pox. I think that is just ridiculous. And I'm not doing the gaurdasil (sp?) shot when she is older either. Some vaccines' risks do not outweigh the benefit.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I did vaccinate my children. There are some parents that wish to avoid these for many reasons... I'll let the ones who are actually doing it explain it all to you!|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	they think that getting the sickness is better then getting the shot|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Some parents do it for religious reasons, and others for health reasons.  Others believe it causes autism, others believe it is unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Selar:  Its not your place to say those parents are irresponsible.

My sister had braces n now they're so straight n white! there's no marks that show she ever had braces.|`|3buQDaRDaa	You need to take a chill pill. Everyday you are freaking out. You are on the road to having an anxiety attack. The white squares will disappear. I don't know what else you asked?|`|GUuFKaaiaa	i know they're not good for your teeth but if you have spots really bad then you can use white strips and then when your white marks are almost gone then you can use the pronamel tooth paste to strengthen ur enamel again since the strips weaken it

I blame it on the weather!<br>  <br>  If you are nervous, definitely call the doctor.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That is not good, if it were my son I'd be calling the doctor for an appointment tomorrow.|`|B0bWrvanaa	sounds like he could be coming down with something, take him to the doctor and see what they say|`|heDtLdz5aa	he could be coming down with a cold maybe? my son sometimes gets a hoarse voice right before he comes down with a cold..
VII5wup3aa	I am in love with your naming style...I've noticed the names before in questions you've asked and answered and I love love love the names of all of them. Very unique and different. And I've wondered what your babies looked like to match those names and honestly even though the only one I know for sure is Lucy....they match them perfectly. You have beautiful babies and gorgeous names. I honestly have no suggestions because you're names are so different that I can't think of anything other than maybe Athena for a girl. So I'm just gonna tell you what I think of the one's you have listed. : ]<br>  <br>   Girls :<br>  Isla Zipporah-- I absolutely love the name Isla, it's on my list. And Zipporah, even though it's very different. The pronunciation comes naturally and it's beautiful and flows very nicely with Isla. <br>  Avis Leontine- I like this, it sounds like a Princess in Shakespeare play, but it's a little out there and hard to pronounce for my taste.<br>  Carys Penelope Rose / Charlotte Amelia- Carys Penelope Rose all the way... Charlotte Amelia just sounds too different from the rest of the names, more plain.<br>  Vivienne Isabelle / Viola Josephine- I like both of these a lot. I would actually mix them into Vivienne Josephine. Josephine is on my list because it's the female version of Joseph which is my fiance's middle name.<br>  <br>  Boys :<br>  Levi Stellan / Stellan Hartley- I'm not a big fan of Levi...but Stellan Hartley is gorgeous.<br>  Henry Atticus- Henry is very old fashioned and not exactly my taste but it has that Shakespeare feel to it like the rest of the names and it sounds amazing with Atticus which my fiance is in love with.<br>  Leo Thaddeus / Gage Thaddeus- I definitely prefer Leo Thaddeus it sounds so good together.<br>  Theodore Benjamin Asher- For some reason this one just doesn't flow right for me. I think it's because it is so long. I like Theodore Benjamin, Benjamin Asher and Theodore Asher.<br>  <br>  Ok, I said I didn't know but I think I'm gonna give it a try, just for the fun of it :]<br>  <br>  Ummmm.....<br>  Girls-- Athena, Journey, Prudence (to go with Lucy),  Antoinette, Calliope<br>  And I like the names Achilles, Amadeus, Emerson, Matthias, Theron, and Alijah for Boys.<br>  <br>  So maybe.....<br>  <br>  Prudence Calliope<br>  Journey Antoinette<br>  & Athena Calypso <br>  <br>  Emerson Achilles<br>  Theron Amadeus<br>  Alijah Beckett<br>  Antonio Matthias<br>  <br>  <br>  Lol I gave it a try...it was fun too. <br>  I really respect your choices in names and love your style the most out of all the names I've seen on here. Amazing names for beautiful babies.<br>  <br>  Good Luck ? Hope I helped : ]|`|CVtmd0h3aa	Your kids are really cute!  I like the name Thaddeus Gage, Isla Zipporah,  Benjamin Asher, Zakiah Gage, and Levi Hartley.  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|NPeKQBtTaa	Ok wow they are some names you have there: i put another spin on it sorry try these:<br>  <br>  Girl: Charlotte Kelly or Amelia Grace<br>  <br>  Boy: Henry Fraser or Asher Hartley|`|CxRJwJsraa	okay, I really LOVE so many of these!!!<br>  <br>  Carys Penelope rose is LOVELY!!! I also really like Charlotte Amelia (I had Charlotte Emilia on my own list)<br>  <br>  Stellan Hartley is sooooo handsome!!! Henry Atticus is nice too, and fits really well. Leo Thaddeus is great (I LOVE Thaddeus). and well, Theodore Benjamin Asher is AMAZING, but a bit lengthy compared to the others.<br>  <br>  I guess if FORCED, absolutely forced to pick. I'd go with Carys Penelope Rose and Leo Thaddeus.<br>  <br>  but man, I'm really in love with those boy names.|`|qv3W0MDJaa	First off, your children are gorgeous!<br>  Next, I like that you are trying to be 'different' and a little creative with names but I honestly don't think your daughter would be happy with the middle name Zipporah,you know?<br>  Try mixing and matching: Isla Leontine, Charlotte Josephine, Vivienne Rose, Avis Amelia/Josephine Amelia?<br>  <br>  Boys:-<br>  I LOVE Levi Stellan and Stellan Hartley (though the latter reminds me of a car,god knows why)<br>  and Theodore Benjamin Asher sounds highly efficient. I think of an army general or something like that. Someone in-charge.<br>  <br>  You seem to particularly like Ancient Greek culture...Atticus and Thaddeus. I wouldn't recommend christening your son anything like that though,sorry.|`|yv94euDBaa	Beautiful names for beautiful kids. I love your naming style.<br>  <br>  I'd have to say, Charlotte Amelia, but I love the name Josephine.<br>  <br>  Josephine Charlotte would be the best.<br>  <br>  And for a boy, I love Atticus, so Henry Atticus. Henry is very elegant. Although I think Theodore or Atticus would match best with your other children's names.<br>  <br>  Atticus Henry & Josephine Charlotte.<br>  <br>  If they were my kids i'd name them, <br>  <br>  Elliot Atticus & Ingrid Blythe|`|DP48dIxhaa	Your kids are absolutely adorable! No joke...theyy are the cutest kids I've seenn in a while. And I love the names Sebastian Ripleyyy and Jude Michael River.<br>  <br>  For a girl I like Charlotte Amelia, Carys Penelope Rose, Vivienne Isabelle, & Viola Josephine!! My favorite out of those would have 2 be Charlotte Amelia!<br>  <br>  Suggestion: Kaliyah Michelle<br>  <br>  For a boy I like Levi Stellan, Stellan Hartleyy, Henry Atticus, & Theodore Benjaminn Asher. My favorite is Henry Atticus.<br>  <br>  Suggestions: Armani David & Alonso William|`|pHIUUnOiaa	OMGGG your kids are GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow beautiful<br>  Isla Zipporah------ Not my favorite I like Sophie Isabella bettter<br>  Theodore Benjamin Asher---- again not my favorite how about Matthew Joseph??<br>  <br>  Sophie (means wisdom)<br>  matthew (means gift from god)|`|HZjiNEMDaa	Girls :<br>  Vivienne Isabelle / Viola .....

The specifics may change, but the principal doesn't. When setting boundaries, people (often moms) typically confuse setting the boundary with trying to convince the other person about how right they are in needing to set the boundary. In setting boundaries, we don't need to convince the other person we are right and they don't have to agree about the boundary. We just need to be prepared to enforce the boundary, at any cost, using progressively more firm responses (if need be).<br>  <br>  I've found new moms often confuse boundaries and trying to convince someone of the *rightness* of their choices.<br>  <br>  The best thing is to assert your boundary and *not* try to defend your choice.<br>  <br>  Some family and close friend help.....<br>  <br>  First, I learned early on that most of my choices were on a "need to know" basis. Most people don't "need to know". If asked "how is the baby sleeping?" Answer: Great! Thanks for asking! Want some bean dip?<br>  <br>  "Are you sure you should be picking her up every time she cries?" Answer:"Yes! Thank you! Want some bean dip?"<br>  <br>  "When do you plan to wean" Answer: "When she's ready. Thanks! Want some bean dip?"<br>  <br>  Now, with some people you will need to set *firm* boundaries. They will need to be backed up with action (like hanging up, leaving the room or even the event). If it's a pattern of intrusion, for example. Practice kind but firm responses:<br>  <br>  "I know you love us and the baby. We are so glad. Our sleeping choices have been researched and made. I will not discuss it again"<br>  <br>  Also, don't confuse setting boundaries with trying to convince someone of the rightness of your choices. New AP moms often struggle with this. The boundary is that no one else has a right to tell you how to parent and create a hostile environment. You set boundaries by doing the above. Where new moms often invite problems is by citing authors, studies and sites to "defend" themselves. Each time you do so, you create more time for discussion and rebuttal and send the message that your decisions are up for debate. Don't defend your choices beyond generalities, and then only once or twice. "The doctor is in support of our choices. Want some bean dip?"<br>  <br>  Finally, look them in the eye and say simply "I want us to have a good relationship. I want you to *enjoy* the baby. I'll parent the baby - you enjoy them. Let's not discuss this anymore. If you bring it up, I will leave the room."|`|4e67Pdfvaa	In my opinion (and that is the point of "answers") Nurse your baby as long as you want and ignore them.... however... YOur baby DOES need food also now! I strongly suggest to call your doctor and ask him, he will say the same thing.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Because 1 year old seems like universal thing.. at 1 year they can have whole milk.. so people assume you quit breastfeeding then as well.. <br>  <br>  Just say you will be the mom with the 8 year old still nursing and they will bug off lol :) <br>  <br>  Best wishes...|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I've been getting the same question from my husband's family since my baby was born. His mom is deceased and his dad is not a big part of his life, so his grandparents are his main family. His grandma actually told me once that I was "selfish" for breastfeeding because at a family get together I had to go in another room to nurse my daughter. I think it's because they just don't get it, you know? <br>  <br>  My daughter is 11 months, and I'm not planning to stop breastfeeding anytime soon. We don't see his family much, but I can't wait until the next family get together (probably Easter), so I can proudly proclaim that I am still breastfeeding my daughter. It will probably freak them out, but at this point I'm ready for whatever they have to say!|`|IlIjGTdiaa	I understand how annoying it must be, but on some level I think they are just trying to make conversation with you about something that is 'you'. Do they really think you should stop now or is that just the impression that you get? If they bring it up, educate them gently on the benefits of breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  It's not like you're a formula mum who knows they're not doing a good thing and has to keep defending it.<br>  <br>  Be proud you're giving your baby the best start in life. Kudos to you!|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Probably because they have not breastfed their children, or did and didnt love it.  You have a plan, stick to it its what you feel is best for your child, and it is!<br>  <br>  I would be blunt!  (and i am a very shy person) just so you dont have to deal with the questions.  Say, i will stop when I feel MY child is ready, he is a baby Im not going to bf him forever, just untill it is time for us to stop.  Please stop asking me, its annoying.  Its really none of their business.|`|hdzlWALdaa	ur baby.. ur rules! u r DEFINATELY not harming ur child in any way so i dnt see the point of stoppin just cos others think u should. my mum breastfed my bro for at least 2.5yrs n even though she was called a "cow" by my aunt it still dint stop her. she let my bro wean off when he was ready.<br>  <br>  if i wer u i would def not stop for the sake of ur in laws n prob do it right in front of them.<br>  <br>  tc n ignore any silly comments! xxx|`|CzKrqgmgaa	maybe they are jealous youve been able to so long?<br>  or maybe they are hoping to get a chance to feed the baby... but at 15 months its probably not going to happen, he'll feed himself when you choose to wean him...<br>  <br>  i just have to add that your picture is sooo cute! i love the hair!|`|z6IekuwSaa	Ignore them. I wouldn't even stress yourself out to have a set age when you're going to stop. Just do what feels natural to you. It's only helping him|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i guess it because people excepted mum's to only breast feed up till the baby a year but it is your decision in the end as long as your happy then that's the mean thing|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	I had this same issue- our daughter self-weaned at 26 months old. I will never understand why people think it is ok to put their 2 cents in regarding parenting where it is not warranted and has not been requested. <br>  <br>  I only said, "When she is ready, she will wean." <br>  The kicker was when I became pregnant again and THEN it really started! I ignored it and carried on. You know what is best for your child- you do. You do not need to validate it for anyone. If they have issues with it- bombard their email with links to facts on the good that extended nursing does for a baby and toddler. <br>  Hugs!|`|WT56iKwZaa	They are just nosy.You can  answer them , ignore them or tell them it is none of their business. Don't let it get to you. Do what is best for you, your baby and immediate family|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	rude rude rude. you wean when mommy and baby are ready and no sooner. i did not breastfeed but i cannot stand it when people are so hung up about what and how someone elses baby is eating. boobie feed away! btw, i am sure you are giving him solids, and if you can give 'regular' milk or formula and solids than why not breastmilk?|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Tell them to ask you again when the flu is wiped out for good.
56a572fde5f78c1444702e92a41b54faaa	Found this to verify first answer:<br>  <br>  First trimester bleeding is any vaginal bleeding during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding may vary from light spotting to severe bleeding with clots. Vaginal bleeding is a common problem in early pregnancy, complicating 20-30% of all pregnancies. <br>  <br>  During the first weeks of conception, the fertilized egg is constantly burrowing into the soft lining of the uterus. Even after the pregnancy is confirmed, this process of implantation continues for several more days, sometimes even a week. As the egg burrows, small blood vessels can burst, causing a small amount of bleeding to occur. <br>  <br>  This blood can take days to reach the vaginal opening. Once it does, the blood is usually brown. When women experience bleeding and spotting in the first trimester, brown blood is the most common type that they find. Brown blood can be considered "old" blood, that was most likely caused by implantation<br>  <br>  Relax, darlin' and enjoy your pregnancy--you are going to have a gorgeous baby!!<br>  <br>  Sincerely, <br>  <br>  Deaun|`|mgiJVjaKaa	It could go either way. for most women, spotting is completely normal. But in some, it is an indication of a problem. Nobody on here will know which it is for you. I'd recommend you call your doctor just to be on the safe side :) Also, ask the doctor about lifting your son. A lot of pregnant women have toddlers, but my doctors told me to be extra-cautious about how i carry even my backpack (12 lbs)<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|8VKRcJmYaa	In many books its normal its a common symptoms but I would go for a checkup if I were you just to make sure everythings okay|`|gZcXQnTYaa	Im pretty sure its ok, but i would just call your doctors office in the morning to see what they think...
ntdGOZqGaa	Yea its normal, the baby adds so much pressure on everything and your body is making room and growing for the baby. You will notice as you get further along that you will have all sort of pains down there, and even pains in your tummy due to round ligament pain, all your legaments stretching to make room for baby. As long as you arent having contraction and no bleeding you are more then likely ok. Good luck and congrats on the baby.|`|kgcTdberaa	you have a lemon sized fetus sitting on your bladder and your ligaments are stretching out to make room for baby. im also 15 weeks pregnant(my 2nd pregnancy) and im currently going through the same things, being uncomfortable during pregnancy is very very normal
fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	oh ya, with both my kids i just "knew". it's just a mom thing, i think. i knew that my son was a boy, just in my heart and i only chose boy names. then i found out he was a boy and it explained all my cravings! my daughter i knew would be a girl because it was just a different feeling from the beginning. GOOD LUCK!|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Well I don't feel pregnant. But I feel like I'm not going to get my period this month.  I just feel different from all the other months. I threw up a few days ago and woke up feeling nauseous and felt like i was going to throw up earlier this morning and have had bad headaches. Plus my temperature has been up, my husband says I feel hot for the past week. So IDK. I've been TTC 29 periods and 29 months.  LMP was 2/2/2009.|`|k3V2CA81aa	I have had that intuition a few times...unfortunately, I am still sitting here, 18 months into TTC and waiting to do IVF = (|`|WZQKevt8aa	Yes, that happened to me and I wasn't TTC. I just thought about a week before my period was due that I was pregnant with a boy and I was right!! (He is nearly 2 now). I didn't even have any nausea or had missed a period or anything when I first suspected I was pregnant, I didn't get nausea until a few days later and then I tested when I was 4 days late.|`|jPnXGIZNaa	For some reason I can always sense that I am pregnant and i always tell my bf that im pregnant and he never believe til he sees the positive test!<br>  Usually my breast feel full and heavy, I have different CM then normal, and of course I miss my period.<br>  <br>  All the best of luck! and baby dust|`|AIskV0efaa	good luck to you and i hope yor right!!
6Z4fKZ8aaa	You are most fertile after a miscarriage and after giving birth.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	very very good|`|AIskV0efaa	like huge. they say the first 6 weeks after giving birth is when your most fertal
AA10595519	All I know is one and one makes us. :-)<br>  <br>  Grats on the baby. I just wanted to say something funny to make you laugh.|`|AA11724307	They usually go from the first day of your last period...but there are things to consider too.  How long is your cycle normally?  Because that can affect it.  I am 6w4d and my last period was Jan 22....I normally have about a 24-26 day cycle and ovulate around day 12...now lets say someone elses last period was Jan 22 too but they have a longer cycle and ovulate later...like say day 18...now I would be almost a week farther along then they would...but my last period was the same day as theirs....does that make sense?|`|HEdGGmkhaa	No one knows really, they go on measurements of limbs, development of the brain and such so your date will change a couple of times depending on that. I would just go with the date of your last period, as the doc did and leave it at that. Either way no one can pin point the day and there will be a baby in 31-32 weeks or so so thats that!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|h1AIzD9baa	go by the ultrasound.. it goes by development and measurments..  but you count 40 weeks from ovulation or 38 weeks from lmp..|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Ok here we go...the first day of your last period+40 weeks.... the ultra sound is technically right because we all ovulate differently..get it?|`|AA12065322	first day of last period.minus 3 months and add 7 days that will give you your due date.|`|a886990db3da72f9049b5468f25f3bdcaa	I would go with the ultra sound since they can physically see how far along you are. without seeing the baby or placenta on development it would just be a guess...|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Go by the ultrasound. They check for abnormalities and whatnot when they give you one but ultrasounds also more accurately give you age of the fetus. The ultrasound is better than what they said in the beginning or whenever you thought you had your period. Mine changed a couple of times in the beginning because apparently I didnt even know the day I got preg and missed my period. They even changed the due date by a day. From the 21st of may to the 22nd. So yeah ultrasounds are better answers.|`|765eZqh7aa	I'm a nurse and the way you do it is... the first day of your last menstual cycle, minus 3 months, then minus 7 days. Your estimated due date should be around September 26. Also the gestational age my be different from the actual fetal age. The Ultrasound gave you the fetal age, your doctor probably just gave you the gestational age, which is used to determine your due date.|`|g2elB8eDaa	they always go by the first day of your last period for your due date. However your due can change depending on the ultrasounds. It is way too early to change a due date for you yet. as long as you baby looks healthy is all that matters. Good Luck and a happy pregnancy to you.|`|8Og11giIaa	Early on in pregnancy i.e when you had your ultrasuond at 6 weeks all babies are exactly the same size, you cannot have a small measuring baby at this early stage.<br>  <br>  Because of this the ultrasound date is more accurate because they get the dates by measurement. <br>  <br>  The last menstrual period date is found by taking the first day of your last menstrual period subtracting 3 months and adding 7 days, it is a very generalised estimate because the egg doesnt necessarily implant in your uterus on the first day of your last menstrual period and when the egg implants is when the fetus starts growing. <br>  <br>  I would say you are 8 weeks 2 days.
pXSKSS3daa	It is absolutely necessary. My son weighed 19 lbs. at 6 months but, now, at 11 months he weighs about 23 lbs. It seemed like he put weight on quickly until around 7 months and now it's been slow.<br>  <br>  Formula is your baby's main source of nutrition until they are a year in age. I wouldn't worry about your son's weight right now.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes it is necessary- babies need formula or breast milk until they are at least a year. weight has nothing to do with it, nutrition does. and those baby foods don't have as much as he needs right now. also, babies need fats for good brain development|`|3Hm5eJfVaa	He's fine. This is about what my kids weighed at that age. And they were great eaters too. Consider yourself lucky. As long as he is growing normal for him then it fine. Bet he is in the top percentiles. Also this is when they gain weight rapidly. It will slow down when he gets between 9 months and a year. I agree with your doctor. He still need the nutrients from the formula. And he is not fat. Bet he is adorable.|`|heDtLdz5aa	omg yes!!! formula is the most important part of his diet right now...and by the way at 6 months my son weighed 21 ibs....once they become more mobile they don't gain as much...please please please continue to give your baby the 24 oz of formula a day...baby food does not have all the nutrients in it that formula does..|`|fHjSonssaa	Cut back on the baby food.<br>  YES he needs that much formula- that's where he gets his nutrients from.<br>  The formula is much more important at this stage than the purees/baby food.<br>  Or don't even cut back on the food- if your DR is OK with your baby's weight....|`|322206d55c7830caeac75028ac7e109caa	My nephew is 16lbs and only 3 months old! The doc has no problems with that.  They will burn the fat!  It is essential that he get all of teh minerals and vitamins and nurtients from that 24 oz of formula|`|JjU4L8L7aa	my 5 month old is almost 20lbs. but hes 30 inches long, so he isnt chubby at all hes very lanky and im 5'9 and 130 and my hubby is 6'5 and 270 so i figure he'll be big...i was a really chubby baby but once i started moving i got rail thin and have stayed that way, so you dont know what your baby will turn out like,once he starts moving he may "thin out" too, and docs usually say that breastmilk or formula should still be theyre main source of nutrition at this point, my boy is eating oatmeal and a fruit in the morn and rice and veggie in afternoon and still about 36 ounces of formula too... i wouldnt worry too much if he wants to eat that much you should let him,  if it becomes a problem in the future then do something about it...chubby babies are cute anyway
TYErFAAzaa	I think you handled it perfectly!<br>  <br>  I also am having this problem with my 28 month old.  She just gets up.  She doesn't worry about taking the belt off.  I spank her for it becuse like you said I would rather her bottom hurt then her be dead.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	yes, she deserved a spanking. when my daughter was three, she used to run across our road with out looking. i told her once not to do it, the second time she did it, she got spanked. she never ran across the road again.|`|7Yzgoowkaa	i think spanking should not be done quite often but shall be done as a last measure only, just warn him.|`|wRHhpanmaa	my son went through that phase... <br>  my uncle, who is a police officer, showed him his handcuffs and told him that if he got out of his seat, that he would give him a ticket.and he would get in lots of trouble. they would put him in a big playpen with no toys and no friends.<br>  <br>  he never stood up again. Its good they know it is wrong, but i dont condone physical punishment, as i was abused as a child. all parents are different, and although spanking is not immoral, i just prefer not to discipline my child that way.<br>  <br>  you could go to the police station one day, and have an officer talk to him about getting out of his seatbelt, how he could get in big trouble. often times, they even do school presentations (day care) to express how bad it is to get out of your seatbelt.<br>  <br>  perhaps you could lightly tap your brakes? that would scare her enough to where she would put her seatbelt back on. all in all, i think you handled it very well.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	It is, if you believe that hitting her will not be teaching her to hit other children, to discipline them if they take a toy.<br>  <br>  Have you ever just thought about praising her for keeping her seat buckled.  Sometimes parents just forget to focus on the obvious, positive things kids do everyday.  And then kids do things that get attention, any kind.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Good on you mum. Yes it's fine that you spanked her bottom and if it where me I would have done the same. Better her have a red butt than no butt at all. And for every one who said you shouldn't spank your children your children more than likely run your house hold and have very little respect for you or any one else. I only spank my children when I have tried every thing else and when they get it they know I am dead serious and they stop.|`|t5tU3Xe8aa	I think you did GREAT!  I'm a firm beliver in spanking but ONLY once everything else has been tried of course, and yes I agree to everybody who does not spank and have kids that are running their house and have no respect....good luck once those kids hit teen years!  Your gonna HATE it!!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Is she still in a car seat, or is she in a booster with a regular seat belt?  If she's in a regular belt, you might want to consider putting her back in the car seat so that she can't unbuckle herself.  That would be the safest option, IMO.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I had this problem with my daughter as well, and handled it vey much the same way. It only took one spanking for her to learn about the importance of having your seat belt fastened till the car comes to a complete stop.<br>  You handled this perfectly. And you are, right, as few smacks on the hiney are so much better than serious injury from hitting the windshield!|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I think u handled it just fine. <br>  She needs to learn to stay in her seat!!<br>  A little sting is nothing compared to a broken bone--or worse!!

However, sperm can live up to 72 hours inside of you. So it is always possible to still get pregnant if you are ovulating soon.

Say you start on March 1st then you will be most fertile around the 14th. But not just on the fourteeth. Usually two days before and about two days after.  So the 12th through the 16th you would probably be fertile.

Introducing you to her is like sealing the friendship and making sure everybody knows exactly where they stand, just so there's no uncomfortable doubt.<br>  <br>  ...Or, it's just possible that he may be preparing to invite you for some three-way fun with his girlfriend. He and his girlfriend will already have worked this out with each other and naturally she'll want to check you out first before deciding if they should make you the offer.<br>  <br>  I guess only time will tell. It won't hurt to at least meet her, they may be a perfectly genuine friendly couple with no strings attached. Just keep in mind that he's spoken for.

zSEJC6vZaa	Well, as you noted, there are no easy answers.  You have a tough path ahead of you but you sound like a very determined person and that determination will help you get through it.<br>  <br>  When I taught high school, I had several students who were pregnant.  It's completely possible to go to school while pregnant, but after the baby comes, you'll definitely need help, especially if you plan on continuing your studies.  Someone needs to watch the baby while you are in class.<br>  <br>  While I know it's tough living under one roof with your parents, if they are willing to support you, I'd swallow my pride and do it for awhile.  At the very least, wait until your boyfriend has finished school, landed a job, and you guys have saved enough for a down payment.  If you are determined to get out of your parents' house, you might need to put your dreams of law school on hold, at the very least, b/c law school tuition is expensive. <br>  <br>  You have to think about what is best for your baby at this point and s/he will need a stable home.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't lose sight of your dreams.  You are young and I commend you for having goals and plan.  Get advice from mature, responsible people that you trust.  If you can, talk to teenage moms to make sure that this is something you are willing to do.  You may need to sacrifice a lot, but it may be worth it to you.<br>  <br>  Just be realistic and take it a day at a time.|`|993828fb52767f45cfd24d17879210e5aa	You should become what you've always wanted to. But for right now take something temperary. Move into an apartment that you can afford. Go to school part time. You have to just move a little slower than planned becasue your prego (congrats) but youll get there.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie. I'm 18 and I'm 16 weeks too :) You can email me sometime if you want someone to talk to as we go through all the different stages of pregnancy. All I can tell you is to try not to stress and figure out everything now. You don't have to make the decision right now. Its very good that you're looking out for your family. I wish I could tell you what to do but you really gotta follow your heart on this one. I don't think that a career in psychology is lowering your standards very much; they are well-paid and well-respected. Good luck I'm sorry you're stressed out but remember part of its the hormones ;)|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	You are 17 years old and having a baby.  Have you considered adoption, it might be the best thing for your child.  Then you can pursue the career that you want, and consider having a family when you are actually ready for one.  Buying a house with a boyfriend is a very bad idea, you should wait on that one until you have said "I do".|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i say you are thinking of too much all at once..best bet is to tackle on hurdle at a time..right now your hurdle is to have a healthy pregnancy and baby..next care for baby till baby can go to day care and you can go to school..by that time you will be able to just take some classes until you see another opportunity. if you try to solve life in one day you will just drive your self crazy. one day at a time honey
c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Pretty good chance of ovulating if you have missed 3 pills in a row.  Wait and see if you get a period next month.
AA11865529	The trembling is probably chills. Put her in a lukewarm bath to bring down the temperature. If the trembling is intermittent it could be a seizure, common in babies with fevers. <br>  <br>  There's all kinds of viruses little kids can have, so it's hard to say exactly what it is. But bringing down her temperature will help a lot.|`|2eoAqicdaa	How long has she had this temp for? <br>  Best to be safe... go down ER/A&E asap <br>  <br>  The trembling and her being lathargic is quite worrying<br>  <br>  If you feel you dont need to go down to the hospital just yet give her some calpol then 2 hours after give her some childrens nurofen, keep the room dark and cool and give her extra cuddles <br>  <br>  P.S<br>  Wouldn't be a good idea to put her in the bath for now...<br>  The sudden change in temp could cause a seizure <br>  Best way to cool her down is get a damp flannel and apply it to the pressure points (wrists and ankles)<br>  <br>  By putting the flannel on the head can cause a seizure too as the gland in the forehead (which controls her temp) will think that she's cooler then she is so her temp will rise again<br>  <br>  <br>  Offer her cool drinks and keep a close eye on her <br>  <br>  Hope shes okai x|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Sounds like a bad cold or flu. You can give her Tylenol to bring down the fever so she can get some rest tonight.|`|DdLfaEzNaa	The flu. It's not always respiratory.  And it is flu season still.  Make her comfortable (give IBUprofen, acetaminophen, cool damp cloth on forehead, etc.), but definitely discuss your concerns with your doctor tomorrow.  You can alternate the two drugs above as close together as every 3 hours.  You can always call your doctor to ask how much to give and how often and tell her/him that you will be in tomorrow for a checkup, but you just want to make her comfortable until then.  My children, at the toddler stage, were sometimes prone to quite high temperatures but I found I was able to control them using the aforementioned methods.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	She has a virus, I hope that's all, there has been viral pneumonia in our house with those symptoms with the addition of a cough and wheezing.   Give her ibuprofen or tylenol to cut her fever - you can do ibuprofen and then in 3 hours tylenol, 3 hours after that ibuprofen again and then in 3 hours tylenol to cut her fever.   If she at any time is having a hard time breathing take her to the ER, if she stops breathing call 911.<br>  <br>  I should add my sons have had the flu vaccine this season - it was pneumonia that sent us to the hospital, the titer was not flu.|`|5888e071a9dc3c4fb97d89fb36010fc2aa	Take her to the emergency room now.  It could be really serious.  meningitis or something like that.|`|3sriJtSkaa	I would take my child to the emergency room right away. My high school best friend had bacterial meningitis when he was 2 years old and his mom called the doctor reporting exactly the same symptoms as your daughter and had an appointment scheduled for the following morning, she called twice to tell the doctor that he really seemed "off" and the doctor said just to wait and come to the appointment the following morning, finally at 4am she took him to the ER becasue she couldn't shake the "mother's intuition" that something was wrong. the meningitis had progressed so far that he had suffered irreperabe brain damage that left him profoundly deaf for the rest of his life. If she had taken him to the ER when she first felt something was wrong he would be able to hear today. <br>  <br>  GO TO THE ER. <br>  lethargy is never a good sign.|`|0g4ZsFfiaa	the trembling is because of the fever.. and so is the lethargy. the runny nose suggests an upper respiratory tract infection. so unless u start noticing some marked changes e.g. continuous severe crying, high grade fever that is never decreasing or a seizure, then you should not worry too much.<br>  it's good that the u're going to see the Doc tomorrow to make sure there is nothing really to worry about.<br>  <br>  hope she gets well soon|`|wUWvO5r6aa	Is really sad to see them like that but MOTRIN is great give to her every 4 hours you could even give tylenol an hour later after the motrin trust me is going to overdose her our anything like that. This time my little princess got really sick on me it lasted a whole week after my kids dr said it was ok.|`|EsXe7S1oaa	girl i would go straight to the er or at least call the pediatrician on call. the trembling and lethargy isnt good....good luck
FGuzsRpJaa	I don't know but in my town there's this free thing for when you don't have money. Like a non profit organization. But I'm warning you that your girlfriend has a high chance on getting a physiological  problem. about 7 to 10 women get it when they have abortion.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Cheapest abortion? -- GOOD luck trying to find that.<br>  <br>  Shoulda wore a condom.|`|HAueVh8Naa	that is disgusting maybe you should use a condom or not have sex at all|`|CpiLHcTlaa	wow... your a KEEPER!<br>  <br>  thx for the two points btw.. troll..|`|UDqGezOnaa	You shouldn't kill a baby just because it was on accident because in the end you'll probably be like "It was so worth it". At least if your not going to keep it then give it to another couple who can't have babies. And there is no cheapest abortion place. They all cost money.LOTS of $$. I hope I answered your question well.<br>  God Bless!|`|NpornPihaa	I would keep the baby wait unless your really Young|`|1DX1KvGkaa	Dont be having sex if your not ready for a child duh!|`|c5AJGcYcaa	are you serious!?

WT56iKwZaa	When I was born....years ago...my mom kept my dad and grandparents busy building a cradel. It is now a family heiloom that all of my kids and now my grandaughter have used. If you don't have a wood working area they can decorate the nursery, refinish a crib or rocking chair, wallpaper,or  sew curtains.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Spencers mommy has some great ideas! I would ask mom in advance, like, mom I miss your cooking so much, will you do me the honor of preparing all the meals why you are here!!  I would pick them up a few gift cards for dinners at local restaurants too, to get them out of the house. WIll they be driving your car or renting one? If they will be driving, forget some things like extra sheets or towels for baby and send them on thier way shopping too. Ask his parents to help with inviting them over so you can have some time alone, or good friends or neighbors. Good luck, its hard dealing with situations like this, you might wind up having to just deal with it to not insult them. Noone wants to accidently find out after spending all that money, their presence isnt appriciated, so it could be you altering your lifestyle for them.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	have you painted the nursery? and set up the crib and all that kind of stuff?<br>  <br>  have them decorate the babys room for you. it will get a big chore off your list of things to do and help them feel involved in the baby without having to be by your side all the time...<br>  <br>  set them on cooking duty so you dont have to worry about it and request a bunch of lasagnas and pails of soup in the deep freeze for after they leave... that'll keep them busy!!|`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	You should never miss an opportunity to be "fussed over".  Sit there and lap it up like a cat laps cream.  Maybe the time before the baby comes will help you and your own parents bond a little better.  As for when you're in the hospital, tell your doctor how you feel and ask him if he will give a limited visits order.  Your parents wouldn't have to know.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Just sit them down and talk to them, they will understand. If this is their first grandchild this may be the link to getting your family closer together. Try getting them involved in the preparations for the baby, it might help.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	If it isnt to late, i would ask them to wait untill the baby is born, and come after.  They would be much more help.  It is always nice to have help AFTER the baby is here...imo.  You really need time to adjust and get to know your baby and get into a routine before having them stay with you for a month.  <br>  <br>  If that isnt possible, I would just talk to them, maybe now on the phone and tell them you are glad they will be with you when your baby is born.  But you and your husband have decided it would be best for you and the baby if you had X amt of time alone with the baby in the hospital, like morning and evening.  You are nervous and need to get to know the baby and what he/she will be like and need to bond. Something like painting the nursery, in my opinion wouldnt be appropriate, and what if the baby is early.  I would ask them to do grocery shopping, forget...wink..wink, some baby items that they would need to pick up for you.  You could ask them to start a baby photo book for you.  gather all the pictures you have from throughout your pregnancy, the sonagrams, baby shower pics, pictures in the hopspital (they can get them developed) and make a scrap book.  Get those cute scrap booking stickers and thingys that go with scrapbooking.  get pics of you and hubby when you were born to put in it.<br>  When my sil had her baby I decorated her house.  I got balloons, welcome home banner.  Developed pics from the hospital of the baby and mom and dad and the baby and put some in frames.  I also got oak tag and made a welcome home picture calloge with baby stickers, it took a while to gather all the stuff i needed and I had fun doing it and she loved it and was surprised.  You could ask your husband to ask them to do this for you, it wont be a surprise but it will be something they do for you and take up time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, a month is a long time.|`|zReKPmgJaa	I had my daughter 5 weeks ago and I welcome any help from my parents or my mother in law.  Trust me, you will need and appreciate all the help you can get in the next several weeks.  You can always go to your bedroom with the baby to breastfeed, rest or just bond.  <br>  <br>  With that being said, have them do all the chores that you can not do.  I.E. cleaning, cooking, if you have any pets... taking care of them.  Any shopping you will have.  It will be nice to have them around too just to hold the baby for an hour or two while you nap, eat or shower.  A shower is a BLESSING during this time!!  Lol... <br>  <br>  Good luck, and congratulations!!

6Z4fKZ8aaa	Implantation Bleeding:<br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  <br>  Delay/Difference in Menstruation:<br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation.|`|DiqDCZU4aa	with both my pregnancies i started having symtoms at 6/7 weeks, every womans different some of the signs can also be pre menstural symptoms so i guess the only real accurate symtom is a missed period, than i'd get a pregnancy test... good luck|`|h4UzjZVnaa	I've seen many women get them VERY early. I am trying and 9dpo and I've had symptoms of headaches everyday for over a wk straight. With those headaches, follows dizziness and my temp rises, my face and ears feel so hot!

Have you had any symptoms?|`|jPnXGIZNaa	I think my body usually tricks me into thinking I have symptoms before I really have symptoms!! But I can always tell something is up when my CM continues after ovulation and it is watery.

Now at almost 7 weeks...I still pee often, but not as much as I was, I'm tired, my back hurts, I get cramps, my boobs weigh about 300 lbs each and I crave foods that make me sick when I eat them...yeah...lovely huh?

vygYFdsSaa	Tender breasts are usually the first recognizable symptom of pregnancy. They, along with the bloating and cramping, could also be attributed to your period. Have you taken a test yet?|`|JlG8XgDvaa	I never had sore breats durning my periods so the best indicator for me was the tender breasts. Other wise it was the extreme fatigue I had for about a week.

22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	I would be with the same guy, maybe a different job (i would have finished my second degree that I was working towards when I found out I was preg)...We would be living somewhere different cause we only move to this apartment cause we had her..maybe we'd have a house by now. I would have a lot more free time to finish my projects, like cross-stitching and scrapbooking...model making and cooking...stuff I don't really get to anymore..Also, the biggest thing, my blood pressure wouldn't be high, and i wouldn't be on crazy meds. <br>  but I would never ever give her up for any of that. She was totally worth it....because she's my first, last and only :) (unless we adopt)|`|IU4uNH97aa	well I'd probably be working and not a stay at home mom. I would have probably opened up more stores and be more involved in the hands on aspect of all my stores and everything. I probably would have traveled more and would be living in a different place other then the same town i grew up in. But I am almost for certain that i would be with the same man.<br>  <br>  All those things though i would give them up in a heart beat for my kids, They are more then worth it.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Gosh its so hard to think back to the time before I had my son and being pregnant with this baby...weird seems like my life wasnt mine lol. Guess I would be bored, funny how now I consider my life before as boring, but when I think back it kinda was. I worked, partied,drank stayed up super late went back to work and would do it all over again.

Most moms would let you know about their experience.<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking in the phone book and calling.  Most hospitals have Reps that can give you a tour of the maternity ward.|`|oi41hGUEaa	If you have a babby you should defiantly have a hospital to putt the babby ewhen thay are sick to show tha t the doctors ahould look at the babby and you should feed it as we;ll.
IybV1Enwaa	Doctors had told me that baby's body sometimes can not maintain uniform temperature and head becomes hotter than other body parts. Eventually it will go away. So I did not worry much. My daughter used to have this when she was very little.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Its because all the heat is lost from the top of the head, that is why in the winter especially a baby needs to wear a cap, so they don't lose their body heat.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	lol
eKtEWrcmaa	First you need to find out for certain if you are or are not pregnant. <br>  <br>  A family friend found out at 46 that she was pregnant. They had been married for nearing 20 years, had 3 kids aged 16-11 and didn't want any kids. His vasectomy failed. They were very upset at first and cried for quite some time over it. this was not in their plans. After the shock wore off though they started to come around to the idea and now have a darling little girl. It changed their life plans but sometimes we are thrown a curve ball and its the best thing that could happen.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant you need to just get it out there and tell your husband. Don't make any rash decisions about the pregnancy until the shock/initial emotions have calmed down and you can think rationally again.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	First do not worry yourself with telling him until you get the results that confirm that you are pregnant.  If you are pregnant just tell him that you got the results from the doctor and they confirm that you are pregnant.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	If you don't have the test results yet, don't freak.  If they do come out positive, you need to sit down with your husband and decide what you want to do.  I am 36 and pregnant with my first, my husband has 2 kids from a previous marriage ages 25 and 20, we were both very surprised, but are now very excited.|`|afT6vw8faa	aww My mums the same as you but she had my sister at 35 so yeah and now I am 18 so yeah... but i was 13 umm I have nothing wrong with it its become a fashion or women having them in there 40's and that's when some women are most fertile believe it or not its been over the news and all... <br>  I think you should do what you feel is best I am 18 Pregnant 13 weeks it was an accident condom broke etc but I dont believe in abortion and I am sure I can do it with my mothers support so I think your husband should support you with your choice just remember its completely up to you =]<br>  good luck xo|`|HZESgWC1aa	Well that is a decision you can make once you know your results...If you are pregnant, you should feel comfortable telling him and ask him for his opinion about keeping it, financial, support, the future.......however, don't' let that be your only choice. If u really want this baby then keep it regardless of what he wants. Maybe if you are pregnant you guys should go out to dinner away from the kids and some quality time so you can tell him....you should be comfortable since hes been ur hubby for 20 years.
I6Mu849Daa	that gift will be perfect.  I am having a little boy but I think that gift is super cute. Great choice!|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	My son got a little security blanket and he LOVES is.  <br>  <br>  The one you picket is beautiful.  I think it will be great by itself, maybe you can add a thoughtful note to the baby with it saying how much you hope they will like it.|`|WT56iKwZaa	Sure it is. I got one of those for my grandaughter when she was born and it is her favorite thing (besides mommy and daddy)|`|XSol0H6Uaa	It's cute but I would have to consider the safety factor.  I wouldn't give it to my baby.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	I don't see why not, but if you're in doubt, maybe you could pick up a few less expensive items to go along with it that you know the mommy to be will want or need.  It's not a "see who can get the biggest gift shower"  it's a baby shower.
TwXJS1thaa	I'm anemic.

Running in the family doesn't have much to do with it. It is mainly that you don't have enough iron.|`|jHUAfrojaa	That doesn't sound like anemia. Anemia is the lack of iron in your body. That means you are excessively tired, bruise easily, always wanting to sleep. I am a SEVERE anemic. I have to be on like three different pills. You might be getting ready to start your period. I get massive headaches when I get my period. Birth control fixed that for me though.|`|F7tyzrMzaa	You could be. I'm anaemic and I get light headed with headaches all the time. Do you? I'm pretty sure someone told me if under your eyes there is white then that can be a sign. I do recommend you go to your doctor and have some blood work done. That's how they found out I have anaemia, after I fainted at school. Very embarrassing.|`|61d84956c9b9dcb3900b945b41d23cc4aa	Alright. I'm anemic, and pretty much it's only bad when I'm on my period or I don't get a lot to eat that day. I'm really skinny, about 103 pounds, 16 years old. 5'8" tall. :/<br>  Soo, if I don't get enough food in my system, my iron gets too low and I've passed out, started shaking very badly, etc. However, I've tried taking iron supplements but it conflicts with my depression meds, so I just try to eat very good sized meals every day. :]<br>  And I don't think not getting your period has anything to do with being anemic.<br>  <br>  You don't sound anemic to me, but if you're worried, talk to your doctor. :]|`|E7ViD8EWaa	That doesn't sound like Anemia to me, but if you are worried, go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  =]|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear friend Stace...<br>  <br>  I really can't believe you're asking the same Q. for "a zillion" times over and over again....Do you get "stars" for it -or- "something free"???? -smile-<br>  <br>  I've told you to get a CBC (Complete blood count) dome at your physician.

A junior in high school, and I just got my first one this year.<br>  I mainly got one because I have a job, am driving and am dating, sooo I feel safer with one.<br>  However, if your parents keep objecting suggest a 'Pay-as-you-go' cell phone. It's a regular cell phone, however you can buy it at Walmart, Target, a regular cell phone service place, etc, and there's not contract. You buy one, and whenever you want more minutes, you buy cards that have anywhere from 60-400 minutes. I bought one of these phones, and it was like a $50 phone, but it has 'double minutes' so if I buy a 60 minute card for $20, for example, I get 120 minutes instead. :D<br>  It auto-doubles. :]]<br>  I use tracfone.<br>  There are lots of different types, just google it. :]<br>  Do your research before approaching your parents, print off pages if you want. It makes you more prepared and makes your argument stronger. :]
nZVTHKNwaa	I kinda experienced this as well. If your baby gets himself into a strange position, that could easily cause you some discomfort. There were times my son was either pushing against my ribs or jamming his feet into them and that did hurt a bit. I'm glad you clarified that you are not in horrible pain, but simply that you notice it when it happens. I'm sure that's just the baby pressing on part of your insides that you're just not used to.|`|57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	I can't say that it hurts when my little girl moves.  It did hurt though when she turned into a downward facing position.  There was so much pressure and pain, I thought I was in labor!  When they do big movements like that, my doctor said it can be painful.  Plus, you have a lot of nerves and veins the baby can lay on that can make things even more painful, especially when they seem to be bouncing on them!  I would definately talk to my doctor or midwife and ask.  They will more than likely tell you everything is just fine, but they may want to check you out to err on the side of caution.  Good luck!  Not much longer!|`|zlciavc1aa	I'm 28.4 weeks and i feel your pain.. literally. When he moves it's very uncomfortable and my belly looks alien like at times (which cracks me up if im not exhausted)... at night it's a complete different story, that's when he really wants to show off his stunts and it becomes painful.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. Sometimes I feel that. Just wait until he/she gets up in your ribs :)|`|AA11085356	I'm sure it's normal. I can't say I was in pain when my son would move around, but I did get pretty uncomfortable at times.<br>  <br>  Remember, you can always talk to your doctor about things like this. That's what they are there for.
ixWiCA0paa	Just remember that high school is nothing like it is in the movies.  <br>  Last year, when I was in eighth grade I was really nervous about starting high school and how everything was going to go, but now I don't know why I was so nervous. <br>  <br>  High school is an amazing experience if you don't get caught up in all the peer pressure.<br>  <br>  At my school, the seniors don't try to stomp all over the freshman (although the sophomores think they know everything).  The jocks also do their homework.  There are no nerds, and everyone fits in.  <br>  <br>  In some ways there are cliques, but not for me.  I am one of those wanderers.  I can be sitting with one group at lunch and then I can migrate to so many others.  <br>  Try to remember that everything isn't as clear cut as the media makes it.  If you stay true to yourself, then you should be just fine.|`|nhRSjWhpaa	Just realize you aren't alone. "everyone's on the same boat." other people who do not seem nervous most likely are nervous. Millions of kids are starting high school along with u and me and we just gotta do what feels right and be ourselves.. We all are going next year and we will all experience the same craziness|`|2WGI6sxEaa	It's exactly like television. If you don't want to become a social outcast, blowing football players in the locker rooms and huffing glue off the toilet seats is the only way you're gonna be accepted.<br>  <br>  Also, lose some weight, fatty. Unless you're a perfect size 0, no one is going to like you and they're all going to make fun of your enormous girth.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What do you mean "How big of me"? How about "How big of YOU, FATTEH!"|`|1ad5u4UFaa	High school is really no big deal. The older you get the more you realize how meaningless all the social stuff is. Everybody at that age is just beginning to learn who they are. They don't know themselves yet and change quite a bit after high school. I did. The people I went to school with did.<br>  <br>  People who don't have a clue (high schoolers) are put in various circumstances. They learn, make mistakes, and learn more. Don't be afraid if everything isn't going perfectly for you. It won't. It's all about learning from experience. That's what the whole life experience is all about.<br>  <br>  Some people catch on quicker than others. I was very slow and was a reject in school, but I think that actually gave me better perspective than if I were to have fit in.<br>  <br>  <br>  D-Ziggy is just making fun of how stupid high school is and being sarcastic.|`|RRxlVNHQaa	it dont matter what no1 think of you. its just high school. remember that. coming from a high school classroom bored as hell right now.<br>  school is easy. you can do whatever you want. every time people tell you not to mess up your freshmen year && take all the classes you need to LISTEN TO THEM! i wish i did. you dont have to have sex or have drugs if you dont want to. but its fun :)|`|FzTVi22Uaa	As entertaining as that last response was, ignore it. High school isn't at all like movies. At my school, the jocks were intelligent, and the "popular girls" of middle school were considered slutty and dumb by the time senior year rolled around. Everyone finds their niche. Don't worry about it.|`|wITZ6ltYaa	Honestly, dont even worry about it.<br>  <br>  High school is the same thing except its older girls being sluts.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's lamee & you'll be anxious to graduate haha.<br>  <br>  don't worry, it's the same thing && people don't really pick on freshman. Unless they have a personal prob. but other than that dont worry!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  new friends, new cute boyss, new start!|`|l6mKwFb7aa	Realize that Disney makes High School appear much worse (and at times, much fruitier) than it actually is. Take it from me - Middle School was worse. People start to become normal in High School...and if you don't like it, just count down the days until college.|`|7nOkNtw4aa	You remind me of myself last year.<br>  I'm in grade 9 now.<br>  After our high school presentation it was so nerve wracking. The presentation given to us made high school look so much worse than it really is. But once I started high school I was embarrassed that I was so nervous. High school is not bad at all. Every one else is starting high school with you, and there might even be some new kids that have no idea who any one is. Make sure you go to the High school's orientation if it has one. It will help, believe me. Don't be too nervous everything will be fine. And you will make new friends too. As for the sex stuff. Most of that is on tv, But it does happen. Just stick to your morals. Watch out for those guys because they do exist. And even if you aren't with the main 'popular' crowd, as long as you're with your friends you are in the 'popular' crowd. Just be yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with High school, and have fun!
ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, still sounds like you are pregnant to me, but we will have to wait and see, huh?  Yeah, don't make an appointment quite yet.  It is highly embarrassing if it were to come back negative!  Been there and done that one.  Makes you feel like a dummy face!<br>  <br>  Try taking a test in the morning like you said.  =)  If you miss another period THEN I would schedule an appointment and tell them what's going on.  Best of luck to you!|`|XO4talxxaa	Hey Girl! I really hope you are preggo! Plus i am having the same symptoms with the cramps, i am on cd 27 of a 31 day cycle. I also am not sure when i ovulated because i had EWCM on cd8 and cd18? lol But we bd all the time :) so i am not sure about this month! Good Luck and Baby Dust!!|`|VlYMcVKlaa	i know i dont like those rude comments either. <br>  i am having the same problem than u are having and the doc told me to wait another week.weird and i took two test and both negative, so i dont know whats going on, <br>  did u already make an appt with your doctor`?
xmIJAUqpaa	6 1/2 yrs ago I had my son @ 24 weeks...he weighed 1lb 10oz and was 12 in long....It was so scarey!!!, but he beat the odds and after 4 months in the hospital he came home on his original due date...he suffered some things, like respiratory symptoms and eye problems, he never had a brain bleed, thank GOD, but it was a rollercoater ride his first three yrs of life...everything cleard up on its own and now he is a healthy active, couldnt even tell he was preemie kinna kid...he has been diagnosed with a learning disability and hes is in a 1st grade special day class, but he is learning everything else a 1st grader would just at a slower pace....but I count my blessings as things could have been 100X worse, he could have died, or suffered severely from it...there was a 25 weeker, who was older and bigger than my son and he has since became blind, and is severly mentally handicapped...bless his heart, but he lived...so its a toss up when dealing with preemies...|`|64d194b56883f9f88839559f207ae02aaa	I have 18 months old twins, and they were born 5 weeks early. My son had a harder time, but they both had to be in the NICU for 11 days. They had jaundice pretty bad, and had to gain a little weight to come home. My son was 6lbs 14 oz, my daughter was 5lbs 7.8 oz. The doctors in the NICU told me that white males have a harder time being preemies. Dont know why,but that is the statistics.|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	My cousin had her baby at 30wks in April 2005. He was really tiny; 2lbs 14oz & 14in long. He stayed in the hospital a long time but he finally got to come home. He's now perfectly healthy & will turn 4 on the 9th of next month!|`|DTg3USppaa	my brothers gf was pregnant with twin boys, they came 1month early and they were so tiny! They stayed in the hospital for about 2weeks and they finally got big enough to take home!|`|SRzswqTeaa	From:  <a href="http://preemie.info/cms/modules/news/article.php?storyid=96" rel="nofollow">http://preemie.info/cms/modules/news/art...</a><br>  <br>  # 21 weeks or less: 0% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 22 weeks: 0-10% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 23 weeks: 10-35% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 24 weeks: 40-70% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 25 weeks: 50-80% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 26 weeks: 80-90% survival rate<br>  <br>  # 27 weeks: greater than 90% survival rate<br>  <br>  There are some studies that say that the sex of the baby can change the outcome a  bit.  A female has a better chance for survival in these studies.|`|pNKBszseaa	My youngest was born 8 weeks early. She had some problem with keeping her body temp up, and she had a feeding problem. She caught RSV which was really hard on her. But she is now a MOUTHY 6 yr old! And i love each day i get with her!
5h8bYsKdaa	it still has time to move, since baby and the placenta move around. i dont know if you will deliver soon but if it doesnt move up you might have to have a c section. my dr told me the same thing but said theres still alot of time for it to change positions. just know u arent alone. i dont knw much about it either|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	It doesnt mean you will deliver sooner...it just means that your at an increased risk for hemorraging (bleeding). You will need a c-section as well...you said it..the placenta is covering the cervix. Pelvic rest will most likely be done at the hospital untill you deliver, incase you start bleeding (you can loose the babe fast so you need easy access to the OR)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it doesn't mean you will deliver soon he just doesn't want to risk bleeding- if you're early on then your placenta has time to move.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	My cousin had it with her first, she had a natural birth without complications as the placenta moved out of the way.<br>  <br>  Don't panic, I'm sure you will be fine, she went over her due date :o)<br>  <br>  If it is still there in the later weeks they will monitor you and possibly perfom a c-section to be safe, thats not the end of the world :o)
ca9dEvSAaa	I had pre-term labor at 26 weeks, and I was told that babies can survive then. Thank god she didn't get to come though.<br>  <br>  My aunt had twins survive at 27 weeks.<br>  <br>  EDIT- The twins spent quite a while in the NICU. They are now happy and healthy|`|uAnw9LAQaa	generally at 34 weeks a baby can survive on its own without special attention but some babies even at full term require some special attention for one reason or another but that is a general time frame that everything is supposed to be fully developed.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Babies have been known to survive with health complications as early as 23-24 weeks I believe. I know that before 37 weeks all babies have some risk of complications.|`|52U22fiAaa	28 weeks is considered "viable"...however, I had a friend give birth at 23 weeks and her baby is happy and healthy now (after months of intensive care).|`|ntdGOZqGaa	With hardly any problems between 30-32 weeks. The only thing that will be immature will be the lungs but they can give shots to help the babys lungs come along.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Probably around 6 or 7 months. <br>  And yes the baby will need some special attention. Most likely help breathing.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	28 weeks it can survive|`|895XRbnJaa	i believe a baby has survived at 22 weeks but it would have to stay in the hospital for a very long time|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	24 week is considered viable but some have survived younger and it will need LOTS of care|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	The book I am reading says it has about a 10% chance of survival at 25 weeks, however it will probably need a life time of care.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	A close friend of mine gave birth to a 15 oz. baby girl at 24 weeks. The baby spent over 6 months in the NICU and she is now 13 months old. She is still on a breathing machine and has a feeding tube. Her vision is also very low and she will require glasses. She is, however, a beautiful little girl and even though she is 13 months old she only has the development of a 7 month old.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	I'm not too sure but I was born in 1986 at 29 weeks and I only weighed 800g. I was put on machines to help me breath and a feeding tube. <br>  I was sent home after 4 months of being in NICU healthy strong.|`|X3zl9hZCaa	They say as early as 26 weeks but the baby would be born with many problems and would remain in the hospital for quiet some time unfortunately.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	by 7mths a baby will survive with special care
sMvWJDqsaa	OMG that's cute!! Will you make me one???!! I love the animal theme too, and that is what my nursery is going to be decorated as...Jungle/Safari theme...alot of Precious Planet items because I want bright, cheery colors such as yellows, blues, and oranges..|`|AA11197832	I think it's really cute.  I would add maybe some pink ribbon or those plastic baby diaper pins and/or plastic bottles, in the color pink.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	One of the best I've seen!  I think a stuff animal would look cute if you could find the appropriately sized lion or something.<br>  <br>  Nice work!|`|j9axB0YMaa	It's really cute. Maybe add something on top like a stuffed animal.|`|qaoIdRSZaa	awer (: looks perfect!!<br>  Thats so awesome :D|`|aMvMklMbaa	Haha Thats so cute!!|`|OaOf4oxQaa	so cute, but why don't you add something on the top?|`|FE1jyfRSaa	Can you eat it? :) Its great.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	very cute|`|GcZqrz85aa	very cute!!! maybe something for the top of the 'cake'?|`|UMoeNvr4aa	you remained  of  some think abut my child that's nice good luck|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Ohhh that's SO adorable! Add some Pacifiers :)|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	That is adorable.  Those are the same animals we put on our baby's wall.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	absolutely adorable! don't add a thing :)|`|LSNffo4jaa	It's adorable!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That's super adorable, actually.|`|duinadV4aa	very nice and neat
Agw4pXAnaa	I would suggest leaving while they are there and letting you're guy go home before you and open some windows.  If it were me, I would stay out until bedtime just to be on the safe side.  If the room airs out, you should be ok for going home and going to bed or if you want to be extra cautious, you might want to stay at a hotel or a friends house that night.|`|tvtEVjdkaa	well you could always call the painters and ask them if the paint is non toxic and if its safe to breath in, but also depending on where you live you could just open up all the windows and let the place air out thoroughly, but the smell of paint will be around for a few days|`|436fREgIaa	paint dries pretty quick.the only thing in fumes you have to worry about is amonia.if the paint has no amonia,you should be fine regardless.but i would wait about 2 hours after they are done,and leave lots of windows open.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I don't know for sure, but I personally wouldn't take the chance. See if maybe you could stay with a friend or family member for a day or two after they are done painting, just to be on the safe side.
BfBMRlNNaa	My daughter tries to do the same thing sometimes. Usually I just give her small pieces at a time (instead of a big chunk she would have take bites from) if she's getting carried away. When that doesn't work I only give her one small piece at a time. I always tell her to 'take a bite' and 'no that's too much', she's getting much better about it. A lot of times she will spit it out herself after putting it in her mouth once she realizes it's too much. You are just going have to keep practicing with him, but don't worry he'll figure it out!|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	The rule of thumb is to not give them anything bigger than a pea until they are older.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	You should be cutting his food up into smaller pieces if he is not able to take manageable bites.  He'll learn in time.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Just give him a couple pieces at a time, when he is done give some more.  Try and teach him to only put one piece in at a time, if he tries more, take it away and say only a little at a time.  When you swallow you can have more.  so he learns not to stuff his mouth.  alot of kids do it,
a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	We got six regular pillows and one body pillow.  One for him and the rest for me.  I'm really tempted to add more pillows but at 33 weeks, I'm getting a bit discourage that I will ever make myself comfortable enough to get a good night sleep.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Oh man i have so many.<br>  <br>  I have one feather pillow!-- & thats the my head sleeps on. lol<br>  <br>  5 regular pillows, are around. when my boyfriend not there, i like to lay them all around me. like my own little fort thing going on. lol. <br>  Of course when he is there, he only sleeps with two.-- all the others ones have to go on the floor. <br>  <br>  and i have 1 long pillow. i put between my legs. SO wonderful.|`|VpDhPP8baa	I used to use 2.<br>  But now it's 3 for my head<br>  one for under my belly, another behind my hips to stop me rolling around listlessly. <br>  Another one between my legs.<br>  And lastly a huge bolster pillow under the matress to raise my feet and legs.<br>  So that's 7 all up for me- oh and he has 2- no changes there- yet!<br>  He might lose one of those too over the next few weeks though :-D|`|j9axB0YMaa	I'm using 6. 5 of them are piled up forming sort of a cheese wedge shape to prop up the upper part of my body and head and the other one between my legs. I've kicked my poor husband out of the bed, I get way to hot when he's in the bed too.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol, I never really thought about that. I actually have one pillow. I thought about getting a body pillow, but never got around to doing that. Anyway my number is 1 pillow- it's for my head.|`|zlciavc1aa	I have the boppy body pillow and 4 extra pillows... i may have to replace the boppy one it's gotten extremely flat ugh!|`|DTg3USppaa	LoL. Lots of pillows!!  For me, I use 1 ...its the most comfortable and I love feeling how close my hubby is to me when I sleep :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	Oh yikes I loveee my pillows and so does my boyfriend, I make VERY comfortable pillow formations for both of us ;) I have 4 regular pillows, two tempurpedic side sleepers, 3 firm down, 2 fluffier down, a down body pillow, and a small oval "FOM" pillow from Brookstone (it is so crazy comfy it has those tiny microbeads and ugh try it in the store I can't even put it into words). I use most of these pillows...LOL I sound a bit crazy. I should note I had lots of pillows even before the pregnancy|`|AA11197832	Not as many as I'd like.  If I could I would have ton's of pillows and to be sleeping by MYSELF lolol.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	That's hilarious!<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant, we only had 2 pillows on our bed.   But, I probably could have used one more.|`|QSodlfMraa	wow not as many as you lol, 2 and a teddy bear lol.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	lol. fun question!<br>  <br>  I was using about 6 or 7 a night until i got a snuggie. OMG- it is truly amazing. so supportive. Kinda pricey, but worth it if you have an extra 70 bucks to spend!|`|zsrnhstUaa	Me and my bf do not live together yet,I sleep with 3 pillows.2 kings and a regular.1 king i use for my head,The other to tuck under my belly so i can somewhat sleep on my side and tummy.The small one is just there if i need it|`|HM0cxcahaa	I laughed when i read your question because im very simlar.<br>  <br>  My hubby is sleeping in the spare room as my pillow bed is no longer accomodating for 2 adults.<br>  <br>  I have 6 pillows all together to support my bump, legs, back, head  :)|`|mL07N3IAaa	hahah that's silly! i  have 6 pillows! one body pillow on the side of my bed.. two for my head, and three others on the other side of the bed so i don't fall over.. and yes..i do fall over quite frequently|`|ntdGOZqGaa	We have 8 he gets 2 and I get the rest..plus that doesnt even count the decorative pillows either lol
vygYFdsSaa	How effing old are you?!?!? This is ridiculous. He WASHED HIS HANDS and then didn't even penetrate her. Of course she can't get pregnant.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Not likely as the semen was exposed to her mouth, then to air and then it was washed off.|`|aBWu7tyHaa	she's probably not pregnant.  for one thing, sperm dies when it hits air.  for another thing, you said he washed it off.  for a third thing, if her cherry isn't popped and he just put his finger in it's highly unlikely for her to get pregnant b/c sperm dies when it hits air.  tell your friends to stop messing around if they don't want a baby.  kids need to stop having sex, seriously.  teen pregnancy is WAY out of control|`|nEVaIaOzaa	no she is definity not pregnant, the sperm cannot live in air, they dry out and die.  there is no way that she was pregnant.  what the heck does he didn't put go in the hole mean, and it doesn't hurt when ur hymen breaks, ei. your cherry is popped.|`|PHknlA1Zaa	probably not, if he washed his finger. Your friend or you...should be fine don't worry to much and if your period is late get a pregnancy test,but really should be fine.|`|qaoIdRSZaa	the chances are VERY slim ..<br>  i can almost safely say they have NOTHING to worry about (:
ntdGOZqGaa	Yes its normal he is a boy and she is a girl they have two different worlds when it comes to playing. Girls are kinder and softer and boys want to smack kick punch. My son is the same way I just tell him ok we have to be easy bc sometimes that hurts. I'm having another boy so for some odd reason I see lots of black eyes and bloody noses in my future lol Good luck|`|VR9KhbEgaa	This is very normal, at least in my house! I have 6 kids and 1 on the way they range in ages from 9 to 5 months. The biggest trouble maker in our house right now is my 16 month old son. He loves to play rough with his older brothers but if my daughter goes near him he comes out smacking! Then he has a really hard time understanding why he can't sit on top of his 5 month old brother, because he always sits on my 9 yr. old sons back while they watch tv.  He more then likely is just testing the water to see how she will react. It will get better....|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Very normal! My daughter was 4 when my 11 year old son got like this, he would pull her bow out and she was scream and hit him, and when he got older he would make fun of how she ran or did something, its just the little brother pest thing. Emma (shes 14 now) asked me when he was about a year old, "When does this thing GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL!!" I told her that he was here forever like her, and she cried. I guess she got so tired of getting her hair pulled. Lol! <br>  <br>   Make them say something nice or do something nice for each other every time they do this, that may be hard for him at this age, but when they get older i would start that. They will be best friends one day, good luck!

Of course it took me a few minutes to actually wake up, it always does...I could get 24 hours of sleep and STILL have trouble waking up.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	I dont like daylight savings time either.<br>  I could not get up this morning. <br>  It blows I like gaining an hour not losing it.|`|pcjOQDymaa	its soo hot when school gets out in the afternoon cause its actually like 2:30 and its dark in the mornings.<br>  i hate it.!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	OH MY GOSH YES.<br>  its so stupid and pointless.<br>  the good thing about it is that summer nights last longer :)|`|PTK2x59Kaa	I love it in the fall but I HATE it in the Spring like its 10 and i should be going to bed, but I'm not tired and it WAS hard enough when I had to get up at 6 and not it's like getting up at freaking 5am.<br>  So yes i hate it with a burning passion!|`|OK5OEL1paa	i like when we skip bk not when we jump ahead + the whole process is confusing cuz it deprives me of sleep cuz it takes me time to get used to the switch && i always forget to change my alarm clock so i end up to early or to late to places|`|drI1vsJdaa	YES. I love it when they go back, but when it goes forward I hate it. I almost overslept for my competition yesterday (It was at noon, and I woke up at 10 but then realized I had forgotten to change it ><|`|6xpALKm8aa	You are not alone my friend.<br>  <br>  This morning I woke up at 7:40 thinking it was 6:40. erg. can you say LATE?<br>  <br>  haha(:<br>  <br>  daylight savings makes me want to eat a cushed glass smoothie... jk hhaha|`|9tonO25oaa	You are not alone, i hate Daylight savings too!|`|94a649dd7ad7b4bbd37d4e30411762e1aa	It makes me very sad.

It's complicated, and I'm too lazy to remember to change the time.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!
XOtOMncwaa	Great question! I'm pretty baffled on the situation myself, my son didn't have a problem before but he was a lot younger. Now he's 1, and he didn't go to bed until 10, when his bed time is 8... he also napped through lunch and supper, so the whole day has been off. I plan on keeping him up tomorrow by taking him to visit, going home about 7, putting him in the tub, and by that time I hope he will be so wore out he will go to sleep at 8... then sleep all night and wake up at his old time. I'm crossing my fingers!|`|PW3hcVZiaa	My 14 month old did fine- she's actually sleeping an hour later in the morning since it is still dark out.  The past 2 days, though, we've been really busy and she hasn't gotten good naps, so that helps.<br>  Once it starts staying light after 8:00 (bedtime) I'm sure it will be harder.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My 13 month old had a rough night last night. He went to bed at 9, woke up at 2:30. Didn't go back to sleep till 7. then woke up at 10. UGH. My 4 year old had no problems at all. Hopefully tonight its better, he only took one nap but it was long.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	my kids did fine with it. i do not like the day light savings but it is ok. no big changes?|`|OxFV92hJaa	Our 4 year old didn't have a problem. <br>  Our 15 month old now wants to go to sleep at 6:30pm, instead of his normal 7:30pm.<br>  Our 3 month old, doesn't even know the difference. <br>  <br>  Tonight for example they both went to bed at 9pm...hectic day though and they took a late nap. <br>  <br>  New norm for us will be 8pm. That way when it goes back in the Fall....it won't be a problem for our middle one. <br>  <br>  We're on an out of whack schedule now as it is though, medical stuff, and hectic work schedule for my husband. Ahhh, praying normal comes back sooner than later.<br>  <br>  G'luck to you with yours. I didn't really have a plan, being sick and already pooped I just let it all happen how it happened.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	It's been a struggle keeping my 8 month old on her sleep schedule!!  Instead of waking up at 6:45am, she wakes up closer to 8am, which messes up her 9am nap.  So all of her naps are off schedule.  Then at bedtime (7:15pm), she's not tired (b/c her body says it's only 6:15pm)...I'm hoping we get this figured out in the next couple of days!!!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	All of my children are okey except my one year old Kali is having a few problems.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My grade school kids (and I!) had a hard time falling asleep last night, so were tired today.  Bedtime should come easy tonight, then we just dive into it from here on out.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	My 3 and 4 year old went to bed just fine, but have geen getting up and chatty for the past hour and a half - uugh.
wZAeBisbaa	A good system is one that works for a particular family. I think your plan is very reasonable and fair, but many students would not be able to earn enough in one summer to pay half their expenses for the rest of the year.  Nor is it always possible for parents to come up with the other half.  We would not have been able to do it. We couldn't even match what our kids earned in the summer (to their credit, they worked hard).  But they qualified for some big scholarships, and the schools they attend offer generous financial aid packages.  Every family has to come up with a system that is realistic and efficient for them. <br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to apply for every scholarship possible.  It's tedious to submit all those applications, but there are so many sources of money out there that the chance of getting something is good.  Go to finaid.org to search for scholarships for every interest and major.  Look around at your community - many local companies and organizations offer scholarships.  Not all of them are based on GPA or class rank.  Many are based on interest or creativity or leadership.  I think every student has a chance if they are willing to put in the effort. Talk to your school counselor about getting started.|`|s6emVQleaa	I thought my in-laws had an interesting agreement with my husband.  They didn't help with most of his costs up-front.  He worked hard and took out loans to pay for his schooling.  However, once he was done with school they have made all the payments on his student loans.  I suppose it was a motivator for him to finish (but he would have anyway).|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My husband is a legal native American. The state college by our home has a system where if you can prove you are native American you go there tuition free. My daughter will go there for 2 years for general, if there isnt a degree there she wants she can go some where else. We will help pay for 2 years of college but no more because there is an option for her to at least get her generals of for free. there will be rules with her going to college, no excessive drinking, no drugs and the GPA has to be passing.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Great base idea. It would need to be modified by rate of inflation of both pay/tuition. But as for a general base idea, it's great. <br>  <br>  My husband and my thoughts on it are as follows:<br>  $200/mo per child (we have 3), for 18 years. <br>  Plus 1/2 of what they recieve in allowance, or "grade" $.<br>  And they will have to put 1/3 of their pay into college savings, 1/3 into regular savings, and 1/3 they can do whatever they wish too. <br>  <br>  We will continue to re-evaluate our ideas/actions/contributions yearly and adjust where needed. <br>  <br>  As it stands right now, that would be around 50K per child. They would not ever know of the money until applying to college though, and they wouldn't know of the amount there. We don't want them to think they have a free ride. We want them to work hard to achieve things....if they need the $ for school, it'll be there. If not it'll be a nice down payment on a home, or $ for a wedding, or travel, or whatever they want that we deem fit. <br>  <br>  Ours are currently:<br>  4years 4months old<br>  15 months old<br>  3 months old<br>  <br>  We are 1 yr behind on our oldests savings because of 2 years medical crap happening. <br>  <br>  Been planning our actions since prior to concieving our first, acting on them from the time she was around 6 months old. <br>  <br>  Do anything that you can, and it's always good to think ahead. It deffinately doesn't hurt lol.
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I would go with a 28 day cycle considering that is your normal cycle. There could be dozens of things that are different in your life that would cause your period to be a bit longer those 2 times. <br>  Id go with what your body normally does, and use the 28 day cycle.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Just use 28 days. A bit of variation is normal|`|vSBJxSL7aa	You are fine and your not out of wack. your period fluctuates all the time you can even skip periods. its perfectly normal, why does it worry you? you dont sound like you have had your period for very long?
OxFV92hJaa	Not having involved parents, and being "cast off" to do their own thing...instead of having good parents to guide them into adulthood. <br>  <br>  I'd say life agenda wise, that would top the list of struggles. Lack of parental involvement leads to a lot of teen problems/adult problems. <br>  <br>  Diet is another valid one. For the first time in history kids are expected to die before their parents...because of all this CRAP food their parents throw at them because they are too busy to do better. <br>  <br>  As for 2012, all I know is the prophecy that the end of the world could occur Dec.12, 2012. <br>  <br>  Hope that doesn't happen. That'd be 8 days after my middle childs 5th birthday. And 4 days after my youngest childs 4th birthday.....that'd suck.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	I'm 21, not a parent but a big sister to 5 kids aged 2-15 yrs.<br>  <br>  peer pressure to be cool and well-liked, parental pressure for good grades and success, growing up too fast. sex, drugs, alcohol...<br>  <br>  Nothing is happening in 2012. The Mayan calendar will restart (not end, as some of these crazies think). Some say that Nostradamus predicted the end of the world also in 2012, which can't be proven as all the "predictions" Nostradamus has made so far have been translated and can be read in so many different ways. It's easy to read something and apply it to something completely unrelated.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	The fact that serial rapist torture-murderers have more rights (I'm not exaggerating, they actually do). Everything they do is seen as attention seeking and simply dismissed. They're expected to act more mature than adults but are still treated like children. When a teen is assaulted by another it is dismissed as bullying and ignored.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i would say peer pressure?|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	An imbalance between responsibility and privileges. Kids are supposed to act like adults, are treated like kids, while they are neither and both. Most don't spend enough time with adults in a positive and meaningful sense. How does one learn to be an adult if one doesn't have anyone to show them how and be understanding when they muck it up. Too often teenagers are treated as though they have the worst of intentions instead of doing the best job they can. Most will, if treated well.<br>  <br>  I don't mind if that's not a cool answer. I have never been cool and am too old to worry about it now ;) (At the grand old age of 29)|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Things like peer pressure have always been a problem. Today the pressure is in regard to some different things, albeit. In my opinion, the biggest challenge facing most teens is the crushing weight of low expectations that society as a whole, and parents in many instances, place upon them. Most people seem to expect teens to drink, have sex, and do drugs. Witness the fact that so many answers, even here on Y!A, begin with those shameful words: "They're going to do it anyway..." Where is the incentive not to do those things? And by the way, I have never thought I was cool.|`|5HKpeVakaa	peer pressure on sex, drugs, even what clothes to wear.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I think that what parents are scared of the most is their child dying..and doing drugs and stuff.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	2012
4WFN0awMaa	A little but like you said it's only a couple of days difference so if it doesn't come by Weds. just take a test :)  Mine came out positive the next day after I missed my period.  And if you are then it's a blessing, I just had a baby last months and my husband was in the same situation but you know God always provides.|`|dOQ5yipDaa	Yeah my period was 2 days late this morning because of February being a short month! <br>  <br>  So I would say that is what it is. However if you have had unprotected sex around ovulation time then maybe you are pregnant!<br>  <br>  Did you test first thing in the morning? As that is when your urine is the strongest so that is when you need to test.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide you want :)|`|lrKdAloiaa	My guess would be that February being a short month will mess up your cycle a bit. But, maybe I'm wrong..Good luck to you and your husband!|`|mrunUkhYaa	yes, days of the month make a difference, but just wait and see.  good luck|`|AA10015625	yes the 29 days in February could have something to do with it, if you don't start within the next 2 days I would say go ahead and take a test. good luck and God Bless.
Qydtjz2naa	I went on my first one around Halloween.  I get scared really easily, but it was with my class and I wanted to try it.  I sat in the middle, and I made the entire class sit around the edges so there was no space around it.  Then I made a couple guys sit all around me, I was so scared!  I was like the only one screaming.  But I pretty much screamed the whole time.  <br>  <br>  It was actually pretty fun, but I wouldn't do it again, I got too scared! <br>  <br>  And there where a couple other people from my school there, so me and my friend were walking along back to our class, and these guys started chasing us.  We were running and screaming.  It turned out we knew them, but it was still scary!  We were running in this corn field away from them [we had just gone to the bathroom, and there was a corn field conveniently placed there] <br>  <br>  And then there was this "monster" guy thingy with a chainsaw, and he freaked me out.  They would chase you with their chainsaw on the way to the bathroom.  I kept screaming and freaking out, again I was like the only one scared.  So these girls went up to him and said "you got a baby mama?" and things like that so I would be less scared.  It worked until he came at us with a chainsaw!  <br>  <br>  Okay, I just told you everything that happened that night!  For me it was really scary, but not for anyone else :]|`|pOZubuOcaa	I went on one in the 6th grade it was cold and it was fun<br>  it was some field trip where we went to Wisconsin for like 3 days<br>  <br>  ours wasn't scary some guy dressed as a bear jumped out to scare us but no one really got scared it was a pretty lame attempt but the hayride was fun|`|FGZR9RwDaa	the hayride wasn't bad;<br>  but omg the haunted house scared the crap out of me.<br>  i'm never going to haunted houses again.
wZAeBisbaa	First, try not to imagine the worst case scenario.  Staying home does NOT mean you will turn into your uncle or even necessarily be miserable, and going to New York does NOT mean you will be homeless.  Anyway, the worst case is seldom a good basis for making decisions. <br>  <br>  Instead, try to be realistic about the options available to you and choose the one that maximizes your opportunities.  You seem to know what you want - to go to culinary school in New York. What would it take to do that?   Figure out the bottom line.  Then look at all the possible sources of money, including scholarships, loans, and grants.  There are a lot of scholarships out there to fit every interest and educational plan.   <br>  <br>  First check with the school to find out what kinds of financial aid they offer. Since no school gives a free ride to very many students, you will probably need more.  Go to finaid.org, sign up for a free account, and let the program search for scholarships that you would qualify for.  Then start submitting applications.  Check into the federal Stafford loan program - many students can get a subsidized loan (the government pays part of the interest. U.S. Bank has some excellent no-fee student loans available now - and interest rates are low.  You could also work full time during the summer and save as much money as possible.  <br>  <br>  If it seems like there is a realistic chance of going to New York, present your plan to your parents.  Once they see that you are an adult and can make rational and independent decisions about your life, they will be more accepting, I think. <br>  <br>  If after looking at your options, going to the school in New York still seems unrealistic, look at culinary schools closer to home.  You can get a good education at more than one school.  Just because you can't go to your first choice doesn't mean your life is ruined.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Whatever you decide will be OK.  Things have a way of working out for the best.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	CIA? Is the BEST culinary school in the country...you GO!|`|098e311b27ff0799b9201e651d380efaaa	Don't let fear keep you from your dream! Go to school! Obviously it's something that's important to you. Talk to your parents, tell them that after you're done with school you can go back to FL. If they aren't willing to help you financially - you'll have to be resourceful. There are programs to help you and you can get a part-time job, roommate, no car. It's not expensive to exist. You just can't have 'wants' for a while. Good luck!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You cant find a school in Florida? And ya know I feel like this, wouldn't it be better to go to NY and do something you love and possibly fail as the outcome or stay in florida and not be happy and always think man I should have done it.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Can you try to apply next year? Homeless in New York? Hmm that sounds way more fun than rent free with the people who love you most lol.|`|6fjrcdYjaa	Pray. Ask God for direction. Wait for an answer. :) He'll answer.

I hardly ever have cramps (maybe 1-2 cycles a year) and when I do have them, they're very mild..not even bad enough to take anything. I don't get moody, bloated, I don't get cravings, I don't break out, I don't get tired or anything. My periods are also short and light. They last 5-6 days and the first 1-2 days its usually so light I barely need a panty liner, the 3rd-4th day, I need regular tampons, then the 5-6th day I need only a panty liner again.

4Yl2awlkaa	I realize you are probably quite upset now.<br>  <br>   I also understand that going to a new school is not exactly how you want to complicate your live more  right now, but it sounds like you don't have a stable adult in your life.  You're 16 and even if you are mature, it's difficult to be an advocate for yourself right now - some people may not take you seriously yet (which is SUPER frustrating I'm sure!).  <br>  <br>  You may be accurate in saying your mom doesn't want you. Or perhaps your mom is not a stable adult enough to take care of her own crap, much less be helpful to you.  Do you have any aunts or uncles who are more rational and understanding than your mom?  Is your dad available?<br>  <br>  My advice is to go to high school for at least one more year. Live with your brother I guess. Meet the school counselor or school psychologist the first week and let them know the situation you're coming from.  They may be able to offer some guidance.<br>  <br>  Don't view this situation as "my mom wants me to go to school" and "I want to get my GED" and if I go to school she's "right" or she "wins".<br>  <br>   Really, she's already lost a great daughter in leaving/abandoning you, and she kind of sounds a loser anyway.  <br>  <br>   Take this opportunity to make something better of yourself. A GED is fine, both my sister and my cousin got their GED, and so did 2 other friends of mine. But they all used it to go to college. One is a doctor now, my sister almost has her PhD.  But if you decide to get a GED, you need to do something after it. <br>  <br>  However, you may need a stable adult in your life, and perhaps there is one (teacher, coach, counselor) at school. Plus,to put this gently and,  I'm not trying to be critical, but you may need some more practice in grammar /English (or maybe you were just emotional when you typed your question). <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, or at least gives you food for thought. <br>  <br>  And above all, don't get pregnant.|`|2GGgllKeaa	Is your brother nice to you? Maybe staying with him will not be that bad. You should go to school.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I would guess that you both screwed up, because you're both people, and people have a tendency to destroy things whether they mean to or not.<br>  I know you don't want to hear this, but first of all, you need your high school diploma. I have lots of friends that dropped out to get their GED - the majority never ended up getting their GED, and of those that did, I only know one that furthered their education after that. People say that a GED is equivalent to a diploma, but it really isn't in the real world.<br>  It sounds like she's having a hard time dealing with life right now, and thinks that if she can keep you from having to deal with the turbulence in her life, you might get yours straightened out. She's your mom - I'm sure she loves and wants you, but she has to try to do what she thinks is best for the both of you.|`|sCuumWVTaa	Im sorry man try and stay at a friends house, get a job and all that so you can gett your own place and go to a charter school you only have to go twice a week for two hours and you get high school diploma in like 6 months.
BfBMRlNNaa	My daughter was the same way. Once she learned how to roll over there was no keeping her on her back. At the time I asked my doc about it and she said that I should always lay her down on her back and then if she rolls herself over it's fine. With all the warnings you read on everything it's hard sometimes not to worry, but once they are able to move themselves it's ok to let them sleep on their tummies.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	I purposely slept my daughter on her belly at 7 weeks for the same reason: she screamed literally all night, with maybe 1 or 2 periods of 15 minute sleep when she was on her back, and slept 8 hours on her belly. I know that SIDS is serious and everyone should take precautions, but realistically the numbers are SO low, that SIDS is not something that everyone needs to be so completely and utterly paranoid about. It almost seems as if it's like something that happens regularly. It's not. But it does indeed happen...rarely. <br>  <br>  If the baby gets there on their own, then your fine anyway. Otherwise, keep blankets and toys out of the crib, no bumpers, and keep the monitor on and you should be perfectly fine. In fact, having that monitor is one step more than most people take. Let your baby sleep however they are comfortable.|`|5jT9cO2haa	My baby is 10 weeks old and has never been able to sleep on his back no matter what I tried.  I was very concerned about him and would literally watch him sleep for hours to make sure he was okay.  I'm sure your little guy at 5 months old should be fine, plus that heart rate monitor really puts your mind at ease.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	Mine did that too, he refuses to sleep on his back, he just rolls over even if he's half asleep.  He sleeps alot better on his tummy, i think he's more comfy (as you see by the picture).  I wouldn't worry too much as long as he can hold up his head really good when he's on tummy time.|`|rjVALevtaa	I recently asked my doctor about this. She said it's fine. My little boy loves to sleep on his tummy too. By the time babies can roll over both ways, they're old enough to sleep on their tummies.<br>  <br>  Besides by 5 months old, his chances of SIDS are pretty low.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son is 4 months old and is a tummy sleeper. Its fine. My son will sleep for up to 12 hours on his stomach if not then we have to co-sleep and our bed is just not big enough for that anymore. As long as you have the monitor then you should be fine. I also have the monitor and I find that it helps me sleep a lot better at night.
MoaIQPvCaa	I think Andrew Quincy sounds nice. In spite of what the one person said, Quincy is a male name and the meaning is fifth son.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Quincey<br>  Andrew Quincey I like, Andy or Drew for short<br>  Andrew after your brother, Drew so he has his own name|`|1r05fktRaa	yes that nice to do|`|0hxK0khKaa	I like it.

Give your son his own identity not someone else's. <br>  <br>  We used my fathers name as a middle name, he feels special that he has poppy's name and his name lives on with my son.|`|P7mHHHDTaa	well its really your choice if you like Quincey than name him that if you like Adam  you can name him that too <br>  <br>  or you could even put them together to be Quincey Adam|`|3Olb1mDmaa	i like quincey alot, but i would name him Andy because of your brother.. && pass down that name. i sorry about your brother. :[|`|GM0hJqrPaa	Quincey...yuck.

aJLx0nhNaa	My parents don't really criticize my parenting, except to pick on me for not sending them enough photos.<br>  <br>  My MIL has some issues with the way I feed my 8.5 month old son, but they are pretty standard grandma issues - she thought I should have started him on solids earlier, but now that he is on solids, she thinks he's too young for the finger foods I've been giving him and that I ought to spoon feed him more.<br>  <br>  She also thinks he takes too many naps, but that's just insane.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My mom used to get under my skin so bad with my first. She was constantly trying to over step me no matter what I did with him. She finally out grew that and now with my second she actually tells me I am a good mom.

Especially when I never wanted kids, but wouldn't change it for the world now. <br>  <br>  My fiance's mom, keeps telling us we need to keep the cats out of the baby's stuff. I have one cat that sleeps in the crib, who curls in a corner far from the baby to sleep. <br>  <br>  Half of my side of the family, except my mom, has been telling me to put cereal in his bottle since he was 2 weeks old. That and not to feed on demand, but to set a schedule.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i will say that she does need to explore but she needs to be ok too- you need to "baby proof" your house and put everything she can hurt herself up. no one really says anything to me anymore because they knwo i will do things my way regardless. it use to be when will you wean ( nursing at 23 months) and why is he still rear facing in his car seat.<br>  <br>   they also made comments about the co-sleeping as if it were effecting them or something|`|YmEGCGtnaa	sigh...grandparents and their "superior wisdom"...it's good you watch her...what if she fell down some stairs or something bc you werent looking and "letting her lear'n?<br>  <br>  This is what I get criticized most for:<br>  ---not having her on a  real schedule---such as jarred foods at the same exact time every day---shes 8 months in 2 days, I work hard to get her on a schedule, but things don't always go as planned.<br>  ---not having her on mrore foods---um she has no teeth yet, so it's kind of hard to give anything but pureed fruits and veggies.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Well I have a co-worker who seems to think my life revolves around her beliefs or some crap like that. I breastfeed my 7 mth old & intend to continue atleast up until she's a yr old & never once give her formula (my choice). She always has some smart alec comment about why I don't take my daughter off my breast & SHE thinks it's high time I did because my breasts will sag & I need to get my life back, umm hello my life didn't go any flippin where it's right where it was before my daughter was borned only better. Apparently she didn't breastfeed or didn't do it for long with her 5 kids so anybody else in my position is a bother to her. The prima donna even said that she didn't breastfeed for long cause when she dies she wants to go to heaven with perky breast LOL, I told her well you can go with your perky breast but I will gladly go with my sagging boobs down to my navel & my stretch marked covered stomach as well, some ppl are just dumb|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My mom doesn't necessarily criticize the fact that I breastfeed my daughter-But she does think it's the reason my daughter still doesn't sleep through the night at 11 months. Every time she sees me, she has to say "you look so tired. Were you up all night again with Jana?" She's been telling me for months to switch to formula, because she thinks it will make my daughter sleep longer. The bottom line is, my husband and I have decided to not have anymore kids. In a few years, I'm really going to miss the late night visits with my little girl. So for the most part, waking up at night to feed her doesn't bother me at all.|`|irHF6CBPaa	My mother actually never saids anything but my mother in law she has an opinion about everything She believes in all the old wife's tales and is always pushing them on me She had a daughter in law that was 13 when she had her first baby(by the way her son was 20 and they permitted) Well she thinks I'm a little girl which I'm not ( I'm a young mother but not that young 22) she is always telling me what I should do I always tell her "I'm not 15" I won't let her push me into anything|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	Mommy of a 7.5 month old.  My family tells me I'm too overprotective and that I shouldn't pick him up every time he cries.  And why can't they babysit.  I'm just not comfortable doing that, so I don't do it, end of story. I would tell them that it's not something open for discussion, and I'm the mother, not them.  My own mother was the worst, I had to tell her a couple of times before she realized that I wasn't going to listen to her.  And a couple more times after that before she stopped the rude remarks.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My MIL every chance or time we go to visit she puts "her 2 cents in" about what and how I should feed my son. Not to listen to his dr and that she is going to buy him baby food to keep at her house bc she loves to watch him eat. I think I am supposed to be shoving food in his mouth every chance I get apparently to her. I wonder if they( as in MIL and other parts of my husband family) the reason why I had so much PPD when my son was first born up until he was 5 or 6 months bc of there DAMN comments. shew!|`|686b15aee384669b47a46ee3855b28efaa	My mother in law was the worst..she once told me that I was starving my daughter because I was trying to put her on a schedule. She tries to tell me what to say and what not to say to my daughter..for example i told my daughter she needs to share or no one will want to play with her and my mother in law had a cow|`|TJusfEnlaa	My mum gives me a hard time for being what she refers to as a 'new-age parent' because I don't give my son juice to drink - water is fine IMO! and I don't want him to develop a sweet tooth and refuse water later on - and because I don't believe in smacking my son. i tell her times have changed in the 24 years since she was a new mum but she still pushes her beliefs on me.|`|ozkdtzcBaa	The way I discipline my daughter or when I talk to her in a sharp tone to get her attention and stop her from getting hurt.|`|heDtLdz5aa	my one friend always makes comments on how my son sleeps in the same room and sometime same bed as me and my husband..it works for us.
49af6e73ecd0b7b59d41bf9491fffa1daa	I don't know about cost because insurance covered mine but I highly recommend it. I had mine for 3 years and never had a problem. No pain, no weight gain, No periods! You do cramp the first couple of days but it just feels like a bad period. I guess it can work different for everybody but it was great for me. I chose to get it taken out because I was ready for another and I am now pregnant. Good Luck! I hope this helps.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I had insurance that paid for mine when I got it inserted. It did not hurt to get put in. I was so nervous about it. You do have to go to they gynecologist. It takes about ten min. Not painful. But the 2 days after you are going to cramp so bad and have back pain. After that you will spot a little bit, probably have your period normally for a couple months then not have one after that. I do not have one. You will have to get it checked in a couple months after insertion. That will cost around $200. They do an ultrasound. Don't have to undress, they rub the thing over your stomach to make sure it's in place. The iud blocks sperm and is good for 5years. I have had mine almost a year. It only hurt the first couple days. It doesn't give off a lot of hormones like most birth controls. I think they only let you get it if you are married or have a child. I would recommend it to you.|`|lqlfIEjNaa	Mirena? is a tiny T-shaped piece of plastic that is placed into the uterus by your healthcare professional. Once Mirena? is in place, it begins to slowly release small amounts of the hormone levonorgestrel into your uterus. It does not contain estrogen, so you can be free of estrogen-related side effects.<br>  <br>  While there is no single explanation for how Mirena? works, it may:<br>  <br>  Block sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg<br>  Make the lining of your uterus thin (this may also result in benefits like less menstrual bleeding over time)<br>  Stop the release of your egg from your ovary (but this is not the way it works in most cases)<br>  <br>  It is thought that the small amounts of levonorgestrel that are released by Mirena? make your cervical mucus thick and tacky. This is why sperms are immobilized and can't enter the uterus. And the thinning of the uterus is why you may have less menstrual bleeding over time. In fact, about 20% of women will have no period after one year, a safe (and, for most women, preferred) condition.|`|575w52loaa	I don't recommend Mirena, first of all if you have to pay out of pocket it is like 500 dollars.  Second of all, even though the doctor tells you that it doesn't cause weight gain, every single person I've talked to about it has told me that they gained weight.  Another thing is that it hurts, ALOT!! all the time it hurts..it hurts to sit down...it feels like something is scratching your insides...seriously GOOGLE it.  You'll find everyone's opinion on it.  I was unable to find anything good.|`|zlciavc1aa	I'm not too sure how much it costs, but there is a website called the arch foundation that helps you with getting a free mirena. You send them the application filled out by you and your doc, if they approve it they ship it to your doctor. The mirena is inserted in your uterus and it's good for 5 years.

My little boy was given a 1 in 58 chance of having Down Syndrome and it turns out he's absolutely perfect :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|x5aJcD9zaa	It depends on whether or not you get the accompanying blood test.  It's generally offered to people in their 30s in addition to the ultrasound.  If you got the blood test too, the results take a little longer.

AA11533998	No matter the subject (child-rearing, business, religion, etc.), it's always hard to give advice (especially when you're very well informed on the subject) without sounding arrogant. So, I understand your dilemma.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd be cautious and pick my battles, so to speak. I always try to hold my tongue when it's something trivial...like organic vs. regular baby food (it's no big deal, in my opinion...and it's not a "battle" worthy of a fight). When I do decide to give advice to other mothers, I always start the sentences with, "This might not work for you, but it worked for me..." That's my way of giving advice without telling the other mom what to do. KNOW ONE likes to be told what to do and know one wants to feel like an idiot. Taking the gentle approach of "you can do this if you'd like" seems to work like a charm. <br>  <br>  RESPONSE EDIT: Oh sorry...I didn't see your edit until after I answered...<br>  <br>  Your edit changes everything. In that case, my attitude would be, "You don't like it? Sorry...that's MY kid and these are MY decisions." You're obviously a well-read, informed, good mommy...so you don't have to answer to anyone.

Ultimately, you have to remember that different people, when presented with the same information, will make different choices.  For most things, there should be no need for lengthy explanation.  A simple "she doesn't eat Mac and Cheese yet" or "we buy organic when we can" should be sufficient the vast majority of the time, there's no need to add on 'why.'  If you feel there's a safety issue that needs to be addressed, that's a different issue but on most things just a simple statement should suffice.|`|AjL9kZu2aa	I wish I could give a reply to this without sounding confusing...<br>  <br>  I guess I'm the friend on the other side who is very laid back.

c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Yes it can help you get pregnant but only if you are timing your intercourse around th etime of ovulation. I've also read that this methos is better for concieving boys. The girl sperms are slower but stronger so if you want to try to concieve a giril then do not have an orgasm. and have sex 2-3 days before ovulation,. For a boy, have sex on the day of ovulaiton and try to have an orgasm. The boy sperms are faster but they die quicker. And yes as long as he ejaculated inside of you you have a chance of concieving, even if some sprem falls out. Those sperm were not likely to make it to their destination anyway.<br>  <br>  And these are not stupid questions by any means, you have to learn somehow!|`|BUI9HnH1aa	ive also heard that it helps <br>  i also heard that when a woman has embros implanted during ivf , it help the eggs to take if she is sexually aroused|`|N89HLv92aa	Yes just make sure your husband "go's" first and then you "go". It help the little swimmers get to the egg faster. Also doing it with the man on top and doggy style is the best way to get pregnant. If the woman is on top then the stuff just runs out.  Try Preseed. It is a sperm friendly lubricant that helps the flow of sperm get to the egg. I posted a link of where I bought it from. I am going to try it out this month. Lots of baby dust to you!! Good Luck and God Bless!!<br>  <a href="http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/pre-seed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/pre...</a>|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	The saying is that if a woman has an orgasm BEFORE sex the cervix is more favoursome to carry the sperm up to where it needs to go to fertalise the egg. An orgasm is not required to get pregnant but i guess it makes sex and baby making more fun. Good luck|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	You need to ovulate to get pregnant.. having orgasm during sex is an additional benefit for the sperms to swim easier|`|E7tpMkdDaa	I don't know but it seems like something you should strive for anyways.|`|HLKb961Qaa	No, it doesn't matter if you have an orgasm. Only if your partner does. When he ejaculates, sperm does make its way into your cervix, so the amount that leaks out shouldn't have an impact on your probability of becoming pregnant. The best time to conceive is the few days before and day of your ovulation.
cnK4X2sZaa	from what it sounds like...i would say no. when your pregs, the bloating doesn't go away.. by this point i had all the symptoms. and im not sure about this period that you had either... im pretty positive it was your period. hope this helps...|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Regardless of whether or not your pregnant- see your doctor!<br>  to me those symptoms sound like warning bells for something potentially serious and the doctor can tell you just how likely being pregnant actually is.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Lol sticky situation.<br>  I was the same "I refuse to spend money on a test when it's just going to come out negative!", boy was I wrong in doing that.<br>  I found out when I was 15 weeks!!! That means I had been pregnant for 3 months!<br>  I had the pregnancy symptoms, but ignored them thinking "I couldn't be pregnant", so then I went to the doctor and SURPRISE a test comes out positive, $25 for a doctors visit instead of a simple $13 HPT.<br>  <br>  You do the math missy, catch it early when you have a choice or be ignorant and tight-*** with your money and spend a lifetime constantly spending money for your child.<br>  $13 now or $500,000 over the next 18 years...or more!? Your choice.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	when you have implantation bleeding at the beginning of a pregnancy, very rarely is it a 4 day ordeal. What sucks is that many of the common signs of early pregnancy are the same as your period or PMS. If you don't want to spend the $ on a test, I say wait til your due for your period again and then go from there. <br>  <br>  I highly doubt you are pregnant. Good Luck!!|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Headaches and a healthy tummy dont sounds like symptoms of a pregnancy... sorry.  Now if you tired ALL OF THE TIME and missed your period and were puking and werent able to concentrate and stuff, that would be something else.<br>  <br>  What do you mean you dont want to waste 13 dollars on a test... you thought, HUM I think i will go to Yahoo Answers and find out if Im pregnant instead??? LMFAO! You need to take a test and you need to find out because I could be wrong, just like someone, well everyone else on here could be as well!  NO one can tell you if you are or not!|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie, it truthfully doesn't really sound like you're pregnant to me. Some women do experience completely normal bleeding (not even spotting) which is how some women claim not to know about their pregnancy until they go into labor LOL. Did you use protection in January? Bloating and fatigue, as well as cramps from your uterus stretching are all possible signs of pregnancy. You wouldn't really be showing yet which is why you still have a flat tummy if you do happen to be pregnant. Honestly I wish I could give you a definite answer. My gut says no, but if I was you, I'd go to the dollar store and get a test ;) You can also get a test from Walmart for only four bucks. Not a big purhcase and it will definitely give you peace of mind. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, like frequent urination, tender breasts, or nausea? Best of luck to you dear I hope everything turns out the way you want it to x<br>  <br>  EDIT--With your add'l details you really don't sound pregnant to me. Pick up a dollar store test to be sure but you're probably in the clear. If you just went back on the pill, it could explain the bloating and breast tenderness/enlargement|`|044WNiRtaa	It doesn't really sound like you're pregnant at all.  Being tired and having headaches -can- be a symptom of pregnancy, but they can also mean that you're not getting enough rest, and with the regular and normal periods I'd say you're not.  <br>  <br>  Yes, you can have periods during pregnancy, but it's uncommon.<br>  <br>  So I'd say no, it's not likely.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Did you know that you can get pregnancy tests at the dollar store?  That's how I found out I was pregnant.  They work just as well.  Also, you  can get cheap pregnancy tests online (cheap as in cost, not quality).  Usually they are $.50-$1.00 ea and shipping is almost nil because they fit into an envelope.|`|GcZqrz85aa	It is always possible to be preggo :) Probably not though if you have had your normal period (not abnormally heavy or light) <br>  <br>  P.S. the Dollar Store sells tests and they are the exact same thing you can get for $15 :)|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	hmmmm i dont think you are from what i read by what you said.<br>  headaches can be caused by so many stufff.|`|GZYN1rCTaa	I really don't think you're pregnant.  As said above, headaches are caused by lots of things.  The bloating could be caused by something you are eating.  This early you would not be showing yet either (if this is your first pregnancy).  Your fatigue could be that you are low on iron.  Women struggle with their iron levels because of their cycles and the constant loss of blood.  Low iron level make you feel sluggish and fatigue.<br>  <br>  When was your last menstrual cycle?  If I am adding your time line correctly, you are due to start your cycle again  You told us when you had intercourse, but when did you have your cycle last?  I say if you start (which would explain the bloating), then not pregnant.  If you don't start, or you spot,  it's a good reason to take a test.|`|kziIf0r6aa	Its funny you ask a question just like this one as my sister is alot like you a real night owl bloated one day flat the next bleeding but not like her usual monthly periods, she was constantly tired her boobs were sore and she felt a little ordinary.  She's now discovered she's 12 weeks pregnant.  I told her to go and get a blood test, she wasnt convinced at first but once I told her that you didnt necessairly have to get all the obvious pregnancy symptoms to be "Pregnant".  They work it all out for you when you go to the dr's anyhow so dont stress too much about when your last period may have been.<br>  <br>  Good luck I hope you get the answers you need today or at a later stage.|`|mQhqRbRQaa	Yes there is definitely a chance of you being pregnant.  I am actually going through the exact same thing right now.  I've had periods but I feel pregnant. <br>  <br>  From personal experience regarding my friends, some of them had full periods, a couple of times before finding out they are pregnant.  The headaches can also be caused by that as well.  <br>  However, it may be just because you really are bloated.  I would wait a little more, and cut down on doing anything that could complicate a pregnancy like smoking, drinking etc, until you know for sure.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you test on time, so 5 days after your missed period or even later.  Sometimes tests can come back negative even if you really are pregnant;
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Cinnamon is a uterine stimulant in high doses, but quite safe as a culinary herb; you should avoid the essential oil completely though. So you just don't want highly concentrated doses of it as in a topical oil or supplement. A cinnamon roll would be just fine and so would anything you would ever want to eat with cinnamon in it. I get cravings for those too and just had one the other day.<br>  <br>  The problem with sleeping on your back when you are this far along is that it can impact your circulation because the weight of the baby in your uterus puts pressure on your vena cava. It's just not good to lay that way for a long time. I kept having the same thing happen so I now make myself a little pillow fort with one pillow in front of me and one behind so I do not roll over on my back. Don't worry that you have harmed your baby by doing this in the past, as it impacts the circulation for you more than the baby. Just try to keep off your back if you can. Good luck to you. :]|`|seU9VwIJaa	My doctor didn't say stay away from cinnamon, so I had plenty of rolls while pregnant. I'd ask yours what they think. Some of the websites overdue it, so I prefer to trust my doctor and the book What to Expect When Expecting. <br>  <br>  Sleeping on your back cuts off oxygen to yourself and your baby. I woke up on my back all the time! I had to pin myself against the wall with pillows. If you can, sleep on your left side. The baby will have a better blood flow. <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|ZPVRxV4taa	I've also never heard either of these things from my Doc. I'm due in May so I'm about 28 weeks... i think (boy time flies by too fast) <br>  personally I try to go to sleep with the pillow between my legs but I'll also wake up and the pillow is else where. normally I'll try to put in under my legs and sleep on my back but then I'll toss and turn moving the pillow a bunch.<br>  And I'm eating a cinnamon roll right now so ;P on them websites you looked at|`|C8E3fe3xaa	You can sleep in whatever position you find comfortable, it is just recommended to sleep on your left side to get better blood flow. I sleep on my back all the time and i'm fine.<br>  <br>  & i've never heard anything about avoiding cinnamon while pregnant..i hope that isn't true, i just ate some cinnamon rolls about an hour ago.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	No cinnimon? I've never heard that. Hon, I'm 39 weeks 3 days and I've eaten cinnimon here and there. My baby is just fine! xx<br>  <br>  Oh, I did that until the weight became to bad. Don't worry|`|mqHL4UcRaa	What pregnancy websites say this? I've never heard of that and I just searched the web and found nothing. If your talking about using cinnamon the spice, I'm sure your fine. <br>  <br>  It's not going to hurt you too bad if you wake up on your back. Just roll over when that happens. Sleeping on your back causes breathing problems and circulatory problems which cuts off some of the oxygen supply to you and the baby. Just try to shove pillows behind you or beside you to keep you from rolling over on your back. As long as your bottom half (legs/torso) is on its side, then you can lay your upper half flat on your back. Make sense? My doctor recommended I sleep this way to avoid hip pain.|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	Eat your cinnabon.  You'll be fine.  It's not like you're eating a whole stick of cinnamon.  I've never heard of avoiding cinnamon.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about waking on your back.  I was freaking out about that too.  My doctor says that you can't help what you do when you are sleeping.  Would you rather pee an extra time during the night or wake up with severe hip pain...you choose.  If you want to stay on your side...try completely surrounding yourself with pillows...didn't help me though.|`|tNofUG1yaa	In high doses it is a uterine stimulant, which could cause you to go into premature labor, but it is quite safe as a culinary herb.  You should avoid the essential oil, but I wouldn't worry about a cinammon bun.  As for sleeping on your back, it puts unnecessary pressure on your heart and other organs.  Sleeping on your left side will improve circulation to the heart and allow for the best blood flow to the fetus, uterus, and kidneys.  Tossing in your sleep is natural so I wouldn't worry about it too much because you can't really control it, you will most likely stop shifting onto your back soon because it will be too uncomfortable.
dOQ5yipDaa	A good idea is going to your doctor and telling them that you are planing on TTC.<br>  <br>  They will test you to make sure you are up to date for your rubella shots etc.<br>  <br>  They will also ensure that you are taking folic acid - which needs to be taken 3 months before TTC in order to reduce chances of birth effects like spina bifida etc.<br>  <br>  You could also just get a general family history IE your mother and your grandmothers (if possible) and ask how long it took them to conceive etc - but I really dont think getting family history on pregnancies is relevant. My doctor didnt advice me of this anyway.|`|VlYMcVKlaa	u can, i think it would help u and the kid and if one of the family members had any illness or so, you can tell your doc about it and see what he says or if it could affect u and the baby

That person could have just posted those pictures for a porn site. Don't fall for people on myspace you never know who it may be I'm sure you've heard this all before but its always a broken record until it happens to you or someone close. Go out with someone in your school that you know and other people know, you'll be safer and people will know a face and a name of who you'll be with. Don't ever send or put or send pictures through the internet that you would mind the entire world seeing. I know you like this person but for all you know he could be a 40 year old pedaphile that lives right in your neighborhood (just cause he has pics doesnt mean its him). Be careful with myspace, its cool to meet people online but keep them as online only friends.

You create a better bond with your child, Save money on formula. <br>  <br>  Cons: I could get painful, some women experiance dry cracking on the nipples but the make what is called a nipple sheild which allows the baby to feed but keeps you safe from hard sucking or even teeth. yes teeth my son had teeth 3 months after birth.<br>  convenience, sometimes the baby might be hungry and you are in a mall, they make clothing for feeding in public so look into that. <br>  Lack of milk, if that happens substitute what you cant produce with formula  with RHA but still feed breast milk some is better than none.<br>  you might make too much milk, in this case get a breast pump and some bottles and store the milk. look up on-line the best way to store the milk not sure bout that. <br>  <br>  In my opinion breast feeding is important for a child's best chance at life.|`|rVsW4ESTaa	I am not a doctor but only speaking from personal knowledge and experience.  You should breastfeed for a couple of weeks and let the baby get your colostrum.  This has many wonderful antibodies in it.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, I don't know all the benefits.  Breastfeeding is difficult, time consuming and painful for the mom.<br>  <br>  The max I did it for was 6 weeks.  My kids are as healthy as can be.  No flues, colds or ear infections.  Much healthier than any of my friends' kids.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Breastfeeding is cheaper, but it's difficult to do if you work outside the home.  I was often in pain and engorged because there just wasn't time and place to pump at work.  If you bottle feed, dad can help with the night time feedings and that might help him feel more bonded with the baby.  Breastfeeding is better nutritionally and I believe helps baby's immune system.  Whatever you choose is fine, really.|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Its natural and makes you kid more loving,smarter.<br>  But its you like hell....|`|vXFpzKRaaa	Pros:  <br>  1.  There's less spitting up, no stains and the poop doesn't smell!<br>  2.  Eat more and lose weight faster: A breastfeeding mother needs 500 extra calories a day because the body burns that amount while breastfeeding. She'll be back in her pre-pregnancy shape quickly.<br>  3.  Protects against ear infections, colds, and viruses: If the child does have any of the above, the severity will most likely be lessened because of the protection from the breastmilk.<br>  4.  Helps brain to grow and develop.<br>  5.  Less learning and behavior difficulties.<br>  6.  Easy to digest: It is almost impossible to have a constipated breastfed baby and less diarrhea.<br>  7.  Protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, leukemia, some childhood cancers, and juvenile-onset diabetes.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  1.  If someone else wants to feed the baby with a bottle of breast milk the mother still has to pump.<br>  2.  Nursing is definitely time-consuming: Newborn babies typically feed every 2 to 3 hours during the day and may awaken frequently at night.<br>  3.  Working mothers can find it challenging to schedule nursings. It is necessary to pump at work and some jobs may not allow for such breaks (they should, but some do not comply.)<br>  4.  Breastfeeding takes a lot of energy for your body to make milk, so the mother can often feel quite fatigued.<br>  5.  Feeding in public can be challenging.|`|VYpVrPluaa	How does breastfeeding benefit the mother?<br>  Eat more and lose weight faster: A breastfeeding mother needs 500 extra calories a day because the body burns that amount while breastfeeding. She'll be back in her pre-pregnancy shape quickly.<br>  <br>  It's easy and convenient: There's nothing to buy or prepare so it gives the mother much more freedom. Breasts are always there and the milk is always warm and ready.<br>  <br>  The mother can snooze during night feedings<br>  <br>  There's a very special bond between Mother and Baby and it's the natural way to feed<br>  <br>  There's less spitting up, no stains and the poop doesn't smell!<br>  <br>  Protects against some breast and ovarian cancers: While breastfeeding, estrogen levels are very low. Research has shown that the longer you breastfeed, the risks for these cancers goes down<br>  <br>  MAY delay menstrual period: Again, estrogen levels are low and many women think they're well protected from conceiving, but ovulation may still occur<br>  <br>  It's an amazing confidence booster: Mothers are really able to use their natural ability<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, there is very little embarrassment: It's easy to nurse discreetly and modestly<br>  <br>  How does breastfeeding benefit the baby?<br>  Protects against ear infections, colds, and viruses: If the child does have any of the above, the severity will most likely be lessened because of the protection from the breastmilk<br>  <br>  Helps brain to grow and develop<br>  <br>  Less learning and behavior difficulties<br>  <br>  Less diaper rash and other skin problems<br>  <br>  Less colic, less crying<br>  <br>  Easy to digest: It is almost impossible to have a constipated breastfed baby!<br>  <br>  Less diarrhea<br>  <br>  Protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, leukemia, some childhood cancers, and juvenile-onset diabetes<br>  <br>  Benefits heart health<br>  <br>  Fewer trips to the doctor and hospitalizations<br>  <br>  Babies LOVE the taste<br>  <br>  Are there any cons to breastfeeding?<br>  Nursing is definitely time-consuming: Newborn babies typically feed every 2 to 3 hours during the day and may awaken frequently at night.<br>  <br>  If someone else wants to feed the baby with a bottle of breast milk the mother still has to pump.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding takes a lot of energy for your body to make milk, so the mother can often feel quite fatigued.<br>  <br>  There can be a certain amount of anxiety and frustration while a mother is learning the process.<br>  <br>  Sometimes mothers have physical problems like mastitis, plugged milk ducts and engorgement if the baby is not feeding frequently or properly.<br>  <br>  Working mothers can find it challenging to schedule nursings. It is necessary to pump at work and some jobs may not allow for such breaks (they should, but some do not comply.)|`|HEdGGmkhaa	The only cons I remember with nursing is that sometimes they get engorged and very large, some might like that lol<br>  The pros by far outweigh the cons, the milk is always warm and ready, always enough of it to feed baby.<br>  It's clean, no bottle needed. If you are tired it's right there, baby used to sleep with me sometimes and I would just roll over and sleep through it lol.<br>  <br>  It makes you lose the baby fat in next to no time, I went to an OB appt when he was 2 weeks old and had people asking me whose baby it was lol. Your uterus will contract a bit but it shrinks quickly<br>  <br>  Obvious one is the nutritional goodness!|`|K2dNndE2aa	idk many but heres some:<br>  PROS<br>  -studies show breastfed babies are smarter than formula babies, both now and when they're older<br>  -you get closer to your baby and have a special bond with them<br>  -good for the baby and provides vitamins and nutrients formula cant give them<br>  CONS<br>  -boobs may sag when you're older<br>  -may make your boobs sore<br>  <br>  my friends brother is breastfed and extremely smart, EVERYONE says "he's a breastfed baby isn't he? lol. he just turned a year old. he can point to things he wants, say some words, knows baby sign language (hungry, change my diaper, tired, etc) we gave him a  shovel and he already knew what to do with it, he put the sand in the bucket the first time he ever used one, he gets upset about things i didn't think babies were capable of being upset about. lol.<br>  <br>  EDIT: breastfeeding shouldn't be painful if you do it right.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	It's rich in nutrients that would help build your baby's immune system and prevent sickness. It also helps protect your baby from diebities and some other conditions. <br>  <br>  You can pump breast milk and save it for later. So you can feed your baby breast milk in a bottle for while your in public.|`|a3bq277Gaa	Pros- It helps you lose weight<br>  It's better for you baby<br>  It'll make your baby smarter<br>  If you don't do it, you'll get an infection if your breasts<br>  Saves money on formula<br>  <br>  Cons- It hurts like hell|`|AA12092217	yes|`|ynh7rqpPaa	i breast fed my son for about a week and then went to formula, i was a lot happier doing it this way. <br>  <br>  pros of formula : anyone can feed the baby for you and they can also have a change to bond with the baby <br>  you don't have to have nipple pain<br>  <br>  cons: it gets expensive <br>  <br>  <br>  dont feel guilty about not breastfeeding, ppl will try to make you feel this way but dont listen to them. My baby is now 19 months old, he has only ever had one cold and i know a baby who always has colds and she was breas fed! breast milk is good for your baby but in the year of 2009 formula is also very good too!  You could always express milk for a period so your baby gets the nutrients they need.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	PROS  free, decreased risk of breast cancer, immunities for your baby, lose weight faster, easy clean up, always right temperature, easy at night, just pop it out and go back to sleep, and free!<br>  <br>  CONS  kind of tied to baby if you don't pump, have to be careful about drinking alcohol, sometimes not fun during sex|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Pro's of breast feeding<br>  It's healthier for the baby and cheaper than buying formula.<br>  <br>  Con's of breast feeding<br>  If you get sick, your baby gets sick.<br>  Your nipples will get sore.<br>  <br>  You could always try breast feeding, and if for some reason you change your mind you can switch to formula.|`|eMSP740Taa	Oh my goodness, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for babies to be breast fed. Besides being the absolute BEST start for a newborn baby's development, a research recently showed that over 90% of the population that was breast fed as babies for at least 6 months NEVER developed a single allergy to anything. I breast fed both of mine and they are perfectly healthy thank God! I recommend it passionately! People may say "oh it will make your breasts sag"...or this and that....but what is most important above all is to give your baby a head start in life. Good luck with it all!! And congrats on your baby. =]|`|HkviOlBgaa	Pros:<br>  <br>  - Correct nutritional intake for the newborn<br>  - Inexpensive<br>  - Proven to form stronger maternal bonds with the newborn<br>  - Gives essential antibodies for the prevention of basic diseases.<br>  - Contains hormones that promote growth of bones, absorption of iron and omega-3 fatty acids.<br>  - Very motherly, and something of which you should be proud.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>  - Your nipples hurt.<br>  - Possible outcry from prudists if done in public|`|0h1qKzo8aa	Pros - healthier for child. formula makes the baby 'poo' more. your boobs get bigger ;] but mostly its healthier. CHEAPER!<br>  <br>  cons- it hurts. blood blisters and bite marks lol. they harden after they haved gone too long without releasing milk.' which hurts' so it pretty well just hurts, but is much healthier for baby<br>  <br>  formula is about 60 dollars usually. at least here it is.|`|ZwsnMTElaa	your baby will be much healthier if you breast feed. it's said to make your kid pretty smart as they grow. and the longer you breast feed the longer you breast are going to be large.<br>   artificial milk wastes your money and it's not really all that good for the baby.|`|8gFujGXbaa	The mom should be aware that once she has started, it is really hard to stop because the baby might not want to swith for artificial milk for example. It can become painful and demanding for the mother.|`|Rkzs0KPsaa	I learned about this in class, the nutrients found in a woman's breast milk are way more better than the ones in powder milk.|`|PHknlA1Zaa	pro- saves a lot of money<br>  pro-connection between you and baby-<br>  pro-very healthy for the baby<br>  pro-natural<br>   <br>  con- painful<br>  con-can be difficult to get the baby to latch on.|`|L3zxoUFVaa	Pro it helps you and your childs relationship, plus better brain development<br>  con it makes your boobs dry and a little sore|`|rigabPvZaa	Actully I'd go with what Alice and Wonderland said
veO1RXrCaa	Get a blood test.  Or just face the fact that the depo is still messing with you.  That stuff is horrible for you.  You should have had a positive test by now.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	Instead of wasting all of your money on over the counter tests why not just go to the doctor and let them give you a test. The health depts will do it for nearly nothing- if you do not have ins. I mean even if you are they will still do one to make sure. Good luck!|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Go to the D-O-C-T-O-R|`|KlJHZRSiaa	All your symptoms could be pregnancy, but they could also be PMS. However, if your period is more than 2 weeks late, you're normally regular, and you're not getting positive test results, go for a blood test. Some women NEVER get a positive pee test, and the blood serum test is how they find out. It would certainly be accurate by now. Good luck!|`|QR6IHIZxaa	actually to sumone up there ^^^ some women dont get a positive because their hcg levels dont read on the tests. and some women also dont get positives on blood tests either its called the loop effect or something, cant quite remember what its called... <br>  Anyways.... sorry to hear that someone was rude to you before, i know this is a stressful time... the symptoms you have listed seem to be falling in the pregnancy category. I suggest a doctor or you can wait and see if your periods are coming on time, but also keep in mind that some women report bleeding such as their period in the first trimester of pregnancy. I hope your ok and everything goes well.|`|ncUhlwevaa	That was like, waaaay too long to read. Just go buy a test. No one on Yahoo can tell you if you are pregnant. Yes, the symptoms you are having are pregnancy symptoms, you can find that out just by googling early pregnancy symptoms.. could they be contributed to something else.. yes. Only way to know for sure is to take a test. By the way, if you were testing negative on a hpt your boobs would not have already grown a cup size due to being pregnant.|`|044WNiRtaa	Depo can do really funny things to your body.  When I came off it I didn't get a period for about 3 months then had it for one month straight.  <br>  <br>  As for your other symptoms:<br>  Weight gain usually does = breast size increase.  Alot of things can cause weight gain.  ESPECIALLY if you're feeling hungry alot.  <br>  Tiredness and temperature can mean a virus, or a cold.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't trust your mothers dreams as a positive pregnancy diagnosis.  Mothers can get pretty clucky sometimes too, even though they've done their dash!<br>  <br>  Taking a million tests and having them come up negative is a pretty big sign you're not pregnant.  They're fairly accurate.<br>  <br>  If you want to get pregnant I'm sorry to be negative, but it just sounds like a lot of coincidental symptoms however I'd go to a doctor anyway as sometimes issues with your periods can be a sign of an STD, and if you think you could be pregnant, you could have one of those too.|`|791NVofcaa	go to the doctor and have them do a blood test. they can also give you hormones to get your period going if the test comes back negative. pregnancy symptoms mimick many other issues, so it's hard to say just by your list of symptoms. depo can cause weight gain, weight gain can cause increased breast size, yatta yatta. you may also be psyching yourself out... causing you to "feel" these symptoms. and the more stress you put on yourself the more likely your period will be irregular. but nonetheless...have the doctor do the blood test.|`|c9ec0233d1d48d45c1d947009910828eaa	your symptoms indicate that you more then likely are. but if your mom cant take the pee test then do like i did today and have the blood test done. I didnt have a normal period last month it lasted one day. more like spotting. I have taking 3 test and they all say negative im late since the 6th. Im regular as well. good luck. some ppl cannot take the urine test. i was pregnant bfore and used a urine test. But this time im not getting a positive result. i had blood taken today.
BBfIXcI0aa	...you people obviously aren't nearly nerdy enough for your own good.<br>  <br>  Online roleplaying is totally safe - it's a lot of fun, and a wonderful way to get to try out personalities and lifestyles you will never touch in real life.

a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	I usually feed my son solids at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  This will establish his future eating habits. And then a bottle in between, like a snack. <br>  <br>  I usually get fresh sweet potatoes, squash, carrots, apples, etc and bake them until mushy. Or avocado, banana.  Then I put into a baby food grinder.  I sometimes add formula to thin it out.   My son LOVES it.  He doesn't touch Gerber foods anymore.<br>  <br>  Here is a GREAT baby food recipe site. <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/</a>|`|y8d38Sbgaa	Hi!<br>  I use the website:<br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a><br>  to help me figure out what to feed my baby.  It has great suggestions for new foods to try.<br>  Also, I just feed my baby when I am eating too - breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  Lisa|`|BfBMRlNNaa	At that age my daughter was really only nursing in the morning and at night before bed, occasionally as a snack. Usually she had some sort of fruit puree for lunch at noon with juice ( watered down ), then in the afternoon she would have a snack like cereal ( they have great puff cereal snacks in the baby isle that dissolve in their mouths) and in the evening she would have her veggies ( carrots, sweet potato, mixed veggies, peas, green beans, squash, etc.) and a drink. My daughter wasn't sleeping through the night yet at that point, so right before bed she would get some warm cereal and I would nurse her. In general I tried to feed her small portions every 3-4 hours and that worked very well for us.|`|YUNE5QReaa	I find that I do a big cook up on a monday and store about half a cup or less of food (you lwill learn how much he eats in one sitting) in lil containers or ice cube trays, you can mash pretty much anything, try potato and pumpkin together, add vegies, try blending meats like lamb and add vegies and potato so your son can have a hearty meal for dinner.<br>  <br>  Try the heinz websites they are very helpful.|`|d8Tifuzmaa	Hello,<br>  My daughter is 8.5 months old, and she eats things like this: Banana's cut up in small pieces, toast cut in small pieces, cheerios, cereals, pasta (well done), and etc. Here's the routine I use: Wake up between 7am-8am. Drink 6-7 oz of milk. Have a bath around 9am. Have some solid snacks with water. Drink milk (6-7oz), and have solids around 11am. take a nap around 12pm. And wake up around 2pm. And more milk (6-7oz). And then she will have some solids and water when she is hungry. And at 8pm she will go to bed. And wake up around 4 times. Then she'll end up in bed with me later. Lol.
1SGl03Zlaa	We're still working on adjusting to the new time.  Right now she is going to bed an hour later since she isn't adjusted yet but I'm planning on moving her bedtime by 10 minutes a night until she is back at the right time.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We still put him down to bed at the same time because he was still awake for the same amount of time. Yesterday was pretty rough for him, today was much better. I figure by the end of the week he'll be settled back in.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son was so off all day. He slept the whole day away. He was cranky also. He went to bed at like 5 when he usually goes to be around 8. I didn't have the heart to wake him up.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Yes, he'll be adjusted, although I'm giving it time.  For example, this morning he woke up at 9, even though he usually wakes up about 7 or 8 (so he really woke up at the same time).  So since his breakfast was much later, then the whole day was off, nap was later, so lunch was later, etc, etc.  But he went to bed not too much later than normal.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	Yes, my baby will still go to bed at the same time.  We just played with the time a bit so that the adjustment was a difference of only about 1/2 an hour each night.  So far so good.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	My daughter adjusted well.  in fact Sunday night she slept better than she has in months.|`|kAyF2fm0aa	My son has been off since this "spring forward." He cried sooo much tonight for bed time, 9:00pm, it was unbelievable.. then I remembered, its only 8:00 technically. He didn't go to sleep until 10 something tonight... I hope this isn't going to happen every night..
k0QRfQ00aa	Hey, sounds like you should be back in l&d within the next 48 hours. They wouldn't have sent you home if it was time. If I were you I would try to go do a little bit of walking or have sex but I am sure right now with the contractions you probably don't want that but that would speed up the dilation process because I am sure you are not only tired from being up all night but ready to deliver. Only time they really induce is if the baby is in distress or you are overdue. I am sure no later than this weekend you will be having your baby. Until then rest as much as the baby will let you. Best wishes to you and your baby!!|`|ZauPx2Ffaa	It was probably just bloody show. Did you let the L&D nurses know that you had bloody show? If you did and they still sent you home- you're fine. If you contractions are subsiding, it might just be early labor. Have some sex, walk around a bit, go up and down stairs- all that will help labor along.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck mama....sounds like you're almost there!|`|LTTips1vaa	They sent you home because you are still in early labor.  It could be awhile or possible not!   I would just try to lay down and get some rest now while you can.  Trust me when your contractions get bad then you will wake up.  If they are already bad then try taking a warm bath (not hot through something luke warm like you would bathe a child in).  You can trying walking to help things.  Another thing that helped me was squat like a child on the floor (this helps open up the pelvis and allow the baby to come down).  Yeah mama!!! <br>  <br>  If you don't want to get induced then wait until the contractions are 5 min apart before going to the hospital.  Labor at home is the best thing.

fboC1N7gaa	I think Marina Sage is a lovely name.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Marina Leanne is a name I would use  I love doule letters|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Marina is a beautiful name, but I'd spell it Maryna, so she's not associated with the ocean and the things that live in it. But that's my opinion. I like Maryna Raine and Maryna Saige :)|`|yv94euDBaa	I love Marina Sage. Beautiful.<br>  <br>  Also, Marina Lilac is pretty.|`|0hxK0khKaa	I like Marina Raine or Marina Willow.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	Marina Skye !!! I love it !|`|DO3grY10aa	I like Marina a lot and I notice that you like nature names in general.  The only drawback I see to your combinations are that they are what some people refer to as "too noun-y".  A marina is a place where people store their boats.  Marine also refers to things having to do with water in general.<br>  <br>  Willow is a tree, Sage can either be a wise person, or a plant used for seasoning.  Journey is of course something you take, and of course Sky and Rain are self-explanatory.<br>  <br>  I don't want to come across as really negative; just want to point out things that you or others might notice down the road.  Sky blue and Marine blue (usually called navy blue) are two shades of blue; and Sage is a shade of green.<br>  <br>  Some ideas for little used middle names are in the second article: <br>  Marina Blythe<br>  Marina Blair<br>  Marina Wynne<br>  Marina Tyne<br>  Marina Clio<br>  <br>  What about Marina Linnea (li-NAY-uh) ?|`|3Olb1mDmaa	1st off i LOVE the name Marina :]<br>  its beautiful.<br>  My favorite is Marina Skye.<br>  Or Marina Raine.<br>  For middle names, i think Skye already sounds really good && my suggestion isnt as good as your middle name idea, but i think Marina Faith sounds pretty. Thats my cousins first name :] <br>  Good Luck.|`|QSL8kwzXaa	I like Marina Sage and Marina Raine, but you could also spell Raine 'Rayne'. I went to school with a girl named Rayne.<br>  I also like the names Delia, Vanessa, Lydia and Amelia as middle names as well.|`|ihn3LgmWaa	Marina Skye <br>  OR <br>  Marina Spring|`|XBUa3Kniaa	Marina Skye or Marina Sage.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	I like Marina Raine the best.  Marina reminds me of boats and water, so I think Raine fits really well with that and it sounds pretty.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	MArina Skye|`|GdgHSFY4aa	I dont like the marina all that much.. its ok.. but not so much.. i like Skye as a middle name!|`|m6G5CuLVaa	Marina Rukia...<br>  <br>  Marina Rose|`|36NBK4aaaa	marina jocelyn... sounds real pretty in spanish|`|z2iz0oNKaa	I like Marina Willow.<br>  That's such a pretty name! :)
AA11728589	At every appt you have they will have you pee in a cup first thing to do some tests.<br>  I agree the Dr. was a bit rude, but do NOT feel bad about asking the Dr. more questions or more detailed explanations or clarifications.  I always make a list of questions before I go and have them in my hand when the Dr. comes in.<br>  Anyway, protein in your urine MAYBE a sign of preclampsia which causes high blood pressure in the mother.<br>  However, traces of protein can be found because discharge or other reasons....<br>  Don't worry yet!  The Dr. will tell when you should worry!!<br>  In the meantime, congratulations and take care!!|`|9bd72311b07fe2efcda1fdb5265a2ebbaa	preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure|`|08902ef0b2ec168317b9955ab855828baa	the simplest way to explain it is that when you are pregnant your kidneys have to go into overdrive, some protein can show up in your urine due to overload.  drink one or more gallons of water a day and that should help.  If the protein is still there with other signs such as high blood pressure, fever, lethargy; your doctor should discuss other possibilities such as infection or preeclampsia; all of which are treatable but come with risks.|`|c668b68279e6ff83ed54170ed8c97f5aaa	there can be a lot of causes are you not eating enough or drinking enough water possibly high blood Pressure during pregnancy or pre eclampsia or a urinary tract infection with high blood pressure or UTI they would probably just give a medication to control the problem preeclampsia would depend on how far along you are i reccomend drinking a lot of water and making sure you eat enough before you get rechecked hopefully this will fix the problem
lzcglDnMaa	Ovulation pain happens in the front about two inches to the right or left of your belly button... sometimes it feels like a little butterfly flutter and sometimes it's a sharp stabbing sensation.
JnLoHaoAaa	Yes, they are really close together in pronunciation. Maybe you could alter the pronunciation a bit so there's no confusion|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Not sure<br>  Here is a tick I saw on here<br>  <br>  You have some one in another room call both names in different order<br>  If you can tell them apart, they are not to close<br>  <br>  Like Hali, Aili<br>  Aili, Aili, Hali, Aili<br>  Haili, Aili, Haili<br>  IF you get all the names right, they are not to close|`|doLyOac0aa	Yeah,|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I think they are very similar. I wouldn't use such similar names. If you want similar names, use Aili as a middle name and give her a name that starts with an "H", like Hayden Aili or Hannah Aili. But of course, it is your child and it's always up to you.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Yes, you will drive yourself crazy when they are older and you're yelling at one just like my mom did with Jessica and Jennifer! How about Reigh?|`|fboC1N7gaa	They are quite similar, but both names are sooo beautiful. I say go for it.|`|FhlmiI7daa	I think that they are cute names but it might get confusing if you have to call across the house for one of them when they are older...I only think of this because my mom named me and my twin sister rhyming names and it was hard to discern the difference sometimes|`|i3FgiLENaa	Hmmm, they're pretty similar, yeah.<br>  Try Isla (eye-la) that's not as similar but it sounds alike and you could nickname her Islie or something..it's a pretty name! And I like Hali too, I also like Haley but that's waaaay to similar!! Ahaha<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kcfZduJHaa	In my opinion, yeah, they're a bit too similar.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on the baby girl!|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	They are pretty similar but that doesn't seem to be an uncommon thing with naming siblings.|`|PuRpsENEaa	Yea a little too similar, Atleast you didn't pick Allie or something! So whatever makes you happy!|`|NePgB9b2aa	Sorry but I do think they're far too similar together.|`|0hxK0khKaa	I would name her Aaliyah and call her Aili for short.|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	They are a little similar but I think it should be fine.|`|bFP6jfvVaa	I think it would cause quite a bit of confusion when called out, especially from a room over. "Hali!" "Aili!" If you say it outloud, it sounds too much alike. My sister and I have names ending in "en" sound and it's confusing enough for that. <br>  <br>  VERY pretty names though. Why don't you use Aili for her middle name?<br>  <br>  Holly (can use the y or an i or ie)<br>  Molly (can use the y or an i or ie)<br>  Bailey (or Bailie)<br>  Kaylee/Caylee<br>  Ashley/Ashli<br>  Nikki<br>  <br>  My favorite:<br>  Hailey (I have two cousins, Hallie and Hayleigh...close but different enough...i like the idea of that... Hayleigh Aili doesn't sound bad either.)<br>  <br>  =) Best of luck! Congrats on your beautiful girls, Hali and whatever name you chose for your newest member.|`|QcvG6LXDaa	a little bit. and alot of people will mistakenly pronounce AILI as ALLY so then it is bothersome and even more similar. but i like some very similar names if you want suggestions:<br>  Kailey<br>  Riley<br>  Kelly<br>  Kylie<br>  hope that helps!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	They're both REALLY pretty.  I do think they are a bit too similar.  But if you like them, then do what suits you and your babies.  Best to you!|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	yeh they are a little bit too similar,... maybe something like:<br>  <br>  ailayah ( ah-lie-yah)<br>  or<br>  alaina (ah-lain-ah)|`|ovWDIHiRaa	The names sound too similar.  Hali is nice name, don't care for Aili.|`|m6G5CuLVaa	I really don't like the name Aili... i don't think you should use it... and they are to similar|`|9BwY5sA5aa	they are cute names but 2 similar just cuz u may call them the wrong name alot and they wont like that probably|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	No I think it's cute congrats
uAnw9LAQaa	I too was abused and developed some issues from it, this is one of those things that time has to heal and some family and relationship counseling wouldnt hurt. You also need to remember who you are with and how he treats you not how someone else has treated you! Good luck|`|vLnlKKThaa	Time will heal man i would never abuse a girl thats just wrong good thing u got a good man now good luck
0hxK0khKaa	I like Demetra, it's pretty much the same as Demetria. You can still call her Demi.<br>  <br>  I don't like Dianey, I can't pronounce it even with the pronunciation. And nobody else will be able to, either. How about just Diana?<br>  <br>  Other Greek names:<br>  Calliope<br>  Lydia<br>  Alexandria<br>  Persephone<br>  Phoebe<br>  Cloe<br>  Cassandra<br>  Pelene|`|QSL8kwzXaa	Demetria, yes.<br>  Dianey? Not so much. I think the most common thing with twins is that their names are similar to almost identical, so I would try to give them different initials so they have their own identities. Helena, Adriana, Alexa and Allison (or Alison) are Greek names and they are beautiful in my opinion.|`|HZjiNEMDaa	Sorry, the 2 names you picked I don't like.<br>  <br>  Here are some greek names...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.20000-names.com/female_greek_names.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.20000-names.com/female_greek_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.20000-names.com/male_greek_names.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.20000-names.com/male_greek_na...</a>|`|tzPEckiZaa	Not at all, especially Dianey. No one will ever be able to pronounce it with out explanation. It's a terrible name. <br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of Demetria either.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Demetria is waaay too close to Dementia, sorry.<br>  <br>  I'd much rather see Diane & Demi or Diane & Delilah.|`|s9WMTbUMaa	demetria is social suicide|`|7qVuZRHfaa	Derrick James<br>  Derranasha Janae|`|F9AiIcVfaa	honestly...i dont like them sry|`|GM0hJqrPaa	Gross Names, Your kids are going to kid teased a lot.|`|ovWDIHiRaa	Sorry, don't care for either name.|`|QhTMmNLAaa	None of those sound good at all...|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	No<br>  <br>  I love Catherine, Alexa and Aretha<br>  They are all greek names|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I don't like Diany but I LOVE Demitria (spelled like that)<br>  <br>  Maybe Demi & Delana :)|`|4SKIE1C8aa	First of all I don't like the same initial for twins. Other than that, I think Demetria is kind of cute but Dianey is horrible. What about Demetria and Melina (Greek meaning 'honey')?<br>  <br>  Other Greek names:<br>  Elene/Eleni<br>  Korina<br>  Nikoleta<br>  Petra<br>  Sofia (means 'wisdom')<br>  Zinovia/Zenovia<br>  Zo? (means 'life')|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I'd go with Dianna instead<br>  If it didn't have tobe Greek, Delaney is cute<br>  Sorry but I'm really not familiar with Greek names, but Demetria is pretty|`|nsSU9N40aa	Dianey is alright, not my favorite. <br>  Demetria is okay.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	If you want an honest aswner then no i hate them :( soorrri
yp9rEMSraa	Yeah it could have been...it depends on your period and when you actually ovulated this month...I wish you the best and lots of baby dust|`|N89HLv92aa	I havent heard of it coming that soon but maybe you ovulated early. Good Luck and God Bless!!!
kRaVa0Wraa	wow... i'm sorry. that was really rude of them. <br>  it doesnt matter what they think, though.<br>  especially because they are your close friends they might just see you as "one of the guys" and not "dateable" (to them) so they rated you lower.<br>  what does a stupid rating even mean anyway? a 6 to one person could be an 8 to someone else.<br>  :)<br>  so dont worry about it too much.|`|5rrK4o5raa	there your close friend there not supost to think your hot.. mine guy friends think im one of the guys .. so you rated highly for just friends my guy friends would give me like a 0 haha and im not ugly.. maybe try a new hair style or get new clothes? it might me them rate you higher or ask them what do you like about me or whatever. but seriously stop caring what people think it will only break you down.|`|PbLuxnzdaa	Dont worry sweetie, that reminds me of grade 7, we we're playing that game and some player ranked me at a 4.<br>  <br>  guess what? ive changed since then! <br>  now, i get compliments on my body and face all the time, im deffiantly 100 times better looking.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel, i felt so shitty for weeks, my confidence was shot.<br>  for every person who doesnt find you attractive theirs 5 more that do.<br>  <br>  think of that!<br>  keep your head up girl.|`|wfE3mo7Naa	Real friends don't rate you.<br>  <br>  They are not your friends. <br>  <br>  And this is coming from a guy.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Well they are not going to tell you that you're a 10 to your face or they will think you will think they like you so they gave you a decent score so you don't get cocky but don't get your feelings hurt either. I'm sure they don't really think you're a six.  Put your picture up on Hotornot.com and see what everyone else thinks. (FYI, Unless your pictures are of you in a hot bathing suit, you'll probably get low ratings. It's the sexy pics that get high ratings)

DsNEpN95aa	Well, Goslar is more unique although I don't like the ring to it that much. Henderson is more common than Goslar. If you like uniqueness, then go for Goslar. I personally like Henderson based on how it sounds lol. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|QE2hNXeCaa	Hi Troy, so like you to go around making surveys.I like both your names. Rad loves you so much, so I think you should take his last name. Joe will get over it but it will be weird for everyone else. We've known you as Troy Goslar all our lives. But yeah, even the public seem to think Henderson goes better with your name, it was meant to be. <3 Tabitha.|`|0XPEAeaYaa	i think troy henderson is better becasue if u dont want ppl to pronouce ur last name wrong all the time then i prefer troy henderson. troy goslar is although unique, but hard to pronouce. hope this helps :D|`|pda2fjxkaa	I think Troy Goslar sounds very unique. In fact, I really like that last name.. never heard it before either. I know a few people with the last name Henderson.|`|DO3grY10aa	I prefer the sound and appearance of Troy Henderson.|`|36NBK4aaaa	i like Goslar<br>   when i hear the second chioce i think...HARRY & the HENDERSONS|`|m6G5CuLVaa	Goslar.....blah... To say it you have to go all like GLOSAR<br>  <br>  Henderson.|`|ihn3LgmWaa	Troy Henderson all the way! Goslar just sounds... yeah|`|ovWDIHiRaa	I think both names sound nice.|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Is Goslar pronounced GOSS-luhr?<br>  If so, that one is just fine.<br>  But I think Henderson is so much cooler.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Troy Henderson!|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Aesthetically I like Troy Henderson better.  I don't know.  The two names mesh more for me.  They're both sort of the same style, they have decent flow.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't chose to change or not change my name based on how it sounds.  If you're going to be adopted and YOU feel like you want to take on your father's last name I think you should regardless of which name you think sounds better.  If you wanna keep your last name then that's what you should do.  Just my opinion, I suppose.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I really like the name Troy.....Troy Henderson sounds really nice but Goslar is fine ,too.

We figured that she might eventually outgrow the nickname, and she could choose if she wanted to be called Grace, Gracelyn, Savannah, etc.  But now, I just can't see her as a Savannah, much as I love the name.  So I guess I'm just hoping she decides to go by Gracie, Grace or Gracelyn!|`|0384e9b5fb1fd85ece0382882ee4d5dcaa	I was never really crazy about my son's name. I only had a few names picked out when I was pregnant, but my husband didn't like ANY of them. So when I was getting ready to be discharged from the hospital the nurse told me I either had to put a name on the birth certificate, or pay later to do so. So I looked through a baby name book, picked out a couple of combinations that I thought were okay, and had my husband make the final decision. I SERIOUSLY wanted to change it when he was about 2 months old (I thought it would "fit" him by then, but it didn't) but found out it would be like $250 and my Mom said I was crazy if I did it.<br>  He's 4 now, and I've gotten used to his name, but don't necessarily like it...yet...|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Freddy - he is seven now and I really am thinking "Was that such a cute name?"

I have always known what I wanted to name my children thank god hubby likes it too lol|`|xVEqBjDVaa	no i love my kids names!
gvN2iNcBaa	From everything I hear, the placenta will not change position. If you saw the doc and they said it was normal, try to relax. It is totally normal to have discharge, you may need to wear a pantyliner from here on out. Your uterus should be right around the top of your belly button right about now. Baby's position will change alot between now and birth! He is probably doing somersaults in there! Try to relax and enjoy whats happening to your body. I am 10 days behind you with number 5, so I know it can make you nervous! But it sounds like all is well!|`|5WP9rLTlaa	if the doctor isn't worried then you don't need to be.<br>  For the discomfort you are feeling, exercise helps a lot, personally I find that if I do not do at least forty minutes walking everyday I am really uncomfortable when trying to sleep at night. <br>  As to your questions here are a couple of websites I find really helpful, I've signed up for the weekly emails and eagerly await their arrival each week because the info in them is relevant to that particular stage of the pregnancy.<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com.au/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.birth.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birth.com.au/</a><br>  Some of the information in them might not apply to you as they are for British and Australian mums to be<br>  here is another site I use because it has very good pictures of what baby would look like if born at each week. you can attatch it to your sidebar so that everytime you look at the screen you can see what baby looks like.<br>  <a href="http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com" rel="nofollow">http://3dpregnancy.parentsconnect.com</a><br>  <br>  I'm 35 weeks along with my baby boy!|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Congratulations!!!!!!! Just wait till your baby gets there. You are probably a first time mom. Don't worry, go to the emergency room anytime you have doubts. I have four children and believe me they are all different. Everything is fine for now, unless you have to pay out of your pocket then, try not to head the emergency room right away, until the doctor lets you know. Good luck. Enjoy your beautiful baby they grow up so fast.|`|l1kO1Y67aa	Well about your back problem and not being able to sleep... it is safe to take tylenol pm, just don't over do it. The discharge is normal throughout your pregnancy and I was told there will be more towards the end. At your stage the baby is usually right side up, and will slowly start turning down, head first. I am having a boy too :] your energy should be back soon... I had the same problem.
Xhgq35dNaa	Just tell him what you said here...It is very important to you that he takes a serious role in this pregnancy.  He doesn't have to go to every appt., but maybe the significant ones he can make it a point to be there for (like the ultrasound).  Also, tell him whether he has done it before or not, it is important for you that he is there and supportive.  YOU haven't done it before, so you NEED him there.  If he stands his ground and still will not be supportive because "HE has done it all before" then you really ought to ask yourself if you really want to raise a child with someone that selfish.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my fiance did not go to all the appt with me and i never expected him too- he went to the U/S and was upset he missed the first one. but the firs appt was a pap smear and then it's all pee in a cup listen to heatr beat get out pretty much. he said he wasn't sure if he could be there for the birth and all this bull. it upset me a lot. guess what he was there more excited than i was and video taped it. some of the time didn't look and he didn't cut the cord because he got freaked out when they clamped it and blood squirted out so my step-mom cut it. you never know he may come along|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, you could talk to him about it and tell him it would be important to you if he came to your visits but if he is adamant about not going that might not change anything. Maybe you could compromise and just get him to come to some of the more significant visits like hearing the heartbeat the first time and getting the ultrasound.<br>  <br>  And he said he would go in with you while you were in labor but he just didn't want to see the birth? I think that's pretty common for men. I don't think my husband wants to actually see the baby coming out either, and I can't say I blame him. I don't even know that I want to see that...lol. <br>  <br>  Just express your feelings on the matter to him. He might not realize how important it is for you. Explain that you need his support and would appreciate it if he could come to at least some appointments. Good luck. :]|`|h5cFkP35aa	no you're not overreacting. you're just wanting what's due to you - compassion and interest in your pregnancy and childbirth. that's insensitive for him to think that just because he's been through this before that it's not as significant. he really needs to rethink his priorities.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	I don't think you should insist on him coming to each doctor's visit. It would be hard for him anyway, since he has a job. Employers don't mind guys taking time off for the ultrasound, but every doctor's appointment is asking a bit much. He doesn't have to look at the baby being born if he doesn't want to. I think it was stupid of him to tell you though, because you won't notice if he does or doesn't. This child will be no more or less special than his other child, it's just that guys don't really get into the swing of it until the bubs are actually born, or even later when they start smiling.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Make him aware that this is a whole new experience for you and for both of you as a couple. Even though he has been through this before make him realise that was a long time ago and things have defenetly changed in the last 13 years. Don't feel too bad that he isn't showing the excitment that you are, men deal with their emotions differently than us women. And about the birth, for now just accept that he will be in the room and discuss  watching the birth later down the track, don't freak him out with everything to early on, leave it alone for a while. Good luck.|`|5h8bYsKdaa	i'd talk to him. maybe he wont go to every appointment but maybe he will sometimes, like the special ones and the ultrasound. and if he ends up being there for the delivery, have him hold your hand atleast. tell him its a new baby and a new woman. and it hurts your feelings|`|CSyBGcLYaa	maybe he's just uncomfortable with the idea,some guys are just weird.but he'll come around ,good luck|`|UMoeNvr4aa	lot of guys do behave lake that don't be warred he will come around you will see|`|8iK5rmizaa	I think everything will be fine. You have to realize that you only found out a week ago. He is still getting a grasp on the fact that a new baby is on the way. I think once you are further along in your pregnancy that he will come around more. Also sometimes its not realistic for him to come to all the doctors appointments and at most of them, you just come in and they measure you and check the heartbeat, nothing to exciting. I would push more for him to go to the ultrasounds and important appointments. Keep your head up! He will come around! Just give him a little bit to adjust. Even if you planned for this baby, men take a little more time then women....|`|zRQmWC5saa	tell him  the way u feel. let him know u want it to be special. But I dont see him going eveytime. or even watching labor. thats embarresing enough for the woman, a man dont want to be embarresed and get sick thinking about that each time he climbs on u. dont mess his head up! lol . even tho my hubby didn't wanna watch, I told him he couldn't even if he wanted but I think he did sometimes take a peek b/c he was in the room with 3 of my births. I have 4 kids.
a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	I would think that by 32 weeks a woman would be showing if she is pregnant. Heck, my tummy has already blown up a bit at 10 weeks, lol, and I was super skinny pre-pregnancy. Is your friend on the taller side? If so, she may have a longer torso which can cause a pregnant woman to look smaller than she is for her stage of pregnancy. However, long torso or not she should definitely be showing by now, even if it is just a small bump. Have you noticed her gaining weight? Does she tend to wear baggy clothes?|`|K2dNndE2aa	you deliver around 40 weeks so you would definitely be able to tell somewhat. sometimes they hardly show but you should at least see something. my moms friend was 80 obs at the beginning of her pregnancy and she gained 30 through the whole thing...her stomach was the exact size of a basketball-her son measured it lol.. so you could definitely tell.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	The only ppl i can't tell that are preg are highly over weight ppl.

This woman had a very LONG torso and at around 32 weeks she had the tinyest baby bumb.  The baby went to term but was just a small baby.  Sometimes, if the skinny girl has a lot of room inside her body, it will take longer to show. BUT, she would be showing enough that you would be able to tell.|`|044WNiRtaa	At 32 weeks you'd expect someone to be showing, even slightly.  Does she wear loose fitting clothes? Is she naturally very skinny? <br>  <br>  I'm more concerned about why you think your friend would lie about this.  Often when women lie about pregnancy it's a sign of something much more serious.  Perhaps, instead of coming on here and trying to find out if a friend is lying, you should sit down and have a heart to heart with her.  It sounds like either way, she needs you right now.|`|36NBK4aaaa	there are those supposed miracle women you see on the news that never knew they were pregnant till they showed up at the hospital. but by 32weeks the average women should definitely have a belly typical pregnancy last from 32 to 40 weeks.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	At 32 weeks she should be showing. That's 8 weeks til her due date!|`|E7tpMkdDaa	Don't be a wimp. Go in there yourself and check, Navy SEAL style.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	With my sister's first baby, she didn't show at all.

Yeah, I think it's possible.|`|aPscVrOoaa	Some women carry small, but I would think by 32 weeks she should be showing, even if she's skinny.

It's definitely NOT normal.<br>  Parents get angry at times, but what you described sounds more like emotional abuse than anything else.|`|XOtOMncwaa	No it's not normal. I would never tell my son I regret having him, and I would never replace his name with a cuss word. People like that are the types of people who shouldn't have kids. Everyone gets frustrated from time to time. But intentionally telling your child you wish you never had them takes it to a totally different level.|`|k5X78IM3aa	It is NOT normal.  It is emotional & mental abuse.  The child needs help to protect him/her...& the parents need help.  This may be a case for Human Services or Social Services in your area.

As a wild guess I'd say 10% of parents act like this on occasion.  It's wrong, but I don't know if it qualifies as abuse or not in the eyes of the law.<br>  <br>  I base my 10% guess based on how I've seen parents behave with their children in public, and based on how I've seen coworkers behave over the years.  There are a lot of people out there who are under stress and have anger management issues, or are otherwise not in control of their emotions.  It's ugly, unfair, and wrong.<br>  <br>  If this is happening to you, I'm sorry.  You could try writing down exactly what was said, immediately after it happens, and then showing your account to a trusted adult.  (Friend's mom, teacher, school counselor, aunt, etc.)  The paper might make the person take your complaints more seriously.|`|AA12062031	first of all, confused i see why you pick that named. second, someone who takes their anger out on their child should not have one in the first place, and they should find another way to take out their anger. Its not weird, its abuse. the way you treat your child when it is little, it affects them when they get older.|`|K384yfClaa	you know what no one should every do that because it hurts there feelings they want you to love them and want them and if you can,t love them don't hurt them i sure they will be happy it you don't swear to them|`|AA11197832	NO...Thats selfish.

nrqWwQBXaa	it might be but it might be other reasons. maybe try talking to a councilor about how you feel?|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Probably, ya know my father was very very abusive, and he drank and did drugs heck he still does. I dont let my son out of my sight, no one watches him, only me and my mom and I trust and love my mom to death but I still call like every 15 mins to make sure he is ok and she didnt leave him somewhere lol. Sad but I dont even like my hubby to watch him, my hubby is so absent minded that it scares me that he will go to wal mart and leave him in the cart.  I of course grit my teeth and let my son go with him to the store but I freak out if they are gone longer then 30 mins, and I think it does have something to do with the fact that I was abused, and how my dad was with me makes me not trust anyone with my kid. Now days though I dont think people can be over protective about people being with their kids bc look at the news, most things that happen to children is from someone on their family, and oh my gosh I dont think I would ever forgive myself if something happend to my son bc I let him go somewhere with someone. I think as they get older it will get a little easier. I hope lol Good luck and I understand|`|sB5dyaczaa	It might be. Get some help sweetie. They can help you try to get over or worry less.

I would go (like the nurse) said and let them hydrate the baby. He can very well be dehydrated and show no other signs than what you just explained with the decreased feedings and few diapers.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Trust your gut.<br>  <br>  If you think your baby isn't dehydrated, or seriously unwell then stay home.  If your says your baby is lethargic or dehydrated or something else is wrong -go to the ER.<br>  <br>  Try spoon feeding some expressed milk to your baby if he won't nurse again in the next two hours.<br>  <br>  I was told if a baby doesn't pee in 6 hours to go to the ER but I can't remember if that was the first 6 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months *lol*<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081300...</a><br>  WHEN NOT TO WORRY<br>  <br>  SIGNS OF ADEQUATE HYDRATION – if your child has most or all of the following signs, then you can be reasonably sure he is not significantly dehydrated:<br>  <br>      * Moist, shiny mouth from saliva, pools of saliva under tongue or lips<br>      * Moisture present in eyes, tears dripping out when crying<br>      * Urinating at least every 4 hours<br>      * Active, playful, running around tearing up the toy room<br>  <br>  MILD DEHYDRATION – most children will become mildly dehydrated during the course of any illness simply due to the fact that they won't drink as much as usual. This is not dangerous. Common signs of mild dehydration include:<br>  <br>      * Less active than usual, but still alert and playful<br>      * Lips slightly dry<br>      * Urinating slightly less frequently<br>  <br>  WHEN TO BE CONCERNED<br>  <br>  MODERATE DEHYDRATION – many children will progress to this stage during a gastrointestinal illness.

Some of the babies who might benefit include:<br>  <br>      * a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeed<br>      * a previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed again<br>      * a baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)<br>      * a baby with nipple confusion<br>      * a baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)<br>      * a baby on a nursing strike<br>  <br>  Even if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect "two steps forward and one step backward."<br>  <br>  If you're getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesn't Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nursingstrike.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeed-essentials.com/nur...</a><br>  Nursing strikes occur most often in babies older than 3 months of age. Typically the baby has been nursing well and then suddenly will refuse to nurse for no apparent reason. Many mothers wonder if their babies may be self-weaning, but natural, baby-led weaning is rare during the first year and is more gradual than sudden. During a strike a baby is also many times obviously unhappy about the situation. When he is naturally weaning himself, however, he is most likely not distressed with the change.<br>  <br>  A nursing strike usually lasts just a few days but may persist for a week or two. Even though a lot of mothers do choose to wean during a strike, most babies can be coaxed back to the breast with some patience and determination. It may take some detective work to find the cause. All of the following are known to occasionally result in a strike: teething, illness, sores in the baby's mouth, a change in the taste of the milk, apprehension as a result of the mother's reaction to being bitten, prolonged separation between mother and baby, the frequent use of bottles or the pacifier, low milk supply, etc. Some lactation experts believe that a nursing strike can many times precede the baby's mastery of a developmental skill such as crawling, standing, or walking. And sometimes the cause is never known.<br>  <br>  Following are some suggestions that you may find helpful in persuading your reluctant nurser back to the breast:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/NB/NBNovDec92p173.ht...</a><br>  A nursing strike is a baby's way of communicating that something is wrong, and most babies who go "on strike" are obviously unhappy about it. Some nursing strikes come on suddenly, others more gradually. But a nursing strike does not have to mean the end of breastfeeding. If a mother encourages her baby to return to breastfeeding, a nursing strike usually lasts between two and four days, although some last longer. With lots of patience and persistence it is almost always possible to convince the baby to go back to nursing so that both mother and baby can continue to enjoy its benefits.<br>  Possible Causes of a Nursing Strike<br>  <br>  Sometimes the cause of a nursing strike is obvious, but other times the mother may never discover the reason. Some common causes for a baby to refuse to nurse include:<br>  <br>      * mouth pain from teething, an injury, a cold sore, or a fungus infection, such as thrush,<br>      * an ear infection, which may cause pressure or pain while nursing,<br>      * pain while being held in the nursing position, perhaps due to an immunization or an injury,<br>      * a cold or stuffy nose that makes breathing difficult while nursing,<br>      * too many bottles, overuse of a pacifier, or frequent thumbsucking, which >may lead to a reduced milk supply,<br>      * regular distractions and interruptions while nursing,<br>      * an unusually long separation from mother. <br>  <br>  There may be situations or actions on the mother's part that contribute to a baby's refusal to nurse:<br>  <br>      * a strong reaction to a baby's bite,<br>      * a major change in routine, such as moving or traveling,<br>      * limiting and/or rigidly scheduling feedings,<br>      * talking in a loud voice or arguing with other family members while nursing,<br>      * overstimulation, stress, or tension from an overly full schedule or an upset in the home,<br>      * repeatedly putting off the baby when she wants to nurse or letting her cry. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/strike.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/strike.html</a><br>  My Baby Is Suddenly Refusing to Nurse. Does That Mean It's Time to Wean?<br>  <br>  A baby who is truly ready to wean will almost always do so gradually, over a period of weeks or months. If your baby or toddler has been breastfeeding well and suddenly refuses to nurse, it is probably what is called a "nursing strike" rather than a signal that it's time to wean. Nursing strikes can be frightening and upsett|`|9NXtWzUOaa	ok...this is totally of the wall, but i read somewhere that if your baby refuses the breast, the breast has cancer. i will see if i can find a link.<br>  please, get a mamogram.<br>  charisma, i did read this in a news article. this is no lie.

Be comforting and nurtuing.|`|7yJ3MHoIaa	play classical music|`|8yTP3jO8aa	What happens if you don't put him in situations where he has to scream to communicate his wants and needs?  Can you acknowledge his pointing and non verbal communication and give him what he needs with out ignoring it until he starts screaming?  Then when you help him get what he needs you talk him through it.  "Oh, you're pointing at the fridge. Do you want a snack or something to drink?  Let's see.  Do you want water?  Cheese?"<br>  <br>  You encourage him to talk by being attentive to his needs and showing him that he can get what he needs with out screaming.  Then you can be patient and wait for him to use his words.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would just tell him ok we need to use our inside voices, if you are going to scream I cant understand what you want or need to until we can use our inside voice then I will be able to understand you|`|dLLDwZaraa	My daughter does this quite often.  (i.e. Walk into the kitchen with her arms reaching toward the counter or cupboard and scream bloody murder because she wants a snack or something to drink....)  She is 18 months, says quite a few words, and repeats EVERYTHING she hears.  So, I kneel down to her level and tell her screaming is not going to get her what she wants and that she needs to ask (she is still quite young, but we go through this several times a day, and she is catching on fairly quickly)  Ill tell her to say "Cracker, please" or "Water, please"  And she does. If she screams she doesnt get it, if she asks politely, she does.....|`|JIxAVONXaa	he don't have a voice yet and so this is how he is getting your attention as well as, honestly, getting ready for language development. When he screams and points for something ask him " do you want the ball?" while holding the ball. if he nods his head say "here is the ball"  say it slowly and so that he can see your mouth. exposure to language and proper pronunciation is key.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	IF he's learning 2 languages, it will not take him longer!  With my 6 yo I only spoke German, he only heard english from his dad.  He spoke in both languages around 2 1/2.  Kids this young are sponges.  They can deal better than adults.<br>  <br>  With my 15 month old I also only speak German and she doesn't scream either.  She'll point or have a few sounds (words) for things.  Some kids take awhile.  Don't pressure him!  There'll probably be a moment once he is talking where you'll think 'I could've waited.'|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	How quickly do you respond to his requests? Could it be that you are missing any quieter communication techniques?
21xLj5Zkaa	There is no statistics.<br>  <br>  But it all depends on the two people having intercourse:<br>  1) Did the guy use a condom? Even if he used it, it can break...<br>  2) If the girl on birth-control pills? Not 100% effective...<br>  3) Also there something about the women's menstrual (sp?) cycle and all that but I'm not sure if that is a true fact.<br>  <br>  The best way is just use protection or avoid intercourse if the girl is afraid of getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  However, if the girl is trying to get pregnant on the first time, it is not always a sure thing even with protection...<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped.|`|EbAMtQsHaa	how about if you dont have sex you wont have to worry about it and i dont know but there is always a chance you could get pregnant even the first time if sperm goes in your woohoo then you can preggers there is no charts saying how many get pregnant there first time and alot of girls do|`|AA11197832	To often.|`|knyjNiy0aa	Idk the statistics, but it happened to me.

tMeN2fm0aa	She cant take a pregnancy test for awhile.  Especially since she just had sex like 5 days ago.  Relax and chill out.  Im sure that the blood, and spotting and discharge is from the morning after pill.  I have read alot of questions where people say they took this and then had these things happen to them, so I am thinking that its normal.  Did she research the pill before she took it?  Looked at the symptoms?  Look them up online.  Either way, if she had sex on Saturday, its too early for a test and she wouldnt be pregnant right now anyways... just too soon.  Good Luck with everything!! Id wait about 3 weeks then take a test.  Next month when she is supposed to start her period, if she is late or feeling not normal, then take the test, or better yet, go to a Dr and get a blood test done.  Those can be done earlier actually (8 days after conception) and most offices dont require you to have an appt.  Just go in, get your blood drawn and thats it!  call the Dr office and see what their policy is on the test... their times, and if she actually has to be seen... Again more than likely she will not have to be.  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|765eZqh7aa	Her spotting sounds similar to implantation bleeding, but if she took the pill she should be fine, go to the doctor to be sure. THe best time to take a pregnacy test is after she knows for a fact that she missed her cycle|`|aDJSizwqaa	if she took the morning after pill, she should be fine and that is probably what is causing the spotting. she needs to wait til she misses her period before taking a test though.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	Its too early for a pregnancy test and if she took a pan b pill it could make her period start early to get rid of any chance of being pregnant.|`|nEVaIaOzaa	she is probably fine since she took the morning after pill.  which like the other person said is probably causing the spotting.  If her period is in a week anyway it is not likely she was ovulating which is the only time in her cycle she can get pregnant.  I would wait a week and if she doesn't have her period than she should take a HPT.|`|aBWu7tyHaa	I just answered another question like this one.  Don't they teach kids where babies come from anymore?  A girl can get pregnant ANY TIME even on birth control and even with a condom.  Some people think if the girl was on top that somehow gravity makes it so she can't get pregnant and that is NOT TRUE!!!  Teens need to stop having sex, what's the big deal?  you have your whole life to have sex, why do they have to do it so young?  If she's THAT worried about it, she shouldn't have had sex to begin with.  A home pregnancy test will not show a positive result until AFTER the missed period.  It takes a while for the pregnancy hormone to show up in urine.  Hope this is a lesson to be learned|`|ki5hZbcTaa	if she took the plan b pill properly she might not be.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Why can't she ask herself? Plan B messes up a woman's cycle. She shouldn't be surprised by the spotting. All she can do is hope the Plan B works; she won't be able to take a test for at least 3 weeks. Tell her good luck x

Plus if you worry about it so much now it won't do you any good!<br>  <br>  Just do the waiting game for right now.. ;)|`|aBWu7tyHaa	stop having sex if you don't want a baby.  you can get pregnant on birth control, using condoms, and everyone ovulates at different times of the month, so it doesn't matter if you have regular periods or irregular ones, it just depends on when your body releases the egg and if it gets fertilized or not.  this is the third yes THIRD TEEN pregnancy question i've answered in a matter of FIVE minutes.  STOP HAVING SEX TEENS.  let this be a lesson to you|`|UMoeNvr4aa	its too suing to tall|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	it would be too early to tell|`|XcE3uRAUaa	im having the same problem..... and i cant wait i just really wanna knoooo.im impatient|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Here's how it works. Sperm can live in the vagina for up to 3 days. So it can take up to 3 days to fertilize the egg. After the egg is fertilized it goes through the implantation process, which can take up to 10 days. So its more than likely too early for you to experience any implantation bleeding as that occurs about 10-14 days after unprotected sex, but it could happen this early if your ovulating.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Why does everyone think spotting automatically means pregnancy? You wouldn't be experiencing implantation bleeding 2 days after the sex. If you believe you could have had unprotected sex more than a week ago you MIGHT be pregnant. You really oughtn't worry til you have to; did you use protection?
HclKftzAaa	The most common mistake made when measuring a pregnancy in months is that people forget there is more than 4 weeks in a month.<br>  <br>  So, they will try to tell you that 20 weeks = 5months. However, we all know that pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks or 9 months. there fore, you couldn't possibly be more than 4.5 months at 20 weeks.<br>  <br>  40 weeks= 7x 40 = 280 days.<br>  280 days / 9 months = 31.1 days.<br>  <br>  There are 31.1 days in a pregnancy month.<br>  <br>  18 weeks = 18 x 7 = 126 days.<br>  126 / 31.1= 4.05 months. 4 months and 2 days.<br>  <br>  A LUNAR month has 4 weeks in it, but a CALENDAR month has 31 days in it. If we were going by lunar months, then yes, you'd be pregnant for 10 months, and at the moment you'd be 4.5 months.<br>  <br>  But obviously we don't use lunar months, because pregnancy is agreed as lasting for 9 months.<br>  <br>  You are currently IN your 5th month, but you are NOT YET 5 months.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	your 4.5 months. but "technically" you are in your fifth month. From the date of conception you have been pregnant for 4 full months, therefore you are in your fifth month. <br>  <br>  trying to explain it online is kinda difficult!!! lol. hope you get it. took me awhile!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	Your baby is approximately 6 inches/ 14.2 centimetres long from crown to rump and she weighs about 7 ounces/ 190 grams. Her chest moves up and down to mimic breathing but she's not taking in air, only amniotic fluid. A mid-pregnancy ultrasound scan is often done sometime in the second trimester (usually between 18 and 22 weeks) to assess fetal growth and development, screen for certain birth defects, check the placenta and umbilical cord and determine whether the gestational age is accurate. During this scan, you might see your baby kick, flex, reach, roll, or even suck her thumb. Bring your partner along, and whether or not he's able to accompany you, make sure you ask for printouts of the baby in various poses.<br>  <br>  If you're having a girl, the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes are in place. If it's a boy, the genitals are distinct and recognizable. If you are carrying more than one baby, check out our section on twins or more.|`|KQU5y20waa	below is a website that may help you....|`|DTg3USppaa	I'm 4 1/2 months pregnant and putting it into wks it would be 18.

mqHL4UcRaa	You wouldnt feel the baby this early. It takes months (4+ months) to feel the baby. Your belly wouldnt even have gotten bigger if you were pregnant. The uterus wouldnt expand above your pelvic bone until you are 3+ months, then 4-5 months to even show. You can gain a simple pound or two if you havent passed a bowl movement in the past day or so. Your body may also be retaining more water. <br>  <br>  Just know the pullout method is not an effective form of birth control. In a single drop of precum are millions/billions of sperm and it only takes ONE to get you pregnant. It's more potent than the final outcome.|`|vygYFdsSaa	The fluttering you are feeling is gas. Its much too soon to feel any baby movements. Perhaps you're having intestinal difficulties and you are bloated, which is why your friend's saying you look bigger? Just an idea. Many women have a false positive in their first tests. Since you and your husband use a method that is not in fact a reliable method of birth control, you should go get a blood test done. By the way, a "flutter" in the back of your head is absolutely unrelated to pregnancy.|`|CFFuFof1aa	You wouldn't feel fluttering just yet, and you could look bigger from being bloated from where your periods have been off.. If you had a negative test, I would wait a few days and take another one. Make sure you take it in the morning, your morning pee will have the highest HCG levels. I doubt you are pregnant, but you could be. But you haven't missed a period at all, you just seem like you are having irregular periods.|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Go to the Dr and see whats going on with you.

It's sad but it happens all the time, now that tests are cheap and available in the drugstore. If you get another positive home test, then it's time to make your first prenatal appointment for 6 weeks, and they'll do all the preliminary tests. I didn't feel pregnant for a while ... I still don't really -- just being tired a lot, that kind of thing.|`|2yusiREnaa	Go to the doctor if your having a period!?<br>  And yes im 6 weeks and i only have a few symptoms|`|sf9LLe37aa	Go to the doctor hunny, somethings not right.|`|IVNM1O5naa	Go to the doctor and have a blood test to confirm your pregnancy. You could be experiencing some "implantation bleeding," or early miscarriage. <br>  <br>  As for symptoms, some women never even have them. BUT, you are only 3 weeks pregnant and the pregnancy symptoms wont kick in until you are about 6 to 8 weeks pregnant.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	You don't normally have symptoms that early but you shouldn't be getting your period still. Are you sure your pregnant? You should go to the doctor.|`|436fREgIaa	no.not normal to bleed.maybe you had a missed miscarraige,or you RECENTLY got pregnant.you usually have no symptoms at 3 weeks.they usually start at 4 + weeks,and some woman get no symptoms.i would go to an ob/gyn for an accurate result,as well as an ultrasound around 7 weeks,if not sooner.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	You are most likely more than 3 weeks pregnant.  You would not get a positive result on a test that early.  A lot of times symptoms don't start until around 6 weeks.|`|ncUhlwevaa	Wow. You won't have many symptoms at 3 weeks.|`|WnlzScIyaa	You need to test again if you are having your period, something is not right. maybe false positive.
fBBJlXBCaa	oh, most of us ask how many dpo because we assume that since you are ttc.. you are keeping track of your exact ovulation day.. like some ppl use the opk which tells them exactly when they will ovulate.. (not a time frame but an hour frame of 12-24 hrs, so thats pretty accurate in keeping track of ovulation).. some of us (me too) use bbt method and we know the exact day we ovulated because of a temperature dip.. so thats how we know to count how many days past ovulation we are and when we can test for pregnancy accuracy. =] you have sore boobs.. thats a good sign. maybe you wont have to track ovulation next month if this is it!! good luck! and baby dust!!! baby dust to me too please!! im waiting to test in 4 days!!!|`|gbAHjNrAaa	The first thing you should do is start tracking your cycle by using www.mycycles.com, www.fertilityfriend.com or some other similar website.  You start tracking the first day of your next period and you enter different variables such as whether or not you're menstruating, the consistency of your cervical mucus, the position of your cervix, types of medication you're on, any side effects you've been having, etc.  Also, if you chart your basal body temperature you can actually see your temperature rise right after ovulation!  It's a great tool and I highly recommend it.|`|mvgszvXoaa	They say on average (but everyone is different) you ovulate 14 days before your period begins so you ovulate on day 17 of your cycle (according to the average).  I can tell you I tried OPK's this month on my "most fertile" days & never got a positive so you really never know when you ovulate.  If your period starts May 14th then you ovulated around May 1st...I would go w/ that date.  You would be 7dpo today.

In regards to how far you are at 22 weeks really depends on how you look at it. Some people count every 4 weeks as a month with pregnancy seeming like a 10 month period. The math: A week has 7 days. Seven days time 22 weeks = 154 days. Ave month is 30 days. 154 divided by 30 = 5.133. Essentially it's just over 5 months. This is usually about the time you feel the baby moving and may be able to find out if it's a boy or girl. Congrats! They are amazing!|`|7c896f1c7729751980e04e5a281ce52daa	5months and 2 weeks|`|accc11d6ae85f16d16878bd70a8a9573aa	22 weeks is 4 1/2 months. Your third trimester starts at 28 weeks.

Congrats, I'm almost 24 weeks.|`|aeedc84efb4460e041e27c19d838ed69aa	But what they call 22 weeks is usually 20 weeks gestational age, since they start counting at the first day of your last period and you got pregnant about 2 weeks after that (most likely).  But yeah, you're five months pregnant (or in the sixth month).  And I've read third trimester starts at 26 weeks.
07514747b3b60863ab12a7a36f0f2d1aaa	L'italia ed il popolo italiano in genere sono il massimo della falsa morale. Non mi risulta che non sia piu' fattibile se regolarmente coniugati ma potrebbe anche essere... so che in Spagna e' possibile. Qua da noi funziona al contrario, poi ai vertici tutti fanno i loro interessi..sappi che per ogni bambino "adottabile" lo stato riconosce un tot di mantenimento all'istituto...hai capito perche' e' così difficile adottare un bambino italiano??? E poi x quelli che gettano nei cassonetti gli aspiranti genitori devono superare quasi un elettrocenfalogramma alla psiche!!! Pero' 3 casi su 5 di abusi a minori avvengono in famiglia e tutti stanno zitti e buoni....che schifo!!! Non ascoltare i finti moralisti od i predicatori del cavolo, guarda avanti e raggiungi il tuo scopo, a costo di trovare all'estero tramite un'inserzione un donatore di seme!!! Capirai che con il denaro, purtroppo, tanti moralismi e "per il bene dei bambini" vengono molto meno. Anche in Italia sai e ' così, parlo per fonte diretta, solo che ci sono piu' vincoli burocratici, ma se avessi tanto denaro potresti adottare per esempio un bimbo italiano anche nel giro di qualche mese...chissa' come mai eh? Fregatene dei finti benpensanti e fai un figlio se lo desideri.

j8T5EB85aa	La regla para el método anticonceptivo natural, se basa en los 14 días que tarda en degenrar el óvulo producido y el acondicionamiento interno femenino para el caso de un embarazo, por lo que muchas mujeres (y hombres también) creen que no deben tenerse relaciones el día 14 así como 5 días antes y 5 después de éste, sin embargo aunque esto es mitad cierto, hay que empezar a contar al revés, lo que signiifca de fin a principio y al día que resulte es al que hay que restarle y sumarle los mencionados 5 días (5 días porque el espermatozoide sólo dura vivo 72 hrs., así que por prevención lo dejamos en 5 para no errar). Ahora bien, si tu periodo es regular y de 28 días, y tomamos como referencia que tuviste relaciones durante una semana (osea 8 días) estaríamos hablando de que ese día entra en el periodo de no riesgo ya que... 28 menos 14 igual a 14 menos 5 días de margen es igual a 9, osea que estás en el límite. Si tu periodo es de 32 días (otro de los más comunes) entonces 32 menos 14 es igual a 18 menos 5 diás de margen igual a 13, por lo que el ultimo día de tus relaciones tampoco entra en el periodo de riesgo, el problema es si tu periodo dura menos de 28 días, lo que si daría posibilidades de un embarazo, lo que puedes más o menos calcular por el número de días de sangrado que para un periodo de 28 días es aproximadamente de 4 a 5, sin embargo hay dos cosas que tienes que tomar en cuenta, la primera es no sugestionarte para no retrazar tu próximo periodo por cuestiones de stress o nervios y la segunda es que no todo es tan exacto como quisieramos y hasta las mejores teorías han fallado, asi que procura usar algún otro método anticonceptivo la próxima vez, aunque no creo que tengas problemas por tu situación, si es en verdad como la planteas.

tuyM5k0zaa	Well congrats, when are you due? I'm pregnant myself with a little girl, Olivia Taylor, and am due in September. My youngest has become very attached to "HIS" baby. Is your son excited?   We're hoping we'll actually get a girl this time. I was told my last two pregnancies  would be girls...<br>   I also have three boys: Nicky who is 9, Steven who is 7 and Connor who is 3. My oldest looks like me: brown hair and hazel eyes. My middle one is the spinning image of my husband with dirty blond hair and green eyes. My youngest is the "combo" child with very light brown hair and grey eyes. They all love to play sports, go to the beach and run about.  They all have a great sense of humor and sometimes say the jaw dropping things at the wrong time. They love to give kisses and hugs and doing "manly" things with their dad.  <br>  Best wishes! =]|`|00c913fa0e57c83761ac57adef686b1daa	no kids yet ...... my husband and i are trying for one though..... hopefully i will have one soon to brag about but for now i can only brag about my dog shelby lol shes just too smart|`|7PNbjit0aa	Congratulations on your (soon to be here) little girl!

Loves everyone and is very curious, he goes to nursery school for four hours three mornings at a time. We don't have neighbors for him to play with we're pretty remote, he has cousins but they are quite a bit older. Nicky loves museums, we live close to Washington and the museums are his thing especially the dinosaurs and the aeronautics, he giggles and spins around under the Spirit of St.Louis, it hangs from the ceiling and he just loves that. It helps that daddy is in the Air Force and planes are like air in our house. What about yours?|`|FmD8cspFaa	none yet.<br>   I want between 3-5.|`|X33U2ftNaa	I have three beautiful children. My daughter Samantha is 17, my son Jake is 5 and my daughter Ava is 4.<br>  Sam is very open minded but stands her ground. She is a daddy's girl despite the fact that she fights with him quite often. She's a great listener and is always willing to help some one out. Just like her father, she is a football fanatic and loves to watch it. She's caring, responsible, creative and a fantastic older sister.<br>  Jake is very curious and active. He loves football and is very into the airforce and the marines, like his father. You could hold up a picture of any airplane and he could tell you what it was along with all kinds of information. He's a mama's boy and loves to cuddle with me on the couch and read books.<br>  Ava is my girlie girl. She loves fashion, dolls and babies! She dreams of the day I will give her a baby sister, but that day is never going to happen. I'm done :).  We think she's a 25yrs woman trapped in a 4yrs body. She's very mature for her age, likes to being around adults and loves to have conversations. She is a talker and can speak with you about anything for hours. <br>  Congrats on the baby girl and good luck! 8)|`|fjJX2ipTaa	I'm a mother of 5 girlies: Jackie, Erin, Sam, Justine & Taylor who are 21, 18, 17, 15 and 12. My older four are browned haired and my youngest is a strawberry blonde. They all have the greenest eyes even though I have blue, their father has brown and no one in the family has green. <br>  I always wanted a big family. My husband on the other hand wanted one child, a boy. Well THAT never happened and after the first two, I was fine with just having girls, but my husband insisted we keep trying for a boy. We'd have a girl, he'd kiss me and then say "next time, we'll have a boy." On Jan 27, 1995, I gave birth to our 5th daughter, he said his line and i said "If you want a son, you're having him yourself. I'm done." <br>  When the girls were little, they drove me crazy. Between the fighting, crying and overall just being little girls, they'd make me what to pull my hair out. As they got older, they matured, became friends and stopped being such a handful. I love having them at the ages they are now. They all get along wonderfully and are growing up to be smart, fun loving, firm young women. <br>  Jackie will graduate next year from college and is planning on being a teacher. Erin just graduated high school and will be attending UCLA in the fall. Sam will be a senior in high school, Justine a sophomore and Taylor will be in the 7th grade.<br>  Best wishes with your children and congrats on the baby. They grow up quickly and little girls are truly a gift.|`|oBP2IF8Daa	I'm a mother of twins, Brynn and Jade, who are 17yrs old. They are the best of friends and were little trouble makers as kids, constantly getting into messes and wandering away. They'll be seniors and high school in September. <br>  Brynn is brown haired with green eyes and tall. She loves working with kids and is a real natural. She's constantly babysitting and works at a pre-school. She plays varsity soccer.<br>  Jade is brown haired with brown eyes and is a shorty. She loves working with horses and has several barn jobs. She is works hard in school and is very smart, but I must admit has very little common sense :). <br>  They both have a great sense of humor and a good out look on life. They have warm hearts and never take things for granted. They're always willing to listen and try to solve any problem you may encounter.<br>  Congrats on the baby girl and I wish you the best of luck with your family!|`|DYcqtio4aa	a daughter|`|INmPiwnMaa	I have 4 one who is 12 and a step daughter who is 11 another one of mine who is 8 and last a 2 year old boy.

C'est inadmissible de l'avoir arrachee de tes bras...<br>  <br>  Non seulement elle a du avoir peur de l'inconnu de l'operation mais en plus ils ont rajoute la peur de perdre sa maman et de ne plus la revoir. Entre nous ce n'est pas ters fin. <br>  <br>  Enfin vu que maintenant tu en es la, si j'etais toi, je la laisserais dormir avec vous pendant quelques temps, elle a eu un choc et il faut lui laisser le temps de se remettre. PAr contre il faut continuer a la rassurer tout le temps...tu vois maman est la, papa aussi, tout va bien et on en te laissera jamais. Maman t'attendait dehors mais elle ne t'a pas laissee et jamais elle ne te laissera. C'est comme quand tu vas a l'ecole, maman s'en va parcequ'elle n'a pas le droit de rester avec toi, c'est un endroit pour les enfants et la c'etait seulement un endroit pour les docteurs, ils devaient te soigner pour que tu n'aies pas mal et puis maman attendait derriere la porte. Maintenant tu es a la maison et personne en viendra te prendre a ta maman et a ton papa. Alors tu restes dormir avec nous un peu pour que tu voies bien que tout est comme avant et puis tu retourneras dans ton lit comme une grande quand tu seras rassuree.<br>  <br>  Le temps seulement la rassurera. Moi j'ai eu une experience similaire alors que j'etais en voyage et on a refuse d'emmener mon enfant me voir alors que j'etais en train de parlementer dans le bureau du patron de l'hotel qui ne voulait pas nous laisser partir de notre hotel nous accusant de ne pas avoir apye, ce qui etait faux. J'etais avec lui dans son bureau et mon fils avec sa mamie et quand il a demande a me voir on lui a dit non. Il a eu une peur bleue et il a fait une crise de nerf. En gros c'est comme si on m'avait sequestree..en quelque sorte!! Et il m'a fallu une semaine ou deux a ce que tout redevienne comme avant mais il en a toujours bien des mois apres un souvenir cuisant...<br>  <br>  Bon courage et un gros bisou a ta minette.|`|68619284dbcaed171ce5d291deac0466aa	Il y a "L'h?pital des nounours" organisé par des étudiants en médecine en partenariat avec les écoles.

GWpkvaTPaa	Non dare retta a chi ti dice che gli assorbenti interni sono dannosi, basta usarli con giudizio. Io li uso perchè mi fanno sentire più pulita e mi trovo benissimo! Il più adatto per le ragazze della tua età è senza dubbio il formato Mini che si trova sia negli OB che nei Tampax. Ti faccio comunque alcune raccomandazioni:<br>  1) provali entrambi per decidere con cosa ti trovi meglio: gli OB sono più facili da mettere perchè non hanno l'applicatore, ma possono fare male quando li hai dentro perchè si aprono in larghezza. I Tampax richiedono dimestichezza con l'applicatore, ma si aprono in lunghezza e perciò si adattano meglio alla forma del corpo, senza contare che l'applicatore li rende più igienici. Io dopo averli provati entrambi ho favorito i Tampax.<br>  2) guarda l'ora quando lo metti perchè va tolto dopo max 4-6 ore.<br>  3) non usarli di notte.<br>  Inoltre: non è vero che tolgono la verginità, sono molto più sottili di un'attrezzatura maschile! E' solo una delle tante leggende urbane che girano su di loro. Non è nemmeno vero che sono tossici, se lo fossero sarebbero già usciti dal commercio da un pezzo. E non è vero nemmeno che danneggiano la cervice, io li uso da anni e la mia ginecologa mi ha trovata comunque in condizioni perfette.|`|85910d5da6875ba45ef2aa45980890abaa	Beh si certo, però usa quelli mini e con l'appliatore(tipo TAMPAX)<br>  <br>  (hai fatto questa domanda 3 volte!)|`|18048b3b667294040756c08b9e754e45aa	perchè no? non c'è mica un'eta per cominciare...|`|12IIvdtSaa	ma usa il pannolone che usano i vecchi.Contattami|`|e12c67db8c244ff5b5e6be751e314998aa	Si, se sei vergine utilizza i mini (i piú grandi non danneggiano l'imene, ma sono un pó piú scomodi all'inizio)|`|tX2OdFaFaa	certo che lo puoi usare!!<br>  usa quelli mini!!<br>  baci da stella ciao|`|9l6fPWZgaa	Certo che puoi,non c'e un' eta' precisa in cui cominciare,gli assorbenti interni possono essere usati sin dalla prima mestruazione anche se all' inizio ti consiglio di usare i mini.|`|H3Pg3gahaa	se sei vergine te lo sconsiglio e se non lo sei te lo sconsiglio ugualmente ho letto un articolo riguarda quel tipo di assorbenti e diceva che causava danni enormi perfino cancro. usa quelli esterni sono affidabili al massimo e Più comodi secondo me. personalmente uso quelli interni solo quando vado al mare e con qualche timore a dirtela tutta . ciao ciao|`|ZApvEmZNaa	ma certo!!!!!! non ce nessun problema...puoi usare anche quello super plus....che nn fa niente.. è troppo piccolo per fare male...........|`|x7w729Jhaa	riguardo a quello che ha detto santa n l'assorbente esterno oltre ad'essere scomodo è anche poco sicuro... io ho 14 anni è ho iniziato a usare l'assorbente interno per uno spiacevole incidente a scuola... comunque l'assorbente interno è sicuro (ovviamente devi utilizzarlo con sotto un salva slip) è comodo e non lo senti se lo senti lo hai messo male.. comunque ti consiglio di cominciare coi mini poi gradualmente passare ai normali.. poi non credo che per una decina di anni avrai bisogno di passare ai super ciao!! buona fortuna!!!|`|xI8jLLCJaa	è ovvio ke gli puoi usare...<br>  io ci sono riuscita solo l'altro ieri a metermeli perche all'inizio mi favceva un po male..<br>  poi ho provato tante volte e alla fine ci sono riuscita...<br>  ciao 1 bacino

bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	I got pregnant right after a D&C. I had a mc after conceiving on clomid. I had the D&C and then ended up pregnant before I even had my first period. I have a beautiful little 3 yr old girl now. Most dr's will suggest you wait though so that your body has a chance to heal, Mine did but was not angry that I didn't.

The doctor literally scrapes the material off of the sides of the uterus. Doing this allows the fertilized egg to attach better at least until the build up gets thicker again.  Remember some stuff doesn't get flushed out with your period. But it did when you had a D&C. Good luck.|`|Lzz8yZvvaa	I had a d&c about 9 years ago.  The date was June 15.  I got my period about 2-3 weeks later.  Was preggers by the beginning of August.  I remember thinking that was easy as previously I was ttc for over a year.  So I guess my answer would be it does make you more fertile.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  .

But, I am not a professional.  I think you should ask around locally (at the Monitoring center or somewhere) to see if this is common in your area. I have had 2 kids and had to go weekly to Non Stress Monitoring with my son (he's 10 months old) but my doctor saw me weekly. I was also high risk because of diabetes and my age so he was right there with me until the end.  Honestly, I would be concerned about her reaction. The problem  is, what do you do now? It is really late in your pregnancy to see another doctor.  I really hate it for you that you are in this situation.  I really hope it works out for you.

You can get pregnant on birth control, the chances are low but its still possible. If you skipped or forgot to take a pill its alot more common to get pregnant. You should be able to find out if you are in about 5 more days for sure. Birth control can make you skip a period as well.

Y lo que te puedo decir es que pienses muy bien lo que vas a hacer. Por una parte abortar es algo posible, pero es lo peor que puede hacer una mujer. No puedes hacer caso a tus amigas o al padre del bebé, por que está dentro de tu vientre, en el interior de tu cuerpo y solo tu puedes tomar la decisión final. Pero piensa que puedes darle todo a esa criatura o no darle nada y negarle la posibilidad de vivir. Vivimos en un mundo muy egoista, solo  pensamos en nosotros mismo, y ni siquiera los más inocentes, que son los ni?os estan a salvo. <br>  Sin embargo comprendo tu angustia y tu deseperación. Comprendo que no lo quieras por que el cambio que daria tu vida hoy te aterra y ese miedo te "obliga" a no quererlo. Por una parte de aconsejo que te des tiempo a sentir y a comprender que llevas un hijo sangre de tu sangre dentro de ti, un peque?o ser que se modela, que se rodea de piel, que define sus organos, que con el tiempo siente, se mueve, crece. Y es hoy una parte de ti, y en unos meses será una personita independiente y tan tuya, que bastará mirarla para amarla para siempre. Esto que te digo te lo digo por una parte; para que si quieres puedas pensarlo.<br>  Por otra parte el aborto, aunque no te lo aconsejaria jamás, es una posibilidad que seguro tienes en mente. Si eres mayor de edad con tu autorización es suficiente y hoy dia cada vez existen técnicas mas seguras, y a nivel fisico es probable que te recuperes en poco tiempo. Si decides hacerlo, solo puedo decirte que el dolor no será fisico, sino emocional, y puede que no inmediato sino a posteriori,pero el tiempo no cura esas heridas.<br>  Puedes darlo en adoción, pero creo que sera′imposible si pasa 9 meses en tu vientre, y luego no puedes acunarlo en tus brazos, aunque es muy preferible al aborto.<br>  Solo tu (y no tus amigas o el padre de ese hijo) puede tomar la decisión.<br>  Animo.|`|912b3bc876d818f58dd207bee0ea25d9aa	Pues si no lo quieres, no lo quieres abortar no te quedan muchas opciones, tenerlo y darlo en adopción a una familia que si lo quiera.<br>  <br>  Mucha Suerte y que tomes la mejor decisión.|`|CPxVTYGTaa	No te aconsejo el aborto y menos si no deseas hacerlo, sería algo muy traumante y te sentirás culpable el resto de tu vida.<br>  En todo caso ténlo y luego bien puede pasar dos cosas, o encari?arte con él o darlo en adopción a una pareja que si lo quiera.<br>  Suerte y recuerda que una vida es un regalo de Dios|`|DMCDDLiUaa	sabes busca ayuda y dalo en adopcion es lo mejor,no pienses en un aborto....ok........quien quita que con los meses qu etengas cargando a tu bb descubras cuanto se puede amar a esa personita que no tiene la culpa de nada..........eso si no hagas caso y no lo abortes.|`|KgSpoO05aa	dale tiempo a que nasca y hay miras si no lo quieres pero tenlo por seguro que despues de que lo tengas en tus brazos no lo dejas ir un hijo es un regalo muy lindo y acepta las consecuencias y toma consiencia ese bebe no querria nada malo ni para ti ni para el piensalo bien despues te vasa enamorar no defallescas listo cuidate y piensa bien lo que vas a hacer depronto te arrepientes|`|LK3ShUH7aa	MI INTENCIóN NO ES DARTE UN SERMóN!!!<br>  <br>  LA VERDAD ES DIFíCIL PODER DECIRTE ALGO.<br>  NO TENGO IDEA CUANTOS A?OS TIENES, NI ME IMPORTA, POR QUE SEGURO QUE SON LOS NECESARIOS COMO PARA PODER AFRONTAR UNA SITUACIóN ASí.<br>  LO DEL ABORTO TE PIDO POR FAVOR QUE LO DESCARTES!!!!

First of all, the pads. For the first few months they were sooo uncomfortable to me but using a tampon hurt. Don't worry, after a while you wont even know they are there, expecially if you use wings. Secondly, the constant self concienceness. Numerous times throughout my days at school I felt as if I were going to 'leak' through my pad. I have realized that them things are pretty much absorbant to anything. I could wear mine a full day at school and an hour busride home and still be safe, not to mention im a heavy bleeder. Just by overnights :). And, as weird as this may be, I was always embarassed to change my pad in a public bathroom afraid that people could hear. The fact is, every woman goes through it or will at one time, and would laugh harder at you if they new you were trying to sneak the sound. Now to the important part, cramps. I have had the gods awfullest cramps throughout my intire life. Though they will never completley go away ther are many things you can do to reduce them. Don't drink caffine the week that you are on your period. For some reason it tends to make cramps worse. As does milk. Try replacements such as tea, juice or flavored water. Also be sure to shower regularly. As nasty as it may be to shower while on your period, it is even nastier if you do not. It will relax your mind and ease your cramps.

3ed2a9795378866bbf945647b8ff855eaa	Regarding pregnancy symptoms, there is no universal answer. Some women don't experience any noticeable symptoms until they're a couple of months pregnant. Some notice symptoms around the time of their missed period. And what symptoms you will or will not experience also varies, not just from woman to woman but from pregnancy to pregnancy. I usually experience heartburn even before I miss my period. On the other hand, even when pregnant with twins I never had so much as a day of breast/nipple tenderness. In other words, the answer is: no one can predict what it will be.<br>  <br>  As for how long to wait before testing: Pregnancy tests work by detecting hcg (human chorionic gonadotrophin), a hormone that your body does not start to produce until after the embryo has implanted into the uterine lining. Implantation typically occurs somewhere in the range of 6 to 10 days after conception, and, of course, when implantation first occurs the hcg levels would be too low to detect in any event. *If* you know when ovulation has occurred you *should* wait about two weeks to test. In theory. As a practical matter, if you use a sensitive test (e.g. First Response Early Results, or any "early results" test that says it can be used "as early as 5 days before your missed period") you can start testing earlier. If you get a positive result it means you're pregnant, but the downside of early testing is that a negative result is inconclusive -- it might mean you're not pregnant, and it might just as easily mean that it's too soon for you to test. You should also know that in a healthy, early pregnancy hcg levels typically double every 48-72 hours, so waiting just a couple of days before/between testing can mean a significant difference in hcg levels and can be the difference between a negative result and a positive one.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long response. Hope the information helps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|tPl1eG9maa	2 weeks after conception dear!|`|48tQ4gbHaa	I would wait a week, they have some pretty accurate test out now. Depending on how well you know your body I would say within a month you should start telling something is different. Like things you use to like to eat might not be as appealing, and that whole morning sickness thing is different for everyone. When I was pregnant I started getting sick the 2nd month and it was all day sickness...some people don't even get sick. Well, I wish you the best:-)|`|toO54eMjaa	the soonest you will have symptoms will be 2 weeks after conception - you would have a raised basal temp tho right from fertilization so if you have been charting your temp you would know earlier.  Otherwise you have to wait til your period day.  Some ladies dont have any symptoms and find out their pregnant cuz they miss their period.... good luck to you - the waiting is HORRIBLE, isn't it?!?!?!|`|vIQuXCMSaa	you have to wait till you could normally get ur period<br>  <br>  for example<br>  if you had sex on the 3rd and you normally get ur period on the 11th youd have to wait till atleast the 11th to get the test, but for better accuracy wait a couple days after<br>  <br>  <br>  have u tried ovulation sticks, they can come in handy and will tell you when you are ovulating to make the process easier.|`|yP0c6Pv5aa	Different women experience pregnancy differently so signs could be different.  One important sign to look for, however, is a missed period.  They have pregnancy tests that are accurate up to 5 days BEFORE your missed period.  Check the pregnancy test labels to see when they should be used.
ygVTtSNVaa	I wonder the same things! I was bleach blonde as a little girl but have light brown hair now that has a slight wave to it unless I straighten it.. My husband has dark brown hair. I have brown eyes he has blue eyes, we are both short.. We picture our little girl with blonde curly hair and blue eyes.. but unfortunatley brown is more dominant than blue eyes i hear.. We are hoping that since we are both pretty short that she won't be a jolly green giant lol. But our Ultrasound Tech said she had long legs.. So she'll probably come out taller than me!! haha. But honestly its so hard to say because sometimes recessive can outshine dominant and sometimes dominant is ALWAYS dominant.. Best of luck and congrats :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	the baby will have dark wavy hair. brown eyes. i dont think talents are hereditary because my dad is a doctor and my mom is a triathlete...i am FAR from both haha =]. there is a small chance he may have blue eyes or blonde hair, but i wouldnt bet on it..theyre both recessive to dark eyes and hair =]<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- unexpected trait lol -- my dad has straight black hair my mom has straight blonde hair...i have curly red hair..naturally =] lol|`|oW4xX5okaa	Ok here's my story:<br>  <br>  My mom is an Italian immigrant. She has medium/dark brown hair naturally and dark brown eyes. All of her family members are the same (dark hair & eyes, paleish skin with some olive tones) My dad is American (of Ukranian, French, and Irish decent). He is fair skinned, grew up blonde/light brunette, and light blue eyes. And his family members are pretty much the same.<br>  <br>  So I am 1/2 Italian and I tan about 100 times darker than all of the full bloods in my family (it's hilarious, they are all jealous). Normally my skin is olive with cool undertones. My hair is very dark brown naturally, looks black even. and I have light brown eyes with green on the edges (hazel I suppose). I inherited pin straight hair from both sides of the family, and thick hair from my mom's side.<br>  <br>  SO back to your son lol:<br>  I predict he will have wavy hair when he's older, probably a curly baby lol. Medium brown hair at birth, and as he gets older his hair should get a bit darker. Brown eyes yes, but the shade could be different than yours and your husband's. He will be a tall kid, probably reaching at or above 6 ft. as an adult. (since the boys tend to take after their fathers in this category, and vice versa for girls)<br>  <br>  Congrats on the new addition!!|`|d1d2e8f3c2203e89e2ab460c494b8dc0aa	You just never know!  I have brown eyes and my husband has hazel.  Both of our girls have bright blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Since your husband has black hair, your son probably will have dark hair when he grows up.... but he might have blond or red hair as a baby.  I'm sure he'll be tall, too, since dad is 6'1.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a gorgeous child you're having. I know one thing for certain... you'll look at him and think he is the most beautiful baby on Earth. Congratulations!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honestly the baby could come out any way.

Both of my kids have brown eyes and brown hair. They are tall like us as well. I am 5'11" and hubby is 6'2. My son is a singer/dancer like me and my daughter is the musician like her daddy. Both are athletic..like us too. <br>  <br>  My friend has 7 kids. She has dark brown eyes, dark brown curly hair and freckles. Her hubby is dirty blond and brown eyes. Her first son has brown eyes, dirty blond hair. 2nd son has blond hair, blue eyes. Next one looks just like mom, dark and dark with freckles. Her daughter has white blond hair and blue eyes. Next two daughters have brown curly hair, the only ones in the family, they also have brown eyes too. Her last child has brown eyes and blond hair like his dad.<br>  <br>  I figure if I keep having kids something should happen that is different..LOL My mother's whole family has blue eyes and so does my hubby's. I do doubt that we will get any redheads though. There are none on my side anywhere..there are blondes though! =)<br>  <br>  Depending on what is in your gene pools you may get a blue eyed blonde. I have seen it happen|`|nDEVWjCEaa	I think your baby will have dark hair and brown eyes. I don't think there is anyway that he will have blue eyes  seeing as you both have brown..he will be tall.probably about 6ft  <br>  I don't think that talents and interests are hereditary.. but it would be nice if he could do either... I can draw as well  and my son likes to draw but my daughter doesn't <br>  Or he will be totally opposite of that and play football or hockey...|`|0bZzlxx2aa	you can solve this with a punnet square<br>  <br>  take the gene for height...

It may be blonde when he's younger tho. <br>  <br>  About the eyes. Its really easy to figure out what color the babies eyes will be. First, you need to find your eye genes. Brown eyes (B) are dominant. Blue eyes (b) are recessive. <br>  <br>  Now, if you are brown eyed you will either be Bb or BB. So you and you husband are one of the two. To find out which one you are you need to know your parents eye colors. For example if your mom has brown eyes and your dad has blue eyes then you are Bb. If both of your parents are brown eyed youll have to look back a little further to your grandparents eye colors. <br>  <br>  Regardless, you and your husband are either Bb or BB. If you are both BB theres 100% chance your baby will be brown eyed.<br>  <br>  If your are BB and your husband is Bb then theres 100%  chance your baby will be brown eyed. Same chances if your husband is BB and your Bb. <br>  <br>  Now if you and your husband are both Bb. Then there's a 25% chance your baby may be blue eyed.<br>  <br>  Interests arent really considered hereditary. But Im sure that if you instill those values in your son then he will learn to love them.

L4VWOVjcaa	Surgical abortion - performed by a doctor in the clinic or a hospital. The doctor will perform a vaginal ultrasound to determine exactly how far along the woman is. They may or may not be sedated. The doctor will use a speculum (like they would use in a pap smear) to open the vagina, inject a numbing medication into the cervix, dilate your cervix, and use suction (either with a syringe-like handheld device or a vacuum machine) to remove the pregnancy. There are no knifes or sharp edges. Just a straw-like suction catheter with a rounded tip. The actual procedure usually lasts about 10 minutes or less. <br>  That whole thing about having to break the skull is completely false. At the stage of pregnancy that 99% of abortions are performed at, the pregnancy is easily suctioned out in a catheter roughly the size of a drinking straw. This is what a fetus looks like at the time that the vast majority of abortions are completed: <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/images/ency/fullsize/9641.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/...</a><br>  <br>  Obviously there is no need for skull-crushing. That's just a lie perpetuated by pro-lifers to scare women out of abortion. <br>  <br>  Medical abortion - may be performed entirely in a clinic or hospital, but some doctors allow part of the process to take place at home. The doctor will perform a vaginal ultrasound to determine how far along the woman is. They will be given the drug Mifiprex, usually taken in clinic, and the drug Misoprostol to either take orally or insert into the vagina, either in the clinic or at home. The drugs will cause a miscarriage, which involves passing the pregnancy vaginally through large clots and bleeding.|`|x4aSep6maa	Abortion is such a controversial issue that people will likely be emotional in their answers.

It is taken after the mother misses her period. It can be used up to the second month of pregnancy. It works by blocking progesterone, a crucial hormone during pregnancy. Without progesterone, the uterine lining does not provide food, fluid and oxygen to the tiny developing baby. The baby cannot survive. A second drug is then given that stimulates the uterus to contract and the baby is expelled.<br>  <br>  Women who abort with the drug RU-486 experience nausea, severe cramping, vomiting and bleeding. But the resulting emotional distress may have even more impact. Rather than being “over with” in a few minutes (as in a surgical abortion) this abortion could last for over a week. Then, when the woman finally does abort, she will expel a tiny dead human being - her baby. <br>  <br>  <br>  Suction-Aspiration<br>  <br>  In this method, the cervical muscle ring must be paralyzed and stretched open. The abortionist then inserts a hollow plastic tube with a knife-like edge into the uterus. The suction tears the baby’s body into pieces. The placenta is cut from the uterine wall and everything is sucked into a bottle.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Curettage (D and C)<br>  <br>  This is similar to a suction procedure except a curette, a loop-shaped steel knife is inserted into the uterus. The baby and placenta are cut into pieces and scraped out into a basin. Bleeding is usually very heavy with this method. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Evacuation (D and E)<br>  <br>  This type of abortion is done after the third month of pregnancy. The cervix must be dilated before the abortion. Usually Laminaria sticks are inserted into the cervix. These are made of sterilized seaweed that is compressed into thin sticks. When inserted, they absorb moisture and expand, thus enlarging the cervix. A pliers-like instrument is inserted through the cervix into the uterus. The abortionist then seizes a leg, arm or other part of the baby and, with a twisting motion, tears it from the body. This continues until only the head remains. Finally the skull is crushed and pulled out. The nurse must then reassemble the body parts to be sure that all of them were removed.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Prostaglandin Abortion<br>  <br>  Prostaglandin is a hormone that induces labor. The baby usually dies from the trauma of the delivery. However, if the baby is old enough, it will be born alive. This is called a “complication.” To prevent this, some abortionists use ultrasound to guide them as they inject a “feticide” (a drug that kills the fetus) into the unborn baby’s heart. They then administer prostaglandin and a dead baby is delivered. This type of abortion is used in mid and late term pregnancies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dilation and Extraction (D and X)<br>  <br>  This abortion is also used on mid and late term babies, from 4 to 9 months gestation. Ultrasound is used to identify how the unborn baby is facing in the womb. The abortionist inserts forceps through the cervical canal into the uterus and grasps one of the baby’s legs, positioning the baby feet first, face down (breech position). The child’s body is then pulled out of the birth canal except for the head which is too large to pass through the cervix. The baby is alive, and probably kicking and flailing his legs and arms. The abortionist hooks his fingers over the baby’s shoulders, holding the woman’s cervix away from the baby’s neck. He then jams blunt tipped surgical scissors into the base of the skull and spreads the tips apart to enlarge the wound. A suction catheter is inserted into the baby’s skull and the brain is sucked out. The skull collapses and the baby’s head passes easily through the cervix.<br>  <br>  Abortion is called a “choice”. What is really chosen is the killing of a human being. The methods differ but the results are the same - a dead baby. Even abortion supporters admit this. Dr. Malcom Watts, writing a pro-abortion piece for the California Medical Association said: “...it has been necessary to separate the idea of abortion from the idea of killing, which continues to be socially abhorrent. The result has been a curious avoidance of the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, that human life begins at conception and is continuous until death.” The real question is not about “choice.” It is whether we have the right to kill over 4,000 human beings a day, for any reason.|`|loFbXT8jaa	I had the sam e question a few years back , so i questioned a girlfriend who had more than one!<br>   You make your appt. they want to know How you found out that you are in fact pregnant( home test, or Dr. ).

They tell you the cost of the procedure9 Whatever procedure you chose) based on the term of the pregnancy.

LrXxwtj3aa	If it was a normal period that lasted the normal amount of time I would say no, she is not pregnant.  There is always a chance, however, getting your period is generally a sign that you are not pregnant.  Missing one usually means that you are.  Implantation bleeding is very very light, brown or light pink in color, and lasts three days max.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	it can because it might necessarily be her "period" but implantation|`|JUPszWGhaa	You really have to know the cycle and using the rhythem method is not the best for birth control.  If you have regular periods for about a year ... and your cycle length and duration is about the same consistently.  You could PROBABLY say that counting from the FIRST day of your period ... the most fertile days are 8 through 19 (going on a 28-32 day cycle).  The LEAST fertile days are usually the first 5-7 (counting from day ONE of your period and the last 5-7 days of the cycle.  <br>  <br>  So ... it's POSSIBLE ... but should be less likely that one is pregnant having unprotected sex 7 days prior to the start of a period.|`|jV9CKAhaaa	No, the sperm can only live in the uterus for 2 days, and your egg is not released until ovulation, about halway through your period
SDr9Y7Zyaa	It is the amniotic fluid that he is swallowing that is making him hiccup...But they do definately carry on all the time when they are born!<br>  My daughter hiccuped constantly while in the womb and it just didnt happen as often when she was born.<br>  Congrats!|`|guxlm7fbaa	The amniotic fluid is making your baby hiccup as he/she practices sucking his/her thumb and things like that.|`|zS6MP05taa	My son got the hiccups once or twice a day when i was pregnant, he is now almost 5 weeks old and he still gets them almost every day! He always gets upset when he hiccups though, i dont think he likes it much! lol|`|S7XTl9NCaa	Yes! It will keep going for the first month or two after the wee little person is born. <br>  <br>  My husband got a kick out feeling the hiccups in my belly. :)|`|69DjSUVAaa	My son never hiccuped when in the womb but gets them frequently now.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	My son had them all the time in the womb, and now he's 12 days old he has them once or twice a day!|`|J1stiMioaa	my oldest son was very hiccupy in the womb and this carried on when he was born but outgrew it after a short while. the health visitor said 'hes just a hiccupy baby, and nothing to worry about'|`|jgDlkSiWaa	My first daughter had them all the time in the womb. When she was born, she had then numerous times a day for almost a year!<br>  My second daughter never had them and has had them a few times in 6 months. |`|kuXhcmsJaa	hiccups only happened once when i was pregnant with my daughter thank goodness but when she was born she always got them, even now at almost 1 years old|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	My son did it all the time while I was still pregnant! It happened a lot after he was born too, but not as much :)
cbkvWnb4aa	I dont think your being paranoid you just want whats best for this pregnancy and you want it to be a successful one I dont blame you one bit for worrying Im in my first pregnancy and I remember worrying all the way up till my second trimester and then worrying all the way up till 20 weeks since you can have a late miscarriage between the beginning of the second trimester and 20 weeks I didnt have my first ultrasound till 19 weeks and its just so reassuring seeing the baby also being able to feel it kick. I wish you the best with a safe happy and healthy pregnancy! |`|eKzraNH7aa	maybe you are|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I think its normal for you to be a little worried, I was worried there would be no baby - or no heartbeat - and I was about 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  I think you will be fine I hada scan at 4 weeks and all that could be seen was the thickened lining of the womb.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|2bWF8N83aa	I had the same situation.  I went for my first u/s and they could only find an empty sac.  Called it a possible blighted ovum.  The dr. scheduled me for another u/s the following week and there was a heartbeat and a teeny blob.  That was at 6 weeks, I am now 12 weeks and there is actually a cute little baby in there.  Don't worry, leave it in God's hands.  That's what I did.  |`|jgP51MlRaa	I think your sensibly being cautious and probably just don't want to get your hopes up.<br>  <br>  If it was too early to see your baby before, maybe it was just too early to see, it doesn't mean there's no baby.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Maj|`|aw1Nzzu9aa	Just focus on being healthy right now.  You don't need added stress for things that you do not know about.  Good luck on Thursday!
6H66rfi6aa	It just gets annoying some times.  Hello I put him in blue for a reason.|`|16858d03c472cebe926c4d0c0c3be4c1aa	my son is what people call "pretty"... long eyelashes, big eyes, light brown curly hair... I've had people behind the counter at a restaurant make bets on whether he was a boy or girl! I don't sweat it, heck, I have trouble with other people's kids, why shouldn't they have trouble with mine (even if he is dressed all in blue with jeans on)...|`|XqfH76PMaa	I just overlook it usually.  Sometimes you really can't tell.  Now if it is obvious I might get a little offended.  But overall, I don't think many of us think too much about it.|`|up08cFFXaa	they have a 50% chance of being right.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I get the question all the time even when he's clearly dressed in boy clothes. I find it funny lol. <br>  <br>  I think girls are easier to pick out because of the frilly clothes and pinks/purples. |`|YBQvzEhGaa	My son has a blue bib that we bought at Babies R Us that says "I'm not a girl".  I once had a lady comment that "she will go to anybody."  I said, "he's not a girl, he's a boy." She rudley replied, "Well, he looks like a girl!" What are you supposed to say to this? LOL|`|10daf56c0dcd049644bf131d372a3591aa	I never get bothered when they are this young. It is a common mistake. I especially overlook when the older people make the mistake. I try and just interject a nice "she" or "he" if that were the case.<br>  As an example, someone walks up to me and says "oh your baby is so beautiful, how old is he?" I would just say,"SHE (stress on the she) is 5 months old."<br>  They always say oh sorry and then look and see that they are wearing pink or purple. It is hard unless they are wearing those colors or have their ears pierced, even then some people that are older make the mistake.<br>  Do not take it to heart, it happens and your baby is still beautiful no matter what they say, because they are not around 24.7 like the mother of the baby, so they have really no idea anyways. Most are just guessing.<br>  Take it easy and try not to feel so bad if that happens, you know in your heart that your baby is beautiful and that is all that really matters anyways, right?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WB6TUooVaa	I get kind of annoyed. When my daughter was a month old, we went to Walmart after church. She was wearing a pink dress with lacey ruffles, and pink dress shoes. A little old lady came up and said to me..."How cute, is it a boy or girl"? I mean, come on. If you can't tell, you need some new glasses. I didn't say anything mean, and was super nice to her, but why is it so hard to tell. <br>  Sometimes, babies are just so cute, and you can't tell. You just go with your gut. Even though sometimes your gut is wrong.|`|MjashZnvaa	Lol... I was at the store one time and my baby boy was dressed in a blue shirt that said 'little guy, big cry' so if the blue wasn't enough to give it away the 'guy' part on the shirt should have. Someone walked up to me and asked, how old is she? I was like "HE is 5 months" |`|Qiwkbevsaa	idk its a 50% chance you find out when you are 18 weeks an get an ultrasound
N6DGQYEeaa	I understand your concern and would like to tell you that i too had the same problem, as my breast felt heavy and sored.<br>  I consulted the doc and she advised a ultrasound.<br>  What i found out is i had PCOs, its an ovarian disease common amonst women.<br>  Please do an ultrasound as soon as possible to clear all your doubts.|`|AA12282259	i have bpd too but i dont take meds im 5 months preg now.. u may want to go in or buy a cheap test to check it out if ur nipples are sore... usually they dont get too sensitive right away. so.. u might seriously wanna do something to find out|`|XqfH76PMaa	Well, the sickness may be caused by the medicine but I don't know of any medicine that makes your nipples sore.  There is a possibility of being pregnant.  I would wait and see if I started.  If not, get an at home test and find out.
aad7e94db80a27e755627a6a85f33f10aa	After 5 kids, my advice is CLEANING. drawers,closets, whatever. Because once the baby comes, things get put-off. I went through just about everything up until my due date. Don't forget to sleep whenever possible. Get it while you can.|`|dnRte8U7aa	Tell me about it.  I'm not even 34 weeks and feeling restless, so I can't even imagine what it's going to be like at 38 weeks!<br>  <br>  For now I am trying to remind myself that we are talking about weeks now... not months anymore... and that this little one will be around 24/7 for the next 18 years so maybe it's good to have this time to relax... ;)<br>  <br>  You are almost there!  Good luck!|`|EU0FrQ7waa	I know how you are feeling i been wondering the same thing i have only a couple weeks left and everything has just been going so slow|`|UcF86tBOaa	Nesting...I stenciled the wall.  <br>  Write thank you notes for all the baby gifts<br>  Start the scrapbook pages<br>  Clean your frig<br>  Get your nails done<br>  Play on Yahoo Answers :)|`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Just try to relax and sleep as much as possible. You won't get much of that once bub is born. <br>  <br>  You could try going for walks (also can help to bring on labour), scrapbooking, surfing the net, visiting friends, having lunch dates, preparing babies room, washing bub's clothes, packing your bags, get your hair/nails done, visit a day spa (we deserve it).<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|9y8Gd55haa	I'm trying to figure that one out myself..lol.<br>  I'm just cleaning my house over and over, rearranging my house and just doing whatever I can.<br>  It is so hard to just sit and wait :(
GwwsJzSMaa	You did the right thing as your daughters friend is in your care at the moment and you informed her mum etc. You may have nipped it in the bud but should anything else happen either to your daughter and her friend then you should involve the school. Nasty business bullying, I had it with my youngest son when he started high school, it went on for months and eventually got sorted out. Well done.|`|mrouA15Eaa	You did the right thing.....<br>  <br>  If they do start bullying your daughter then you should step in again....<br>  <br>  Is your daughter helping defend her friend, or just ignoring the bullying?|`|db177321e144fc6c8411beb4480c3ae8aa	You did absolutely the right thing - I can't think of a better way you could have handled it.|`|J1stiMioaa	you did the right thing, hopefully it will stop|`|3PyCIZh2aa	Ever heard that old saying "it takes a village to raise a child"?  I completely think you did the right thing.  Bullying should never be allowed and if more people like you stepped in the kids on this planet would be alot happier.  Plus, you had the perfect "in", you knew the mom.  I understand your concern of not wanting to get your daughter involved, but it shows a united front.  On a side note:  I personally think a good self defense class is something every young woman should take.|`|9b2a823d56eccf54adae83e6bbdc6c7baa	Well, the way I see it, your daughter's friend was under your care (staying at your house) when you addressed the problem so I don't think that you stepped over the line.

Of those stores, H&M and Forever 21 are probably the best because they're really cheap and have awesome clothing. <br>  If you don't want to get her clothes, you can get her a CD.I don't know what type of music she likes, but you can ask her. <br>  Makeup is always a good choice for preteen girls too, but you don't want to get her too much. Maybe get her Lip Smackers chapstick and lip gloss (I loved that stuff when I was 12!!!).

IPrygvZlaa	I have an autistic brother  who is now 13. so i can tell you experiences from that. Autistic children are really smart bright kids. They like patterns and routine and dislike being intoduced to something new. My brother was in nappies till he was nearly 5 as some autistic kids dont like passing bowels, my brother used to hold his bowels for up to a week and have to be given medication to soften them to allow them to pass. They like toys that draw attention lights, music...etc ang tend to stick to specific types..for example my brother used to like power rangers and for months he would only ever play with power rangers, few months down the line he would be interested in say: spiderman and for months that would be all he was interested in.<br>  it was a pattern and still happens even now, all my brother takes an interest in is doctor who and wrestling and its been like this for the past 2 years. He also has had issues with food, there are only a handfull of different types of food that he will eat and refuses to try anything new, his diet has been the same for years and myself and my mum have tried to let him try new things but he wont.  Autistic kids dont like change and develop patterns<br>  <br>  If theres anything else you would like to know in a bit more depth, you are more than welcome to email me. Its a subject which i'm pretty experienced in and my mother would gladly be able to help too xx|`|J1stiMioaa	when i potty trained my autistic son i left it until he was ready (which was 4 years old) as i knew if i tried to get him to do it before he was ready then it just wouldnt work. but on the other hand he may have started late but there was no 'battle' and he was dry day and night within 2 weeks. he woke up one morning and said 'mum, i want to wear big boy pants now' (he has aspergers so is vocal) and we went from there|`|4FN5bVieaa	Firstly, Children with Autism are that.  Children first.  Autism second.  So they will not all be the same  just because they all have Autism, they will develop at different rates, have inherited personality traits, and abilities, just like regular kids. <br>  Secondly there are different degrees of Autism, so some will have greater social difficulties than others.<br>  I know several children with Autism, I will share my experiences of one of them who I know well.<br>  At three - would say the odd word if it was to get something (bikit for biscuit for example), and use gestures to communicate needs.  Only communicated needs as he had no need for social communication.  He was on a special programme to try to help him develop speech so he would have to say words to get what he wanted (ie 'milk', 'drink', 'car' etc).  He was also encouraged to use a pictorial communciation board and to point to pictures of things that he wanted and say the word.<br>  Behaviour:  Was happy if allowed to play in his own world, didn't like children or adults interfering in that play and so could be aggresive if they did.  Could bite, hit, pull hair.  Adults as well as children.  Liked repetitive play, loved numbers, letters and shapes and could become very agitated if a number or shape was missing or someone interefered with the number/ letter orders he had made.  Was very clever at number and letter ordering, and could do so almost without looking.  Could concentrate for hours on these activities, but very little concentration for other things.  <br>  Didn't like noise and would put hands over his ears and scream if the environment became too noisy.  He would humm very loudly and constantly while playing with numbers etc<br>  Toilet training - hadn't a clue was still in nappies.<br>  Obsessive over the colour green and would only eat green foods.<br>  This child is now 7 years old.  There are no changes in the above behaviours except he now hardly speaks at all and rarely says the words that he had to use at three years old.  Still wears nappies.  |`|639cad0e1fe06101ed7d68cdc335a825aa	I worked with Autistic children a lot in my previous career. They were between 4 and 7. The main thing is not to give up communicating, they are in there somewhere and will be listening to you on some level.<br>  <br>  Try to get their eye contact when telling them something important, they will learn that these are important things they need to remember.<br>  <br>  Try to establish a routine and try not to break it too often. Give them picture charts of what their day will consist of so that they know what's going on and what to expect from their day.<br>  <br>  They like yellow, don't ask me why, I've just found this to be true. They like names of things like countries so this could be helpful with language development. They like lists of things to remember, again good for language.<br>  <br>  Don't let them get away with being naughty just because they are Autistic, remember they like structure in their lives.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck, the children I worked with who were Autistic were all beautiful people.|`|uVuYdcRcaa	<br>  Hi,<br>  <br>   I have worked wiht autistic children before and I have to say this is a hard question to answer as it affects children in different ways.<br>  <br>  If severly autistic it can be hard for a child to be potty trained - I worked with some young people who were autistic and still in pads at the age of 22 because they are not able to know when they need the toilet and so on.<br>  <br>  It depends on their level of learning and understanding. <br>  <br>  Autistic children like different toys and many get their simulation from various senses such as visual, smell, touch ect.<br>  <br>  One girl liked visual stimulation so she had toys that would light up a lot. Like a wand that light up and had a dark room where she went and watched the lights.<br>  <br>  One boy like smell so we got him some aroma dough and smell boxes.<br>  <br>  One girl like touch so all things we gave her had different material for her to touch and she loved playing with shaving foam.<br>  <br>  Speech again depends on how autistic they are. Some can communicate on some level with speech, some may sign and others have no speech but do vocalise.<br>  <br>  This was true in the children I worked with so we used PECS which is Picture Exchange Communication. We would make them up a book with various things the student likes, then the student would make a request and we would give them what they wanted.<br>  <br>  We used Green Back Pictures with pictures of symbols or real life photographs of where we were going and place it on a key fob for them to know and understand.<br>  <br>  We also used Object Of Reference where the student would be given things like a spoon for dinner - so they associate spoon with dinner, pad for toilet, paintbrush for art ect. But you need to be consistent in this and NOT CHANGE the object of reference the student understands as this will lead to confusion and upset the child.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped a little!<br>  <br>  Lx |`|57khpl9jaa	behaviour you must be firm at all times or they will play up.                  potty get 1 that plays music when they wet in it.    speech  is   a hard one my grandddaughter has this to she is 4 and talk the leg of a stool just talk to your partner the child will pick up.                      
b3571242ce7bcad1d85a8ae85156993eaa	My guess is she still has a tiny bit in her lungs, or the lungs are irritated from coughing, and that's making her gag and vomit.  Haven't you ever swallowed water the wrong way?  You can cough all you want, but it won't all come out.  It is eventually reabsorbed and it won't kill you.

Qz3sii2caa	You have a history of severe preeclampsia so your doctor should take that into consideration. They should be able to detect high protein in your urine, and if needs be they'd have you do a 24 hour urine collection for testing. It's definitely possible that you could have it again, so if the doctor doesn't mention it after hearing about your past pregnancies, maybe you can suggest being admitted to the hospital for observation. That's what they did with me when they detected possible preeclampsia. <br>  <br>  Make sure you mention the headaches and vision issues. The protein and blood pressure are just the first steps and they can be cautious, but once the headaches and vision become a problem, it's an emergency.|`|HIRYscJlaa	Tell your doc about what happened in the first two pregnancies and tell your doc you think it might be happening again...I'm in my first pregnancy now and my doc suspects I have preeclampsia as well but is also waiting for my bloodpressure to spike...goodluck hon|`|Dq3VhQp9aa	I also had pre eclampsia and one of the signs is those sparks that you are talking about, they are usually sort of at the edge of your vision.  You are describing all of the symptoms of it and given you have had it twice before I wouldnt be surprised if you had it again.  I am not sure if you are aware but pre eclampsia can cause fitting and stroke therefore you need to be resting or in hospital.  You should not be driving at all in case you do have a fit.  This is really serious, I didnt realise how serious it was until my Oby told me about the serious implications not just for you but for your baby.  I would be telling the Dr about all of your history and if they dont consider it an issue I would seek a second opinion.  This is literally life and death stuff.  GO with your gut instinct about this, you seem to realise it is serious.  And it is.

de8b710a2152b97f3cf9de81f8967564aa	Here's a few things I do:<br>   As soon as baby is strong enough to hold up her head or about three months old, you can lie on your back and bring your knees above your chest.  That should create a flat place on your shins to lie your baby tummy down on.  Carefully hold your baby’s hands and slowly raise and lower your feet.  If you also extend your feet away from you, it really works your quads and lower tummy.  This “ride” makes my little girl smile every time and her smile is my motivation to keep going until I just can’t anymore.<br>  <br>  Also, bouncing your baby on your knee. Just lift your toe up and bounce away. That really works your shins. You can also do a baby bench press. Just hold your baby above you while you are laying down and lift them several times. That will work your arms. <br>  And you can turn on some music and dance away with your baby. This can be good cardio.<br>  <br>  Of course, be very careful anytime you are doing any of these w/ baby.|`|8a46cf985d12bfcd9a6c364a7844b9a6aa	are you trying to exercise yourself or the baby?

I seriously doubt you are pregnant, just let this be a wake up call to you that it can happen.  No birth control is 100% eeffective.  There are worse things that could happen to you than pregnancy, there are so many sexually transmitted diseases out there that you need to use condoms to protect yourself from.  Do not rely on the guy to buy them, buy them yourself and insist that he wear one or there's no play time.

7M6ca8SXaa	Nope, you're in no danger.|`|08978edb64e3ad1547f9c30ccce0e022aa	no your safe 100% no. you are NOT pregnant. and good for you for stopping|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Nope, you're fine. But if and when you do decide to do it, wear a condom! Also, if you're getting this serious with your boyfriend and it's leading down this road, go get on birth control. Birth control with condoms GREATLY reduces the risk of pregnancy but there have been cases where a baby still comes from it. My best friend just had a little boy out of birth control pills AND condoms, so, take that for what it's worth. <br>  <br>  No sex is the sure fire way to not get pregnant, but I won't preach to you about that. I'll only preach about protection. : )|`|svtHMGiDaa	Dear friend, Honestly, eventually, someone will get pregnant or a disease if two people of the opposite sex, who are not married, tempt themselves by being alone with one another.  You can get support and information at a pregnancy help center, which you can find by googling optionline, or call 1800afamily.  Please take good care of yourself and your baby if you are pregnant.  Sincerely, Runner
MtikeJtRaa	My hpt was positive within a couple of days of missing my period.  As for the discharge, it shouldn't smell.  It should be white or clear and you shouldn't have any irritation from it.  If you are experiencing discharge that smells and irritation, head over to the doc for a check because you might have an infection.  The amount of discharge will vary from person to person.  Some women don't get any, some will get a lot.|`|y1XH0DGjaa	unfortunately everyone is not the same, and your discharge could vary.  Even if you have been pregnant before, this time could be different.  As far as the +ive pregnancy test.....Again everyone is different.  Both times I was pregnant though I didnt get a +ive until about 2 weeks after I missed a period.  Good luck!|`|1o2c1FVAaa	i can answer to your question , test can came back after 10 days after period,  discharge is OK if you are pregnant , I had discharge when i was 1- 4 months pregnant, no smell no color, but check test first if you are not pregnant  make appointment with Doctor|`|sdIWQQypaa	im havin the same problem but i dont know is it pregnancy yet have 2 wait
850f687434575cd9e9958c6a1af9d1a7aa	Sounds like pregnancy symptoms but it could be ovulation. Chart your cycles for 3 to 4 months to become better aquainted with your body to be aware of what is going on.  Most women have no symptoms with ovulation and  some have a sharp to dull pain on one side.  Emotional symptoms are common with pre menstral syndrome. If concerned, talk with a health care professional.|`|mloFYDNFaa	Could be but then again you could be "thinking" that you're pregnant..that happens a lot to women

I have 4 kids and only one came on her due date.<br>  <br>  You can call the hospital delivery department and ask them right now if you want..or just wait until your baby is born and find out then,,either way it won't matter..baby is going to come and need a name.
AA10137294	Because swallowing makes you gag?|`|HclKftzAaa	if you're talking normal every day spitting out saliva, it's because women can develop a metallic taste in their mouth during the first few months of pregnancy. They are just trying to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  If you're being grotty, and want to know why women 'spit' instead of 'swallow' it's likely that your sperm tastes bad. Pregnant women are more sensitive to tastes and smells, so, something that is normally unpleasant to swallow, is now unbearable.|`|AA11356502	Spit or Split?|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	whata?|`|Rzztwnlyaa	never have i done that threw my pregnancy <br>  <br>  Vicky|`|a58b08181d61fb340c1fe0ced7f24e43aa	who told you that|`|9BahOl1Laa	Grow up.
7D3Cx8JCaa	Hola!!! Puedes combinar muchos nombres, lo importante es saber cuáles te gustan a ti y a la mamá.... Los apellidos son muy importantes porque tienen que combinar con el nombre, por ejemplo si los apellidos del bebé van a ser latinos como Gómez Martínez o Pérez González por favor no le pongas al bebé Alexander, Erwin, Kurt o nombres del estilo.... o viceversa, si los apellidos son anglos, italianos, franceses, busca un nombre que rime con ellos. <br>  Trata de combinar.... Por ejemplo a mi me parece que la combinación de Juan Pablo es muy bonita. <br>  Otro tip??: evita los nombres de telenovela que honestamente son muy feos y sin gusto, ejemplo: Alberto Ricardo, Sebastián Eugenio, Federico Julián.... pobre bebé!!!  <br>  Los nombres que normalmente se combinan con otros son los más sencillos: Juan, Luis, José, etc. (Juan Antonio, José Luis, Luis Enrique).|`|8AVUncEFaa	PONLE COMO YO!!!<br>  <br>  AZATHOTH SI ES VARONCITO<br>  <br>  O "JEZABEL" SI ES NI?ITA!!!|`|CHHkP9gtaa	tiago tadeo<br>  iam lionel<br>  julian santiago<br>  espero que te gusten !!!<br>  felicitaciones por tu bebe !!!!|`|HrbjIyg9aa	Yo te suguiero Josué Israel, o Jair Israel.|`|OHcCPR6Daa	Santiago, Juan Camilo, Samuel, Juan Sebastian, David, Juan Pablo, Luciano, etc.|`|Qi4wqIf1aa	Armando Esteban!!!! es la posta man!!! espero que no seas de apellido Quito.... o sino Angel, Juan Jose ( ; )) Kikino, Nicolas, Anselmo, Guevarita, Ramiro, Chiqui, Tripa, Jeringa, Pintita o Roman.

If she come to you and wants to talk about it, then just be there for her and listen!!!|`|KeFb8t0baa	She may well have given birth the usual way.Babies can survive really early nowadays so id say it was properly developed.I hope the evil man who did this is in prison now.|`|teXUcwhyaa	i had twins at 22 weeks, which is about 5 and half months. yes its like giving birth,  i had mine vaginally. they were a pound each. i didn't have to have a D&C tho , so i don't know about that. no my cervix didn't need stitching either. i'm terribly sorry for your friends loss.|`|w0Nen7JPaa	I would say let her tell you about it if you feel she wants to. It is probably something that was very upseting and she won't feel she is able to talk about it a lot of the time - you know ruin a nice atmosphere by talking about something so difficult. But only if she feels like talking about it, and that may be now, in 6 months time or year's time. At 5 months pregnant it she may not want to say it was a 'miscarriage', depends on how many weeks it was it might be regarded as a 'premature birth', or maybe a 'late miscarriage'. Although many say the womb is strong enough to cope with strong blows, such as that in a car accident, but I don't know if it was possible that the placenta became a bit separated with the blow then it could cause a series of events like bleeding then contractions making the injured area separate more. It might not have been because of the blow, it might have happened anyway for unknown reasons. At 5 months she may have had a chemical induction which is basically giving birth to the baby by chemically causing the mother to have contractions. I think D & C (surgery) is done more for pregnancies earlier on, and would be done under a general anaesthetic so she wouldn't see what was happening. If she had a D & C the baby can come out quite damaged and it could be distressing to see the baby. She will be asked if she wants to see the baby, or know what sex it was. She would also be asked if she wanted to cremate or bury the baby and arrangements made for the baby to be taken to be cremated and the mother put in touch with a minister/priest if she wants a service for the baby. The hospital should be quite sensitive about what the mother does or doesn't want to do about this. For small babies such as under 5 months there will not be any ashes leftover so she will not be able to have a place in the cemetary to visit the baby. Some people do things like name a star in memory of the baby, or plant a tree, name a rose etc. It may well be hard for her to talk about it, but she may feel relieved about getting the chance to talk about it as many people won't ask just in case it is too upsetting. But it can be a major event and talking about it can help in the right place and time. Other people find it easier to forget, not say anything about it and move on. You can let her know she doesn't have to worry about you being upset with the details, then its up to her what more she wants to say.
JFHWzl8Raa	What you just described has nothing to do with flirtiness, she's a child and most children do thrive on attention and can act silly, there's nothing wrong with that. If she is touching other people inappropritaley, kissing boys, etc then yes you do need to sit her down and tell her that it's not acceptable for little girls to do that. Other then that she's doing nothing wrong, so leave her alone.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I would make her a little aware. They teach about good touch and bad touch in school so you should to. Tell her she can always tell you even when she thinks she'll be in trouble and teach her the word modesty.|`|bPJk3yrXaa	whens she doing stuff tell her shes being annoying and s***|`|7188951b2f34ca626cce3ab444debcd1aa	my daughter is now 7 and for the last couple years we'vebeen slowly introducing appropriateness if you can teach her personal boundries so she isint hanging all over older men. at her age its noatural to start wanting more attention and i'm sure she sees it everyday when boys and girls whether on tv or at school or who knows are interacting its just your job to teach her hwo to do it right. we ofter just ask is that lady like because we have explained to her how a lady acts and stressed  that she wants to be a lady soits kind of our code phrase so she doesn feel like shes in trouble or doing somehting bad but that she needs to think about what she is doing. so far its been working hopefully it will continue. its what my mom taught me and my sister and how we both have been raising our girls|`|itK0nXuaaa	there was a girl at my sons school who liked him a lot (hes 6). he got annoyed of her chasing him, so he told her that he had cooties. she never bothered him again|`|t0An16jWaa	No dont do what sp3nc3r said<br>  <br>  quietly tell her that is enough and she needs to calm down.
VClxXNs3aa	did you give her the shot?<br>  <br>  or did she just say that??<br>  <br>  hahaha you got framed buddy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  use a rubber!<br>  <br>  thanks for the two points!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	stay away|`|b11cb078cbd4c27fc4fd2771594d6a26aa	it is possible, no birth control is 100%<br>  If you want her to prove it, buy a test bring it to her and have her pee on it right in front of you and check the results.|`|oltCj6Kcaa	It's possible. Birth control is not 100% effective. Ask her to test again so you can see the test result.|`|uecwFz0Daa	I have never heard of a shot that shuts down female organs. If you mean the Depo shot, then it is still possible to become pregnant.  She also may just be saying this to keep you around.  My suggestion is that if you bring a test to her and have her take it then and there and show you the result.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Yes, it's possible, however, it seems you have a trust issue here.  Give her another test that you have purchased, and at one of your houses, have her take the test, that way you'll know for sure.|`|1YnpNR7Raa	I don't know of anything that "shuts down" the reproductive system, but if she was on the Depo shot then yes, it's still possible to get pregnant. The chances are about the same as with most other forms of birth control, around 97-99% I believe.<br>  I've gotten pregnant twice on the pill, taking it perfectly, so yeah, it happens to the best of us!<br>  Good luck, hope it works out.|`|AplXCzYLaa	Its possible if you had sex with her, but what you need to do is take her to a planned parenthood or some thing and get a test done with them reading the results with you there. That way you know for sure! Good Luck|`|FXA8SImqaa	I know someone who got pregnant by using this form of birth control (the shot) on her honeymoon....then a few weeks aftere the baby was born she was pregnant again!!  Let's just say this form of birth control was not working for her!|`|XqfH76PMaa	The only 100% way to avoid pregnancy is to not have sex.  There is always a chance when you have sex no matter what you use to try to avoid the pregnancy.  If I were you, I would take her a pregnancy test and have her take it so I could see for myself.  Or, take her to the doctor for the test.  That is the only way to know for sure.|`|nuP9XxOnaa	There isn't a "shot" that shuts down the female organs.  If you're having sex, then yes it is possible. <br>  <br>  There is the depo shot that prevents ovulation by giving off pregnancy hormones, but I have never heard of it giving false positives.|`|s9UfJo48aa	There is no "shot" that shuts down female organs, whatever that means.<br>  <br>  She duped you, got pregnant with your child, and you are stuck taking care og hium/her for the rest of your lives.<br>  <br>  Have a cigar!?!?
oY1e6FZ9aa	I never had any morning sickness with my full term baby, but with the ones that were only there for 10-12 days I would be very sick (that is, unimplanted eggs).<br>  relax, nothing is wrong, every baby is different, you can really enjoy this pregnancy!|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Just consider yourself lucky.  Perhaps you had more hormonal changes with your 1st two pregnancies, and now your body is more prepared for pregnancy.  Each pregnancy and delivery is different for each woman.  My mom had extreme morning sickness with me to the point of almost losing me, and none with my sister.  We were both born in less than 3 hours labor.  On the other hand, I didn't have morning sickness with my pregnancy, but a lot of heartburn with my adopted son's mother's pregnancy!  My sister had lots of morning sickness, and yet we all had boys born by c-section.  <br>  Pregnancies are kind of like people, no 2 are alike.|`|oltCj6Kcaa	Every pregnancy is different....|`|3m40DbqNaa	It must depend on the pregnancy, not the sex of the baby, because I was the opposite from you. No sickness at all with #1 (girl), horrible sickness and vomiting with #2 (boy) and just a little sickness but no vomiting and not every day with this pregnancy #3 (girl).|`|XqfH76PMaa	My pregnancies were completly opposite.  I was sick as a dog with the first one and the second one I didn't get sick at all.  I hear (probably a wive's tale) that you have really opposite pregnancies with different sexes.  My pregnancy with my daughter was alot worse than that of my son.  Anyway, it is normal.  I wouldn't be concerned at all.  You are actually lucky!|`|zA0e7QWCaa	I am or rather my daughter is pregnant 22wks. and she hasn't had nay morning sickness until this last couple weeks.  She found out today that she is having a boy.  Good luck|`|023c3ef3fd676819b11c0615018873d6aa	Every pregnancy is different. You may be speaking too soon! You could still get morning sickness. I didn't have any until around three months with my first, and it only lasted two or three weeks. Now with my second, it started around 8 weeks and continued until about 14 weeks. Or, you may just be one of the lucky ones that doesn't have the nausea at all this time! As long as you are having other pregnancy symptoms still, I think everything is okay. Good luck!|`|i2T0UCmLaa	I am 6 weeks too and I don't have morning sickness either. My belly feels a little weird, I am very trusty with sore breast. That's about it. You are just lucky not to have symptoms for that pregnancy. I heard that every pregnancy is different. Good luck to you.
fKaATpL0aa	mkay. If you have had sex (protected or not) their is a chance that you could be pregnant! DUH! Get a test and see.|`|XqfH76PMaa	If it was unprotected, there is a possibility.  If you don't have your period within a week, I suggest getting an at home test and finding out.  Good luck!|`|023c3ef3fd676819b11c0615018873d6aa	Yeah, it's possible. Take a test. If it's negative and still no period in a few days, take another one just to be sure.|`|2hwzvppsaa	all it takes is just that 'one' time. You can wait it out and see if it''s just late or to have a peace of mind (or freak), go buy a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|NWFZZEXlaa	CONGRATUALATIONS....<br>  <br>  You could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test.

AA11118812	sure is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!of course|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	Yes, but if you are trying for a baby, I would try working out when you ovulate and try to have sex around that time.|`|78fa1593646560988c16340f9f158d5eaa	You can get pregnant after having sex only once!|`|J1stiMioaa	every time you have sex it is possible to get pregnant|`|RdAzsZujaa	Anytime you have sex, you have a chance of getting pregnant.|`|aNsv0PPnaa	yes always possible best to try every few days xx|`|sbmzMVLraa	Yes it is possible to get pregnant.<br>  Anytime you have sex you could be pregnant.|`|HzevoVflaa	Hi Kisha,  it is very possible you could get pregnant, particularly if not using protection. There is also a chance of other things, like STD's,which are not pleasant, could cause a horrendous effect on any partners if you have many different partners, and  which ultimately can take away your life,<br>  Also imagine if you do pick up an STD, and have to go to a clinic for treatment, they are almost certainly going to ask you for the names of the partner(s) you have been with so that they can be checked out.<br>  Remember also that an STD is passed on through bodily fluids, so that oral sex, anal sex and even a hand job can lead to thesd deseaeses being passed on to you, particularly if yoyu have an open wound, even a small uncovered cut or graze.<br>  When you do use a condom, make sure your hands are clean, ie have not touched the penis, because it is possible for the guy to pre ejaculate (usually a clear fluid) which can also carry sperm, and thus make the condom no good as an anti pregnancy device.<br>  Also if you are on anti biotics, they  may counter the effect of the contraceptive pill, ( I know, I got a lovely granddaughter through this).<br>  If the guy loves and respects you he won't object to condoms, ( latex allergies are no good as an excuse as there are non latex condoms available in the shops and family planning clinics { the latter free} )  address and telephone number in the phone book.  Enjoy yourself, but dont let 10 seconds of fun lead to a lifetime of misery.  Mike  t|`|I9BbQ5Qmaa	i think you already know the answer to this question|`|ITp35Wyzaa	yes, it is possible to get pregnant.|`|RZM6gFezaa	IF you are having sex without a condom or any other form of controception it is possible to get pregnant. Some people need to do it a bit more but it IS possible!!!.|`|k3XU7GOsaa	Without a doubt! If you had sex once a year you could get pregnant!
vI0WnAiOaa	what a good idea, i am still using mine though|`|J1stiMioaa	unused as in new or unused as in not wanted anymore? do they pick them up or cover postage? i live in notts so its a fair drive to drop a travel cot off|`|irP2yTMWaa	Nice idea but are local doctors take all things like that for people that can't afford stuff for there baby x
xXnFx6qLaa	Don't worry - every child is different!  My son is 7.5 months and he sits, but not very long and then he topples over.  He's not good at it yet.  He's been doing this same thing for over a month.  Your baby is just fine.  If you are that worried, contact your pediatrician and ask, but let me assure you, everything is probably fine.|`|Cw4awfllaa	Give her lots if tummy time, it is very important  for baby's to get tummy time for it will help her developed her skills. A lot of baby's get skills at different ages. If you are worried tell her doctor or get into a class with other baby's and mothers to swap ideas.|`|AA12311021	I would talk to her doctor so that they are aware of what is going on babies hit milestones when they are ready some babies don't learn how to sit till later some earlier it just depends on the child. I'm sure she is just fine and developing at her own rate but give yourself some peace of mind and talk to her doctor. good luck.|`|lVzBupUaaa	I honestly wouldn't worry - my son didn't do anything until he was almost 10 months old and he's a healthy 2 year old now.  Babies develop at different times and ages - it's probably nothing.<br>  <br>  However, if your concerned, speak to your health visitor or GP.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry. xx|`|HYLC4pqIaa	Was she a premature at birth?  This may cause some delays.<br>  How often do you work with her on sitting up?  Some babies take longer than others to do things.<br>  Best bet is to check with her doctor.|`|EJpRFYSTaa	have you tried to let her sit in a bumbo seat. i did that with my son and it helped him within a couple of weeks.|`|eYBIir2Raa	her knee caps have not developed - about the first year
7T6KIqOwaa	You have taken the first step by recognizing that you want or need a job now is the time to take even harder steps. Separation anxiety between a parent and their child can be a difficult issue over come. I believe that the key is to start slowly and work your way to further time apart from there, after all you don't want to be the parent who can't let their child go to kindergarten without having a breakdown. My advise is if right now the most time you and your child spend apart is 5 minutes start from there. Take your baby to a friend, family member or sitters house just for 30 minutes, make sure that this person knows the situation. Just be gone for those 30 minutes. If it is just sitting in your car, taking a walk around the block, or giving your best friend a call on the phone that is fine. After those 30 minutes have come and gone go and "pick up" your child from wherever they are. I am going to be up front and honest with you it is going to be extremely hard on you and the baby. There will be tears and hard feelings (mainly on your part) but sometimes in life we have to do things that are hard. Try this and gradually increase the time as tolerated. If you and your baby are having a difficult time may I suggest starting with a part time job which has the opportunity to work into a full time job as you and your child progress and become more comfortable with the situation. Best of luck to you both and remember you can do anything you set your heart on.
144e7e835c833aa90ee631957688d63baa	Congratulations!<br>  <br>  I can help you out with the breastfeeding question.  I don't have twins, but I was tandem-nursing for over 2 years.  I am also expecting another baby next month, and will tandem-nurse again.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you that you won't make enough milk for 2 babies, because you will!  Don't automatically assume that you will need to supplement.  I have had two friends in the past five years give birth to twins who exclusively breastfed their twins for 12 months!  It is hard, one mom said she basically lived in her recliner for the first four months, just nursing.  AND she had three older children, too. <br>  <br>  I really recommend the book "Adventures in Tandem Nursing" by Hilary Flower.  It has great tips for tandem feeding, with lots of photographs to show you how to nurse two at a time.<br>  <br>  It's not the same thing, but many years ago, I was a nanny for infant twins for two years, and honestly, they were lovely children!  I got used to doing everything with two, feeding two in two highchairs, matching their nap times, etc.<br>  <br>  You will adapt very quickly, mom, and congratulations, I hope the breastfeeding goes well for you!|`|2c48b3bd7e6ca9cfd29d601e87ea4eedaa	Yes it is difficult, just like it is difficult with a singleton. But just like with a singleton, you adjust and it becomes routine and easy!<br>  <br>  Great job with breastfeeding your twins! That's fantastic!!! :) I suggest finding a breastfeeding forum that supports great moms like you! You can do it and congratulations!!!|`|drFne2vsaa	Wow.....lol.  Well first of all don't plan on sleeping for about a year unless you have babies that want to be on the same schedule. (mine did not chose this, lol)  I really tried breast-feeding but one didn't latch right and the other was a biter ( yet another bad combo).<br>  <br>  Good luck, sleep when ever you can, take any babysitting offers you get for an opportunity to sleep, and DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE HOUSE it will get done when it gets done. <br>  <br>  My twins will be 16 this November........you will survive!!|`|X4b1FqlGaa	I have twin female girls that are 2 years old now. Honestly my life has been easier with the twins than it was with just my son. It's hard though, overwhelming, prepare to cry! It is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me. I breast fed my girls. I have a very set schedule for the most part. They eat togethor, bath togethor, poo togethor and everything togethor. A piece of advice--- When they are babies of you put them to bed and they aren't hungry, have a dirty diaper or sick let them cry and learn how to sooth themselves to sleep. Having multiples is a hard job. You will be glad that you have time for yourself. My girls go to sleep at 8 pm and wake from 7:30- 9am. I love having me time. Make them nap the same way. You'll be glad!! Anyway the reason I say you cry is because it's difficult to have 2 babies screaming when they are newborns. You have to make them learn to be patient with diaper changes, feeding and everything else. Congratulations by the way. Prepare to fell like a star in public- you'll get lots of attention. Twins are so much fun!! My girls are identical and I painted one babies toenail so I made sure I never mixed them up. My girls are Identical. Anyway, just make sure you have a lot of support and you will be fine. Be patient, don't stress out you areonly one person and I am sure that at all times you will do the best that you can. Congratulations again.|`|KU4RG2SPaa	I was 10 years old when my mother had my sister and about 15 months later she gave birth to my twin brothers! Needless to say, I was like their second mother! My mother didn't breastfeed though. One would be bottle feeding one while the other was feeding the other twin. Or if my mom was by herself she would put them in their infant carseats in front of her and feed them at the same time. One little tip that we found very helpful, when one would get up during the night, wake the other one up and feed and change also. It gets them into a little better of a routine and you also will find yourself getting a little more rest during the night! Bathing, my mom would take turns putting them right in the bath with her and someone (either my father or I) would be ready to dress them when they were done. You'll def need a little extra help in the beginning. It may seem very overwhelming to you now and right after they are born, but as time goes on things start seem to fall into place and become more routine. My brothers are now 18 and graduating in a month, I only wish I could go back in time and hold them in my arms again!! Having twin brothers was def an amazing experience for me. Good Luck to you!!|`|GUNSoFWuaa	Wow, cool. Yeah well we have 2 twin boys they are 3, almost 4 years old. I'm 16 and I've helped raise them since they were born with my grandma. And as I can say, it is fun. One thing, I dont know if you know but twins when they get a little older, they might not start talking for a bit becase some twins have "Twin Speak" where they talk to echother and u honestly dont knwo what they are saying.So they can be late on when they start talking. Wow they go through a lot of diapers too. A swing would help a great deal if they are always wanting to be taken care of at the same time, the swing will calm the other one down and you have time to take care of the other one. We had to do that a lot and it helps to comfort them both if you have two and you need a break, That is Highly recommend. =]..Birthdays are fun as well, just make sure you get 2 of the same toy even when they are 1year because they still fight over it at that age.... Well, if you have any more questions you can email me at my yahoo account... savagedkitty_62691  have a great day and good luck..
qi568pojaa	I love it...it sounds exotic but not too over the top.  I would give a simple middle name to even it out...just in case your baby doesn't like it...LOL..like mine!|`|RFGLvbNEaa	I assume it's pronounced Ky?  Love it!  I've heard it for a girl also but I prefer it for a boy.|`|PwEvPL0Faa	Didn't we answer this already???  sounds like the same question asked before..<br>  <br>  Anyway I still like it, I have friends with that name one pronounces it Kay the other pronounces it Kah-Eye|`|kEJLWdz1aa	Yes. THe name is so cute for pet and not baby.|`|hDqQUVmAaa	Its okay, but do you know what a better name would be...|`|jopCFM8vaa	Yes it is very cute and very...i don't know...unique :]|`|Ez3XCinaaa	I like it =]<br>  It could be for a girl or a boy!<br>  :D|`|qzlyoa9Eaa	i think it s a very pretty name. im just not quite sure how to say it. no offense.<br>  is it like saying just kay?|`|470241789c0116ce394a6164bc62866eaa	no. it sounds like a animal or food.|`|hYntkVHTaa	for a fish=]]but yea i think its kewl|`|WDD8L8zYaa	thats a namee!!!!!!? noo...they are really amazing names|`|wy8NMzy8aa	It's okay|`|iBmuZUxvaa	no.|`|EcMIIdRlaa	no|`|P5ZTuHJ8aa	is it short for something?|`|ugTZwP1Uaa	nope|`|I1jvtphTaa	yes<br>  very cute!|`|A6q6Ravhaa	aww that  is  a  cute  name  i  like  it|`|xiK4YAblaa	It's okay. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. I don't know anyone with that name, either, so it must be unique.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	only if you're from California, otherwise it sounds weird.<br>  <br>  It sounds alright on Californians though for some reason.  Maybe because it sounds like a surfer name.|`|klBuVAXIaa	not exactly sure how to pronounce it but it looks cool!!!|`|ZXdAimqXaa	Sounds like a karate yell.|`|nL5hIjE9aa	Is it for a gai?
Y4MAdfP4aa	get them goodnites or underjams they fix up to 120 lbs<br>  they work for kids from 6-12 years old bedwettting is very commmon and they are like real underwer my 11 year old and 8 and 6 year old wear them|`|nbSp469Waa	I don't think they make the thick underwear for kids that age.  Plus, if they are anything like my son they will wet right thru them.  We were so tired of having to buy pull ups too, and it didn't help my 4 year old daughter doesn't have a problem wetting the bed.  My son is almost 10 and we've been dealing with it since he was potty trained.  I think we finally figured it out tho, and he is a super heavy sleeper, we cut his drinks off an hour before he goes to bed.  I make him pee before he goes to bed, I wake him up when I go to bed to pee, if I get up in the night to use the bathroom I get him up to go too, and then my husband gets him up before he goes to work.  We are about to start week 2 with no accidents.  And we did the whole doctor thing, they found nothing wrong with him, his doctor just said that he is a very heavy sleeper, and his body doesn't wake itself up like you and I do.  And he will eventually grow out of it.|`|okh3hL8taa	Another thing to cut out is soda.  Soda causes gas, gas causes bloating bloating puts pressure on their bladders. The alarm is a good idea, one of my brothers had to have one because he could literally sleep through an earth quake (he slept through the big one in San Francisco in 1989.  If you have a problem (don't want) with the alarm the doctor recommended the only other option would be for YOU to get up in the middle of the night and take them to the bathroom yourself.|`|C5uY7lIWaa	I've been dealing with this with my 5 year old as well.  He has no medical condition either.  He can not drink anything 2-3 hours before bedtime and he goes to the bathroom right before sleep.  One thing that has helped us A LOT is him not even wearing underwear.  I think when they are wearing underwear they feel something is there to catch the pee so if they don't have anything there to hold it then they are more likely to not pee or to wake up.  In the last 3 weeks of doing this we have only had maybe 2 accidents when it was a nightly thing.|`|2Hv5VEwdaa	5 and 7 are too old to wet the bed. Make it a habit to take them to the toilet before sleeping, everyday. Or wake them up some where in the middle of the night just to visit the toilet. I'm sure this would help. In case, it doesn't you will have to show them to your doctor.|`|UAXZcvqraa	Well you could tell a doctor|`|4b85bad102a91e6724b315304a3e5d4eaa	Unfortunately, underwear will not help.  The best thing to do is to talk to your pediatrician.

bJqVZqseaa	you know what, you are better off without that waste of space, he dont deserve you or your child... be strong.<br>  you dont need him.<br>  if he ever wants to see his child, tell him to leave you and the baby alone, he made his decision the day he walked out on you both.<br>  Mke sue he pays child maintenence for that child though.<br>  Contact CSA when the baby is born.<br>  <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|AykczQleaa	Just because he doesnt' want to be on the birth cert. doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay child support.  Don't wait on him....|`|oojO4WAraa	You need to worry about your future and the baby's future.  Get an attorney, file for support. Do it NOW.  He can change his mind all he wants.  Fact is - he is the father and the courts will make him live up to his responsibility whether he wants to or not.  Cut out the emotional BS and get an attorney and deal with this problem squarely and up front.  Good luck.|`|jgP51MlRaa	At the moment he says he wants nothing to do with the baby, i think you need to move on and just be there for the baby, give it all the love and support it needs, but leave the door open for the father, he may come round in time, but if he doesn't you've still got a wonderful little miracle<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  :) maj|`|GivjcvuYaa	Hun, I would cut him loose completely. From the sound of this he really does not care and he never will. He is probably just scared and he is not man enough to tell you straight up, so he figures ignoring you will take care of things. Guys and there immature ways of thinking ugh! You will do fine without him and you will realize that you deserve better!! Hang in there! :)|`|db82e50b29bf9812520947d2b57f0246aa	I think you should get on with your own life being a mum is hard without having boyfriend problems you will meet someone else sod him !|`|OXxKTM6vaa	personally i would cut him out now if thats how he feels and what he wants and i wouldn't put him on the birth certificate so that he never had any rights.<br>  <br>  However, saying this - if his family still want to see the child i wouldn't begrudge this, cos it will be their granchild etc.<br>  <br>  I know from experience how painful it is being a child with a father consistantly coming in and out of your life, its hard and causes more problems than its worth. I later made the decision to cut my father out of my life, although i am glad my mum gave me the choice to make that decision myself.<br>  <br>  For me, if i was in that situation i would perhaps let him see the child if he wishes to do so with a family member, so this doesn't effect you.<br>  Perhaps the child may turn on you if he/she does wish to his the father once older so never turn this down.<br>  <br>  Its a hard situation you jst need to weigh up the pros and cons and see whats right for you and the child, but like i say, when the child is old enough the chances are he/she may want to see their father and you should always allow this as hard as it may be and be prepared to pick up the places.<br>  <br>  The child WILL most certainly see their father for what he really is when the time is right.<br>  <br>  i wish you all the best and try not to worry, my mum was a single parent like i stated before and she couldn't have done more for us. She was my mum, dad and bestfriend and you can be the same to your child!|`|Qlss54yyaa	i am an iranian asylum seeker and i have been living with an english girl for nearly 3 years. when she got pregnant however i did not recommend ( because i was and am in limbo ) but i supported her all the way. she still telling me how she got support to push by looking into my brown eyes to give birth.|`|BNA3mhpBaa	Abort this baby.  You are too young to have a child.  No father, no marriage.   What did you expect  becoming an unwed mother?   Who will support you and this child?  Living in poverty, you soon will grow to resent this child.  Chalk this up as a hard lesson and keep your pants zipped.|`|oMcsmBhraa	guys get just as scared as we do ok hun...they are just as complicated as us lol...but all i can tell you is that hopefully he'll change his mind...if not...you always have your family...and maybe even his family...im sorry for what your going through but just have faith and love your child dearly...good luck you can do it|`|NotCK6GTaa	Don't rely on him, simple as that.<br>  <br>  If he comes to his senses, is around and becomes a great Dad, then thats fab.<br>  <br>  But don't be surprised if he doesn't.|`|7r6ptEJyaa	my dad left when my mom got preggo and im 15 now and preggo myself. u never really know.|`|4cNiHIWeaa	Ok sweety, don't let this guy worry you so much. You need to focus on yourself and your baby right now. For you and the baby's sake I hope this lunkhead gets his priorities straight, but, some guys are like that. Tell him you want him to be a part of his childs life but you don't want it to be about his conveniance. This  is a persons life, and you are the parents, and the child does not need an unstable force driving it. That said, you should have him promise to be at the birth of your child, hopefully that will change his attitude towards the whole thing. Watching your child come into the world is the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen, and it will change both of your lives forever. Try to focus on yourself and the baby inside, as it can feel your pain even in pregnacy! With or without this guy, you are ganna be in charge of giving this baby the happiest life possible. If he's ganna be like that there are plenty of guys that will step up and be the father he should have been. Talk to him, then give him his space, as he's got alot on his mind and has some realizations to come to as well. Good luck sweety, and keep your head high!!!|`|7W8ihXA4aa	I am so sorry that you are having to go through this!  The father of my son and i were 19 when we found out i was expecting.  To start off with he was shocked but came round and seemed fine.  We told our closest friends and were all joking about names and things.  He went off to do camp america and used to ring me and say that we would go travelling when the baby was here and how much he loved me and missed me . . . .and then he spoke to his dad and his dad put him off so badly that we broke up and it was horrible.  I was utterly devastated and heartbroken, crying all the time and worrying what i would do on my own.<br>  <br>  But at the end of the day i realised that my baby needed me to be strong and get on with it more than i needed to sit around crying.  It was hard but i picked myself up, found a job to last until i had the baby, made living arrangements, and when my baby arrived i was all set.  His dad sees him (he calmed down and wanted to be involved a little but i would never have forgiven him and taken him back) but im his mum and all the big decisions are up to me and thats the way i like it.<br>  <br>  First of all i would see if you can find out why he changed his mind so suddenly because it seems a bit strange.  Then i would see if you can sort it out with him.  If you cant sort it out then make sure that you can look after your baby on your own.  Im sure that you have loads of family and friends ready to support you and in time you will realise that you dont need a man to be a good mother.  If he doesnt buck his ideas up and realise how lucky he is to have you and a baby, then he doesnt deserve to be with you.  Dont waste too much time over him because you and your child deserve better than that!  Good luck and keep your chin up, these things work out eventually and whatever happens now will be for the best.|`|8UDXj1F9aa	Whether he likes it or not, he is that child's father.  I am sure you can have him put on the birth certificate and you should because your child has a right to know who his/her father is.  I know how important it is because I never knew who mine was and it really causes a lot of pain as you get older.   Also, he must support your child financially.  Please don't let him just walk away, even if the two of you can't be together.  Try to stay strong for your baby and try to cheer up because all of your emotional pain will be transmitted to your baby in your womb.  I hope you have good family support and really do wish you all the best.|`|o7x1d9yDaa	My answer for you would be to focus on you and the baby right now. My best friend just had a baby about 2 month ago and is going through the same thing you are. I know how you feel but your not going to change his mind only he can do that so don't worry about if he'll come back or change his mind because you'll soon realize that the only thing that matters to you is that baby. And if that's the kinda man he wants to be than your really have to think if you want your baby to grow up around that, believe me I'm sure there are plenty of Male's in your family he could look up to one day that will teach him right. So i wish you the best of luck and I'm sure you guys will be just fine!|`|q5j8xSNCaa	If you need child support - forget about a relationship for a minute - you need to make sure he is on the birth certificate, and you need to get a lawyer involved to make sure he pays up - garnishing wages if necessary.  He is the father, and he cannot just dump you and say that's it.  He is responsible for making this baby, and he is responsible for supporting it.  As for the relationship, if this is how he is going to be, he probably isn't the best man for your or your baby.  It will hurt for some time, but one day the right person will come along and you will be glad that you didn't end up with someone who didn't want to be with you or your child.|`|sIpWnIKaaa	don't wait around for him , i know it'll be hard but at the end of the day as long as when the baby is born it as got you , , i don't know why how men van be like that he wasn't bothered when he was helping produce the baby but now it's reality don't want to know , you are better of without him you don't want to live life with him knowing that he wasn't there for you when you really needed him , and causing you stress when you should be stress free , I'm sorry and good luck in the future

If he sleeps in a cot for the nigth then his reluctance to use it in the day could be because it's too light for him - try blackout blinds.  If you really want him to stay in the hubbub of the house perhaps a travel cot would work.

1kJLWCX6aa	You are probably getting pre menstural symptoms. Breast tenderness, cramping, and hunger/cravings are normal before your period. Don't psych yourself out just yet. If you do infact miss your period, take the test five days AFTER the missed period and you will have your answer.<br>  If you are pregnant, and abortion is something you are comfortable with, I say do what you need to. I know people will flip sh^# when they even see the word abortion, but I think it's bad to bring a child into a world where it cannot be supported fully. I think it's mean to just drop it off to some agency and deem it their problem, too. Poor kid will grow up feeling depressed and wondering why? <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|Qiwkbevsaa	well then get on birth control anyways take a test like 3 days after oct. 5th if you havent started that should tell you|`|Jwd5uIVwaa	Take a pregnancy test - go to the doctor - you might be. You might not. No sense in losing sleep unnecessarily. Go and find out officially!|`|XqfH76PMaa	Just keep your fingers crossed.  I understand how it is to worry like that.  I would wait until it is time for my period and take a test if I am late.  Stressing out won't do you any good.  It can actually cause you to be late.  So, try to remain calm until you have good reason to worry.  Good luck!|`|bS4l7GHfaa	WELL I HOPE YOU ARENT EITHER BECAUSE THE WORST THING TO DO IS HAVE A BABY AND YOU CANT PROVIDE FOR IT. YOU SHOULD GO AND SEE A DOCTOR AND HAVE THEM TEST YOU IF THE TEST STILL COME OUT A NEGATIVE YOU SHOULD TRY TO RELAX BECAUSE IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE STRESSING OUT. AND STRESS CAN LEAD TO TIRING, EATING AND OTHER THINGS. SO GO AND CHECK WITH A DOCTOR FIRST AND IF YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT YOU SHOULD GO AND HAVE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THEY ADVERTISE ON TV SAYING THAT IF YOU DONT WANT TO HAVE A BABY FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS THEY CAN PUT INSIDE OF YOU. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP. ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THAT.|`|mptvSNqlaa	Just relax, your body can trick you into thinking you are pregnant, stay calm and im sure you are fine.|`|L8peUnIPaa	You'll have to wait & see if you miss a period then take a test.<br>  OB/GYN RN
2CdwIkgxaa	Continue doing what works for you and your husband, just say thanks mum when she gives you advice and leave it at that. You don't have to do every thing people tell you he is your son and you know whats best for him. i personally don't agree with the cry it out method either it breaks my heart to hear our daughter crying so why let it continue if you don't have to and if your husband can settle him so quick then that's great plus it's time they get together even if it is only for a couple of minutes and your son will love the fact that daddy goes when he needs him. good luck and best wishes. :-)|`|TlsK9bCGaa	BUBBLES X my sympathy, but only if u were in this situation would u understand. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: it has nothing to do with lack of appreciation,but more to do with having authority and feeling a sense of accomplishment. it can be overbearing at times. be firm and each time she does it point it out, how would she have felt if roles were reversed? if this does not work cut her off for a short period periodically until she gets the picture.|`|XqfH76PMaa	You are the mom.  You know what you are doing is best for your baby.  Your mom probably thinks that she is helping and that she knows more than you.  I suggest you just ignore her.  When she says something like what you have mentioned before, just let it go in one ear and out the other.  Talking to her isn't going to work and fighting isn't worth it.  Do not get upset.  Just make up your mind that she is trying to "help" and you are doing fine on your own.  Just let her talk but ignore it, change the subject as soon as possible and don't worry about it.  Sometimes they can get so pushy and never realize it.  |`|f7a373eb7a994b57f8de966c9eb0968baa	Do you and I have the same mom?  HAHA.  My mother does this to me ALL the time.  I finally told her that since I was a baby things have come a long way, they have learned more about the development of children, and some of the things that she did when I was a child have been proven not to be such a great idea today.  I told her for example, she was able to hold me in her lap on the way home from the hospital when she had me.  NOW, it is a fact that maybe children are better off in car seats.  The SIDS rate has went down now that we don't lay babies on their tummy's like our mothers did.  Maybe explain some of these things to her.  I also told my mom that I appreciated her "advice" but that I was my sons mother, and I was going to raise him the way I wanted to and in a way that worked for us.  It sounds like you are doing a great job!!!|`|xBXrqRttaa	First off, don't cry to her about it. Stand firm or else you look weak and incapable. My mother likes to give unwanted baby advice also. Most of the time I just smile and nod. If she sees its bothering you, she may keep  <br>  poking the fire to get a reaction. Put your foot down...tell her "You raised me to be a capable woman, and now you don't trust me to take care of my own son? What does that say about you, after all, I've learned from you." There is no need to be rude, but be firm. Show her you are capable...otherwise....ignore her. It may not be easy, but sometimes just grinning and bearing it works and eventually she'll stop. |`|WlU3NFu6aa	Honestly I would just ignore her. My grandma is the same way. She babysits for me and she always thinks shes right. She is very set in her ways. WE did alot of arguing but now I just say ok, kind of to shut her up and do what I feel is right anyway. If your mom is anyhtng like my grandma, she will not give up because she believes she is right.<br>  and you are not a crappy mother! dont let her make you feel that way! you just have differences of opinions|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Tell your mum you appreciate her concern for grandson.  But ultimately, he is yours & your hubby's baby & therefore your responsibility.    WTF "baby cries when I pour water on his head in the bath, & mom says your too gentle".<br>  <br>  Most babies cry doing this as it's a bit of a shock,   Imagine if someone grabbed you when you were fairly comfortable lay in your bed & undressed you then gently poured water over your head.   I don''t think you'd be too happy either?   You don't say baby's age?  They soon get used to having a bath & water gently sponged on their heads, so I think she's just trying to put you on a guilt trip. <br>  <br>  I think it is wonderful that your hubby is actively looking after bub @ night sometimes.   You do need a rest to re-charge your batteries.  He helped with conception so why shouldn't he lend a hand when you're exhausted? why make yourself suffer for over 2 hours when hubby does it so much quicker? You can both get back to sleep easier then.<br>  <br>  Every-time your mom starts on about your son - count to ten then repeat; "I appreciate your concern....." .    Take it easy on yourself.   If you get up tight your baby will pick up the signals.  Good luck.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Tell her that when you try to talk to her about these issues that all you're doing is venting, you really want your mom to just lend a ear to listen. Tell her if she just can't listen without inputting her two cents then the talks are going to stop. <br>  Also let her know when she gives this advice it makes you feel like a crappy mother. I'm sure she doesn't realize how it makes you feel.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Does your mother live with you?  If not, stop telling her what goes on in your home with the baby.  Talk about the cute and sweet things that happen.  <br>  Smile and nod when she gives advice.  Then do what you want to do.  You are grown and your instincts about what your child needs are just as keen as her's were when she was raising you.  Trust them and tune out mom.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	tell her to shut the hell up hes your kid and youll raise him how you want!|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	Just be firm and blunt with her.  Tell her that you are raising your child the best way you know and that you are his mother and not her.  Tell her that she is welcome to come visit you and the baby and that when she is babysitting she can watch him her way.  Tell her that you are an adult and that it is time for her to realize that.  Let her know that when you are in need of her adivce you will ask her, but unless you ask, she needs to back off.    <br>  <br>  After that if she calls you and starts into then tell her you need to go and hang up the phone.  If you are with her in person, change the subject or get up and leave.  This will stop any argument, it takes 2 to argue- if you stop it before it starts, maybe she will get the hint.<br>  <br>  She will be wounded and feel like you are rejecting her and in a way you are, but she needs to know that is not acceptable behavior.  <br>  <br>  Since it is your mother, you need to tell her and you need to tell her straight up how it is. She will be upset and will lick her wounds for a while but eventually, she should get over it.<br>  <br>  I think that is the best you can do.<br>  <br>  Edit**<br>  How old is the baby?  If you are talking an infant like 2 months, getting up with him is acceptable.  If he is 2 years, it is probably not a good plan- he should sleep through the night on his own, you are setting the stage for the future.  But he is your baby and you have to raise him how you see fit.|`|6auqS9pLaa	Tell your Mom that if you don't expect her to come over and put the baby to sleep that it is really none of her business.  Same goes for the bath.  It sounds like you need to be more firm.  <br>  <br>  FYI - I count to 3 and blow in my daughter's face then pour the water (babies automatically hold their breath when you do this) and she loves the water, pool, beach, etc.  |`|XhdcIQWwaa	tell her you want to do it your way and also be ******* greatful your mum is there to see your baby she is only trying to help you. im 21 and my parents are dead.  theyl never hold my first baby so just appreciate shes there for you|`|XD42367paa	I'd quit making it up for discussion. When she starts up, simply say you aren't discussing it and move onto another subject. |`|6yi6gteeaa	What Ladonnas momma said. <br>  <br>  My kid. My business!|`|siDcjgJCaa	I find myself saying to my mother "good thing she is my kid huh?" alot.... try that....|`|AA10091004	She's just trying to help you, stop being so hard on her for heaven's sake. Be polite!! What is wrong with you. Thank her and nicely let her know you appreciate her advice but would like to do this your own way and she is certainly welcome to be involved, but remind her you need to learn this for yourself. Remember, she raised you and she deserves respect and having a bad attitude does not show good parenting skills. Don't listen to the one that said tell her to shut up.She's your mother and that child's grandmother like it or not, so try to get along.|`|bFbSXNx8aa	Just ignore it.  Or straight out tell her how you feel, like you did here - tell her that her constantly commenting on those issues are really making you feel badly, and you wish she would please stop.  <br>  <br>  I hope you don't take this the wrong way - but I've been in your boat and you may be somewhat creating some of your misery.  How does your mother know how often your son wakes up at night?  I'm assuming you told her, that your mother doesn't witness it firsthand.  If your mother harps on these kind of issues, you may want to omit this kind of information from her.  For example, if she asks "how did the baby sleep last night"  just say "fine" and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!!|`|hoXKLSenaa	"I appreciate your advice and concern, Mom, but this is my child, and this is how I will be raising my child." End of story. I believe you will need to be straight-forward and blunt.. try your hardest not to cry and be emotional when you talk to her.. this shows vulnerability and may make her think that if she persists, she will break you and you'll do as she says. You need to take a stand for yourself, your husband and your child... sorry Mom, you already had your chance raising a child, my turn! She is your Mom, she has the right to give advice, but you are an adult and its your child, so you have the right to now follow her advice.

QbVefoq2aa	Sex is fine throughout the whole of pregnancy and is recommended UNLESS your doctor says otherwise.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine.|`|kprKXEOSaa	In most cases it is safe to have intercourse up until the baby is born.  If you're three months along, you need to start seeing a doctor, they will monitor your pregnancy and can answer any questions you have.  They can treat the UTI, too.  |`|elVDYy7eaa	Yes it's fine, as long as you feel comfortable with it.|`|w693yaMlaa	Sex when pregnant in fine and fun ... just not in the last month.  <br>  <br>  Reduce your exposure to urininary track infection by dringing cranberry 4 ounces of cranberry juice every day.  Get the real stuff, not the cocktail.  You can mix it with orange juice to sweeten it up a bit.  Also, clean up before and after sex.|`|hCgTGDR8aa	i don't know about the UTI, but my doctor told us it's ok up until the water breaks. THey recommend you use a condom toward the end.<br>  <br>  Depending on your pregnancy, they might restrict you towards the end. Something about how orgasms can induce contractions. <br>  <br>  We haven't been given the "NO" and i'm due next month.<br>  <br>  So again, other that the UTI i think you should be fine to get your freak on. Your best bet is to ask your doctor/midwife at your next appointment. |`|onkUcy19aa	It is okay to have sex in pregnancy for as long as women do not feel any discomfort or cramps. In fact, some women would do it even up to the nine months of pregnancy. But to be safe on your part, you should see your doctor for a more thorough advice on the matter.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|d7AaiXnRaa	Sex is fine so long as you dont get any cramping, abdominal pain or discomfort.<br>  <br>  You should see your doctor soon it is very important to get regular check ups while you are pregnant|`|j9DTANIwaa	Sex is absolutely fine when your pregnant,if anything you should do it all the way to the end of your pregnancy, nothing will happen to bub dont worry the bub is too far up for any damage to occur. However if you still have a urinary tract infection dont have sex until it is gone and make sure you drink a alot of water to avoid it from coming back.|`|vJWyNAZNaa	I've had several UTIs since the start of this pregnancy and my advice would be to wear a condom during sex until the infection is cleared up completely otherwise you will be just passing the infection back and forth.<br>  <br>  UTIs can cause preterm labour so its something you'd wanna see your doc about.<br>  <br>  When i was 8 wks pregnant i was told i was at higher risk of miscarraige because of my UTIs.<br>  <br>  Empty your bladder straight after sex and drink plenty of water throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|QIc0Uaq6aa	hi according to me first of all u should consult a doctor abt ur urinary track infections n if not it may even go to the baby becoming a problen for him
1cb9d97fc5fdf9070b04aad8d907f1fcaa	He should be fine. If he is hungry feed him. That really sounds normal to me...good luck|`|69DjSUVAaa	that sounds about right. He would let you know if he wasn't getting enough.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Well, he shouldn't be getting any solids at all. 11 weeks is far too young for solid foods.  (They are usually started at around 6 months, and NEVER before 4 months.  So stop the spoon feeding.<br>  <br>  As for his formula -- if he's satisfied with what he's getting, then it's the right amount. If he seems hungry, offer more.  Anything between 24-45 ounces would be normal for this age, and he's in that range, so he's fine. |`|KL24imFBaa	if he isnt crying for more than it is enough. dont let anyone else tell you you are doing a bad job. you know your baby better than anyone else. as for spoon feeding, what are you spoon feeding? my daughter had cereal at 2 1/2 months and fruit and veggies at 3 months. my daughter never would drink as much as everyone thought she should but she didnt cry and is never hungry. take your cues from your baby. as long as he is gaining weight and your doctor doesn't have any concerns, than your son is fine.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Thats sounds good. What kind of spoon feeding is he having. He should not have any solids until 6 months. He can develope allergies, increases the risk of diabetes, and he cant properly digest solids at 11 weeks. |`|dXVA1wHDaa	Each baby is an individual.  I'd think if he's not screaming for more food then he's doing fine, I'm sure he'd let you know otherwise.|`|jgP51MlRaa	I'm sure he'll let you know if he's not getting enough :)<br>  <br>  Maj|`|LqYSWCweaa	The liquid intake seems fine because like all the other replies, each baby intakes different amounts.  However, the spoon feeding is a big concern.  11 wk old babies just don't have the digestion or reflexes to consume cereals or foods.  I know lots of people do it, but consider doing research in this area before you continue spoon feeding.  Add in another bottle feeding instead.  Or, consider dropping down the ounces per feeding, but feed him every 2 hrs instead of stretching out the feedings to every 3-4.  They still have very limited stomach capacities, but more frequent feedings will keep your little one content and happy without being overfull. |`|FLEXqVoiaa	That seems like A  LOT of food, but I breastfed so I don't know how much formula a baby would take. Also you really shouldn't be "spoon feeding" an 11 week old. Do you notice your baby throwing up a lot, or having really bad gas? You should consider taking your child to a doctor. I doubt the doctor would encourage you to "spoon-feed" your newborn baby.|`|hPIUa586aa	Yes. He'll let you know if hes not. If hes hungry he'll want to eat.
AjqO1aJgaa	Yes - she's just had the second one and is at home at the moment feeling a bit sorry for herself. Both times she's been fine on the day itself and felt ill the next day and the day after that, then been fine again.<br>  <br>  I must say, this is the jab she's had more of a reaction to than any other - and a lot of her friends missed a couple of days school after the first one too. It does seem to affect them.<br>  <br>  But just about all the women in my family die from cancer. I do not feel remotely bad putting her through a couple of days of symptoms no worse than she'd get from a virus, to protect her from what my relatives have been through.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	Heya hunni,<br>  <br>  i dnt think ur daughter will have anything 2 worry about and i think its a great idea that girls are having this vaccine. i really think it should have been offered sooner .<br>  <br>  sorry i can offer any anecdotal advice hunni but all the best and i hope all goes ok :) xxxxx|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	my daughter is only 6 so I have a few more years to go before I have to face that. Honestly, I don't think they should be forced to have it when there has not been enough studies done about the side effects or even the total effective ness of this drug. It really irritated me to know end when Gov. Perry (tx) made it mandatory for all girls to get it. There isn't enough proof on how it works for me to jeopardize my daughter like that.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter is 6, when she is older I plan on talking to her about it. I don't want her to feel like I am forcing her do it. I just like to have my daughters input on things that have anything at all to do with her.|`|w1UDuUMKaa	I only have a son who is 3 months old so I don't know about a daughter but I had mine 2 years ago and I was fine. I had to sit for about 15 minutes but after that all was well.|`|HWeajklaaa	well it wasnt my daughter it was my sister and we discontinued after the second shot. She got really sick from the second one and with further reaserch we found out that it can cause any where from a headache to i think there were a couple cases of seizuers. i dont know how common it is but we werent willing to take the risk. Personally i dont see why everyone is jumping and going for the shot, yes, yes i know it helps prevent some disease that cause cervical cancer, but it's such a new shot how does anyone know that three-five years from now they wont find a really bad long term side effect? Some medications are like that, my grandpa was given something for his heart ( yeah i know total different bracnh of medicine but still) and a few years later they told him he had to get off it becasue it had dteriated some of the musscle in his body. So you never know with new drugs on the market.|`|XqfH76PMaa	My daughter was 13 going on 14 when she had all of hers.  She has done wonderful!  No reactions or problems at all.  As a matter of fact, I do not know anyone who has had a reaction.  You have done a wonderful thing by getting her the shots.  It is called Gardasil by the way lol.  I know so many women who have contracted HPV and have had problems.  One can no longer have children (and has no children) because of the problems from HPV.  I think you did a wonderful thing!|`|GbGrS9YBaa	My little sister had hers last year. I think you have to get three follow up ones.She got it, and the HPV one at the same time.<br>  They all said it wasn't too bad, However, The girls wern't told which jab, was which but they all said one hurt more than the other. and it was always the "second one" - But yeah. She was fine!|`|OH9iAKM2aa	i am a 13 year old girl and i am refusing to get it.  my big sister (17) had hers and had a reaction, had trouble breathing and got rushed to hospital.  so i dont want to take that chance.  and i dont like needles.  but most of the people in my family that got it had a reaction.  so my chances are higher. i wont even get it at a doctor.|`|AA11333480	My dau a long way off from that, but she won't be having it, or any other vaccine they bring out.<br>  <br>  Neither of us will.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Nope.  And she will never get it for two reasons:<br>  <br>  1- There's no long term proof or study that says it does protect against HPV (not cervical cancer) and there is not enough known about the long term side effects.<br>  <br>  2- The vaccine does NOT protect against cervical cancer.  It protects against a SEXUALLY transmitted disease called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).  My daughter better not be out there having sex that young and putting herself at risk for an STD.  It's the men who carry HPV and pass it to women.  I'm going to make sure my daughter knows that there are guys out there carrying this disease and she won't know which on it is until she's already had sex and it's too late.  Condoms don't prevent that disease or most STDs.<br>  <br>  The only way to 100% effectively prevent all sexually transmitted diseases is abstinence.  And please don't tell me that's a ridiculous concept because both my husband and I were abstinent until marriage.  It takes a little something called self control.  I think more parents need to stop having the mentality of "they'll do it anyway".  I hate to burst that bubble, but I didn't "do it anyway" when my parents told me not to.  I listened to them.  Why?  Because I don't want to risk my own health or risk a pregnancy for a couple of minutes in the back seat of a car.  To me the risk was just too much for a couple minutes of pleasure.
J1stiMioaa	if you are unsure of abortion DONT DO IT! if you arent sure u will more than likely regret it. i was unsure what to do when i caught pregnant with my first son (age 21) as the father wanted nothing to do with us no matter what the decision, my son is now 7 and i dont regret keeping him. if you arent 100% then there is always adoption, which gives you the chance to meet your baby again in the future|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	i turned 20 yday and am 14weeks pregnant with an unplanned pregnancy.....i was on the pill, but it seems it didnt work for me. Its hard to accept that your pregnant to start with, and trust me its a emotional rollercoaster - but its SO worth it!!! Please dont abort your baby, its truely a gift to be pregnant!!! So may people try so hard to have a baby and dont succeed - if you arent ready to raise him/her consider adoption - there are MANY loving couples out there that would appreciate your gift!!! <br>  If you are ready to prepare to look after your baby and raise them, please do it!! Its a sucrafice but its SO SO worth it!!!<br>  <br>  Please dont abort!!|`|O7nyzkGdaa	I am 22 yers old and am 6 months preggo. I had one abortion and thought i couldnt do it again, but i regret making that decision. I am going to keep the baby but i still fight with myself about my decision. I am very lonely and depressed, people say that it changes your life, and it does, you have to be willing to give up everything, school, friends, social time, you wont have time for any of that. Im going to take care of my baby but i am too young to be in this situation, had i known what i would have felt in the long-run i may have chose differently. |`|4OUszQ6zaa	Please don't have an abortion. Please please please. If you don't want to keep the baby just give him/her up for adoption. There's lot of people that would love to raise your child. |`|3oACYNMkaa	most people are gonna tell u to not have an abortion. but the descion is yours and only yours. You have to do what you feel as though is best. I had my first daughter when i was 18, and my second when i was 21. It was very hard and it still is. I did everything backwards and out of order so now i am 25 and trying to get thru college while raising two kids. I love them and in no way regret them but looking back life would have definitly been easier if i would have finished school got a career then had the kids. Honestly, this isnt really the best place to get advice ons uch a serious situation. Sometimes the people here are judgemental, rude and just downright mean for no reason. if you cannot talk to your parents, how about a sibling, close relative or friend, and what about the father? Those are the people you need to talk about it with but remember, its YOUR LIFE and YOUR BODY. Never let anyone try to sway you to do something you dont wanna do.Good Luck!|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	My mom was 16 when she got pregnant. She was on the pill but  didn't take it the way she was supposed to and wasn't educated enough on what would happen if I didn't use it correctly. Her parents made her have an abortion. Every time I think about this it makes me wonder what my brother or sister would be like, would it change my life, and if it made my mom any different. I believe that you should keep your child. I realize that it is not the best timing and it was unplanned. But ask anyone and MOST people are going to tell you that you are never completely emotionally or financially ready to have a child. God gave you a child because thats what is meant to be. <br>  <br>  I planned this pregnancy. My husband and I thought we were ready, and then when i found out I was scared to death. I'm 23 and I do have a stable job and I have a good home life to give to my child. But there are still months when we are stretched to the limit.<br>  <br>  I also met my husband when i was 20 and still in school and I took on the role of mother to his son who is now 4. It was difficult for us to juggle a child, school and work. But we did it. And there are so many places that can help you until you are on your feet. I never wanted to be on welfare and never thought I would be but I went through a period of time where I was, and now that I have done it I'm paying it back by being financially responsible and taking care of my own.<br>  <br>  I know you are scared, but think of this child as a blessing. I don't know a single parents who says that they regret their child, but Iknow plenty who regret NOT having their child. Good luck sweetie and I will be praying for you.|`|30d204f57085b8b67d534a885d3a40dcaa	Well, I am going to give it to you honestly, and without a pro-life approach.  I find it much crueler to have a baby that you will resent or not love (and it happens all the time) than to have an abortion early on.<br>  <br>  If you feel like a baby is going to ruin your life and keep you from doing the things that you want, or if you feel like you'll resent a baby or ignore the baby, or leave the baby with your parents all the time, then you might think about abortion.<br>  <br>  If you go before 9 weeks, I think, you can get the medication abortion.  It costs the same, I think, as a surgical abortion, but you just take some pills and you cramp a little and bleed.  It's less traumatic and feels more natural then a medication abortion.  <br>  <br>  I got married at 18 and pregnant at 19.  I had my son and it's exactly what I wanted to do.  But, everyone is different.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, you have to make the decision that you feel you can live with.|`|0ekwnHZAaa	I'm 21 and when I first found out that I'm pregnant I was seriously thinking about abortion. In the end I knew I couldn't get rid of the baby, as I didn't want to go through life thinking my baby could have been whatever age by now. I'm at university so it wasn't a decision I took lightly. I too was aware of all the pros and cons, and I had to go with my heart, even though my head was saying that I might not cope at times. I'm just now concentrating on my growing baby and every time I feel him/her kick, I can't help but smile, especially when it happens during a boring lecture!<br>  I hope you come to the right decision for you.<br>  Best of luck <br>  x|`|fq2qwu94aa	it really is up to you! no one can tell you what to do! but think of it...your baby didnt ask to be put inside of you at this time of your life!all this baby deserves is a life of his/her own and you have the power to create or destroy!<br>  |`|846dea7801aa96951a367fa9bd77cfbbaa	I would advise against abortion, it's very hard. And you won't forget u did that. You won't be the first or last, talk to your parents, please, please! If anything you can give the baby for adoption.|`|NPSRTGibaa	It is your choice! Don't let anyone persuade you in what to do with you body!  You need to go talk to someone at clinic to better advise in in a situation like this. |`|8nQaIcq9aa	i wish some people would just pi$$ off when it comes to their veiws on abortion, who cares what a bunch of strangers think about it. <br>  <br>  Good on you for education youself.<br>  <br>  Assuming you have yahoo send me a PM to mizzdani89. <br>  <br>  I'm 19 and i have a 2yr old son, I have also had an abortion and 2 miscarriages. I'm sure i can be of some assistance.|`|UY5anDNRaa	I wouldn't get an abortion. I just found out that i'm pregnant too. I'm 25 an this is my first. I'm also in school for my associates degree.  I also work 3rd shift as a CNA. I'm keeping my baby and that's because i have my family to help me when i need it. But it's all up to you on what you want to do. If you choose to give up your baby would you want to be in the child's life? If so that's called an open adoption where you get to choose the family and you decide if you want to be in the childs life or not. There is two ways to adoption that was just one. I don't want to scare you just some advice or shall i say my opinion. Good Luck and I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do!
sZ90OTRFaa	...i'm your age and my mom lets me go to my boyfriend's house.<br>  <br>  but don't use the word boyfriend when you ask.<br>  <br>  ex. mom, can i go to steven's house?<br>  <br>  instead of "can i go to my boyfriend's house?"|`|CCSwrKIoaa	Geez.

You're the model child. :)<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask your mom. She's been 15, too. Introducing her to your boyfriend's parents would help tremendously. That's my best advice, for her to trust his parents! Maybe invite HIM over to meet her so she can come to trust him as well. |`|BuUvFx9saa	my mom has let me go to my boyfriends house as long as she has met them and is fine with it and everything and i was 14 when this started just ask her just be like hey mom this weekend i was just wondering if me and _____ could hang out like at his house. and tell her that his mom will be there and stuff.|`|cQ1LfJb8aa	First of all you should be honest with your mom right away. That is the best way to earn her trust. Let the moms and everybody meet. Than make sure there is always an adult around when your in a home. Temptation is very hard to resist espeacially when there is alot of alone time. Becareful but have fun.|`|sOfbda7Daa	Ask, have fun, just don't do anything you'd regret. Stay out of closed rooms, and stay away from bedrooms if you're skeptical about his hormones and control of, especially the first few times you go over there. Establish your boundaries, and you'll be fine. |`|MSNaTuGhaa	I think as long as your mom knows who he is and she is okay with you hanging out with him she should let you. especially if you wont be home alone. I dont think there is anything wrong with that at all!!! <br>  Just ask! It will be fine!! Whats the worst that that could happen? it cant be that bad.|`|tJu2OEfkaa	I'm no parent, but I'm not sure why you wouldn't just ask your mom anyways?  What's the worst that could happen if you try and ask?  She says no?  It's not like she's going to say, "Of course not!  You can never see that boy again!!  EVER!".  Just talk with her and see what she says.  |`|HCKlLUQRaa	Has your  mom met his mom yet? That may help the situation but you have nothing to lose by asking.

She doesnt like to be in my business. She would just probably want to meet his mom first and have an emergency phone number but everything else should be fine.|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	i wouldnt be comfortable with it, id probably call his mom first, talk to her about it, then if its okay, id drop you off there, personally talk to his mother to ensure she will be there at all times and know what kind of things she allows in her house.  you guys are really young, and inexperienced, and havent been together for very long.|`|fDbNb6h1aa	I would try to make it as casual as possible.  If I were a parent of a 15 year old (my kids are young) I would look at it as a friend's house you were going over to.  I would want to meet the boy's parents and see what they are like.

wBpennsMaa	In my case I won't be having another child due to pregnancy complications I have. If you are even thinking about having another baby I would keep the clothes and diapers, but I either have rummage sales and make money off of them or donate them to mothers to be in need.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I save my favorite outfits and  donate the rest to our local women's shelter. I get the tax write off, they get nice barely used clothing.<br>  <br>  |`|p2Njf5gBaa	I am keeping most of my outgrown baby clothing for now, I stored it all in rubbermaid totes in my basement.  I have given a few items out to a few friends who where in need some things that didn't really have a lot of money to spend.  I was given a lot of newborn diapers and my son only fit into them for about the first week.  I hung onto then for a while.... but recently gave them to a friend of mine who just had a baby.  Diapers can get old and brittle if they sit around for too long.  <br>  I would say hand onto some baby clothes so you don't have to go re buy everything in the future.  As far as diapers.... give them to someone you know that is expecting.... and if you don't know anyone who is expecting donate them to your local women's shelter.... and some food pantry's also will except things like that to give away to new mothers.  |`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	I've donated some of her outgrown clothing to Goodwill. I kept a some of the neutral pieces in case we have another baby someday, as well as some of my favorite pieces just as a keepsake. I say keep some and give some away. That way you don't end up storing so much stuff, but you do still have some if you have another baby sooner or later.|`|308cb6bcf0531e27237a2cb393891091aa	I just bought a 252 pack of size 1 diapers for my daughter and only use about 50 or so and she's outgrown it. I am about to give it to a family who just had a baby, since the other 200 are still in platic wrappers..<br>  <br>  The clothes that she has outgrown or not worn I will donate to the church who can give it families who can not afford to buy a lot of clothes...|`|pXSKSS3daa	If you have the room store them, especially if they are new. As far as diapers go some stores will allow you to exchange them for a bigger size, if not opened. <br>  <br>  We have kept most of Noah's clothing in a tote in our storage room upstairs. It's out of the way and we'll be ready if we have another boy. Of course we want to TTC next year sometime so it's in the near future for us.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	With the newborn diapers (everyone went waaaaay overboard with the newborn size. He would have been wearing newborn diapers until he was two) I gave them to a friend that was having a baby. With his clothes I take them to a baby second hand store and trade them in for money.|`|Ouhzs81kaa	I have saved all the clothes. We hope to have another one in the next two years. I have packed them away in plastic totes and organized to size. If you don't want to keep the clothes you can always look for mom 2 mom sales and sell them. <br>  <br>  The left over diapers I have taken to the church. They put it in there cupboard, for a needy baby could use them. They have a cupboard that if you are needy you can go and get food and Hygiene products. I did the same with the first foods I never opened.|`|sycgY17taa	There were 3-4 women having babies a couple months after mine was born.  I gave some of the clothes and diapers to them.  I still have a huge pile of clothes that he can no longer wear.  I plan to sell them at a flea market for $1-$5.  Some of the clothes he has never worn or only wore maybe 2 times.  Some of my "myspace.com" mommies set up a page to sell their items.  I thought of that but don't want to deal with shipping etc.  <br>  <br>  Now with the clothes for his size now, I don't take the tags off until he is going to wear it and I keep the receipts.  Just in case he doesn't wear some items I can take them back for bigger clothing.  |`|c9387f79b14133134f45bd7ea7546614aa	You can <br>  <br>  1.  Pass them on to a family member or friend who is expecting.<br>  <br>  2. Keep them for when you have a friend or family member expecting.<br>  <br>  3. Donate them to a thrift store or other charity<br>  <br>  4.  If you have some time and energy... sell them on Ebay.  Baby clothes sell pretty well...especially if they are like new or new...and if they are good brands.  If you don't know how ... .I suggest buying the book Ebay for Dummies.  Careful though..once the money starts coming in it's highly addictive. : )|`|isokr9cfaa	I'm saving them. Luckily for me, my kids are really close in age so I didn't have to store them for a long time. Just get a big box and put them in a closet. You'll be happy you held on to them! After you're done having kids there are a lot of consignment stores that give you money for baby clothes and furniture, I plan on selling my stuff once I'm done with it or give it to someone who needs it.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	The diapers I passed on to a friend whose SIL has a baby a couple months younger than my son.  The clothes that I liked I kept and they are in our storage building...the clothes that I didn't like I just bagged up and took to goodwill.|`|iQjS2lJ4aa	I gave some away to charity, but I kept some too, they were like new, I still have them and probably will sell them when I get round to it!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I am saving all of my baby clothing and every because I know I want another one sometime :)|`|4ZnrBThaaa	Save the clothes. YOu can always use them later for another child or give them to a family member or neighbor that knows you. As for the diapers, local shelters are in MAJOR need of diapers and formula. They really could careless if the package is open. I have 4 firends in my neighborhood all having abbies within the next 3 months. I have already given them the extra diapers my daughter has outgrown, and given a few items of clothing that she never wore to them. At least when they people are close to you, you get the see the use of the clothing and diapers you spent money on.|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	I have two cousins on the way so I gave diapers and other stuff to them. I haven't given away my clothes-though I doubt I will. I plan on having a yard sale next spring. I'm going to sale clothes/shoes, swing, and activity toys. If I don't have a yard sale, I'll sale them to a consignment store. I'm going to keep outfits I like. I'm not worry about having clothes for my next baby. |`|AA11119024	i would keep the clothes for at least a year because a lot of people get pregnant again within a year of their first!    but if you don't plan on having one for a long time and are taking the proper precautions  then you could always donate them to a pregnancy center that helps mothers less fortunate!!   especially diapers!!  every new mother could use diapers!!|`|DmpFFcoBaa	i have all the outgrown clothes in a storage bin im hesitant to give them away or sell them. i just cant part with them. as for the diapers we dont have any diapers that she hasnt used. she goes thru them like nothing|`|AA11483331	You can either list on <br>  <a href="http://www.craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.com</a> <br>  or <br>  <a href="http://www.freebabyhandmedowns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.freebabyhandmedowns.com</a><br>  <br>  on either site you can sell, trade or give away for free.|`|MzgsGAXyaa	You can either save them, or find a store that buys used baby products for cash or sell them on the internet on craigslist. Good luck.|`|5kAJSSxNaa	Sell them online on ebay. People actually buy them because they know no one will sell things bad for a baby. And also it's practically new since babys grow so fast.
mzRSO802aa	With your first pregnancy your breasts will start to be sore at about 4 to 6 weeks and continue for about 2 to 3 months.  Your breasts have never functioned before so they are going through a lot of changes so that they'll be ready when the baby's born.  You will notice that they will become larger and to reduce stretch marks use vitamin E lotion on them.  <br>  <br>  With your future pregnancies you won't experience this - it's generally just with the first pregnancy.  |`|5f7c3bdd057cf8e6f77aeb4f3ecc6155aa	Mine became sore before I even knew I was pregnant (both pregnancies). In fact, that was one of the ways i discovered i might be pregnant. <br>  |`|DcffYZo5aa	mine started with my first about 6-8 weeks than hurt till like 5 mths seriously ....with my second (my current preg) my breasts never hurt ....every one is differnet|`|XqfH76PMaa	It is different in every person.

sjlQj4ihaa	This guy is messed up. Don't feel bad at all for not picking up. Just be straight forward with him and say "I don't want you calling me anymore." Then don't pick up when it's him. If he tries your home phone just tell your parents to  say "She doesn't want you to call anymore." If he keeps calling put your parents and his parents on the phone together and have your parents explain that his obsessive calling has got to stop or you are going to report him to the police. Good luck with this creep. |`|ulB8zopsaa	you have every right toi not pick up the phone. tell him VERY nicely that he's bothersome and that you dont like him and that you should be friends. you've gotta tell him sometime or else he wont stop calling|`|GD2ykHkwaa	Just block his phone number and then it wont come through, or tell him your parents took your phone cuz you got in trouble for something and your dad has it then maybe he will be scared to call|`|A4S8CW4gaa	That happened to one of my friends. The guy called her 2 times a day and just told her random facts about himself. I would just stop answering...he'll get it eventually, and if he doesn't and worst comes to worst...change your cell number. And don't feel guilty...he's the one causing the problem.|`|etWY35Z8aa	Okay, well Don't turn off your phone.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt have to turn off your phone to avoid someone, they should just leave u the hellz alone!!!<br>  <br>  And you should obviously just be real with the kid, tell him u really aren't that into him! Basically, tell him to lay off!!! <br>  <br>  And oh, the last resource would be blocking his number, because it sounds like if you did that, he would just start texting/writing-you-notes/ . . . and u can't really get outta things like that! so just tell him like it is! =]<br>  <br>  <3|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	Block his number. I had the same thing with me with a guy on Facebook. Wrote me like 10 times a day and would have a fit if I didn't respond to everything.<br>  <br>  Tell him he calls you too much. Just tell him the truth.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I had this same problem with a boy that would call all the time.<br>  At first I picked up, but I didn't like him, so I felt it would be WORSE to lead him on by answering than by ignoring the calls. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way-by answering, you are giving him false hope that you like him. He will get over it eventually, and it's better for him to gradually stop calling than by you telling him outright that you don't like him.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	So if its not on your homephone, say that you have limited minutes. This guy is CRAZY about you, obviously.<br>  <br>  Turn off your phone allot, like at night, so you wont get annoyed. dont call lhim back. |`|a6ed7acf264e14fc00a9f345b6f76010aa	your right. thats a bit creepy of him. just ignore him on the phone. if you see him in school, be nice, say hi and whatever, but dont give him the wrong impressions, he might think you like him|`|yV8fog7Paa	If you don't want to pick up don't pick up. I rarely pick up my phone.|`|xst7KYQ3aa	This is a case of stalking, and it needs to be stopped now.Tell him in a text to not call you again, or you will take legal action.  Save all his texts to you, and ignore him when he calls. You can put a block on him, and hope that helps.  I'd also suggest you get your parents involved, and explain what is going on.  If he uses voice mail, save all of those calls too.  Your parents can take legal action, including a TRO (temporary restraining order) or an OFP (order for protection).  Stalking you is a crime, and this is clearly a stalking case.  It also might be good for your parents to answer the phone the next time he calls.  You can also ask your parents to call HIS parents, and let them know what their son is doing, and also that they are responsible for his behavior, as he is a minor, and they will take legal action if it's needed.  That should cool his jets.
wOLdIZRbaa	Yes. And enjoy, pregnant sex is awesome.|`|zNhChOvpaa	you can have sex throughout the entire pregnancy, its actually good for you when your pregnant.|`|d7AaiXnRaa	Yes so long as it is with the same partner or you have protected sex so you don't expose yourself and the baby to harmful STD's/STI's|`|WaU0hmD5aa	yes sex is fine while pregnant unless the dr. says different so enjoy yourself and go for it and God bless you|`|QczEdd5qaa	yeah.<br>  <br>  you just won't have to use a birth-control method because you're already pregnat|`|44QPXU5eaa	yes|`|mVBiDv6laa	Hell yea!! u can even have it when ur huge and prego!|`|ltjf2OkYaa	no, it will kill you and the baby|`|ugg33CM1aa	nope no sex untill six weeks after birth.lol|`|XqfH76PMaa	Um, yes.

Of course, my phone calls don't tend to be lengthy.<br>  <br>  2) I almost always go to the bathroom alone without being disturbed while in there.<br>  <br>  3) I don't watch television, but I read news online and do Bible reading, and they don't interrupt to often.  We really encourage our children to learn to entertain themselves, and having multiple siblings helps.<br>  <br>  4) I almost always drink hot tea in its entirety.<br>  <br>  5)  I do usually have my hair drawn back in a ponytail with a fat clip.

VMASMHX6aa	The BEST way to get a stash of ramekins in your life is to buy those lovely Gu and Fru puddings from the supermarket which come in glass ramekins. That way you get a scrummy pudding for you, and a ramekin to put your baby's food in. I've got loads of them and use them all the time - freeze them, microwave them, put them in the dishwasher, they are great.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you can buy ramekins from anywhere that sells kitchenwear - Wollies, Sainsburys. But for another 50p, you could get a chocolate pudding in one!|`|56216275babe93f0f69ad2124d3724deaa	ramekins can be bought in most places, try argos for example - they are mostly the same size so dont worry about getting specifically her ones.
etWY35Z8aa	okay here are some tips : <br>  <br>  * if you cut of the friendship now, things will only get worse,<br>    from how u describe her she is troubled, so breaking off<br>    your friendship will only send her spiraling downward.<br>  <br>  * show her love! she really needs it. she needs to know <br>    she can deal without having to use. don't give up on her, <br>    support her, that's what bff's do. and she needs it. <br>  <br>  <br>  and the rest is up to her, rehab/changing/ext. is really more for people that WANT it, more-so than people who NEED it. she needs the drive and will-power to go through with it. <br>  <br>  she has to realize she can be more than this to be helped.<br>  <br>  keep encouraging her, things will change. . . =]|`|DOWwk7Gfaa	Sit down and talk with her about it<br>  Or get a trusted adult to say something<br>  Get her into therapy, anything you can do to help her|`|c612db5f7eaf689dc523cb1c679189e1aa	sometimes you just cant help people that dont want help. i learned it the hard way but all you can really do is love her and be her friend and let her suffer to consequences of her actions. That means stop bailing her out. to stay in jail will do her a world of good.|`|aYnduRsxaa	This might sound bad and I'll probably get thumbs down for this, but next time she ends up in the detention center, don't bail her out. If you don't bail her out, she might actucally get some help with professionals. |`|ZEO7RhGzaa	You need to stop being friends with this girl, honestly- maybe it will help her come to her senses.  Tell her you don't need that influence in your life and if she wants to better herself, then to come talk to you. You've been friends for 7 years, maybe her best friend leaving her because of her selfish ways, will help her realize she's being dumb.<br>  <br>  Sleeping around is never good, especially unprotected and that young- she IS going to wind up pregnant if she keeps that up.  It will suck, because the baby will have a 14 year old druggie alcoholic mom.  No one deserves that.<br>  <br>  And of course her dad kicks her out, she's a whore and on drugs.  A good parent wouldn't, but if she cared soo much she would respect him and stop what she's doing.|`|qBeUdSJEaa	Is tht person jazmine? cause the jazmine i kno has the same excat problem<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081107125345AAgL2yc">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|50054aee173e5405ede8ebfa95e6cc24aa	dont stop being friends with her at times like this she needs friends the most sit her down and tell her straight up how it is and how u feel maybe she doesnt understand what she is doing to herself or the effects that it could have on her there is also probably something else such as family or the need for males attention behind this so be supportive and if u cant get through to her just tell her hey im trying to be her for you alright i am ur friend and so when u finally realize wat ur doing to urself i'll b there for u and in the meantime i'll be waiting<br>  <br>  yeah she'll prolly get mad but hey she will think about it and if she is willing to give up ya'lls friendship so be it ive been there and she will need u and when she does just give her a hug as much as u wana yell at her dont as much as u want to say i told u so dont because she needs u wheither or not she shows it|`|58eHufb3aa	No do not cut off the friendship she needs someone who cares about her in her life. If you leave it'd get much worse. The best thing a friend can do in this situation is get her help; tell a counselor have an intervention or something. |`|d2aV5NTdaa	That girls family and you into counseling now. She can only stop when she wants to. Show her risks and now that shes doing it. Intervention. EVERYTHING. This girl is going to die if you don't stop her and you may be her only hope.
AA11672364	"I know how it feels just to want other people's opinions, thoughts and support"    Do you?  <br>  Most people understand that they need medical attention when they ask those questions and most people understand that the people asking these questions need to be comforted.  There's a major difference between medical and emotional support...especially for women.  We need other women to share their experiences and offer support.  <br>  <br>  Why do people ask these questions on YA: "Why do people ask these questions on YA: Am I pregnant?  Am I having a miscarriage?"  Your question seems ridiculous to me...much more ridiculous than the questions you are so concerned with!|`|0aecoqSZaa	LOL I did this when I went into labor with my last one in January. Although mine wasn't completely dangerous. I just thought my water broke, so I got on YA to kill some time and ask if maybe it sounded like my water broke before I left to go to the hospital, just to be tested and told that I peed myself. Turns out my water DID break, and I gave birth 4 hours later. But I'm stoked on the miscarriage one. I don't get that either. If my pregnancy was in harms way, I'd do whatever I could to stop it including calling an ambulance if I couldn't move from the pain. (I have had a miscarriage, but was told it was too late before I even started bleeding.)|`|DzHOggxsaa	Some are too scared to buy a test or see a doctor so tey come here to see if there is someone that would know. I'm not really sure why they would ask things like that either. Some of them are fakes. Like the "10 years old and pregnant" ones. Someone just looking for attention. But as for the others, i'm unsure.|`|fIkNVwsDaa	Well for me, im not too sure whats going on, im not asking if im prego or if i Had miscarried, but im wondering if it is normal to be experiencing the problems im having. The dr doesn't know yet. I just want to see if anyone had a similar problem|`|zknBAdilaa	Well i though that's what a thing like this is for to ask question this is a free world we can ask what we wont if you don't like it don't read it |`|Tq9tRUzsaa	Last time i checked people ask what they want if you don't want to answer the question the worry about what people writing they just want other opinions... |`|JI39pz2faa	Some people crave attention and are overly dramatic, while others are too scared to find out. I think asking those types of questions gives the "asker" a sense of hope. |`|YtSCHIVaaa	My favorite of the week was "I just had sex yesterday, Am I pregnant?" <br>  hahah <br>  |`|AA10516678	Because they don't have no life!!!!!|`|0YtO73Wyaa	Well, as one who has asked the question "Could I be pregnant?" on this site, I would have to say it is because we are hoping to find some "answers" to keep us otherwise occupied until we can figure out the real one.  I'm not due at the doctor's for another week and my hpt's have been consistently inconsistent (if that makes any sense).  So, I'm curious if anyone has anything helpful to say.  Playing the waiting game doesn't really suit me, since I tend to go a little nuts, especially over something as huge as a potential pregnancy.   <br>  <br>  I can't really speak for anyone else but myself here, but I don't expect anyone to give me a solid take-it-to-heart answer.  Unless you're a liscenced doctor, I'm certainly not going to just go on your word.  Most of the time when a person posts a queston like that it is because in place of an actual answer, they are more than likely seeking simple advice.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yep, you'd think so.|`|vpL67nETaa	Because this is yahoo answers, and they are asking a valid question, unlike this rant disguised as a question.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sure, it may not be the brightest question, but women are concerned.<br>  <br>  Especially women who think they might be losing their baby, and want to get advice from others who have had a similiar experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have some compassion|`|AA11380378	This Y! answers, not Y! Rants<br>  <br>  People sometimes are just too anxious and want people's opinion. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it's too early to have a pregnancy test and getting an appointment with your OB can take a week or more! <br>  <br>  I see no harm in asking if you are pregnant on the pregnancy section of a forum called Yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  Gee, take a chill pill|`|IllWKAUGaa	yea i hear ya...take a f*cking test...i dont have x-ray vision! and what really gets me is when people say "PREGNATE" or when people ask a question when it is sooooooooooooo easy to search the question and get a billion results for it....some people just dont think...|`|Bw18seFqaa	Most of these questions are probably asked by teenage girls who are too scared to go to their parents to ask about a Dr.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I wonder the same thing sometimes but I just try to help as best as I can because I'm only online so what else can I do. |`|joPJtKemaa	I agree, people ask these questions like we would actually know. Also the question that gets me the most is "Should I take a pregnancy test?" Why the heck not if you think you are. Sometimes I think if the questions are for real or people just make up crap because they r bored.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	The Am I pregnant questions should go in TTC not here... I see them all day and some days I want to just answer " Take a F%^%&* test" but instead I ignore them. And for the fools who ask Am I having a miscarriage if you are having signs why get on the net instead of going to the ER? |`|FvonW0Gmaa	I mean the section is here to get advice about pregnancy, so people can ask whatever they want.  Doesn't mean you have to answer it.  I just skip over them after a while.  |`|w0eRRsoVaa	I've wondered the same thing for quite some time.  I am not a psychic.  It's as easy as calling your doc's office to find out.|`|WmNcnUmlaa	I agree.  I would not ask those questions on here.|`|YpgoGNuXaa	Well you are being rude. Because they aren't sure! DUH!|`|G4qP2gATaa	I dont know. |`|pvjEOGtOaa	i cant answer your stup!d question.
XgHwa7YBaa	YES, hon, they DO!  If you don't believe our loving/cuddling makes a HUGE impact, just go on-line and read the nightmarish stories about orphan children who are NOT held and cuddled.  <br>  <br>  They stop crying, because they learn there is no use.  It gets them NOTHING.  They become anti-social, have much slower learning abilities, and have a much higher risk for mental/emotional problems throughout life.<br>  <br>  A nurtured child excells by FAR the child that is ignored, and left in front of the TV.<br>  <br>  You will be ASTOUNDED at how quickly your child begins to respond to your face and voice.  And the first time he says "I love you" your heart will melt like warm butter on a hot day, and you will NEVER be the same again!|`|daBtvDv7aa	i know how u feel i have a 2 week old and just came back from the hospital with a uti.. i was there for 3 days and cried since i miss her sooo much.. and kept thinking she just wants food not me.. like when they grow older they say mommy and i miss mommy now its just food.. but im just happy im with her |`|69DjSUVAaa	i am sure they do. they love a big cuddle like the rest of us.|`|F63yZgkRaa	oh yes def they know from the day they pop out.Ive had 3 happy babies so far and ive also looked after another one since he was just over a year old as his mum past away from cancer when he was around 9months,from that 9 months he was brought up with misery around him and he bacame a very agressive unhappy baby(at that age so quick) he was very spoilt by everyone to because of the circumstances and that didnt help but obv none of it his fault.It normally goes to prove if your happy,your babies happy.Yours is old enough now  to get cuddled and kissed and told hes loved,,,so go for it and enjoy.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	aww hunni, of course he does, he knows who is mommy and daddy are and he knows they love him.<br>  <br>  they are more perceptiive than we think, how many times do babies who are held by people the parent sdnt really like and cried? or even better threw up on them lol xxxx<br>  <br>  glad everythings ok hunni xxxx|`|y0Z8AtRuaa	you sound like such a beautiful mother! im sure your bubs know exactly how much u love him! its a spiritual connection i think!<br>  <br>  go get some sleep - you will need it for the day ahead! lol<br>  <br>  take care |`|Sn14yI57aa	oh how wonderfull, of course they know. you sound like a great mum.|`|2NxBl4t9aa	I think they do becasue you can see the difference from a baby that is loved on lots to a baby that is just given the minimal care! Baby's that are loved on lots tend to develop better and cue/smile more! Don't worry about the sleep thing unless your like me and can't sleep very well!  I'm expecting and am 35 weeks and I think he knows hes loved even though he's not born! LOL, I love to sing to him and I talk to him! They say that he will recognize my voice and might even remember the lullaby's I've been singing to him! Well i don't have very many more weeks to go to find out!I can't wait! He's loved and I think he knows he is! Good luck!|`|GPeYqjbBaa	Babies do feel love when they are cuddled knowing that that motherly instinct is there.for them All baby animals seek mothers around them for comfort,safety and assurance,as well as knowing they will be fed.It may not be love as you know it know,but they are content being with mother Great when they grow up and smile at you,sit on your knee and fall asleep holding your hand.|`|MEVg0LBGaa	i asked this aaaages ago. and like you, i was tired and philosiphising lol.<br>  <br>  i think sophie knows that she is my favourite person in the owrld and that she is always smiling makes me happy that she is happy and thats good enough for me.<br>  <br>  someone once said to me, all babies know is love, until they are shown differently. so if all i show her is love, then im happy that im a good parent.|`|7DiL2Cwaaa	Of course they do, thats why when they are crying and they feel the warmth of your body when you cuddle them, they stop crying.<br>  Our baby boy is 9 months old and is always smiling because he has never seen an angry face, which is how we always want it to be !|`|PPk0ahMFaa	Definitely!<br>  <br>  And how wonderful you'll find it when he can show and tell you back! My daughter is now 2 and says 'I love you mummy, do you love me?' lol<br>  <br>  Its so heartwarming - you have SO much to look forward to! :D|`|IDS64Eh8aa	I sure hope so because I'm holding my sleeping 4 month old right now (wouldn't sleep in her cot, pram, swing, on the sofa etc.) and my arms are killing me, lol! |`|3c30aa4263d27ab6160b3aeeb8b23303aa	im positive they know :)<br>  <br>  its a spiritual thing i think|`|hSaLWg74aa	i think they do... Babies are magical things :) lol |`|YaYrbyNMaa	Yes. I have a daughter and as a baby, I could always tell she was happiest with the people that loved her. At that stage, love to them is security and stability and a positive voice; if you're that force in their lives consistently, yes, they know they're loved.|`|XqfH76PMaa	I believe that they know that they are being loved.  But, I don't think our children ever understand how much we truly love them because I do not think that there are the right words or enough time to express that love to them.  It is wonderful, isn't it?|`|ARa39UvEaa	Yes. They do know. Babies are not completly stupid. And even if they do not know that it means you love them, by giving hugs and kisses, they will love you, cos they like it. |`|Icr6IIyYaa	of course they do <br>  <br>  they don't know the WORD love but they definitely know the emotion<br>  they feel it and they give it in the best way they know how<br>  <br>  |`|Zh3rgkUCaa	yes the more skin to skin contact and hugs they have the more the nerve endings in their brain connect. So they do and physically they flourish.|`|QJ17P0DOaa	i really hope so.i think they feel secure anyways which is the beginning of loving feelings i hope xxx<br>

AA10167940	Do you have friends or family that could help out now and again?  It sounds like you could use a holiday all to your self-|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Sounds to me like you are coping quite remarkably.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	YOU ARE FABULOUS!!!  I don't know how you do it.  <br>  God gave you these little ones because He knew there was no one on this EARTH that could handle them as well as you do.  My hats off to you!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Well, it's too late to not have so many kids, so you'll just have to make the best of what you've got. The one who's out of the house needs to take responsibility for himself or help out with the younger kids if he needs money; that might give you some me time away from the house. The seventeen year old needs to know she has your respect and give you some, too, refering to her as a ***** doesn't really make me feel sympathy for you there. Your 9 year old needs regular therapy and medication and possibly hospitalization. You and your kids obviously need to learn to work together and a little one on one counseling for you wouldn't hurt. Quit looking at other people and what you don't have and focus on what you do. |`|CxCigxZIaa	WOW!<br>  You deserve the MOTHER OF THE CENTURY award!<br>  Those kids have no idea how LUCKY they are. However they will...<br>  As for your social life ... it must be hard on YOU to not have the time, energy or the money to just go and play bingo for a few hours. Perhaps you could "treat" yourself once a month to a few hours out. Even if it's just shopping. You need some "me" time (that's what I call it) Go get a pedicure/manicure or set up a time for you and a friend to just go have lunch. |`|Oa5i93zfaa	First of all, you are brilliant!!!!!<br>  <br>  You work VERY hard at being their mother and you deserve some "you" time. Usually it's hard to take time out for yourself when you have children so try taking a nice warm bath and maybe going to a candle store and buying some incense. Try creating something like maybe taking family pictures and making a scrapbook. It doesn't have to be finished in one day. This will relax you. Maybe the kids would like to help put some pictures in it, or even draw some pictures for it. Anything so you can relax and still have something to show for it. Sometimes it's about simplifying everything when you have kids. ;)<br>  <br>  And don't stress about the 19 year old. Everyone is having financial problems right now. At least he is trying to give you a break by moving out. You have so much on your plate, that at least, he is trying to be responsible...<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|gRvHucPPaa	You are awesome!  I know alot of single parents with one or two kids that don't cope as nearly as well as you do.  Just make sure you make time for yourself, weather its for an hour or two. Take a long hot bath, leave the house for a while to socialize, just don't feel guilty for doing it.  It'll make you alot happier and calmer person..  Good luck on a job well done. You are most certainly loaded with patience.|`|okh3hL8taa	Number one, stop helping the adult child financially.   He is an adult and it is time he grew up and stopped being depend ant upon his parents.  As for the other ones...it was your choice to bring them into this world if you wanted a social life you shouldn't have chosen to have that many children.
YJNql5Mgaa	I waited 2 weeks after my period was late.  I'd already suffered through 10 months of negatives and late periods so I waited extra long.  But finally! :-D|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honestly, I waited until 40 days from my last period, because it was an accident and I wasn't trying to get pregnant. Thought mine was just late.|`|AA10516678	Well with my first child I didn't take a pregnanc test because I had morning sickness and didn't think anything of it. I thought I had food poisoning so went into the doctor and they told me I was pregnant. With this pregnancy it was planned so I waited until I missed my period because I knew my last period and calculated when it was going to be next period and when that time came I didn't have a period. So went ahead and took a pregnanct test and said positive. |`|TJhkyhIoaa	I was getting cramps and normal menstrual feelings. So i was taking tylenol all the time because i had cramps. Then one day i decided im going to by a pregnancy test even though i had that feeling i was going to start my menstrual cycle any day. Well i got the test and it was positive. I was excited.
yPNvecc7aa	Don't worry. You're fine, the baby's fine. Like 90% of women have done this while unknowingly pregnant and their babies all turn out fine.<br>  <br>  Hell, I was hungover when I took my preg. test! lol<br>  <br>  I think the only thing you should be worried about is if you were doing hardcore drugs.<br>  Ask your doctor. I'm sure they'll reasure you that everything's fine!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|63fb2fe791f92e434fc9c72fe297f49eaa	I'm sure many pregnant women have been in your shoes.  Your baby should be okay because even though it's been 4 weeks since your last period, technically the egg has only been fertilized for about 2 weeks, and even then the egg may have only been implanted in the uterus for a little over 1 week.  And the fertilized egg doesn't start taking nutrients (among other things, alcohol, nicotine, etc) from your body until it's implanted in the uterus.  Just stop drinking and smoking now and your baby should be perfectly fine.  Congrats!! :)|`|2B2fgmw9aa	your baby will be fine, just make sure you stop now! I had my best friend's wedding and labor day weekend where I drank the entire weekends away...then 2 weeks later I found out that I was almost 6 weeks prego! So far everything is going great!|`|XqfH76PMaa	This happens a lot when you are not planning a pregnancy.  I did the same thing and my baby is fine.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Just don't do it now (as you already know).|`|vXjPAHaKaa	It depends on how long you have been pregnant while drinking and doin drugs. I<br>  'll be praying for you!|`|AA12089586	You'll be just fine and so will the bub!<br>  Just be careful from now on!  <br>  Good Luck!|`|FV8SEdfVaa	You should be fine. Just take it easy from now on. |`|qw93hbEHaa	YES!!!!!|`|KUsyxicwaa	There's a very small risk that it could have damaged the baby. But again this risk is VERY small.  I found out I was pregnant the night after I had come home from a bar where I had  gotten drunk off of my @ss and smoked 2 packs of cigarettes. My son is perfectly fine.. The baby is more than likely fine, just stop everything now and start eating right, and taking your vitamins. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ItG88e6iaa	your baby is okay...when i was pregnant with my 1st baby (back when i was young and stupid) i was smokin weed but i didnt know i was preggo until 3 months later...my periods were always messed up so i thought it was just my menstral cycle being retarded until one day i had this feeling and went to my docs office and found out i was 3 months along...obviously i stopped my smoking but my daughter came out perfectly fine...just take it easy for now on. |`|264327ecd425fcd4f6d37e37b70b8549aa	Dont worry about it your fine. I didnt know i was pregnant with my 1st i found out 2months later and i was partying up nonstop. Yound and naive, but i had him he was perfectly fine and hes 6yrs old now. So dont worry to much about it and plus your only 4wks but good luck and god bless!!!!|`|GvWkXnqMaa	Yes, However I would recommend stopping cold turkey. A lot of women do the same thing before they find out they are pregnant, Sometimes it's the reason you get pregnant:-) |`|IFM3WYEAaa	You're fine...almost every woman has been through this.  Just stop now.  You're baby is OK!  :)|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, your baby will be okay.  Stop smoking and don't drink anymore. People used to smoke and drink all the time when pregnant and their babies were okay.|`|LrHPqW0aaa	Your baby should be fine as long as you stop drinking immediately and if you cant stop smoking you should smoke less until you quit all together.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	I'm pretty sure I drank before I knew I was pregnant. <br>  <br>  BUT listen to this...<br>  <br>  I know a girl who had irregular periods who was borderline alcoholic. Because her cycle was messed up she didn't know she was pregnant till 4 months into it. She drank constantly before that and her baby is perfectly fine. Shes 3 now.<br>  <br>  I know another girl who was only 15 when she became pregnant and was so scared she actually tried to give herself a miscarriage but drinking and doing drugs profusely till she was 6 months pregnant. Then, the accepted it and had the baby. He is 5 and a happy normal child.<br>  <br>  I know another girl who drank tons and smoked lots of weed till she found out. AND she was on the pill. Her baby boy is a little hyperactive but very happy and smart. He is 4.<br>  <br>  Obviously what they did wasn't right, but somehow their kid's are all completely normal. Amazing huh?<br>  <br>  So not to worry! |`|wBWc4b5naa	welcome!  wouldn't it be nice if our bodies sounded an alarm the second it happened!!?!!  most of the women i know, myself included were doing those things when they found out.  i had just gotten engaged and had been out celebrating two weeks... i took a test the third week before we were going out again (my theory is that if you are going to drink and you are late, take a damn test!!!)  so boy was i feeling crappy when it came back i had been prego for almost a month and had no idea and had been on hydroxycut living it up with the beers and ciggies!  i stopped cold turkey and the docs are really positve abotu this being normal... don't sweat the past... but do sweat the future.  do what you can now and you won't have to live with regret. :)  best luck!!!|`|1UpR1vSCaa	<br>  <br>  <br>  CONGRATS WELCOME TO MOMMY LAND <br>  <br>  <br>  I DOUBT YOU'LL HARM YOU BABY I THINK I SMOKED CIGARETTE'S TILL I  WAS 4-5 WEEKS BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS PREGNANT AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN FINE TR-OUGHT MY PREGNANCY NO-CK ON WOOD BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST RELAX AND ENJOY YOUR PREGNANCY<br>  <br>  <br>  BEST WISHES GOOD LUCK |`|tivpa7Vlaa	yes the baby is ok. alot of women like myself carry on as usual until they find out they r pregnant. it should be fine as long as u stop once u know. 
ErCJnABBaa	Well, here's the problem... you biological clock IS ticking, whether you're hearing it or not.  When it comes to pregnancy, the biological clock is basically the time you have to get pregnant before you become too old to be able to get pregnant.  With every passing year, your clock is ticking and it becomes more difficult for you to concieve.  Once you hit about 30, the decline picks up, and once you hit about 35, it begins to nose dive.  By the time you're 40, clock might have wound all the way down.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Totally agree with HooKoo that is a great answer!|`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	Maybe it is broken!!!!!!!!!!!!
ewagsnW4aa	as everyone else has called it MURDER and Partial-Birth Abortion.<br>  <br>  We should all thank Barack Obama for promising Planned Parenthood that he woudl legalize this disguisting act once in office.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Partial-Birth abortion...<br>  <br>  Goggle it.|`|DrlDqVZeaa	it's partial birth abortion and i'm kind of glad you asked this because it shows how many people didn't even know it existed. Hopefully this will inform some of the "pro choice" people out there. |`|AA10424047	The legal and technical term is Partial Birth Abortion. They deliver the baby just to the head and neck, which is left inside. Then they make an incision and use a tool to suction the baby's brain out of his or her skull. They do it this way to avoid the term "murder", as a baby is not considered born until he or she is completely out.<br>  <br>  However, in my mind and many others' minds, this IS murder.|`|AA10529334	partial birth abortion - this procedure is used very rarely, its not common at all.|`|eemmWU0Haa	murder...|`|b0670824054466599bd233e87a62d7d5aa	OK folks-everyone calm down. This is a horrible thing for a mother to have to go through, watching her half born being 'aborted'. HOWEVER-A close friend of mine had to 'abort' her child this way, as she was too ill to undergo a surgical abortion and the child's skull had not developed properly. The little girl was born with her brain exposed. They aborted it immediately as the child would have suffered an enormous amount of pain while taking hours and hours to die. YES this is a horrid thing to think about, but there is a reason the procedure exists.|`|2ad181c21364a9bc452bc03d80d57598aa	Murder.... <br>  <br>  to the tards who gave me thumbs down, probably some dumb *** "pro-choice" because i said how could a woman do this, makes me sick... I meant this abortion you twits. but hey, if reading about this type of abortion still makes you want to root for it. great. but still makes me F**cking sick! Murdering your child after delivering the head... my god people... it needs to be illegal.<br>  <br>  <br>  and I'm sorry... I have to ask this how the hell could a woman do this?.... Makes me sick...|`|J1stiMioaa	it is called a bul***** abortion. killing the baby when it is ouside the womb is called murder|`|83oIuTJcaa	Partial-Birth Abortion IT'S A HORRIBLE THING!!!!!|`|xVs6vFhXaa	that's horrible|`|ABJG1lLWaa	i am not sure how many people want to hear about this. |`|CFXnq8Vxaa	wel lets see.. you are killing the baby so i am guessing it is called...............MURDER!|`|9K6QtzGaaa	i think its very cruel so unfair that is so gross where on earth do they practise such extreme measures
hCgTGDR8aa	I think i texted everyone "you're going to be a grandma!" "you're going to be an uncle!" etc...<br>  it was fun having them call me asking things like "how did that happen?" |`|nsme1Alpaa	"im pregnant" and held up the positive test lol I was so nervous i couldnt think of any other way to tell them haha|`|UHIi8AuQaa	just told them,obviously this your 1st|`|PxhEDoCWaa	It's such a happy event! Just shout it out! lol Congrats to you!!!!! |`|bfb4XOONaa	We told them a few weeks ago at Thanksgiving here in Canada (I was 12 weeks). With my family, it was also my sister's birthday, so I bought her a shirt that said "The coolest Aunt in the world"...lol...corny, but it got the point across.<br>  With his side of the family, we bought a cake that had little blocks on it that spelled out "Baby" and put "Happy Thanksgiving" on it and brought it to family dinner and just left it on the table.|`|PTmJFtCIaa	I was 18 when I became pregnant with my son... My mom worked at the doctors office where I took a pregnancy test. Which was awkward and kind of funny. The whole situation kind of panned out like "Hi Mom." "Are you here for my lunch? I don't take it for a while..." "No I'm here to see the doc and take a test..." "A test for wh--- ......................<br>  .........................................<br>  .........................................  ...Let me get it for you. Go into that room..." we laugh about it now, but back then it was awkward.<br>  <br>  Course I took 13 pregnancy tests with him-- all negative, so that alone was frustrating. My dad I told in a fit of rage during a fight we were having. I don't recommend that.<br>  <br>  When I became pregnant with my daughter, my husband and I were at my mom's house and we just told them. Course, we waited a bit to tell my dad. Everyone was super happy... My friends, we just told out right, but with my son, we waited for some time to willingly announce it. Long complicated story surrounding my first pregnancy...<br>  <br>  If you're concerned with telling them or are afraid of their response, your best bet is not to wait and wait and wait. Tell them when things are comfortable and calm. Education is key. Make sure you educate yourself about pregnancy and the things to come. Showing that you are preparing yourself emotionally and mentally (and financially) is a good way to help ease the fears of your family and friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and I hope everything works out.<br>  XoXoX<br>  ?<br>  |`|AA11591868	I just got off BC pills - so all I have is a plan. :) I plan on ordering an itty-bitty pair of Converse Chuck Taylors and presenting them too him once I get a positve test. Those are the only kind of shoes "daddy" wears - even wore them in our wedding, so I thought it would be cute.<br>  <br>  I'm a little nervous about ordering shoes for a child that's not even conceived yet, feel it's bad luck - but I really want to and couldn't wait to get them in the mail. <br>  <br>  I probably won't tell ppl at work until I can show an ultrasound photo.|`|yQWnMSc6aa	I showed my family the ultrasound of the baby my husband and I had done at 9 weeks.

KMmtEoPjaa	i found kirkland to be the best (costcos brand) i used pampers and huggies and they leaked alot. my baby also sleeps with her legs tucked under her and butt in the air|`|XqfH76PMaa	I have always used Pampers Cruisers.  You can use the diapers or the overnight pull up type.  I have never had any trouble out of this brand.  So, it is worth giving them a shot.|`|A9SnOTCAaa	I use Huggies overnight pull-ups actually. They are super absorbent and since they are elastic all around the top and at the sides they usually stop the leaks right at the source instead of letting them...travel lol. Good luck!|`|uxItOSkmaa	Huggies Overnites (specifically made for the problem you're having).  |`|pMLvhLSkaa	i use Luv's with both my kids that are 2 yr old son and a 9 mo. old daughter|`|6gEd68S1aa	My 2 year old son sleeps in all knids of weird positions.

Yuo could also used Huggies Overnites but I honestly don't think they're worth the extra money. Luvs work just as well. Hope I helped.|`|8MDFKrrfaa	Huggies|`|Q9HetCBkaa	i always used luvs. i really liked them.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Huggies worked best for us, but we usually got what was on sale between Huggies and Pampers.  They both have overnight diapers that can hold more.  
5OQLmECTaa	save your money, they will just tell you this is normal and give you meds for the nausea,  every pregnancy is different so you really can't compare it to your first one.  i had sickness until my 7th month then it went away and i was throwing up around 5-8 times a day.  not fun at all, and it is just one little baby in me.  if it is multiples they will know soon enough when you go for a scan until then just try to hang in there, the tiredness is completely normal this early on it will ease off by the second trimester.  good luck and congrats!|`|XqfH76PMaa	I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that something is wrong with the baby (or babies).  But, you may have a virus or something that is making you so sick.  You may be wrong about it costing you to go to the hospital.  I received a medical card when I was pregnant and I had to go to the hospital before I got the actual card.  The hospital told me just to bring the card in as soon as I got it and if I received any bills afterward, to send them to the address on the back of the card.  I would at least think about going in to my doctor if nothing else.  I wouldn't suffer sick like that if i didn't have to.  I really hope you feel better!|`|VcvMQVFKaa	It could be just morning sickness, but it shouldn't be that severe! You should call the hospital and talk to a receptionist in the ER and she will tell you if you should come in or not and what to do. You may be having a miscarriage. Or call your GP and ask the receptionist, your doctor will contact you back. <br>  <br>  Hope everything goes well.|`|UYKJVlZ5aa	Try to take it easy, relax and get some help (husband, mom, sister - someone like that).  If it were me, I'd wait and see a doctor instead of the ER.  You should have a free womens health clinic nearby, try that.  Or, take your application for insurance info to an OB doc and tell them that it'll be in any day now - they may go ahead and see you.

(An episiotomy cuts through ALL the layers of tissue -- a tear is usually more superficial.)  <br>  <br>  The idea that episiotomies are easier to repair and heal better is a myth   -- long disproven by medical research. (In fact, the most severe tears are almost always extensions of episiotomies -- standard analogy -- take a piece of paper and hold it in two hands. Pull your hands apart and try to rip the paper.  Doesn't tear easily, does it?  Now cut a small slit in the paper and try again.  The cut will easily rip further.)|`|H1NjIT10aa	It really depends on how you tear.  With my first baby I had an episiotomy.  This made it difficult to sit flat bottomed.  <br>  <br>  My second pregnancy I had twins.  There was no time to do an episiotomy and I tore toward the side quite far.  I healed fine had no problem sitting flat bottomed.  Only one time did it bother me and that was when I had my first yeast infection, the scar was new enough that it swelled and was very sensitive.  <br>  <br>  That being said I shudder to think what would have happened if I had torn in several other directions.  I could have had a mess.  Therefore, for my money, I would rather have an episiotomy than a tear. <br>  <br>  That being said my daughter has had three children.  She did not have episotomies nor did she tear!|`|5OQLmECTaa	if the doctor knows you are going to tear, it is best that they go ahead and cut,  i have heard that it heals much faster and better b/c they cut in the best place instead of just letting it tear wherever and it would make the stitches alot more comfortable,  they would know the best place for them.|`|HntAuUW3aa	depends on how bad you tear|`|dG3V2roaaa	It is better to tear.. many studies have shown this. Cnn recommends you do NOT let them cut you unless the baby is stuck. Natural tears have less complications, and heals better. <br>  <br>  Here are some things that have been recently said about it:<br>  ---------------------------<br>  The procedure, which is done in about 35 percent of vaginal deliveries, was once thought to make childbirth easier by widening the vagina with a small surgical incision, but researchers from the University of North Carolina said the opposite is true.<br>  <br>  After analyzing data from 26 episiotomy studies, they concluded that episiotomy actually increases the risk for injury to women.<br>  <br>  The surgery, they said, should be used only when it will prevent harm to the baby -- a situation that occurs in probably less than 10 percent of vaginal deliveries.<br>  ---------------------------<br>  The 26 studies included data from 5,001 vaginal deliveries. The authors conclude:<br>  <br>      * There is no benefit from episiotomy.<br>  <br>      * Women who have episiotomy "may be more likely to have pain with intercourse in the months after pregnancy and are slower to resume having intercourse."<br>  <br>      * When use of episiotomy is restricted to "fetal indications" the episiotomy rate is 8% to 10%, but "in contemporary practice episiotomy use remains threefold higher." |`|Y7xlBWdsaa	What to Expect when Expecting says you heal better when you're cut. I tore a little, but I had no problems healing. I got 2 stitches. I think it depends on how bad you tear. I had a friend that tore in 3 places. She had issues 3 days after she left the hospital. She experienced things I didn't: burning during urniation, itching, and soreness. Some people can barely walk afterwards because they hurt. Like I side, that depends on how bad you tear or get cut. |`|nXAMvp7gaa	I was told a cut heals better than a tear as the skin is straight and not jagged, however i had a episiotomy and it never healed properly at all and now i have to have surgery to repair it. although with an episiotomy you do get the added bonus of an injection of local aneasthetic so you dont feel it. id ask your midwife and see what shes says. |`|XqfH76PMaa	I think it depends on how bad the tear or cut would be.  With my daughter, I needed a large area cut so they didn't let me tear.  With my son, it was just a small amount and I tore.  I can tell you that I healed much better with the tear than the cut and it actually hurt a lot worse.  If it is a small amount, I would recommend to tear.  That is just my opinion.  Hope I helped!|`|iLLoc003aa	YES! A tear heals quicker...I had both...I was cut with my first child and was in so much pain for like 2 weeks! I could not sit or lay...I cried everyday...with my 2nd, I tore and it hurt a little but NOTHING compared to the pain with my first...|`|i6mydMOyaa	I had both...an episiostomy...and then I tore.  <br>  <br>  So tough to say which was worse, but to be honest, I think they both hurt the same.  It's all healing to the same area.|`|cxdZHrFvaa	no
q0JTN9QAaa	It is bad in a lot of cases because it can cause soy allergies but your case is different he has a milk allergy and the doctor knows best.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I'm vegan and don't plan on ever giving my son cow's milk. I've researched a lot and soy milk has the calcium and protein and vitamins they need, people are just ignorant. Soy milk is better than the chemicals in cow's milk for sure.|`|txbZujeRaa	Actually it is.  And I'm not a fan of cow's milk either.  Soy has very high levels of estrogen, which can be harmful to everyone, and esp. young kids.  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.soyonlineservice.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.soyonlineservice.co.nz/</a><br>  <br>  Excess soy turns off some chemical in the body that allows it to fight off cancer and it negatively affects the thyroid gland as well.  Short term you won't probably notice anything, but long term it isn't good.  Asian cultures use only small amounts of it and they usually ferment it, which takes out the toxic compounds.  They don't drink soymilk or put bricks of tofu in smooties like people do in the west.  All the vegans on here will disagree with me (and I used to be one).  I'm not against being a vegetarian, it's just that many people don't realize that soy can be harmful.  That website explains a lot.  I stopped eating soy and many of my menstrual issues vanished.|`|3gXQPso5aa	my daughter also drinks soy milk for the same reason and is fine she is 19 months old|`|Hi2GYFa9aa	No, it's not harmful.|`|uSqc6bUuaa	soy milk is fine dont worry |`|J1stiMioaa	my son was on soy milk due to a allergy (he outgrew it by 12 months though!), i think the only reason they are reluctant to give it is because it isnt as nutritionally packed as regular milk, so make sure he gets a a varied diet and he'll be fine. if you arent sure abidec vitamins are a good suppliment|`|77MUaN6Faa	I suggest that you go to www.worldnetdaily.com. Type in "Jim Rutz" in the WND Search box. Select the article "Soy is......". That will take you to a page with 6 articles on soy. You will be shocked but I hope,well informed.|`|Ve0Fi2UMaa	No.  
OHq5gSjJaa	Its called the fencing relex...  here is some info:<br>  <br>  Tonic Neck Reflex: This is also called the fencing reflex, because of the position the baby assumes. When you lay your baby on her back and her head turns to one side she will extend her arm and leg on that side while the opposite arm and leg bend, assuming a "fencing" position. This reflex is present only until about the 4th month.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	It's an infant reflex, and shows that your baby is neurologically typical, and that's a good thing.  If that reflex was absent, it could be a sign of brain damage.<br>  <br>  It's also called the tonic neck reflex.|`|d417ff78c87187a951bf9bd51ab28d23aa	its just a reflex that new borns have for a while they all have it. its a position the lay in and looks like someone in a fencing (swords) stance they eventually stop laying like this. but its normal and they all do it <br>  its also called the tonic neck, when they are on their backs w/ head to side the arms and legs on that side extend and the other side flex or bend.<br>  perfectly normal she was just checking him for normal reflexes|`|33BS467Raa	Yes, that is the asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR). Watch for its disappearance around 4 months of age. Some pediatricians will specifically check that it is gone during the six month checkup (just like it is abnormal for these infant reflexes to be missing in a newborn, they have to disappear at a certain time to enable a more mature motor response). |`|XqfH76PMaa	Nothing is wrong.  It is just a term they use for one of the normal positions you see in an infant.  They actually use a few but I can not think of what they are right now.  It is nothing.  She was just giving a visual example of a normal reaction that the student will see regularly.

VY4LqfLpaa	I never really had any symptoms...I had some occasional morning sickness, but most of my nausea was right after I took my vitamin...so my doc changed my vitamin and the naseau went out the window with the old vitamin.  Other than that, my son started kicking hard enough for me to feel at about 18 weeks, let my husband feel him kicking around 28 or 29 weeks, and got here at 30 weeks 6 days.|`|Hub1UGqPaa	Just wait....your body is going to change DRAMATICALLY within the next 4-6 weeks.  <br>  <br>  |`|QzWHMGHJaa	No you aren't but not everyone is the same.

I am 8 weeks and I had a day here or there where my boobs would feel a little sore, but it wasn't like everyone said it would be. Mine just got sore last week and they're still not real bad. I just leave my bra on at all times and they are fine and don't bother me. Remember everyone is different so just because you don't experience every symptom doesn't make you wrong, it makes you lucky!!! :)|`|M5HyStReaa	I am 8 weeks gone and boobs have gone up a cup size but aren't sensitive or sore at all.<br>  <br>  I have been tired and teary this week and off my food but nothing more than a virus would affect me so I know how you feel. apparently we are the lucky ones with no symptoms!|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Your fine! I am 25 weeks pregnant and I have never had sore boobs! They grew quite a bit but they still arnt sore!|`|eBif437baa	No your not crazy cause I think when my boobies became sensitive was when I was about 4 months or so pregnant. So you still have a little more time before you have sore or sensitive boobies.But have you gotten the feeling of people aggravating you? I know I got that feeling by 3 months I think. And I know my son's father wanted to have sex with me still after 5 months and I told him ok as long as you don't touch the boobies and he wanted to know why so I told him that they were sensitive and I would feel disgusted if they were touched. It could be the littlest touch and I would flip.<br>  <br>  LoL sry for the long story thats just from my expierence so just give it time. <br>  |`|euN3ct9oaa	No it is really normal, you are just lucky. Some women don't have any signs at all, not even nausea. I had it all...even 3 months worth of severe nausea and vomitting. You may even get all of the symptoms tomorrow or in a couple of months. Everyone's different. Haha you are not crazy.|`|XqfH76PMaa	You may not be having them because you are still so early along.  It took me until I was about two or three months along before I got them.  Don't worry, you will get some soon!  Then you will be wishing it was like it was when you didn't have any lol!  You aren't crazy, just excited.  Congrats!!|`|hJwheleJaa	Nope!

AA10315542	.tell them|`|JsqMSU9Haa	go to the dr to find out if you are for sure.   if youre not, and i hope youre not from what i just read, focus on stabilizing your life, saving money and then start a family.  whats your rush??! you obviously aren't being careful about birth control and you basically have nowhere stable to live and not enough income to support a child.  that's not fair to a child, no matter how much love you can give that child.  children require more than love, they need stability, and they things that cost money!  <br>  if you are pregnant, stay in school or get your ged (you sound young).  you can still go to college and get a good job to financial support your child.  and please get on birth control as soon as you can.  good luck.  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: if you have a good job and savings, its confusing that WIC is an option.  and seriously, who cares what your stepsister thinks or says?!  that's why you sound young.  if you are having a baby, her running her mouth should not even be of concern to you.  good luck.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	There are plenty of people who will not be happy for you, regardless of what you do.

Also you need to have financial stability! This is not something to be playing around with by trying to get pregnant then get on welfare because you can't afford a baby! I mean accidents happen but you are actually planning to get pregnant then get on welfare. There is something majorly wrong with that picture! Wouldn't you want more for your child then that!? I really hope that you aren't pregnant and then fix your life before you try to get pregnant again. Babies are not cheap by any means and you should know that this Joe guy is going to be there for you and this baby for the rest of your life! You don't even have a place to live and you want to have a baby! How old are you? You sound between 15 and 17 yrs old. This makes me sad for that baby to be. Get your life straight before you go off trying to have a baby for selfish reasons. Do you or your boyfriend even have jobs?? I'm assuming no since you both live with parents! Aw this makes me sad and sick to my stomach!
AA11787590	No, not until baby is at least 6 months old  Just keep formula or breast feeding him until then, you can severely upset his tummy if you start giving him solids now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a>|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, it's not ok to start solids that early.  Baby doesn't need them, can't digest them, and probably can't even eat from a spoon yet.  And early solids increase his risk for a wide range of health problems. <br>  <br>  He's obviously doing great on milk alone, so why add solids? (Despite what some might tell  you, doubling his birth weight is NOT a sign that he's ready for solids.  He was small when he was born, so he's going to double his birthweight early.)<br>  <br>   Solids are usually started at around 6 months, and 4 months is the earliest to even consider starting. (When you do start, you can start with anything -- cereal or jarred food or home-made babyfood or, if you wait until around 7 months or more (perfectly fine to do) you can start with table foods and skip the purees completely.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	NO solids till 6 mos.   Just keep on breasfeeding him/formula feeding him till 6 mos. No need for solids before that. And even then solids are just an introduction but he wont be getting most of his nutrients from food but from milk.|`|J1stiMioaa	my son was weaned at 12 weeks but that was under the advice and supervision of a dietition as he had a bad allergy to milk and was starting to lose weight.  the best bet would be speak to a doctor/health visitor or dietition and see what they say |`|cZIyR12eaa	i started both of my babies on solids at 3 months and they are fine.  i spoon fed them cereal and when they got the hang of eating from a spoon, i started them on veggies and fruits.  it won't hurt him.  it's up to you.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No way!  My son was 9lbs 4oz at birth.  He's 6 weeks and 12lbs now and Dr. says still no solids, not until 6 months.  Please talk with your Dr. before giving your son any solids!!!|`|lVzBupUaaa	To be honest I think your baby is too small yet.  My baby was 9lb 5oz at birth.  He was a little monster and desperate to eat solid food.<br>  <br>  We waited until he was 4.5 months old and then started to give him baby rice - just a little at bedtime.<br>  <br>  Baby will show signs that he wants solid food - following your fork when your eating - reaching out.... I doubt a 2 month old baby would know how to move his mouth with food in there.|`|3eP616uSaa	No its not. And his weight has nothing to do with if he's ready for solids. AAP, WHO, and UNICEF all state that a baby should be Exclusively breastfed (or formula if thats the case) for the first six months of life.<br>  <br>  Have you spoken to your dr about this?|`|SO88BzeYaa	i started my daughter at 5 months and shes fine! as long as you still breastfeed or formula feed. start with vegtables then fruits. most babies, if started fruits, wont eat veggies! youre supposed to introduce one thing at a time for 3 days. to make sure theres no allergy. have fun with it! i sudgest making your own foods. they taste WAY better and it costs MUCH less!<br>  recipes on wholesomebabyfood.com <br>  have fun! |`|KrQkESGLaa	talk to your doctor ur baby is too young.
DyEIc0K8aa	Most parents will say they love all their children the same... and I would agree with that. But the experts say that parents do love one child more that the others. So I guess you can believe you do or don't love them the same.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I will give you an honest answer -- YES, sometimes you like one of your children better.  If one child is doing something bad of course you would like the one who is being good -- it's human nature.  However, it's the behavior and not the child that we are liking better.  I have 4 children and love them all totally, but it's easier to like the one who isn't in trouble :).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|lxAP3n3vaa	heey, it always seems that way for me. there are 5 children in my family. my older sister (she gets what ever she wants because she's the oldest, she can go anywhere herself, gorgeous and it seems like everything goes her way), me (no special value what so ever), my brother (the only boy in the family), and my little sisters (they're twins and the youngest, so they're spoilt as well). i always feel like i get treated a little worse than the others. eg. i'll ask my mom for something, she'll say no. one of my sisters will ask straight after and she'll be like ok. she gave my brother $50 to spend+his pocket money for the week, then she gave me $10. i spent it on my lunch and then she wouldn't give me my pocket money because she said she already gave me the 10. she ended up giving it, only after when my older sister asked her too and told her it wasn't fair. i know i might sound selfish because my mom works so hard for all of us, but it makes me feel less important when things like that happen. well there's my point. sorry it's so long.<br>  hope this helps =)|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	I only have one im debating on having another for the fact that i dont think i will love anything else more than my child now, although i would love all my children. i think that in most cases people dont love their kids more than the other, but rather that they give attentions to the ones that always need it.<br>  <br>  |`|9kaIOXqkaa	i have four children i love them all differently but equally i have seen my children feel that way because of their range of ages i think they are at different stages of life needing different types of attention but maturity makes a big difference |`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I like the one who brings me a cup of tea, sits down and chats, and is nice to me.  I'm easily bought.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I don't think there is any loving a child more or even equally, it's loving them individually. It's astounding how different children can be, especially while being raised in the same environment, the same values, morals, and ideals. Each one has a personality all their own, some showing strong preferences to this or that. Unfortunately, I think what happens is when a child and a parent share an interest, they will sometimes hold extra discussions on it or maybe take them on an outing (fishing) that the other children may not be privy to, not because the parent doesn't want them to join but simply because the children do not enjoy it. The children then perceive this as favoritism, although (example) just last week the parent did something with the child that only that child fancies. The more children you have, the more difficult it can be as well.|`|DDFSITiYaa	  There are moments and sometimes phases that you dislike about your child's development but that doesn't mean you don't love them. I can't say I love all my children the same way because they are different people but I can say I love them all equally.  I love them because of their differences, not in spite of them.  Each has traits I admire and dislike.  Think about how you love your parents and your siblings and your friends.  You love them all but differently. <br>  <br>  I would walk through fire for any of my kids without even thinking about it.  |`|rVgVpHXLaa	When my daughter was born and I was a mother for the first time the feelings that I experienced were so overwhelming that I said "I'm not gonna love any other child as much as this one". The love I felt for that little creature was so unique, so powerful that I knew I would never feel it again. <br>  And I didn' t! <br>  When, four years later, my son arrived it was not the same. Of course I felt affection, love, tenderness but all of them on a milder level. And the years passed and I was convinced that my love for my daughter could not be compared with anything on earth and I usually felt guilty for that. <br>  But, little by little, I sensed that something was happening, something was changing. My little one was EARNING my love his own way. Watching him grow and develop his own personality, realizing that he is nothing more that "flesh from my flesh" made my love for him so solid. <br>  Today, my daughter is 13 and my son 9 and I can assure you that I love them both equally. Equally but differently. <br>  Maybe it's that difference that you kids perceive as unequal and unfair. I really don't know. The only thing I know is that I can't imagine my life without my two children.    |`|XqfH76PMaa	I don't love either of my children more than the other and I do not like one more than the other.  My daughter is easier to deal with but that is about all I can say.  You are right that a parent may like one child's personality better or get along with one more than the other.  But, you love your children the same. |`|aSn5Vz8Gaa	As a parent, there are different sides to your children. with that said, a parent may a times get along better with one child, however, its my opinion that most parents love all of their children the same.|`|DIebEIw7aa	No, I've only 1 baby, planning to adopt soon..but I'm sure I will treat them the same...& supported them both..give them equal love & care...|`|TS0bMiVWaa	well im not a parent but i do agree with that statement my mom does that now she treats my little sister better than she does me

8nPXjFlPaa	Doesn't seem so wise to get pregnant and have a baby JUST to see if you can, but hey, we all have our own wierd and wonderful ways of looking and feeling about things.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself these things;<br>  <br>  Do you enjoy staying in a LOT?<br>  <br>  Can you handle having to do things you aren't in the mood for without complaining and with a smile...on a daily basis, living with that background grating feeling?<br>  <br>  Are you into spending your twenties doing the school run and babysitting your neighbours kids for days on end because they only want to play at your house?<br>  <br>  Can you handle planning days out, only to have to cancel everything mid-flow because your lil one is having a bad day..or worse, bad phase that can last for months?<br>  <br>  Are you wanting to give up your freedom to be you, to put you second ALL the time with no let up?<br>  Sure you can get babysitters and send them to the family for the weekend, but you can't switch off being a mum, you will waste most of your freetime thinking about them..and being on call when things go wrong.<br>  <br>  Are you willing to go back to work, and can you handle an upsidedown house, because, no matter who you are there really aren't enough hours in the day?<br>  <br>  Can you handle loosing a small part of your sexiness, because people don't check out mothers that often..this may sound sooo shallow now, but trust me, most women feel like they've lost a part of thier identity. Not all the time...but it is true of most of us.<br>  <br>  If you can answer yes to ALL of these, then you really will be happy being a mum at this time.<br>  Please remember the mums, those of us that 'do it all' and 'have it all' are absolutely knackered 90% of the time. Don't look at this thru rose coloured glasses, it is continuous, it never ends, and at the end of it, you are 18 years older.<br>  <br>  I genuinly wish you luck in your disision, I really do. <br>  Just remember you are only 20 once.

I can see the complete chaos they have to endure while growing up that I know is forthcoming for her, and I worry. <br>  <br>  The last thing any parent wants is for their child to bail out of life.<br>  <br>  I would hope that this event will serve as a wake up call for your daughter, and even for you. You now have the best opportunity to discuss all of those things that you may have overlooked discussing with her in the past, thus causing her to commit this attempt. <br>  <br>  Have a real heart to heart with her, and let her know you are going to be completely honest, as well as this is what you expect from her. The goal of this discussion, of course, would be to determine the problem, and set forth a game plan on how to fix the problem. Let her know you will do everything in your power to resolve her issues.<br>  <br>  Even though children may seem non-receptive to the things you need to tell them, that doesn't mean they don't still need to hear it. Tell her how much you love her, how much you want her to endure growing up so she can become a happy, healthy adult. Let her know that she is not alone in feeling this way, that you also experienced these feelings, as any young adult has to deal with, and overcome negativity. Tell her that none of these trivial social problems that most children endure mean anything in the grand scope of life. <br>  <br>  What is most important is that she gets some perspective on what life really is all about, and I know you can help her do that.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	How awful for you and her.<br>  <br>  Did she go to hospital? They will have referred her to someone for counselling/psychiatric evaluation and hopefully she may get some help.<br>  <br>  If not, then you should go to your GP and he will refer you. She needs professional help. I understand that you will have done everthing you can to try and help her but for severe depression, professional assistance is needed.

There has to be a reason she feels this way. Maybe it's because she feels lonely. Family time is extremely important. Taking her to see a psychologist may help, if it's on the budget. Maybe something is wrong at school and she felt she was useless. Ask her more about her day, I love it when my mom does that. It could be she is too stressed and needs a good holiday. Taking her out of school for a day or two could help a lot. Keep the pills locked up where only you have control over them. |`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Three months ago, you asked where you can go if you leave home and stated that you are 13 years old. Listen here missy, suicide is not funny, nor is it something to joke about. There are those of us that have lost people we really care about because they took their own life. We can never see them or hold them or tell them we love them again. There is also a tremendous amount of guilt involved for the survivors. We missed the signs. What if we would have seen them. Could we have stopped it. This is a horrible question for you to ask, when it is just crap. Shame on you, little girl! There is a reason Yahoo Answers keeps children off this page, and even though you are old enough, you are a prime example. In your question about being 13, you say you are mature? This is not mature!

I understand your mum died of breast cancer when you were 4. do you and your dad talk about your mum or is it a raw subject in your home. i think you may need some councelling to deal with growing up without your mum.

First of all, she needs to be on some antidepressants (I went thru several before I found out which one worked for me). I found the stimulant effexor worked better than paxil or zoloft or cypralex.  She should also be hospitalized in a psych ward where she will receive counselling and other solutions to her problems.  Good Luck and May God be with both of you!|`|LR8etSbPaa	I think you should take her to a therapist. You might want to go with her at least the first time, maybe the second too, because some of them are creepy and messed up but some can be really helpful and diminish any more suicidal thoughts from your daughter's head. She needs professional help before she tries again not just a lot of people online thinking they can give great advice. (But I'm going to try anyway; still, GET PROFESSIONAL HELP!!!) Please talk to her and find out why she committed suicide. (Or tried to.)<br>  Make sure she realizes how much you love her and that you'll love her no matter what she does! (Nothing she does is bad enough to make you stop loving her) Make sure she understands that you are there for her and she can tell you anything. Find out why she's so depressed. Is it her relationship with you or your husband? Maybe her boyfriend dumped her? Maybe she's being pressured into doing drugs? Maybe she is taking drugs? Maybe she has an eating disorder? (Which actually can cause severe depression and has  caused suicides before) SO, therapist, (psycologist)or maybe a counselor would be your best bet.<br>  Hope I could help!<br>  ~Jade|`|XF4tcGhFaa	thats horrible, and i am so sorry, but i think the best thing you could do is be there for her. don't be mad because if your mad then shes more likely to do it again. just tell her that you are there for her and you lover her and she can talk to you. don't be like i understand what your going thruogh, because obviously you don't, and that is one of the most annoying things that people say. you should probably send her to a treatment center to. there she will get counseling and help. |`|T7AcDVJfaa	my parents often shout at me just for not eating veges.. ill always run to the toilet and cry scratching my hands and leg saying why are they so 'lame' and unreasonable. sometimes i even tempt to shout back at them, i cant seems to control my feelings. thought or silly stuffs i never thought of, wanted to run away from home. i would like just freedom and care. i just need to see and feel they truly care for me when they 'schout' at me but seriously i dont see'em|`|IoUEaoCJaa	i used to be that way, then my parents brought me a pet n i was able to open up to it. i think all u should do is really get her to open her mind up to you, find out whats really wrong n how to make her feel better.|`|Uge0Nt9Raa	This May Sound Stupid But When I Get Down All I really need is a hug from my mum so i can just sit with her and cry and she will ask no questions, but me and my mum are pretty close and if you two aren't close she may tell you to Get lost or something :/<br>  <br>  |`|SVGEtdWtaa	treating her differently is going to make things difficult because she will most likely turn it around and take it offensively. get her professional help, you can't help her on your own. |`|FtYc8EnOaa	I think you should take her to talk to a proffessional.

HOXXSlnZaa	right she needs to get over it she should be happy that she's pregnant and she shouldn't be worried about anyone stealing her thunder. when i got pregnant with this one their were loads of ppl around me that had been trying for ages or that couldn't have babies and i got pregnant within the 1st month of trying so i just told everyone and the ppl that reacted badly who cares it's their problem not yours.|`|wENdWT5kaa	First, find out for sure if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Second, it is you SIL's problem. Aborting a child would be kind of stupid just because you  SIL would be devastated. <br>  <br>  If you are preg. that baby has every right to live as it's siblings.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you didn't want anymore children, you should have been practicing safe sex. <br>  <br>  But if you are, accept responsibility, this is your childrens siblings. And maybe, after this pregnancy or scare, maybe you should consider on a tubal if you don't want any more kids. <br>  <br>  And again, do not let your SIL's feelings get infront of yours. She is being quite foolish if you ask me. |`|1IDSGM71aa	Why on earth would she be devastated? That's horrible. If you are pregnant, don't worry about what other people say or think of it. And if you are pregnant, your kids could grow up together and will probably be very close.|`|J1stiMioaa	WTF! any normal sister in law would be delighted if you were pregnant together, dont even consider a abortion for this reason! as for 'devastated' if you were pregnant together it sounds more like 'i would be really p*ssed off that you are getting some attention and it isnt all focused on me', if you are happy then she should be 2. dont let her bring you down|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	ignore your sister and get over it. you and your hubby made a baby and now you will have another child.<br>  <br>  who cares if your sil is devastated? if she asks you why you got pregnant, just tell her to phiss her off and walk away. yeah, you got pregnant and decided to spend 18 years raising a child just to make her mad, what a freakin egomaniac.|`|GjuRYsITaa	since when does the world revolve around her, i have children as well and now having number 5 i didn't want anymore but its happened so im just getting on with it|`|WQR0KEqZaa	how old is she??<br>  DONT BE SO SILLY, YOU CANT ABORT YOUR BABY BECAUSE OF HER!! tell her to get over herself, she sounds like a selfish bi***.<br>  |`|Q1Zl6Rc4aa	Have someone to talk to, to give you comfort. You did not get pregnant just to make her angry, it happened, so now it's time to see how birth is a miracle, a good thing.<br>  <br>  And, once she is over jealousy (or whatever made her want to be the only mother-to-be), you both can share the experience. It will be good to have someone close to you that is feeling the same things and going to motherhood (again, in your case).<br>  <br>  If this pregnancy makes you hesitate, have some counseling, or see a psychologist, maybe he can help you cope with these opposed and intense feelings.|`|lTHAR3sKaa	Are you kidding me?<br>  <br>  If you're old enough to have a hubby, then I think you're old enough to make your own decisions.  Your SIL needs to grow up.  This is your decision and she should not even be a factor.<br>  <br>  As for not wanting another baby and not wanting an abortion, it's a little late for that.  Discuss it with your husband and make the decision that suits your family best--not you husband's sister.|`|f39e8475c8f65146e9266b38be944586aa	you sister- in - law does not have a right to make any decision on what you do. a child is a precious gift that should be cherished. since you do not believe in abortion have you considered adoption? that is another option for you. talk to a counselor and maybe she/he can help you make up your mind but in the end the decision falls on you.|`|SoRLHQeRaa	Its happened, she'll have to deal with it. Plenty of other people will be pregnant the same time as her. I assume she means cos the attention wil be taken off her but that's silly as all births are special. It will also be nice for her to have someone who has been through it before to talk too. She'll get over it. As for your dilemma, no one can tell you what is right for you, I hope you are happy with whatever you decide x |`|ryvO8DMaaa	Tell this girl to get over herself first of all.

AvY7Rwvraa	More than likely you are pregnant. But I would go ahead and wait a week before testing again, just to make sure it wasn't a false positive. I bought clear blue. Its digital and inexpensive. Good luck! I hope for the best for you! |`|IllWKAUGaa	any line, even a faint line, is positive, as long as it is within the time limit.<br>  <br>  congrats and good luck!!!!|`|horefBCyaa	i would wait a couple more days and test again when you probably have more HCG hormone. and to help clear things up-you could probabaly buy a digital one that says pregnant or not pregnant so there's no confusion. good luck and congratulations in advance!|`|XqfH76PMaa	I think it sounds like you are very early pregnant.  If I were you, I would wait a few more days (a week if you can) and retest.  If you are really early on, the line will be faint like that.  The further along you are, the more hormones you produce and the darker the line will be.  By the way, the name brand doesn't matter.  They are all pretty much the same and will give you the same results. |`|Zy07f0Zwaa	Well if you saw a line on two different pregnancy tests then I would rule out evaporation lines and say there is a good chance you are pregnant =] I would advise though to take another test in a couple of days to confirm and only use first morning urine to ensure you get an accurate result!<br>  <br>  Good luck xx |`|ZBc16tOvaa	your pregnant congrats wait a couple of days and it should be darker so test again cheers|`|EpfVsCa2aa	your pregnant|`|okzx31rzaa	some tests are known for giving positive lines that are "barely" visible even when they are negative.  What you could be seeing is the chemical (test) strip, and it can darken if moisture sticks to it, but if it is positive it should have at least a hint of color to it.  If it is really hard to see, and if you cant see it from the same distance as you would read a book, then it could just be the test strip you are seeing.  Just remember, if it has any color to it at all, then it is most likely a positive result.  I would recommend waiting 2-3 days and retest with the same test you used before.  If you are pregnant, that 2-3 days will allow the pregnancy hormone to roughly double it's amount, and you will have a more noticable line.  If you are STILL getting a super faint line, then either wait it out another 2-3 days or go to your doctor and ask for a HcG qualitative test.  The blood test is far more sensitive and can detect the earliest pregnancies before an HPT can.  Good luck to you, and I hope you find out soon!|`|OvLY4fNUaa	From personal experience only, this means you may be pregnant. The only way to know for sure is to go to your doctor. False negatives are much more common than false positives. For the line to appear, it generally means that the test picked up a small amount of the hormone hcg, which indicates a pregnancy. Don't panic, but do go to your doctor at your earliest convenience.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4hxgRpBIaa	I took all sorts of HPT's and the best results I had were with the Wal-Mart brand (equate) and I did it first thing in the morning. I kept getting really faint positives as well so it sounds as if you are pregnant, but I'd try it again, or maybe go to your local health department or doctor! <br>  ^_^<br>  Good luck either way!|`|1h15QntPaa	A home pregnancy test works by picking up a hormone called HCG.<br>  <br>  HCG is a hormone released y a fetus, if there is no fetus then there would be no possible way that you could have HCG in your system.<br>  <br>  A faint line still means that you have HCG so yes, you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|gdU4YoRmaa	as long as the line is even showing a bit, that means your pregnant.<br>  <br>  Because even if there is the slightest HCG hormone in your urine, its means your pregnant, and thats what the tests look for!<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|EwH0OOEKaa	Its positive even if the line is faint... All mine have been and 9 months later I had babies. If you want more of a definitive answer go see an OB/GYN.|`|DtGFWUP5aa	get a real test at a clinic|`|1grRyERpaa	It sound to me like your slightly in denial. Go see your OB/GYN, they have a more acurate pregnancy test. Store bought ones are not perfect, in the least. |`|QImv7V8aaa	Even the faintest positive is a POSITIVE!  There can be false negatives but all positives are right.  My test was very very feint.|`|MpghpiVGaa	could be pregnant but you hormones are so low still and it cant detect wait a couple of days then take it again if it still not working wait until u have missed a period.|`|ArraT4dqaa	a line is a line, no matter how faint|`|QNorKUm6aa	you r preggo girl congratulations!!!!!!!!!|`|lBINJvevaa	congrats!!!!
wBpennsMaa	Have baby.|`|VJpdmd0waa	Have the baby DUH!!!!!<br>  Only if you where in a forced situation should u abort it...|`|yV8fog7Paa	Have the baby. |`|zbjaBgyEaa	Every situation is different - I don't know how accurately I can answer that unless it actually happens to me.<br>  <br>  Frankly.  I don't really want a baby - especially not at this point in my life.  I'm a university student.  I don't want to be a mother.  I want to fous on my studies, I want to have fun with my life.  I want to travel and be spontaneous and crazy.  I'm young.  And I don't really want to give up the life I live to have a baby.  But I'm also quite cautious - I'm not sexually active.  I am politically pro-choice as well.<br>  <br>  I just think that until something happens you can never give a definate response to how you'll react.  So I can't say for sure what I'd do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Harsh.  Children as punishments.  I think that's really dreadful.<br>  "Did you want me mom?"<br>  "No.  You were a consequence."<br>  <br>  It doesn't really bother me that you thumbs down me.  I mean.  It's about what I would do.  And I'm being honest.  I don't know.  It depends on which point in life I'm at, who the father is, etc etc.  I'm sorry you disagree.  But that's your choice.  And this is mine.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I am male but, I would keep the baby.<br>  <br>  But Cupcakes answer is pathetic!<br>  <br>  While I disagree with Tinkerpanda, politically, I do like the fact of the responsibility she is taking.|`|AA10186411	HAVE THE BABY.  I was faced with this decision, and its not my choice as to whether to take a life or not.  I was mature enough to have sex and get pregnant, so I am mature enough to be a single mother.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Well I am a bloke so this is a decision that I am never going to have to make.<br>  <br>  Though, if my girlfriend was pregnant, I would hope she would chose to keep the baby - even if it meant handing it over to me as soon as it was born. Although, obviously, considering she would be the one carrying it for 9 months and giving birth to it, the ultimate decision would be down to her. <br>  <br>  Being a dad is something I have wanted for a long time now. I do not know how I would be able to cope with the pain of knowing my child was aborted. It would be on my mind constantly.|`|Xmc8C2Psaa	HAVE THE BABY!!!! I'm 14...and if i had the choice i would have the baby all the way...i wouldn't give it up for adoption...for me it wouldn't be a consequence, it would be a gift...even if my parents didn't look at it that way. Being a teenager and having a baby is nothing to be  ashamed of...some people say you should...but really why should you? Because unlike others killing isn't what you want to do? Having a baby as a teen just means that you get to be with them longer than other people get to be with their children...if your 16 and have a baby, you get to be with your child like 25 years longer than someone who's in their 40s...so come on...bring on the thumbs down...this is the truth even if you don't like it. A lot of teens out there are having sex, so why should you be any different if an accident happens and you don't feel like killing your own baby?<br>  EDIT: btw cupcakes...so your saying that if your married and you become pregnant and have the child, and then your husband divorces you, you will kill your baby? So many teen moms are single...it's rare to see a teen mom who's still witht the dad, there are so many single moms out there...in fact i WANT to be a single mom!!!|`|YtSyCgwyaa	Have the baby!I'm 15 and pregnant.A complete mess up,but not a mistake.I am more than overjoyed for my little girl.I shouldn't have done it,but I wouldn't change this for the world.It's my fault,not the babies.|`|CXHY5Inxaa	have it, EVRYONE SHOULD SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES and learn a lesson to stop bein a ho, iftheirnot married|`|A9nsilNNaa	I am not extremely anti-abortion, but if the baby will have a good life, then have it!|`|ggo0etbEaa	have it. then if you don't think you can raise it, give it up for adoption|`|Jb9FsdrGaa	Definitely have it. Abortion is wrong.|`|frpCK0utaa	have the baby.|`|LaWOqsHmaa	Actually, commenting on the answers a few up from this, babies are a LOT more than blobs at 3 months. Acutally, I think they already have fingernails at 3 months. I would say have the baby, even if you feel the responsibility of raising a child it too great, then bless someone else with that opportunity who really wants it. People spend tens of thousands of dollars trying to get pregnant or trying to adopt just to have a child in their lives. To give someone that gift would make you feel so unbelievable. I had a baby girl all but two months ago, and to see her smile means the world.|`|FgnJ6X2laa	Definitly have the baby, regardless of the situation. Everyone should have a chance at life, and if someone isn't ready to take care of a baby then there is always the choice of adoption. Why waste life when someone out there is trying to get pregnant but they can't. But anyways my motto is, "If you're not ready for a baby then don't have sex." Plain and simple as that.|`|W6Z9mnZxaa	Have the baby. How do you think you were made? Would it be fair if your mom decided to abort you? Think, murder is illegal, and abortion is murder. You are taking away a life when you choose abortion. Remember.. a babies heart beats 21 days after conception. |`|3PrXrJiuaa	That is up to the individual in question. myself unless I was out of college I would choose to abort. But I would take preventative measures to avoid getting pregnant in the first place.|`|2IlAjYrHaa	I think it depends on your situation. I'm not saying to use it for a form of birth control.

MwakNF9Vaa	my son did not sleep through the night until he was about 10 months old. I tried everything but nothing worked, I did not see the point in letting him cry it out because he was still getting up to eat, so why let them cry when you know their hungry. My hubby and I had to take turns our son also woke up at 2 and 4 am. There was really no Magic wand you and wave to make a baby do something they are just not ready to do yet.  I'm 32 weeks along with another baby my son just turned 1 so you know I was soo tired getting up all night. He now sleeps through the night but he won't go to sleep before 9:30 he just won't and he sleeps until about 8:30/9 am. Now that I went through it with my son I know with this baby I need to expect that he will sleep through the night when he's ready not when I'm ready. It sucks girl I know but if your baby could help it he would sleep all night. There is no rule when a child should sleep all night I hear moms brag about their kids sleeping all night like they did something to make that happen. If a kid is not ready to sleep they won't period. I tried cereal bottles, crying it out, music you name it but the truth is each kid is different and when he's ready he'll sleep|`|d5BD0pGnaa	cause he is a baby, have you checked teeth? you could have another 2 yrs of sleep depravation yet... try and give him the silent treatment and dont change a nappy unless its dirty.  thats what worked best for me <br>  <br>  i feel for you |`|xkyBZ2kqaa	Carry him and make him sleep do it for few days and soon he sleep on his own|`|J1stiMioaa	my 16 month old hasnt slept through yet (wakes 4 times a night 4 no reason) and doesnt go to sleep until 11pm and my 7 year old didnt sleep through until he was 4 years old, so, on the grand scheme of things, 9 months isnt too bad! he will do it eventually
NhKOlXrZaa	First of all: stop calling, stop texting and STOP HAVING SEX with this jerk.<br>  <br>  Now, concentrate on what is important: you are going to have a baby.  In a month or so, your life is no longer going to revolve around you and what you want, it is ALL going to be about your baby.<br>  <br>  The one thing you said that really scared me is that "they are going to fight for custody".  You need to make sure that is not a possibility.  Talk to a lawyer and make sure you understand your rights as a single mother.  That may include NOT listing this guy as the father on the birth certificate.<br>  <br>  Please get your head straight and remember what is important.  If this guy is a jerk now, he will be a jerk then.  CUT HIM LOOSE and get your life in order.<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  <br>  So, I have thought about your situation some more, and I want to offer you some additional advice after reading your other question where you provided more details.<br>  <br>  He is 29, and you are 21.  He is in a position to marry this ex-girlfriend and turn your life upside-down.  Let me expain how.<br>  <br>  So, lets say you go ahead and share custody with him like you said you were thinking.  Now, he marries this girl.  And now they think it is a better situation for his child to live full-time with him and his new wife.  They are older and can give your baby a better life.  So, they take you to court.  And lets say the Judge does think that they are better to raise your baby, so he gives them custody and YOU have to pay THEM child support.<br>  <br>  I am sure this will be an unpopular suggestion, but here goes:<br>  <br>  Text him today and tell him this:<br>  <br>  "I have been thinking about our situation, and I am sorry.  I am sorry I lied to you so long ago when this whole thing started.  8 months ago I was with another guy, and he is the father.  I should have told you then, but I knew you would be so very angry.  I was scared I would loose you, and I never wanted that to happen.  But now I know it is time for me to be honest with you.  It would be unfair to you if I didn't tell you the truth.  I will leave you alone now so you can be happy with (whatever her name is).  I will not contact you again, and I will ask that you please not contact me.  Again, I am very sorry for all of this."<br>  <br>  Now, if you are able to convince this jerk that all of that is true, you will be the only one who ever has parental rights to your child.  And trust me, no amount of child support he can pay you will ever be able to make up for the pain you will feel if he takes your baby from you one day.|`|eIVy7xkXaa	I don't think a person who abandons you at 8 months and continues to have sex with you is worthy of your love or respect.  My guess is that, even though he's now going out with his former ex, you think that sex will keep him from leaving.  As a guy, my intuition tells me that having sex with him will not get him to come back.  <br>  <br>  But it's important to analyze the situation to make sure you haven't had your own missteps (since none of us are perfect).  <br>  <br>  My intuition tells me that, for now you should concentrate on being the best mom that you can, and document this (for your upcoming legal battle).  Have a support network of friends who care for you.  Write your arch enemy off.  You're in a better position, because it seems the disappointing excuse of a man will now go away.  I know of a woman whose mother decided to not include the biological father in the parenting process.  This woman went to a top college, a top graduate school, and now works in a law firm.  On top of that she's an awesome person.<br>  <br>  In addition to doctors, you need to also be talking to a lawyer I think.  There must be a way to get free, basic information somewhere.  Perhaps start with the Internet, then the library.  You might want to check out the domestic violence hotline people to see if they know of any good lawyers who are willing to do pro bono work.  You haven't said anything that implies assault and battery, but the domestic violence hotline people are the first people I could think of that would best begin to understand your predicament in terms of custody.<br>  <br>  I am not a lawyer, this is not official legal advice, etc.  Regardless of the outcome, I believe that your future newborn is worth every ounce of effort you can muster.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|TcR4EJjHaa	Instead of calling her names, you should really wake up.He is OBVIOUSLY using you for sex.<br>  <br>  STOP having sex with him! you are only hurting yourself, not to mention that you are putting your child at risk for STDs because you have NO clue if she is clean or not.<br>  <br>  Nobody here can tell you if he is going to come back or not.You need to get over him and start focusing on yourself and your child.He is not important anymore.<br>  <br>  Now, for the legal part.<br>  <br>  <br>  No man is legally recognized as the father until he signs the birth certificate OR paternity has been established.If he is not there during the birth, he can go to court and file for paternity/custody but, if you are a fit parent, he will only get visitation rights.Not full custody.<br>  <br>  If he wants to be apart of your child's life, that is great.He should be.Whatever happens between you two shouldn't affect the bond between father and baby BUT...he will not get full custody.<br>  <br>  Also, I would go for child support as well to help you and baby out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ePq2vUMmaa	Hes not a piece of meat. Let him make his own decision. As for the coming baby, just do all you can without him. Friends, siblings that can help you?|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	I am sorry that you are pregnant with his child, but guys are jerks who don't know what the heck they want. They commit then change their mind because they don't want to grow up. <br>  <br>  Believe me the same thing happened to me. I have started to let him go, and guess what? He's starting to show interest again... I know it may be harder since you are pregnant but try to let him go, he might come around again. If he doesn't then it wasn't meant to be. <br>  <br>  But be sure that you get child support from him!|`|osDQVLqNaa	You don't want a guy like that raising a child anyway. Tell him to get lost, and concentrate on getting yourself ready for the baby.<br>  Stop sleeping with him, for god sake. He's using you, and could be passing on god knows what infections. If he's sleeping with you and this other girl, how do you know there aren't other women as well? <br>  Make sure you let him know that just by abandoning you, he doesn't get out of his responsibility as a father, and that you will be filing for child support. You have nothing to worry about regarding them seeking custody of your child - he's abandoned you for another woman and wouldn't have a leg to stand on.|`|ym8bLfl2aa	who the f--- does he think he is?  ok you love him, and he is trying to throw you out!!! well tell him he isn't gonna see his baby much since that not fare to you i mean that's just wrong!!!! how can he sit a-- down when you are with a baby. i say tell him you love him (you probably told him  that before but still) and if he loves you he will come back. and if he loves his baby, he will come back.<br>  <br>  tell his ex to f--- her self<br>  <br>  P.S. keep your baby|`|r5EfuwqKaa	Sound to me like he just doesn't wanna take care of that baby. get child support from his punk ***. any man that Won't take care of a child isn't a man at all|`|2eVq2WOaaa	Hmm!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  dear u r not alone where are your parrents,talk to them to help u out first.<br>  <br>  <br>  the thing about ur bf, he only want sex thats all he can , he only worth this, becoz he is only a user and user have nothing to do. <br>  <br>  main problem as some one give u girls sweet words and smile u think he is ur dream guy, then u take them to ur bed and then they give u ****... so u cant get any thing out of it.<br>  <br>  my dear live ur own life with proud, just iqnore him , he will come back as he knows his real worth.<br>  <br>  live ur life for ur coming kid, not for that who left u when u need him.. <br>  <br>  concentrate on ur coming baby,.... congrates to u on becoming a loving mom ...<br>  <br>  <br>  bye tc n wasalam|`|XqfH76PMaa	He couldn't have picked a worse time to do this to you.  But, you have to concentrate on that baby.  He is obviously not mature enough to deal with this and is trying to "have his cake and eat it too".  You need to stop having sex with him, stop calling him and stop texting him.  I know it is hard and it hurts but he is doing you wrong.  He is more interested in moving on with this other woman than he is in you and your life.  He isn't worth it!  You deserve better and that baby deserves better than that!  You should just concentrate on you and your baby's lives and forget about him.  He can not take custody from you.  He is just running his mouth.  Ignore him and let him see how it feels.  Maybe later, after you have your life and head on straighter, you could think about getting back together, but right now, he is nothing but bad for you.  You are going to have this baby, who will love you no matter what...focus all of your love on him or her.  That is all you need....|`|vAMlA5waaa	If a man tells you he does not love you any more, is one thing, but when he tells you he is going back to his ex, and doesn't want her to know that you are still intimate, he get impatient with you, looking at his watch when you are talking, gets angry when you text or call him, what more do you want to read the red signal, until here and no further.<br>  <br>  Leave him alone, that way he won't be able to fight for custody because he was the one who actually left. Don't contact him until the child is born and you are applying for income support.<br>  <br>  I know it hurts, but you don't want to extend the hurt. There will be somebody else for you who will treat you with respect, all else is just pure nonsense. You don't want that for you and your child. Good luck.
M4WY8YEhaa	He's probably fine, but you can never be too sure, especially when it comes to young children. If you're worried, then you should probably get him checked out just to be safe.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	It really depends how old he is, and how hard he feel, from what height.  Personally, with a toddler who didn't have a major fall, I would just keep him under observation for a day or so.  If there is any vomiting, confusion, any reaction that isn't normal, it is probably a concussion , so you should take him to see a doctor. |`|dwu1b36xaa	You need to give more details...<br>  <br>  I have fell down stairs, up the stairs , just plain fell, fell off my bike, did a face plant, etc. Theres probably nothing wrong, everyone falls once in awhile. Wait a few days before taking him to the doctors or the hospital, to see if he is still ok. If he's not your best chance would be to call your Doctor first and ask about it. |`|XqfH76PMaa	He is more than likely okay.  I am giving you a link that lists things to look for before you take them to the hospital.  I hope it helps!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/firstaid_safe/emergencies/head_injury.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/firstaid_sa...</a>|`|11t7PuwKaa	If he is still falling with bumping his head, he can't talk yeat, so I suggest take him to the hospital just to check. Anyway he will be fine because toddlers fall down all the time.|`|ZRG18vnQaa	need more details , how old is he , did he fall staright on his head froma  standing position<br>  <br>  <br>  If in doubt go to the hospital NOW|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Here this link tells you what you need to do - I was going to copy and paste but it was to much.

He is still little and his head is very delicate, his brain can swell up depending on how hard he fell, but still its better to go now then to wait and see what would happen. It may look like nothing but could be serious underneath the skin!|`|ftLC9wtvaa	Are you serious, why are you on the internet asking us!? Here's an idea, pick up the phone and call a child health nurse or even the local hospital, they'll tell you if you should seek medical attention, they are medics, not us!!!|`|Fyodq34eaa	how old is he...?? anyway toddler fall all the time.. if he is not crying and his behavior is normal .. u shouldn't worry .. this Always happens..|`|2233c8a85a3d56f236d2005db5431c93aa	I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM TO THE ER JUST IN CASE HE STARTS TO FEEL KINDA WEIRD SO YA TAKE HIM.|`|qBaORER2aa	TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL....BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY HUN =]|`|crEyM8eLaa	yes yes yes dont let him fall asleep take him straight away whyare you waiting|`|3BS4fXy6aa	yes. you never know what has been damaged on the inside<br>  <br>  and **** you who ever gave me a minus
C22jeMVhaa	I'm a mother of two. I have talked(and apologized to) my husband about my pregnancies. Women just get emotional. There is nothing you can do about it. I am NOT a crier, but during my pregnancies I absolutely could not watch Hallmark commercials. I would cry for hours. It was horrible. My husband usually just gave me a good hug and let me cry. He was absolutely the best. As for her feeling sick. When is she taking her prenatals? I had to take mine right before I went to sleep, or I would be sick all day. Those pills are rough. Saltines first thing in the morning before she even gets out of bed helps some too. As for the advice about being a good father? The fact that you want to be says you probably are going to be. Just give everyone lots of hugs and tell them you love them every chance you get. Other than that, as they get older, consistancy is the most important thing. Talk to your kid about eveything all the time. Good luck to you both and I know it will be just as great for ya'll as it has .been for us. Enjoy your family<br>  |`|nmu6coapaa	Whatever you do, dont shout back at her when shes in a bad mood! I know you may be getting all the aggro but shes not angry at you I promise! My bf would constantly shout back at me and it made me feel like he didnt understand at all! Dont expect her to want to do much and always put her first! Theres not a lot you can do honey except let her know that you're there for her! As for tips and advice, there are always loads of people on here willing to help so hesitate to ask! Good luck and Congratulations! |`|9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	If you want to help you g/f during pregnancy and birth read this book, its called  The Birth Partner, Third Edition: A Complete Guide to Childbirth for Dads, Doulas, and All Other Labor Companions (Birth Partner: A Complete Guide to Childbirth for Dads, Doulas, &) thats the full title from amazon, its a great book it can show you how you can help during pregnancy and also A LOT of things that you can do during labour.<br>  Your G/f is a lucky girl to have such a concerned man in her life, just make sure in however you help her that you make sure she knows you love her and will be there for her throughout the pregnancy, having support is one of the most important things for a pregnant mom! <br>  <br>  <br>   |`|J1stiMioaa	i found dry toast as soon as i woke up helped as well as peppermint tea for sickness. as for the mood swings, sorry, but a pregnant woman is NEVER wrong and never to be argued with, this is all very normal and will settle not long after the birth. during the pregnancy just be supportive and do as you are told (sorry but that is only half a joke!) and you will find when the baby is born most of it comes naturally and the rest is trial and error.  congratulations and hope it all goes well for u!|`|9Guj407Caa	First of all.  I would like to say that I think it is very sweet that you are concerned and want to help.  As far as the feeling sick, it might help for her to eat 5 or 6 small meals a day or not eating large amounts of food at a time.  Saltine crackers help as well.  The mood swings, just try to be understanding and loving.  You can go to babycenter.com and sign up as the baby's daddy and it'll give you loads of tips.|`|3AKHk6vUaa	just be there for her have patience and understand. when the child is born just be the best dad you could be, be here for the mother and child, provide for them & raise and tech them well|`|kMNDcV6saa	well you cant really do much 4 her sickness, she can tell her doc, they have pills to stop the sickness. but u can rub her back her feet. run her bath water help her rest. don't let her get lazy but just try to easy her pain or whatever she wants.also i just wanna add it's help when the father is by the mothers side when she goes into labor. when the baby comes try to help with the baby without her askin u too, when the baby cry in the middle of try to get up a take care of the babies cry. that would help a lot.|`|hiiEQfaDaa	Yes it is absolutely normal....in most cases that feeling should go away by the end of the 1st trimester or around about 16 weeks......<br>  Just be very supportive and patient...help her with the daily chores and stuff...dont worry u will soon see a happy moomy!!!<br>  Good luck
XrKviWgSaa	you can just be late and getting ready to start a different cycle, this happened to be before because i was stressing that i might be pregnant. wait another week and if you still do not start your period get three HPT and if the first is positive take the other two to make sure.|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	You absolutely could be, take a test!<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|b5XqNCbDaa	If it was unprotected sex, then yes, you could definitely be pregnant. If you're already 4 days late, you should take a pregnancy test to find out for sure.|`|XqfH76PMaa	Could be pregnancy or could be that your are getting ready to start.  If you do not start in a day or two, I would get a test and see.|`|lL2L0UmHaa	you worried.. you wont know untill a positive pregnancy test.. do 3 when its positive.. jsut to make sure :P .. but you didnt use protection meaning you wanted this to happen GOOD FOR YOU!|`|dWG3TVk8aa	Yeah, it's possible. Get a pregnancy test.|`|amkvqb87aa	theres no exact way of knowing for sure. If you really want to know you should get a pregnancy test from the drug store. they're about $10. They work best if you take them first thing in the morning. However being 4 days late isn't too unusual. it may just be late because you're stressing. Even if you take the test and it comes up negative just knowing you're not should make your period come.|`|ZoKyFAxIaa	dont stress I was just eight days late and started this morning. but you could be. give it four more days then go buy a test and they are not all 10 bucks dollar store has em to for a dollar and they are just as accurate, |`|22TEmBdBaa	wow you're exactly the same as me! I'm 4 days late too...lmp as oct 18 and tried on nov 1st. lol! I'm 17 dpo and still awaiting that bfp...i'll i've been getting are bfn!|`|p3zm8mdyaa	quite often symptoms of early pregnancy are very similar to pending menstruation. a pregnancy test is your best bet.
0HP510Wxaa	sounds to me that you are pregnant//<br>  the blood could of been implantation bleeding since it was light.<br>  sounds to me like your pregnant.<br>  good luck.|`|CNRsWJM3aa	It sounds like you are. I am just over 4 weeks pregnant, went to a dr for blood tests as couldn't wait for a home preg test to work. So if yuo are eager to know like i was, just take the blood option. |`|b144c71c3a6b2fb244e240cc707db0dcaa	I know it a while to wait but i would wait till early december then do a home test.
