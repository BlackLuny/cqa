20090220103925AABnFB4	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Would you buy a house with high levels of radon but will be mitigated?	Thinking about buying a house with high levels of radon. The test showed a level around 10. We think the high level is due to the fact the house has been abandoned for a couple months but there is a mitigation system installed. We have turned it on and are going to retest. Even if the system works and reduces the levels below 4 my wife and I are a bit hesitant as we want to use our basement as a playroom for our kids. Anyone out there with a similar situation? Anyone currently live in a house with kids and have a high level of radon but lowered by a mitigation system? We are looking for a little first hand advice.       For everyone answering.  We know what radon is, we know how radon gets in, we know it can be mitigated below the EPA level of 4.  We have done a lot of research on it so you don't have to include it in your answer.  We just want to know if anyone has any first hand experience living in a house with a mitigation system with children.  Do you feel its safe?  Do you ever feel paranoid and if so is it overwhelming?  Our kid's lives are the most important thing and we don't want to buy this house if we cant use it to it full ability.  Thanks in advance.
20090220173812AA9JiTA	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What tree should we plant in our yard?	I really want to plant a tree in our yard this spring. But i can't decide what kind i want.. The arbor day website says were in zone 7 but some sites say where in 6, we live in western oklahoma, our summers can be pretty dry, and our soil has a lot of clay..  Our yard isn't super huge, and my fiancee wants a garden too, so we can't have a tree that gets super huge.  I would kinda like something that flowers in spring.  there is a tree that's kinda popular around here, it has white flowers in the spring, i think its some kind of pear tree that doesn't have fruit but i can't remember what its called.  I was also thinking of maybe a redbud tree, or an apple tree. or maybe a cherry tree. Ive no idea. I don't think my fiancee really wants something with fruit, because of the mess, but it think an apple tree might be ok.  Im open to just about any suggestions,  but something with flowers in spring and color in the fall would be nice, most everything here turns yellow in the fall.  If anyone has any experience or pros or cons of any of these trees i'd be grateful of any advice.

However, after baking a "take and bake" pizza directly on the stone, it now emits a terrible smell when heated.      My instructions said never to put oily foods directly on the stone, so I am assuming that the dough contained a high amount of oil or other fat, which is causing the odor.        I think the remedy would either be to burn it off at a high temp, or sand down the stone (sanding was mentioned in the instructions).  Has anyone tried either of these remedies?

They got COVERED in salt stains, it was really really bad, and I have one of those Suede and Nubuck brushes with the gum that they sell for ugg boots, but the stains were too bad.       So a lady at the store where I bought them told me to hand wash them with cold water and vinegar and it would come out. I checked online and it said something similar, so i did that. They dried, and now they have these weird patches where they are faded and it almost looks like snake skin if you look really close at it. they look awful!      I tried brushing and brushing but it doesnt help. I think the problem is that I got them too wet. Does anyone know what I can do? are they ruined? help!

Anyone will better understanding would be greatly appreciated; my husband and I live in a entirely electric (no gas) home, and I'm trying to find ways to cut down on our electric bill. We cannot, at this time, afford new appliances, and obviously we cannot unplug some of our appliances when not used (deep freezer, refrigerator). I try to limit the amount of laundry we do, but don't know some things- would it be more efficient to primarily use toaster oven and microwave vs. oven (of course, depending on amount of time), or turn off computer (I've been told it takes more power to stat and stop than let run idle), unplug small appliances (cable boxes and alarm clocks) that have a constant display time, etc...

I have a oval rod that comes from the ceiling that the curtain hangs on.   The curtain touches me and my roommates and it grosses us all out equally.   Not that we're gross and have a moldy shower curtain or anything =) it's just, we need some space.   We've started to only have half of the curtain in use and the other half is the wall that she tub stands against.  I've noticed that water has been getting in between the crack and the wall.   I want to use self-stick tiles to create a back-splash and I will caulk and seal the crack between the wall and the tub to prevent water from leaking down tot the floor.   Is this possible?
