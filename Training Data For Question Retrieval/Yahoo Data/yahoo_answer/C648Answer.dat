tK7XacH7aa	This is what I think she is thinking. First you are showing how much you care about how and how you will supposedly treat her well. Now that her bf knows that someone is after her (you) and he realizes how badly he's treated her he is going to change himself to keep his girl. Now the question comes down to her. Will she stay with her fiance now that he is bettering himself and realizes everything he has done wrong. Or will she go with you because it's a fresh start and you are proposing everything that you would do for her. Try to keep going, if you really meant that you want what's best for her then the results of what is to come will help her. She will either forget about you and just become a friend of hers because her fiance has improved and that is who she loved in the first place. Or she will be with you and live a happy life supposedly. Either way she wins. That house thing sounds okay, but going to eat at a restaurant or cooking a homemade meal at your house would sound best to persuade her. I don't know what else to say so, Good Luck!
QdCwBSVQaa	Truth?  I don't like the idea of red water.  It would remind me of Kool Aid.  How about using plain water, but putting red stones in the bottom?<br>  <br>  Like these, but in red:  <a href="http://www.jamaligarden.com/pID_17519.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamaligarden.com/pID_17519.as...</a>|`|YTasscmKaa	Wow, the colors of Imperial Germany. Cool.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	my wedding is going to be those colors also! I love it! Red and black are mine and my mans favorite colors.

tkpBDLwYaa	You are an adult, a married woman with a husband, a son, your own family.  Maybe examine why your mother's approval is so important to you.  Believe me, your son will suffer more from a grandmother who is so "conditional" in her relationships than he would from not having any contact with her at all.  When you grow up and leave home and form your own relationships, your loyalties lie with your husband and children.  If you don't mind me saying so, I think you're using your son to try to mend your relationship with your mother.  Your mother, in turn, is being very childish and manipulative in demanding you come to her.  <br>  <br>  We need our parents' approval when we are young, for we depend on them for our survival. If they don't love us, we die.  You are now a wife, mother, student and survive on your own.  Your mother's acceptance is no longer a necessity.  Stand up and tell her she is always welcome in your home, that you would love for her to have a relationship with her grandson, but you are a grown woman she has to stop her games and respect you and your husband.<br>  <br>  She is manipulating you.  Do you need that in your life?|`|6EazgAthaa	dont get angry|`|UQOfS3xGaa	You're a grown up now. If there's no sign that she is willing to change, then just let go. It's out of your hands. Put your energy to better use. Focus on being a good mother.|`|aPClcfh9aa	whatever you do, don't give granny an ultimatum. I would tell her that honestly, you are too busy to take such a long ride on the greyhound. (and believe me, with a 15 month old, it will seem like a lot longer ride than it actually is) and that you would really love for her to come see her grandson, and try to have the 2 of them (tony and granny) patch up their differences or agree to disagree before she comes. It is not fair for you to be caught in the middle, and have the baby suffer because people can't get along, she should at least try! If you have never been on the greyhound... It can be a pretty unpleasant experience. And stressful with small children.|`|gtr3CGU5aa	As one who comes from a very dysfunctional family myself, my advice is this:  Your mother is a loose cannon and once she becomes attached to your son - she will use him against you.  It is best that she not be around your son until he is quite older and can see for himself what she is like rather than get caught in the crossfire between your mother and you and your husband.  Find another baby sitter.......... she can see your son at family functions where many other family members will be.  DO NOT RELY ON HER FOR ANYTHING.|`|k7bBN9bHaa	Your mom must be a Leo like my mom. They always want there way no matter what. She sounds like my mother. I would take the bus trip and let her see him. Once she sees both of you guys she will be fine. Tony just needs to stay out of her way and let her say whatever she wants words can't hurt. I understand that is your husband but he still has to respect ya moms no matter what the heck comes out of her mouth. Girl I understand ya pain. I been there. You need to make amends with your moms and she needs to see that baby. Please get on the bus and see her. Hey she might even drive you guys back.(SMILE)|`|rEx5MSdQaa	to tell you the truth is up to you.<br>  you have to make the choice on your own.<br>  don't let others decide for you and make the wrong choice.|`|zMJDtFgGaa	Personally I tend to be very patient with issues like this. I would not give her an ultimatum because that would be one more thing for her be mad about. Her not liking Tony is one thing, and Very normal if she feels that he "took her little girl away." I will probably feel the same way in about 15 or 20 years with my own girl. Her resenting you for a note you wrote when you were 16 is a whole different issue. That is just peaty. If you can let it go and (I'm not saying you don't) love her for being your mother, then her anger can only hurt herself. Don't let it bother you too much and just hope she comes around. In the mean time take care of that baby and be as good a mom as you can. This will show your mom, by example, how she should act.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Tell you mother if she wants to see you then she will have to accept your son a s well . You a package deal now,|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You have the rest of your life to work this out.  Do not give her an ultimatum and stop trying to get her to see your son.  That will work itself out as well.<br>  <br>  She will eventually want to see him and may be more amendable to plans.  Right now, she is not ready.  You have your family.  Grandma needs more time than you are giving her.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	send her a big pic of your little one with his arms held out and give it a mushy title like<br>  <br>  "Grandma, I love you......won't you forgive and forget so I can be in your life?"|`|ON84EQaBaa	you sound like you're really hurt behind all of this, you are 23 years old with a family. I know you love your mom & want to see her, do you think she's acting like this because Tony took her baby from her? Maybe she's a little jealous that you have a family of your own now. you need to try & talk to her and really find out whats the problem. She couldn't dislike Tony that much where she won't come to see her own grandson,  it's been two years! You need to focus on finishing school, and loving your family. Hopefully she come around one day.|`|Plq0BGSgaa	it sounds to me like you're more of an adult than she is....<br>  <br>  and you and your mothers relationship sounds like a bad breakup.<br>  <br>  you are not in the wrong.<br>  <br>  why should you have to take your child on a freakin BUS to see her.<br>  <br>  she should definately make a better effort instead of make up excuses.<br>  it sounds to me like she's lazy and bitter and cant get over things.<br>  <br>  if she wont come see the baby then id say to just write her off.<br>  <br>  your child is better off without her than growing up knowing grandma wont visit bc she's immature.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	she needs to get over herself, she is a mother and grandmother. you don't have time for this anymore. and if she wants to see your baby she can come over to you. the baby doesn't need to be on a bus so you can end up with a horrible stay it sounds like it will be. <br>  she needs to grow up. don't go and enjoy your son and husband. they child at least has 1 grandmother that will give him the time and energy he deserves. that bus ride is way to long anyhow- you will never make it sane with a child!
6tW2DFYSaa	He sure does have alot to think about.  He just needed someone that night and didn't realize what he was thinking.  You need to tell him about your pregnancy and of course this will add more problems on his side.  You should have not force yourself to love someone who is not interested on you.  Now you don't know if he will be with you or he might go back with his own family.  Take care!|`|iOqmoIrcaa	You should expect nothing.  He made himself quite clear.  Thousands of children are raised by single parents, and they do quite well as long as that parent is a good one.  Inform him.  And then move on without him.|`|owjZhOOhaa	this is a really difficult situation. there are several ways this situation can play out. 1) he can either be happy about your pregnancyy and support you by being with you and the baby 2) he can be happy about the pregnancy and support you but not be with you 3) he can be a jerk about the pregnancy and deny that he is the father and don't help you out at all until you get a DNA test and prove that he is the father. <br>  <br>  This is definitely not something that you should hold off from him if he is the father. You should tell him as soon as possible. I hope that you have considered all of these options and I hope that everything works out for you.|`|3bf6bf2fa95deff37a266b5813651ca7aa	To be honest, it sounds like your trying to trap him. Just because your pregnant does not mean he's gonna want to be with you and it doesn't mean that he has to be with you. Move on and find someone who actually wants you, the guy has already made it clear that he doesn't. Your only going to make him think your crazy!|`|yIGVOqXdaa	expect nothing. He has already told u he is not interested...you should have thought about that before having unprotected sex with him. You made the bed now you have to lay in it. Good luck|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Nothing. That way you won't be disappointed. Tell him and God bless and good luck|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	Depends what kinda guy this is. If he's responsible for his actions, he'll man up and have to become a dad.<br>  <br>  If he's just a loser... he'll tell you to hit the road and not talk to him again. At this point... you may consider putting your child up for adoption if you don't want to raise it alone.<br>  <br>  If you do, I guess all you can do is collect child support!
F47MyGDSaa	That's a lot for you to take on, but if you can manage (keep up grades, be well rested-and it sounds like you are most times) then it's not a BAD schedule. You do have to do a lot for your brother's though, which can put a lot of pressure on a teen.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Everyone is busy it's not like your unique.
eJTqTvp4aa	maybe he's scared. Usaully boys are like that, they wait like 2, 3 monthes to ask you out which is pretty stupid.<br>  <br>  also, if he has friends that may "act up" when they go out with someone. That kinda makes them nervous, which is really annoying.<br>  <br>  but thats rarely to happen<br>  so the main reason is probably because he's shy...<br>  <br>  <br>  why dont you ask him?<br>  <br>  or send him something anomynous?<br>  .-. just some adivce. DONT DO IT if there may be some things that may get you hurt. in an emotional way|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	U should flirt with him back, maybe he will notice the returned feeling and will ask you out.|`|QxIwRURAaa	ask him out....or ask to hang out with him on a weekend or something? idk<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmnQ4nQNJOPqiK4nqD28rETsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223154657AA5zPqM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|tkpBDLwYaa	The best thing is to get a mutual friend to introduce you and then you have an opportunity to actually talk to this person.   Even if nothing happens right then, you will feel more comfortable saying hello to him in the halls.  Short conversations could turn into long conversations, or it may turn out you don't like him all that much after all.|`|k8mfDeELaa	Next time he looks at you or you pass him just smile and say hello.  He might be shy and just waiting for a signal from you to take things further.|`|ZeIZibpVaa	He obviously has interest in you,If he looks at you all the time.<br>  <br>  Hello!Study date!
2vaGZ4eDaa	There are two possibilities:  He might lie because he is manipulative, or he might lie because he fears your judgment.  You can't control the first, and if he is a habitual liar through no fault of yours, then you just can't trust him.  If he fears your judgment, you have to ask yourself if you don't react too harshly sometimes over trivial things.  Like a child who is punished for small mistakes, people will try to hide themselves to avoid their wrath.|`|WsMXhqcZaa	I know people will tell  you to leave him, but you won't because you love him. So the next step is to adapt. He's going to lie and it is a waste of time trying to figure out when and where he's lying, so stop trying. <br>    Everything he says and I do mean everything, take with a grain of salt. It's as if he's telling you a story. <br>    Also, have a separate checking account and make sure you manage the money. Don't ask him where he spent it. It doesn't matter. Just be aware. <br>    Once you adapt, your life will be much smoother and happier.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	My Best Friend does this and he is Married and it is a problem. Here is my outlook on his problem and perhaps it will relate to your. Most the tiem he lies about non sequential things and it is usually obviouse. More so to me as his Best friend. I have found he has low self esteem and thinks the lies he tells make him somehow look better. He does not do it to hurt anyone or to be manipulative. He is just trying ot look cool or sound interesting. The worst part is that he is cool and interesting. The lies just detract from that. <br>  <br>  I would try to accept these lies as a self esteem issue on his part. Since he is not willing to speak to someone about this privately I would suggest a Marriage Counselor. You can tell him you want to work on this together and that you personally need to go. The Counselor will help with these issues.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think he trying to maybe impress you or he lack in confidence,How was he brought up does that have any bearing to this issue,I have a family memeberwho he tell stories and we no half of them are not true but he so funny, but i think he does it more for fun than harm<br>  I think you need to sit him down and talk to him but do not make him walk over egg shells as nobody changes over night|`|TbnI8F5Iaa	RUNNNNNNNNNNNNN, you sound like me when I first got married told him to see a counselor we ended up getting an annulment based on fraud and he's is an actual socio path if you dont have any children run as fast as you can and fight for your money please run if he lies to you he doesnt love you period! Be as nice as he wants (that s a lie to) he s faking his caring please run I wouldnt wish what i went through on my worst enemy!|`|AuKKjaxaaa	If you can't trust him, I don't see how you can remain married to him.  Marriage is an act of love and trust.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Divorce him. Liars can't be trusted, and if there's no trust...there's no marriage.

g3l5f9iwaa	That IS weird, since you didn't do anything to warrant his behavior. I guess the only thing you can do is just wait it out, and finally he will tell you. I can't imagine why he is acting the way he is. The only obvious thing would be that maybe he feels you don't really want to be with him, in one way or another. But I have no idea why he would think that as it sounds like there isn't anything you said to make him feel that way. Maybe he's picked up on the fact that you don't actually want to really get married. But then probably neither does he! So....it's pointless to badger him (as it sounds like you know), so I guess I would just wait it out and in the meantime be friendly and open, as usual.
SovaFpN8aa	Dude, I checked your profile. You seriously need some help!|`|kbz5S3waaa	having sex feels good, and when your horny your body is craving sex, it's craving that good feeling.

Please go to watch Spongebob and leave the Grown ups room.|`|749K6Hysaa	To answer your questions, It feels like, you just need to be next to that one person, you have to have their attention and most likely their touch. So yes, it does make you want it. It is natural to become horny, especially after you have hit puberty and for a girl when she goes threw her onthly cycle. You just need to have a converstation with yourself to figure out what choices you want to make in your life. Defiantly talk with your parents, if they are not around, a school nurse, she can give you useful information. My best advice is, No matter what choice you make, get educated about it first.  Good luck! :0)|`|KSFMUnlbaa	well when i get horny i Just feel drawn to my junk Just wanna Touch it and play with it it is hard to explain i guess but i just get warm and drawn to it lol

GqhtePhgaa	Go with your gut.  Regardless of his feelings being "real", your perception of what's going on will dictate how this relationship goes.  If you are constantly wondering when the whole thing will blow up, it will likely blow up at sometime.<br>  <br>  Can you really count on anyone's feelings at any age?  My mom's boyfriend is 77 and I honestly don't think she can count on his feelings being genuine and not changing.  So don't get hung up on age.

Women become bonded to any male they spend a significant amount of time with. Slow down, I'm all for sex in a trusting relationship without all the guilt and shame that often get's attached.

Your body is not fully developed, and won't be for a few more years.

Have sex and see how long you stay together. See how much you do fight. Guys are always searching for that first time feeling. There is only one, but guys still search. Are you able to give that every time? Why would you want to give up the happiness you have now? Sex doesn't make a relationship better or guarantee what is already good stay that way. Being ready and being mature means your supporting your own lifestyle. It means that if anything goes wrong you can take care of it without running to mom and dad. It means that your doing it with your parents blessing. Meaning your not being sneaky. Enjoy your youth. Don't be so anxious to give away your most Precious treasure to someone who is here today but maybe not tomorrow. You feel your in love. Just let it mature some more. good luck|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	ALL RIGHT!<br>  You have your own job ,your own home and transportation and a job to pay for it all you go g/f!<br>  That way you can pay for all the kids your going to end up raising alone!Isn't it great?You can be just like the woman with the 14 kids!<br>  Also, guys will think you are a total whore if you ever get dumped by or break up with the guy your with and the guys  will treat you like one,That IS what your aiming for isn't it?Well that is what you'll get with that lifestyle along with with some possible diseases.<br>  Just remember :<br>  Sex makes babies<br>  ALL birth control has a failure rate<br>  No birth control will keep you from getting used for sex and dumped regardless of whether you love the guy and/or you are pregnant by him.<br>  Condoms do not protect against herpes or aids.<br>  You have ALL this to look forward to.<br>  You are taking a risk on the consequences I just warned you of hon, the ONLY thing you will get out of it is a few orgasms.|`|V2ZKTMOJaa	not to go all crazy white catholic girl on you, but the thing is, if someone asked you tomorrow, "would you marry ________?"

Continue to have fun with this person.  However do the fun things that 14 year olds are supposed to do, go to movies, go shopping together, or bowling, or putt putt, or nature walks, bicycle rides together, school dances etc. Not Sex,  You are too young, see what the future holds and if you are still together in 3 or 4 years, then it will be more reasonable to consider it, and waiting will make it all the better at that time.|`|HFsRHZS6aa	What is up with you kids and wanting to have sex so fast? It's like you're making it a competition or something. Seriously...It's not that fun when you're younger. Why not wait another three years?

I'm going to sound like a bloody school health teacher here, but I'll still say that there's much more to love than sex. Just wait it out, will ya? There's no rush.|`|qgEW5Koaaa	I don't mean to be discouraging but relationships that start at your age don't typically last forever and girls that lose there virginity at that young of an age don't tend to realize that.

But if you do, make sure your safe so you dont end up with a baby!|`|sC3vgYxfaa	i'm sorry, but i think you're still too young. your relationship will change if you have sex. you could get pregnant or get an std. i think you should wait until you're better informed.|`|xUvYQ0PHaa	Are you out of your mind, Are you crazy your too young to have  SEX you should`nt have mention the word SEX your way too young ok.|`|2VqpmyNfaa	People always think having sex is the meaning of love......<br>  <br>  Kid when  you are older you will understand what I am talking about.

AA11899313	Oh dear! Oh deary dear!!<br>  <br>  Look at it this way.  Does it matter that he might not (as you put it) 'like you back'?  Does it really matter?<br>  <br>  If it does actually matter, then say nothing at all about him, to him.  That way it won't matter because you won't know.<br>  <br>  If your 'fondness' for another person is dependant upon their returning that feeling, then it doesn't say much for that feeling. Does it?<br>  <br>  I have a photograph of a young 20 something woman, she is peering down at the street through net curtains, disturbed while half way through changing her clothes and is dressed in some rather beautiful lingerie.  I also have a painting (watercolour) of a huge 18th century timber built boat shed, both of these I love along with a particular brand of ''Magnificent''  Italian chocolate ice cream.<br>  <br>  None of these things returns my feelings for them, but it doesn't matter as I see the beauty that I see in them.<br>  <br>  Liking or Loving someone is not about 'Bookkeeping' and or the 'balancing of numbers' nor about actually saying, ''I'm ONLY going to like you if you like me in return'' ~ does it!<br>  <br>  If it does, then sorry, if it were you liking of me, then it wouldn't actually count for much if it were to ''depend upon........''<br>  <br>  Try being honest with your self about this and simply accept your feelings towards him for what they mean and are, and not for what he may or may not feel in return.  And then be honest with him.  You never know, he might just see you as being incredibly brave about it all.<br>  <br>  Take care. <br>  Sash.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	he most likely does, otherwise i don't think he would care much at all if you liked someone.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	My guess is the reason he really wants to know is, he's hoping it's him!<br>  <br>  When he gets pushy about it, just laugh and say "It's my secret.  Maybe it's you!" Give him a wink, and walk away.<br>  <br>  Or, just go with "well, I didn't want to say anything, in case you didn't feel the same way, but hey, it's you!  Hope that doesn't freak you out".<br>  <br>  Yes, there is a bit of risk involved in telling him it's him. But good relationships take a bit of risk.<br>  <br>  And if he's not interested, you can quit wasting time on him and look around more.|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	you should definatly tell him becuase he DEFINATLY likes you, guys dont ask and desperatly want to knwo these kind of things unless they like you, he wants to know who you like because hes wnats to know who hes up against, or maybe he know syou like him too.<br>  definatly tell him DO IT!<br>  <br>  worse comes to worse, he says he doesnt like you, well then at least you've finally told him and im more then sure he isnt going to freak out.<br>  <br>  if your still worried tmoro that he'll freak out then say something like "erhhmm well dont freak out ok.. but its you" somting like that :)<br>  <br>  good luck anyway,<br>  x|`|qqi2YlABaa	tell him to ask you questions about the guy i like and answer him truthfully. don't hold back!! you may regret it if you do hold back!! and i can almost guarantee that he likes you. make him guess and at the end of the day if he hasn't gotten it, tell him! he will want to go out with you then, TRUST me!|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	just tell him|`|5Etwhg5Iaa	Say to him ask questions and i will give you answers thats what i would do or just tell him because me and the boy i like who likes me was talking about this today and we was like i knew you fancied me because you kept asking and trying to guess and basically it means that they are interested ;) So GET IN THERE BABY !!|`|12OHBv6uaa	he probably already knows that you like him but wants to hear it from you! just go for it you've got nothing to lose
KHC2oE8iaa	just like i knew he would. we always come back. we're like the common cold us dudes; simple and yet hard to be rid of. the decision is yours really. sh*t happens and you move on. but as stated it's entirely up to you. but it sounds like you've already made your decision. "it was so cute." chicks smh. lol<br>  <br>  that decision is up to you though. but i honestly think your going to take him back. because if him yelling at you still makes him look good to you then obviously you haven't had enough from him. if you were hurt and it still bothers you let him go. if your sure your over it then take him back.|`|qgEW5Koaaa	No one can really make that decision for you. It depends on how long you two have been together and how much he really means to you. If this was just a one time thing than maybe, but if you think he would do it again than definitely no. In the end it all depends on you and what you want. Think about if it is worth it to wait a little longer for someone who will treat you better.
SHARt1k3aa	Well with negative thinking like that who would want you.  You sound like a dark cloud.  My god.  Have you heard of the video "The Secret."  You are a perfect candidate for this.  I recommend you go out and buy it right after reading this, it will change your life.  They have it in book form, video dvd, audio book, whatever you do... get it.  Trust me.  You my dear are causing your own misery and you need to stop!|`|1HfLkTrdaa	I have proof that you are wrong about dreams not coming true. It came true for this couple in their 60s. See link below.<br>  <br>  I'm a success story as well. I got divorced at age 28 after 9 years of marriage. Was alone for 12 years before I met someone. He was 45 and I was 40 at the time.... and now we've been together now for 8 years.<br>  <br>  Love comes to a lot of people of all ages all over the world everyday.  Whether or not you'll find love has a lot to do with your attitude...and whether you'll allow love into your life...and there's a BIG difference between true love and the romance stuff you see in the movies. <br>  <br>  You are right about one thing... that no one can do it for you, not even God. God's not about to force things on us that we're not ready for or willing to accept.  Since God gave you a free will,  the power is really in your own hands.  You need to CHOOSE to believe that God blesses us with love, and that with the proper attitude and appropriate action and by not giving up.... love will eventually be yours.|`|AA11388175	you dont say WHY you cant find a gal... i have this guy friend, older by far than you, that says the same thing...but when he FINDS a real woman that wants him, he just isnt interested in HER...he wants one of those gals that don't want him...<br>  keep looking...|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Frank!  Come on now, you are not a freak/mutant of nature.  That's silly to think that.  I'm your age and in kind of the same situation...been in some lousy relationships in my years.  However, I don't think  I'm a freak.  I have had bad luck with the wrong men.  I think maybe you've had some bad luck with the wrong women too?  Sounds that way.  At times it is very lonely and having those thoughts are normal...(at least I tell myself they are).  If I'm lucky enough one day to find someone who deserves me..then I'll be happy but if I'm suppose to be alone then I'll have to deal with that.  I don't think I want to be unhappy the rest of my life so I'm choosing to be as happy as I can be..alone.  Happiness comes from within Frank..you have to make your own happiness and love yourself for who you are.  Don't think your happiness depends on whether or not you have a woman in your life.  Good Luck :-)|`|3bafa98a86a650c6b22d2db59560ed1aaa	thats what hookers are for dude...your too good for the ladys anyway..there loss.your foot loose and fancy free... i,m jelous !! go on a cruise ship,plenty of ladys looking for luv there,and if that dont help,get a pet canary.like the bird man of alcatraz,watch re runs of the odd couple,works for me|`|aDhZIhQcaa	I am 49yrs old, good looking, and healthy and educated.  I have been married a few times (all nurses are) and have been in a few long term relationships.  I just found out that I have never truly been in love until now.  I found my man on an on-line dating service.  He has been through the same thing and he's 55yrs old.  I wasn't really looking, I was just wanting friends or someone to connect with.  My late husband passed away in June after 11years of marriage.  It was hard to take a look at myself and realize that I had never been in love before and it was scary.  This man I met and I e-mailed for weeks, then talked on the phone, for weeks, then met and it was "magic".  It is like we have known each other our whole lives.  Don't give up.  Pray to God.  That's what my mother did and his mother did.  They prayed that God would bring someone special and different into our lives and voile', here we are.  I have been truly blessed.  And everything about us is perfect and natural and open.  We laugh, talk about everything, make love like we are teenagers, and trust each other, implicitly.  Just remember that you have a lot to offer some special woman, and stop settling.  Never settle for anything less.  Good luck

JG7Dlnm3aa	kay, so you heart your ex, but now your current bf ain't payin enough attention to ya? rite?<br>  kay, so you need to evaluate your feelings for each guy, and then you need to decide whose worth it and who ain't. then you gotta decide to what length will you go to gain this guy's affection, and you need to treat them with the same affection you feel you deserve. you have done nothing wrong (if you did tho, it would be different...) and you need your bf to understand that, and for him to luv you. but, if that just ain't happenin, then you need to decide if you two are actually right for eachother and all.... kay hun? just think it through, take a breath, and remember that it could be worse, and that if it's absolutely nescessary, you may even need to evaluate yourself... kay? good luck!|`|ExaerfDraa	Sounds to me like your playin games like a little kid and he dont want to take your ****.

Maybe he wasn't far from the truth.|`|JuNf9cnJaa	Perhaps the fact he can't trust you is one indication your relationship is shot...<br>  Secondly, the fact you jumped to a new bf right away and you still have feelings for your ex means you really don't "love" either of them and this is merely hormones raging! <br>  Thirdly, you obviously don't know what love is all about, because if you were truly in a loving relationship, then your partner would not listen to what someone else says because he would know weather or not it happened.<br>  Fourthly, pay attention to school, and stop investing your youth on dumb little boys who are just as hormonally raging as you are... its pointless... you might as well focus get good grades and hey, maybe when you are in college and understand a little more about the morality of a relationship you will find some "man" who actually has a career ahead of him.  <br>  When the love triangle is that mangled its because you don't know what your doing, so until you do.... relax!|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	You must be hot to trot, You animal, do you have that much to offer that you need your ex and current boyfriend to make you happy?<br>  <br>  If that's the situation then just forget about those two for the time being  (they'll come back for treats) start new, there must be another guy you like, start dating him. <br>  <br>  Try not to lead the two exes along.

As his girlfriend, you have a right to know why he's being so distant. If he isn't interested in the relationship anymore, he needs to tell you. It sounds to me like he still wants to go out with you, but is debating on whether or not he believes you kissed another guy. Trust is very important, and if he can't get past this then you're relationship isn't going to go anywhere. Sit down, tell him how you feel, and ask him why he's acting so strange. Good luck with everything!|`|H1eshhEIaa	you are torn between him and your ex, that is the first problem.

Only thing I was 8 years older than the younger daughter so we didn't have a triple family marriage.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	It's an odd coincidence, but it's not completely unheard of, and really, there's nothing wrong with it at all.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Nope, why would it be wrong? They are not related in any way.<br>  <br>  In bigger families, this used to be pretty common. Two of my uncles married two sisters.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Its fine:) as long as brother and sister are not marring eachother than theres no problem..|`|ClQCFsqOaa	Pretty kinky.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Creepy.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	nothings wrong with that..|`|KSFMUnlbaa	i think it would be amazing to have a family so close|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	I knew a family of three sisters who married three brothers. <br>  <br>  It's not wrong.|`|sCPrXGoIaa	nothing wrong wit it...i think that it would be cool.
qxpF5IYSaa	From what it sounds like is that you have gotten almost every other girl you wanted except this one. Since she is one of the only ones to say no you almost can't believe it and she is playing rather than you getting almost anyone.
1OxiOk2taa	No one can tell you what to say to your best friend. If you are turly great friends- it just comes from your heart. You can say things like you are friends with ehr because she is super friendly, and you enjoy being around her.|`|kMqh9hFlaa	Tell her that you can always count on her. Or maybe that you lways have a good tim ewith her. Something like that don't read to much into it.
5P3cHR4Taa	Marriage might be over-doing things a bit.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	They are getting the number from somewhere and because they are guys, I wouldn't take this likely.  Surely you have talked to her about it.  What does she say?  How do they know that she is your GF?  At least 4 men know more about you than you should be comfortable with.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	sadly i think she is f-ing them and then doubling getting off by having them prank you in front of her or when she knows you'll be near her and she can see your reaction|`|JxUFDutxaa	Your girlfriend is still cheating on you...<br>  Don't settle..find someone who will never think of cheating..|`|DJLz6o8Iaa	wow,thats very hard! you should try to investigate first to see if thats true,if its true ,shes not the right one for you,sorry!<br>  good luck|`|9a3fC9mOaa	I would leave her... There is a reason these people are calling...|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	Sorry buddy, but she's a first class whore.|`|RSbn5STjaa	She's a slut.  Dump her.|`|DWLbXd79aa	dude , how do u think they got ur number? yes she cheated on you!!!!! move on , be smart dont stay|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	Ah. I understand you love her but, you need to get rid of her! She sounds like a whore. You don't need anyone like that. She cheated on you once, she probably is cheating on you again by the looks of it. Get rid of her, and find a good girl you can settle down with.|`|ePYR5RpLaa	Its probably some idiots prank calling you.|`|4TXQje2Daa	ask her .. tell her to be honest.. annd <br>  get checked! if that guy was serious, then you have herpes too. thats another way of finding out|`|mcKKdbhgaa	Of course she is cheating- are you co-dependent?<br>  <br>  Once a cheater- always a cheater!|`|VZFEB85Iaa	maybe they were drunk and prank called you.|`|oebqzgNraa	first things first. you have to talk to her. people do evil things. and if you love her, you have to trust her. i mean theres always that question "will it happen agian?" im not a cheater but ive been cheated on and i know how it feels. are you sure this isnt the same guy calling you? he might just be trying to piss you off, but is to chicken to call w/out a blocked number. if she is leavin all night and shes getting phone calls in the early morning or late night than id be concerned. however i think this person is just trying to tick you off. but trust your gut more than anything.<br>  however, i dont think shes cheating.|`|lK8D17WIaa	your life is mest up|`|x98z1Mx5aa	Does your girlfriend know about this? You should talk to her about this, don't believe everything you hear. It could have been just a bunch of guys that dislike her. If she says she hasn't, then you need to trust her. Trust is the most important thing in a relationship, without trust you have no relationship. Talk to her and tell her how your feeling, and if she says she isn't cheating then follow your heart. Cheat once shame on them, cheat twice shame on you.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	Sounds to me she could be cheating or they could be calling just to mess with you. But you dont want to marry a woman who sleeps around on you, because that means she'll do it again. Plus think of it this way, you are putting your health at risk with her, you dont want stds. I hear they arent fun. If i were you id go with my gut. But in my own opinion i would dump her. Thats ridiculous those phone calls.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	trust is no way to have a relationship, it will only destroy it. You need to ask her, if you still dont believe her and not trust her, i would definately ask yourself if this is what you want in your future, especially if you want to marry her. It sounds bad to me, but even asking may not reveal the truth!|`|RMGzjECmaa	tell her... get a std test <br>  <br>  if so dump her (my point of view)|`|V2ZKTMOJaa	once a cheater, always a cheater, get out while you can dude, you relation"ship" is sinking fast. im really sorry if you think you're in love with her, but true lovers don't cheat. good luck!!<br>  peace. love. a.|`|vTra7n5baa	Yes, you should be suspicious.  It sounds very odd and seems to have happened all at once, no?  Talk to her about this, particularly the STDs.  She may not have herpes, but could have something else.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	if she cheated once before she will probably do it again. If you trust her then ask her about it and move on. It could just be people playing a prank. Trust your guy instinct its usually right. Do you think she is cheating or not?|`|bP1opFVAaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater. I think she is cheating on you. She doesn't deserve your love if she's into other guys, dump her.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	id hold off if youre planning on marrying her.. thats just some really immature crap and i dont see how they would have gotten your number unless its a public number or she told them it..|`|iUTx8jrHaa	of course she is cheating. sometimes when we love someone we dont see even the more obvious signs. It seems like she is way too easy.|`|krIKhZzcaa	Yes, I think she's cheating :\ And if its love, mutual love, then she wouldn't be cheating on you. So I think you need to break off this relationship as soon as possible. :\<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|RUKh37e9aa	Sounds like a bunch of immature guys that are trying to frame her or get her in trouble..|`|qfhoCCzvaa	i think shes TOTALLY cheating!!! dump her and see how she feels, that'll teach her|`|bxj7EWx4aa	good luck with that one <br>  (HERPES)|`|BBpUk1LHaa	These guys are probably screwing with you! Cause having herpes shouldn't be something to be proud of! If you find that your gf is acting weird then there might be something up but from what you say those guys are saying they are either serious boneheads or just jack a**es that  dont have any thing better to do but mess around with peoples love lives! Also the last time your gf cheated on you was when she was drunk so she didnt have as much control of her self so you cant really put that against her.|`|uZG1kjvbaa	iIt sounds like someone trying to mess with you, but if you are un-sure, ask her.|`|RLMbTf3gaa	idk sounds like they are trying to prank you. but i would watch her...|`|bDCSxkJtaa	do you have herpes if she gave them to one guy she could have given them to you personally i wouldn't be with anyone who cheated on me but this sounds like someone trying to wind you up OR is she getting them to phone coz she doesn't want to be with you and wants you to end it. I hope she's not but it's worth thinking about good luck with it|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	It sounds to me like these guys are just trying to harass you and nothing more.  Did you ask her about it?  If a part of you is unsure about it all then try to catch her in the act.  If she is not doing anything wrong then you won't catch her but if she is then sooner or later she will be found doing something wrong by you. <br>  I would never just believe a phone call from some guys though.  These guys just sound like they are trying to be cruel for their own amusement. Sad but true.|`|r1IUOJ6Iaa	lawler u been cheated on boii!!! Ask that b**** straight up!!!!|`|Oe4FosAMaa	honestly... it could be both ways.<br>  But you need to ask her.|`|XrnXhWtTaa	These dudes are messing with you... no one has an affair and then calls to throw it in someones face unless they already know each other. Did the voice sound familiar? <br>  <br>  Don't marry this chick... she cheated on you and you already have doubts. Really want to add a legal marriage in the mix? Be smart about it, man. You don't want these head aches. Move on and find a woman who respects and loves you.|`|8UD5I3xzaa	well first id ask her about it but it sure does sound like she is cheating on you. you shouldnt marry someone who you have your doubts about.|`|np5VgFelaa	First off, it depends on how old you are. If you are still in high school or college, then these guys could just be idiot little boys trying to get a rise out of you. Personally, it sounds like a giant prank to me but you can never be sure.<br>  <br>  Secondly, talk to your girlfriend. Tell her that you care about her and don't want there to be any secrets between the two of you. Let her know that you're anxious about the fact that she already cheated once but that you trust her and you trust that she will be open and honest if something DID happen.<br>  <br>  Also, you should get an STD test, just to be safe.|`|tXjwuTjlaa	Honestly, the only way you'll know the truth is if you ask her and you have enough trust to know if she is lying or not. It sounds to me like their just trying to piss you off but it could go either way.|`|xiOiRE1Kaa	Maybe one of your friends got mad at you and told all his friends to tell you that. I seriously doubt anyone would be laughing if he just found out he had herpes.
Zca1PGERaa	valentines day ?|`|PHp71Xt7aa	Valentine's Day. This guy that I really liked sent me one confessing his feelings for me & then asking me out. Inside was a movie ticket & a red rose was attached. <br>  He said:" I could never tell you in person just how you make me feel, I can't breathe when I am around you, let alone say anything.

OmUlmhPvaa	Disney is a great idea!!  Very family friendly and they do have packages for vow renewals.  Here is the website... <br>  <a href="http://www.disneyweddings.go.com/site/gate/index.jsp?backLocation=wvh" rel="nofollow">http://www.disneyweddings.go.com/site/ga...</a><br>  <br>  Also, some hotels around beaches in the U.S. have packages for vow renewals as well.  And since you mentioned Florida, Key West might be another option for you too.  Lots to do and gorgeous sunsets at Mallory Square!  (My hubby and I went there last year and had a blast!)  Just do a Google search on Key West and there will be lots of information for you to look over.  Good Luck :)|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	i used to live in montana and i moved to phoenix about 2 yrs ago and i guarantee that if you went to montana you would love it! beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, wildlife, lots of sports and touristy things. great vacation spot!|`|be40588ae7c28e63b468da0087e4f8f9aa	Have you thought about Mackinaw Island, Mi?<br>  <br>  I live in Mi but would like to renew our vows in Disneyland or Vegas too!!!|`|NvW6voPJaa	NOT Vegas,,,,especially with a child!  It's definitely an adult city...nothing for kids except at the hotel pool.<br>  <br>  I would give an A+ for Disney!  I love Florida and Disney is most definitely kid friendly!  You could do something right at Disney or at a beach and then go to Disney for a vacation.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|qQtupqe2aa	being that you haven't stated where you are from in the question.... um... i know.<br>  go to seattle its beautiful with so much to do. there all the tourist activities and sites to visit not to mention the 5th ave,, and various other theatrical places to go see shows, you have the water front peirs, and the underground tour. you have all the fun of a city and all the glorious beauty of washington. you could renew your vows in the space needle or on a ferry as you cross the sound. there are many near by places to visit that are gorgeous too. like levenworth and the tillamock village. its a couple hour drive to the ocean. seriously check out washington state. salt water state park would be beautiful for out side. thats were i was gonna get married but we had to move away for personal reasons. theres bambridge island and just on the other side of where the ferries land there is an amazingly beautiful casion and resort. right on the water. you could go to greenwater, just pass enumclaw, its amazing! sorrounded by forest and oh so much beauty. and dispite what people think it does not rain everyday and even when it does rain its beautiful. i miss it so much.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.experiencewa.com/home.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.experiencewa.com/home.aspx</a>
krIKhZzcaa	She likes you :) I know. Well I think you should wait alittle bit before making a move on her, such as asking her out. But I really think you should it.

If you have deep and honest conversations with her in the past then just ask her if she likes you, granted be nice and gentle about bringing the conversation up. Don't be awkward about it. Just tell her how you honestly feel. Girls appreciate it when guys are honest with their feelings.<br>  I think asking her would be alot better than people's second guessed opinion if she likes you. I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|BIweLR4raa	what is ur question?<br>  if it is<br>  "does she likes me?" then YES<br>  there is a high change that she does|`|mywtmSROaa	Go for it dude.

SRaSbCZtaa	I have or well had the same problem and it sucks doesnt it? I think you kinda have to respect the way she feels, but if you really want to say something, do it gently so you dont offend her.|`|1OxiOk2taa	I know it si hard when friends change- but people change. For the sake of your friendship- no matter if you see it or don't, maybe you shouldn't tell her straight out saying she has changed. That can be hurtful, maybe you can just bring up the subject on how THINGS in generall have changed. It will start the convo without accusing her.|`|GV8h48Wqaa	itsall part of growing up seewty<br>  soon enough... your going to begin to feel the same<br>  if you think you really need to talk to her about it then just approach her and say "i need to talk to you about something seriously" and explain to her how you feel|`|UJ1w74gdaa	omg! the same exact thing happened to me, my friend completely changed, even more now since we're not friends, (I think its her new friends from her new school) and she likes Victoria's secret! how disturbed is that? she's only 13<br>  <br>  she will probably be mad if you tell her "you've changed!" or be offended in some way, try asking her nicely why she put the background up and why she likes ahem "making out with boys" it's possible her other friends are making her this way, trust me, almost every time changing happens to lead to bad friends.<br>  <br>  you could try letting her know you liked the old her, but she is who she is, don't force her to go back to the way she was before, just be by her side, pretty soon she might find her old self again, and if she doesn't and you don't like it, you might want to let the friendship go|`|P3OWfxi5aa	just let it go for now. but if it bothers you maybe you should talk to her about it and if shes mean about it then let it go and stay away from her for a while
v3bhi62Kaa	Wow yeah those are some MAJOR signs he likes you a lot. I think you guys should go out he likes you, you like him you guys have he same personality which will make things run smoothly.

Yeah i think it jsut depends some people can be friends and some can so hopefully you guys can. BEST OF LUCK|`|6tjaH1rjaa	1.

eObzadUhaa	It's you're insecurity that's putting these negative thoughts into your mind.<br>  You're probably thinking things like:<br>  "What are they doing? What are they talking about?" <br>  Right?<br>  It's okay to feel this way, but it's not okay to let it dominate your relationship.<br>  You should talk to your boyfriend about it again, tell him how it makes you feel and how it's affecting your relationship.<br>  Try and build some more trust with him, and build up a feeling of security in your relationship with your boyfriend and your relationship with yourself.<br>  Maybe you could also try being friends with her, just hanging out and feeling more comfortable around her.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	you're jealous, any girl would be.<br>  you're only human. all you can do is to try to ignore her and your worries, she's not taking him back and he doesn't want her, he's with you for a reason.|`|mcKKdbhgaa	My girlfriend is out to lunch with her ex NOW!

GM1rImrfaa	Option B sounds good, followed by option C, if things *DO* begin to go south between you guys.<br>  <br>  Do remember, that he may not consider your friendship as close or meaningful as you consider yours with his.<br>  <br>  One final note: Don't believe everything you here. It could be "friendly" banter, or Mike might be trying to drive you apart purposefully, so he can get his hands on you himself.<br>  <br>  Conduct your test. Don't be surprised with whatever you find; nothing is below a human being, as trusty as you might believe them to be. If things don't work, you've got another great friend who might be actually watching out for you. It all depends. You never know. T.T

zxQT3Uo5aa	You are on hold because you want to be.  He is not holding you nor is he expressing the kind of interest in you that you have in him  You call it a crush but it is really hoping for a change.  Decide how much life you want to waste on this.  You are running out of time and deferring the realization that it was all for nothing.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	<a href="http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com" rel="nofollow">http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com</a>|`|AA11289793	Well maybe it you try to make a move on him and see if he feels the same way, you don't know if you are not right unless you have ever tried to make it work.<br>  <br>  Besides what he says in front of others could just be a front to conceal his true emotions, so just tell him how you feel.|`|kHSPH0RBaa	iM KiNDA iN THE SAME POSiTiON, THE WHOLE BRO/SiS THiNG,i THINK iZ BULL, BUT JUZ GiVE iT TiME, THiNK iT THROUGH A LiTTILE MORE, GOOD LUCK =]]|`|HNjNWHSyaa	write his name down like 500 times in a journal and you will eventually get sick of writing it lol worked for me =D|`|U5A8JQ1paa	just give it time|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	i know how you feel, i been in and out of that problem but all you have to do is start thinking about yourself more when it comes to him because thats the only thing holding you back it is not really him its you doing that to yourself. i found out that the hard way, but i'm over him and i'm doing fine now that i know he is not more important or worth more time i have given myself.|`|wcgm8Z4uaa	My friend once had a crush like this on my best friend last year. <br>  <br>  id say, think of someone ELSE.  get your mind off of him.

He has a gurl! And then I just started talking to other guys as friends until we began flirting and i began getting over him, slowly but i got over him. =) I hope I Helped.<br>  <br>  So yeah talk as friends.<br>  Look at him as you would see a brother.<br>  Dont talk sooo much for a while. <br>  Look at other guys. <br>  Go on a date with someone <br>  etc.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =)|`|vTra7n5baa	Stop hanging around him (if you are).  Plain and simple.  You would not be avoiding any problem, just saving yourself from this guy's antics.  There will be other boys who love and appreciate you.  This jerk sounds like he's taken you for granted a bit.  Kick him aside and make him realize you don't play games, friends or not.  If he doesn't love you, then is he really good enough for you?  No.|`|ddfuY8Dwaa	Dimension, and you just go out a lot of other good. When you speak to him saying I love you This is the beginning of the end because the love will end quickly unhesitantly|`|ck4BiIK3aa	Gosh I have this problem too! well it took me a while to get over the guy but when i finally did out of nowhere it came back cause he was like doing things for me its weird! but I would just say like maybe finding a new crush! idk!! but yeah|`|xsG3woDCaa	tell him how you feel.see if he gives you the same response he gave your friends.who knows if you say the words to him maybe you'll see how you really feel,and see how he really feels as well|`|zZ3MGvPHaa	hey sister friend,<br>  i know what you r goin through  look i dont know what to do but all i know is give you and him time kk i will pray for you always thnxs bye|`|3ZbVHhG9aa	Think of every thing he does as negative. Start nasty rumors about him (you'll start to believe them, too). All that good stuff.|`|ZNo5x0Veaa	Well try to keep your feeling with you. And try to avoid him. Or flirt with another guy! :p|`|SO2oRloEaa	I went through the same thing :) just focus on knowing that your true love is out there and remember-- every love gone wrong is one step closer to true love :) good luck!|`|fYlBTdJJaa	it takes time..just try to occupy yourself with something else|`|XLOLn3lKaa	try making friends with another cute guy.. and maybe ull forget about this other -brotherly friendd- =)|`|KjiTQZzjaa	cant get rid of a crush utill u find a new one srry|`|r1IUOJ6Iaa	Drink that Crush!!!! Is it orange flavor or grape|`|lK8D17WIaa	act nasty around him so then he will go away|`|913QbBLIaa	He's lying when he says he thinks of you as a sister. He lying cuz your friends are probably weirding him out so he doesnt want to talk about your relationship with him. Your best bet is to go ask him yourself and if he says no then you'll probably be able to talk/like other guys more.|`|PHp71Xt7aa	Well, firstly for starters he didn't actually reject you as NO guy would say Yes if some group of girls asked as a joke. Especially if he really liked you...<br>  <br>  It sounds like there must be good reasons for liking this guy & trust me you cannot just like someone if the feeling isn't mutual. He definately has at least some feelings for you.<br>  <br>  So, do you really want to let this guy go? Or would you be willing to give it one last shot? Your heart is telling you that there is some possibility & I guess somewhere inside your head you do want him still.<br>  <br>  So my advice:<br>  <br>  1. Next time you are with him act bubbly & sweet like you normally do. Try & treat him like another friend & be your usual self... Trust that you can do this & you will. Only concentrate on being friendly..<br>  <br>  2. Ask him to do something with you low key, milkshake or hang out, something like that. You will have a really great time & you can suss out from there what to do.<br>  <br>  Before you let him go I advice trying one last time... & then you never know!!! You two may be meant for each other =))<br>  <br>  But if there is TOO MUCH stopping you, all you need to do is find a new guy. Requirements: cute, funny & friendly...<br>  <br>  Start liking him. How do you do this? Think that he is cute yea? well get obsessed... Think about him.. Talk about him... Tell all your friends "How cute is he!" Spend some time staring at him & then laugh if he catches you...<br>  <br>  Write his name down... then myspace him or text him, say hi<br>  <br>  If nothing works out, let him go & then find another NEW guy... THAT is really HOT, cute & funny & popular. Start liking him & obsessing over him... This way you are guaranteed to get over the other guy..<br>  <br>  Oh yea & dream about this new guy... Think how much better he is than the other guy you used to like. & think how good it will be when you get with him and you kiss him & you walk past the old guy while you two are holding hands & he sees you. (jealous of course) & he will feel soooo bad & he will totally regret not making a move with you.. as he has MISSED OUT so BAD! <br>  <br>  good luck girl!! =)))<br>  <br>  xoxoxoxo|`|gkySyuBaaa	Just date the dude and be yourself, That's what turned my ex away from me. If you don't even know how to talk to someone while being yourself then that will annoy him enough to hurt him and frustrate him. It sounds like he was being sarcastic and wants to stay quiet about goin out and jus go out with you when he's more comfy with you from what you said about the bro & sis thing. I'm bein myself more around this girl I've only known for like 4 days and I feel a true connection but don't wanna get too close too soon. I'd give it time and be yourself around him.|`|sD77eXUuaa	wow <br>  your slowing your self down by letting him get to you.<br>  you cant get over him because for some reason you because<br>  right now all you want him to do is give you a chance.<br>  <br>  he made it very clear that he doesn't not like you in the way<br>  you want it to but just know that's its for that greater good and<br>  that should help you move on<br>  <br>  find some one else and make your crush see what he is missing<br>  i bet you then he would want you <br>  and if he still doesn't then at least <br>  you moved on with some one else

yGPRntXFaa	Ask her this....?<br>  <br>  If you stopped going to her bar, would she date you.... if the answer is yes, then so be it, if she doesn't answer it or says she'll get back to you on that one.......... you know she means no, never ask her again............<br>  <br>  She may find that going out with someone who was a client there may be trouble for her since she is used to many many many advances from all kinds of people..... you can't get mad if other guys like her too.. so it makes the situation uncomfortable for her.. understand this and ask her out one last time...|`|AA11289793	Yeah obviously, people do get mad at other people that they care about, if they didn't then I don't think they could truly care for them. Everything in nature has a balance, so why wouldn't our relationships...|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	Yeah i do get mad at the person i like but its because i care.|`|zBGH9dqAaa	yeah...the guy i like knows i do and i get pissed because he wont ask me out...good luck though|`|sWgekFwaaa	yeah all the time dude ur not alone
pQbmqlabaa	i dont think its bad for him to be in drugs, not that a big a deal as long as hes not into any REALLY bad ****. but i think you should casually talk to him when you can. find a chance to get his number and start out texting or myspace, some thing like that. then once youve gotten to knwo each other a little more, talk to him in person or phone and try to get him to hang out :) just take it slow.|`|XdBbAHbbaa	hmmmm, i say don't go for a druggie...who knows what they'll do? I know this isn't good advice, and I'm sorry for that, but I'm just lookin' out for ya hon.

This is your wedding make it count|`|naFBXYteaa	I know it might seem harsh but you just need to tell her straight out, you could say hey this is my wedding, my day you either need to step up and act like my made of honor is suppose to or i will choose another one you could also say if you don't want to seem as harsh you could be like hey i really want you to be my made of honor because your my best friend but your not doing your job and this is my day and i want it to be perfect|`|NCvX4I0baa	I think it sounds decent enough. Just make sure she understands that it's your wedding and it's a special day for you. I'm pretty sure she will understand that you just want everything perfect because when it comes to her she'd probably want the same too!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Sounds good.

I understand that I'm not married therefore would have no input on anything at least in everyone Else's eyes...I don't mean to rant...But just sit down and talk to her about it ...don't raise your voice...Good Luck|`|EBlXsSCbaa	just take it easy and tell her what she needs to do and wat she shouldn't be do in  but give her a chance since its her first wedding.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	There are no "bridesmaid duties".  If you need this person, who if she is your maid of honor, should be your closest friend, to help you out with something, then ask her.  Don't circle aorund it to the point that you "kick" her out of the wedding.  Talk to her.  Although, in my opinion, you may be expecting too much from someone,k it is your wedding afterall|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	Well I feel you need to be honest as possible and soon as possible.  Because you need the things done that need to be done and the person has the right to know she will no longer be in the possition she was expecting to be in.  Just be honest and tell her the truth.  I am sure if she cares about you then she will perfectly understand your possition and support you in it.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie

S3UxNOhdaa	Wish we could all go and turn back time but we can't. You are married to an abusive man. <br>  A healthy marriage is not filled with vicious comments and things done or said to destroy the other person. You did nothing wrong in asking him to be careful with the finances. Just by the very fact of saying it, let's me know that you are concerned with your finances and your marriage. This has very little to do with dinner out or finances; but more with the issue of him and feeling in TOTAL control.<br>  I hate to say this to you, but he is not going to improve. This IS going to get worse for you. Believe me when I say this. I am glad you don't crumble to him with tears or a weak response, because his goal is to break you down.  It sounds like you have a job and are independent of him. Please don't stay for a part time marriage with a guy that  <br>  #1 doesn't provide for you and what he does..resents it.<br>  #2 is vicious and unkind.<br>  Marriage is supposed to be a joining of kindred spirits. Please don't let him destroy yours.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Don't call him when he is out of town.  Make him wonder what you are up to, instead of you always being there for him.  You are making yourself too easy and it is like you are chasing him instead of the other way around.  Don't mother him either.  I would also wonder what all he does when he is out of town.  Does he go to the same places a lot?  Or different towns.  A traveling man has many chances to play around on you, so you have to keep your sex life exciting so he wants to come home.|`|NPd3apdsaa	That is abuse. mental abuse.<br>  <br>  he seems very immature if he can't ask you nicely not to say something and then tell you why he doesn't like it.<br>  <br>  I would be suspicious of him... a lot of guys act all crazy when they want out a relationship because it forces you to break it off rather than him<br>  <br>  it will be uncomfortable but you have to tell him your miserable and you have to ask him if he wants out or not... his words and actions after that question will let you know what you need to do, even if he lies.|`|xOerfdNwaa	honestly if it was me i would assume that he is cheating. if he works out of town five days a week he shouldnt have room for an arguement  thats how much he should miss you. something is totally wrong with that. he is  just looking  for excuses to get angry because he  know wat he is  doing ( cheating) and is just looking for a reason to justify it. i guess he wouldnt call you later either?|`|SovaFpN8aa	Maybe he is mad and mean because you treat him like he is stupid, or he is your child. Did you remind him to wash his hands too?|`|Q9c3fkcdaa	It is more than possible that he is cheating on you,,you should always question each change|`|AA11584348	maybe a separation may help or maybe counseling good luck|`|ucVgUcDvaa	He sounds abusive. Seek out some help. It can get allot worse. One way to start to look at books. The one I found mst helpful was the "Verbally Abusive Relationship". This book will let you check of some personality traits and help you decide if he is a abuser or not.Then look up a professional for some counseling. <br>  Good Luck!
PVNFHksIaa	I've had this happen to me.. I finally picked up and I heard a few guys voices and they sounded like they were at a party. It's very possible that this could be your ex... when people are intoxicated they tend to get emotional. Do you still talk or see your ex? Try dropping hints.. or pick up the next time you get a blocked call.|`|hSsTlC6Saa	It could be anybody. It might have been him, ya never know.|`|MzSFaebraa	Booty Call.|`|psMZrXa7aa	Maybe it's a jealous friend trying to piss you off? <br>  You girls really no how to be bitchy.<br>  Mrrooowe!!|`|qxpF5IYSaa	I thinks its defiantly drunk dialing of some sorts. Obviously this person is thinking about you enough to call you at 3am and lets be honest if your up at 3 am and calling some one your probably drunk.|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	how many more times are you going to ask this question?<br>  <br>  youve obvs not got the answer you were oping for.<br>  why dont you just ring him already and ask him of it was him<br>  if itwasnt then does it really matter who it was?<br>  just answer the phone if it happens again.<br>  x|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	Even i think the same because i use to call my ex GF on the same time|`|FEStjFIRaa	yuup itz him iiive done it before im over it now but get used to those calls because they have an ending point he will forget and stop doing that i think we all like doing that hehe ;)
Lfc9Zav2aa	Explain about trolls to him.|`|c0UhndO6aa	I'd yell at him and tell him that he can do whatever he wants when he's 18. Tell him to wait a year .|`|ljus6sn4aa	Nothing, i'd just tell him to use a condom and to use his own money, because i wouldn't like him to use my money for that kind of crap|`|TYjXGyCzaa	I would sent him to rehab for doing some nasty sexual intercourse with a stranger who might be carrying a disease.|`|rGci1ehoaa	have a long talk about how prostitution is not only illegal but unsafe... take him to get an std check!!

I'm guessing that you've read the books so yeah.|`|BoHGJsFDaa	I like girls who are a little bit eccentric and have a positive attitude. I also like girls that are kind and maternal who compensate for my own weaknesses. Other than that, it's the usual shallow stuff, good looks, good in bed...|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	from my experience and observation, guys like quiet girls mostly and they can be loud together, they dont like drama, they dont like clingy but they want to know that you care and will be there for them, they want to know that you like them and the rest is just natural =)|`|NJrkgBaWaa	I like girls who dont talk ****, Respective, Mature..., Not loud mouths.. Treat you right..
1TD0nRaRaa	Well it sounds like he has a crush on you! But don't take it that far just yet! Your friend may be a huge help, if she can talk to him during P.E it's perfect. She needs to kind of befriend him first so they talk or if they are already friends no need! Ask your friend to tell him that she noticed you thought that you had scared him away or something along those lines. You may be able to put it into better words. Idk. Maybe if he sees that it  kind of hurt your feelings that you think you scared him away he may come and talk to you and I bet everything I got you can take it from there.

3e0IjGsYaa	just be yourself. learn to love yourself first, and then you're able to love others. have confidence in yourself...guys notice this in women - they are attracted to it. Of course, there are men out there that notice that your confidence isn't too high - these men may do one of two things: 1) Not show interest in a relationship and run the other way -or- 2) Show interest in you, but for the wrong reasons. The guy that does this should be a sign to you that he's not looking for anything more but a good time...he will most likely use you for what he desires, and afterwards throw you aside!<br>  <br>  take a few deep breaths, and ***make sure to think about what you're gonna say before just saying it - - otherwise you may find you want to stick your foot in your mouth! ;)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some!|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	You will never meet anyone in this world if you are not brave enough to speak up.   After all you can't lose. If you do not speak up then you lose out anyway, so .. take the chance and maybe you will win.|`|BXrt8yfRaa	Just talk to him. Whats the worst thing that could happen huh? You said u guys are ready to be together so just think  of somethin to talk about and go up to him. He will probably be really relieved that you made the move!<br>  good luck :)|`|bP1opFVAaa	Talk to him and ask him out! Make a move!|`|zOrRgddFaa	Just calm down and try talking to him about it... If you don't have enough confidence to speak about it face to face, text him or email him about it to see what he thinks...But it is better to tell it upfront to see immediate reaction|`|GgLXXmpAaa	Next time your talking to him, you know just casual conversation, just be like, hey we should hang out some time, i bet that would  be really fun. thats what i did!! and he was like yeah i was thinking the same thing. it worked out perfectlyy:)|`|fFDdDq3Yaa	I happen to second the person above me - just speak up and tell him how you feel and I'm sure he'll come around. Worse case, what do you loose? You've stepped up and done your part.|`|FJEBddESaa	R u a boy or a girl.  if u r a boy then you should not tell him unless u want to b a social outcast.  if u r a girl then u should tell him and ask him out.|`|Q2IKPxd0aa	(sigh) speak up believe me it would help|`|AA12232294	ask him out you pusscake|`|5TIIgqhhaa	talk to him. guys love confidence!|`|A7ovwP94aa	Asuming you are over 16, ask him out but make it sound casual like when you ask a girl friend out. The movies a good start see if there is anything that you will both like.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
42ad7e4482db3626a80fdb7429b585fcaa	you are precious-in a good way-I think you should drop a really casual hint to Josh like-So William is kinda cute, does he have a girlfriend? That will be enough for Josh to mention it to William. DO NOT PURSUE HIM!! Josh will tell William if William is truly interested.  If you don't hear anything from either of them within a week-there is your answer and leave it at that.  You won't come off as a stalker and you are leaving the chase to him-Keep me posted!!  I will pray that it goes well.|`|z98UFPmIaa	if what your friend josh is saying is true then i think you should talk to william he seems like he is obviously interested in you and wants to get to know you. the next time you see him be the first one to say hi or just start up a convo. say you see him around a lot and wanted to introduce yourself<br>  hope i helped(:|`|hVEmEaMSaa	heyy. if i were you i would def. try to get to know him better. try to be subtle at first, and if things go well, let him know that you like him. i know its easier said then done, but i think that its worth a shot, good luck!|`|9bsYmkV3aa	Good luck with him!  It sounds like he likes you too. I have a question, when "Josh" asked for your number to give to him, did you ask for his number too?? Maybe if you get his number, things may start to move along.|`|Svek6aXEaa	God I hate it when people change the persons name. It's not like were going to come and tell the guy you like him. We don't even know where you live. God some people are f'ing annoying.|`|FQ9BajGraa	I would go up and talk to him.<br>  Yeah there's this guy who is extremely country and i think he's really cute so every time i see him i smile and say hey.|`|8EFzDxiKaa	Ask Josh if he has a gl then you might start day dreamming about him|`|tIBQP1VSaa	drop your books, but don't make it look too obvious|`|PDaoqbF0aa	well i understand what your going through because i would do the exact thing you would which is to try to read the guys mind <br>  personally guys are quite easy to talk to you don't need to freak out about what to say to them<br>  <br>  and if you seem to like him just start talking to him as either a hi,smile, look at him, kinda try to let him notice you <br>  cause based on what your friends and his friends have said I'm thinking that "William" wants to get to know you as well <br>  <br>  so take a risk =]|`|SzAgnHr0aa	Well I'm a girl and yes! yes! yes! i have been in a situation like that....kinda actally if you see my most recent question it has somthing kinda sorta to do with a situation like this. If I were you i would make sure and be positive to see if he was interested. Bc i have made that mistake before and gotten turned down!!!! :( but from what it sounds like he likes you! but i cant fully answer your question unles i know if you are traditional girl (wait for the guy to talk to you) or a modern girl (you go straight to the guy for what you want!) but if you can just answer that then i can fully help ya out!|`|FJEBddESaa	i am a guy and if i was william i would want to get to know u as much as you want to get to know me.  because of this i think dropping books and running into him is stupid and you should just ask him to meet u somewhere and just talk.  but don't act like it is a date, he will probably be caught off guard and say no.  just tell him that he is cute and that u want to learn more about him|`|nMCdfOhVaa	Something like this has actually happened to me so i know exactly what you mean...<br>  <br>  Well what i did was that i started talking to him, started out wit a hi, how are you, and so on... I was just being myself and you know letting him know by the way i was focused on him that i liked him...<br>  <br>  things worked out pretty good :) we set up dates and you know time we could have to ourselves...<br>  <br>  till this day him and I are still together :)<br>  <br>  [[07.05.07]]<br>  <br>  just go for it! try it out!|`|zBGH9dqAaa	dude...relax!<br>  okay im a girl so im going to tell you:<br>  1) dont do the dropping books thing. if you want to meet him, talk to him. get this josh kid to find you his number and call him. dont try to do anything...really get to know him first. repiprocate the phone thing with saying hi in church if you get the chance.<br>  good luck!|`|OrXIyPHbaa	if he already said hi and initiated the conversation with you, then you should feel comfortable next time when you see him. when you pass him or sit with him just look and say hi and i PROMISE if he likes you he'll say hi back and start a conversation so you will stay and talk to him more.|`|qlCwiXpyaa	when you see him i would just be like hey! dont you go to my church? then start the conversation, like arent you friends with "Josh"? and what school do you go to? and whats your name? (as if you didnt know who he was) and then just be like well, hey i have to go, whats your number? i can text you!|`|IBqYBRahaa	wow im having something similar to that know.and im also in 7th grade.okay in my  girl point of veiw well if he ever catches u by surprise and says hi to u, just seem relaxed and say hey. wat u can also say is when you talk to him for the first time like in the halls, just ask him about his school. and i have been in countless situations. just act cool and be chilled.|`|pQbmqlabaa	uhmm. i would just talk to him. casually about church or math or something. at the math tutoring thing, sit by him and ask for help or just takl to him and see how things go. dont make it that big a deal haha. smile or say heyy in the hallways.|`|hjt0H2MQaa	He alreaedy told Josh he likes you - so whats the prob?  If you are too shy to talk to him, give Josh your number and tell him to give it to William for you.  Good Luck!|`|dp0B5ixuaa	drop pencils in front of him and pick them up<br>  be directly in front of him to show him ya butt ;D<br>   but wear a skirt with yah undies saying i love you :D|`|dnpGVx22aa	just talk to him most of the time guys ike it when girls make the first move|`|70a47f94503a1953542e060626fbb52caa	Relax he likes you enough to ask for your number so next time you see him just be yourself and say hello and talk about school or television or music to get the ball rolling. Be yourself and good luck! He likes you a lot!|`|03ls3iXmaa	just keep it simple, when you see him just say hi and you go to the same church as he does, and you saw him there, ask him what his school is like and if he likes it, that should get the conversation started and hopefully a new friendship.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	When you see him you should just try to hold a conversation with him talk about school to break the ice, then you can work your way into knowing more about him, maybe you will realize if all the stress was really worth your time.|`|KaqAxtV0aa	hmm well he might just think your hot or he might actually like you. I know its kind of hard approaching a guy but if you ever see him during the time that he is there just say hi! or a little nice smile or a wave. Conversation might come from there! hope i can help|`|w6weeb7Daa	Mehhh I'm a 15 year old guy in 9th grade... I think in middle school people aren't too serious about each other because nobody did anything. Just ask him out I guess or if you have the balls go up and kiss him and see what happens...|`|hGGoXZu7aa	if i were you i would be confident and start a conversation.compliment him on something.that always starts a convo<br>  <br>  im saying jus talk to him cuz if u dont u might regret it.
GM1rImrfaa	*Stomps in*<br>  <br>  Take heart, lass. Stand your ground, and don't let her intimidate you. Don't let the rumors spread, and prove yourself to be preferred friendship material! If she really is the wench you describe, then labor to expose her for the true harpy she is. Do not go quietly into the night; if they turn on you, they were never really your friends in the first place, and were unworthy of your valuable attention.
JRizSTYdaa	hun dont let anythin happen i was 15 when i had a 21 year old tryin to chat me up all the time for one thing only maybe she just got a little crush or going threw a fraze ive been  there and realised when your that young the older guys just want one thing hopefully she will move on from likng him soon hope everythin goes ok|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Well keep her the hell away from him and tell her to get over him. She needs to realize that he probably wants nothing to do with her, and if he DOES than he is a pervert and a pedophile and is nothing but bad news.|`|hjt0H2MQaa	Why is she hanging out with a 20 yr old in the first place?|`|AA11263103	ok.. well, tell the guy to go away.|`|A7ovwP94aa	It may be just a crush which is normal. Just make sure that he is not doing anything to encourage her. Hopefully he will still see her as a child like all my crushes lol.
2l1IpjAwaa	i would tell him to come over and have a little talk with him. sit down and ask him if hes just using u for personal reasons. if he is constantly avoiding you and then hookin up, i would just ignore him. if he really likes u, he would stay with u. just sit down and don't start letting him take control of the whole situation. start by just asking y he always does that. maybe, he is pulling away becuase he's embarresed? im not sure, but u really need to talk with him and clear things out|`|A7ovwP94aa	I would drop him like a hot potato. He sounds like he is just using you. He is not what I would call a friend with benefits. <br>  <br>  Next time he approaches you for $ex politely decline - find another bloke to have casual meetings with if that is what you are into.|`|BTpzHQ3Qaa	Yea I have to say to forget about that guy. Guys shouldn't play around like that. And you are prob way better than this guy..no offense he seems like a dush. Only caring about himself..NOT COOL<br>  <br>  I would end the friends with benefits and if he asks you again to have sex..say no..and tell him how you feel.

I think u should sallow ur pride and go talk to him please.|`|0Bx2knr2aa	sounds a little familiar. me and my husband get along great but when we argue it will last forever cause we are both so stubborn. we began to realize that most of our fights are around the time its been a little bit since we have had sex so if we arent wanting to kill each other, or if we get to a point in  a fight where we will talk calmly, we will just shut up and have sex. it usually works. i know it sounds kinda dumb, but when theres sexual tension, we always tend to fight more. its worth a try. good luck!

If hes a  friend  your friendship would  be  in danger.Also if he's one of your  classates its a  possibilty he'll take  advantage of youre feelings and  manipulate  you.

Keep your options open, maybe you'll find someone else... or maybe someone else will find you.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	I wouldn't.  You might end up getting hurt.  If he is not attracted to you in the first place then why try?  There are too many other guys out there that may end up crazy about you.|`|mcymZfuAaa	Keep trying if you think hes worth it. If hes a good guy he will see you for who you are. Keep it up!! And good luck!|`|AyFgGoq4aa	NO! How rude of him! If he doesn't want to date you then that's his loss.

qcPrUL84aa	People have random sex because sex is fun to have. It's not a hard concept to grasp.|`|AA11289793	Well it's becuase people want to feel loved and it gives them the sense that people actually care for them and they do it for confidence.<br>  <br>  People also use it as a method of relaxation, there are also different reasons for it although these two are the main ones...
XH2o1MM6aa	.CHT you  did othing wrong.Perhaps the mutual "friend" told him you were checking on the veracity of his unavailability.Then it became a matter of trust.Trivial I know .
uOVepBl8aa	Well as I always say, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder (cliche', I know haha)<br>  <br>  But yeah, he's ok but i think with a different haircut it cut emphasize his jawline more.<br>  <br>  He has pretty eyes too :P.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Looks like a girl.|`|AA11122150	how old is that kid? 12?|`|trb2s2uoaa	nawt really...<br>  sorry.<br>  I've see wayyyy better|`|Y63zyLZyaa	I  dunno.

NOT MY TYPE<br>  :)|`|JKjy4Nv1aa	Isn't that a girl?|`|oaOZ2wlRaa	Not at all. Reasons why:<br>  He's wearing a necklace (ewww).<br>  He has a smug expression, giving off the impression that he is insecure and rude.<br>  He has a strange, short bowl haircut.|`|EZyHOht7aa	I think he is gay  well he looks that way sorry
X1gOkyNqaa	You can't complain if you don't make the first move first. He may just be nervous to do it now because he knows you think the first kiss was awkward and weird. You need to show him that it was fine and you want to be kissed. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE MOVE NOT HIM|`|8EFzDxiKaa	It sound like he really likes you but why dont you just tell him to get used to kissing cause you want to be kissed.
laHLW1yQaa	"I have class" is a message you have to send out regularly.  Not at the top of your lungs but by doing the right things.<br>  <br>  I'd say it is not like you are encouraging the boys to call overtly.  More like you are cute and they are hoping.  Throw in a few girls who do say yes and they hope you will to.  While it is fine to say no keep in mind someone just worked up the nerve to call you.  So maybe you can say "I don't do that but you could take me to Starbucks for a coffee some day".|`|5TIIgqhhaa	its cuz ur young, guys think ur easy. it most likely doesnt have to do with ur personality or anythingg|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	Wait till your ready to sleep with a guy dint let them pressure you into doing some thing your not ready 2 do. Guys are immature at that age and will MAYBE grow up a lil once they get older. Stick up for what you believe in and that's good that that you haven't given in!|`|bHZGFd6eaa	i guarantee if instead of saying no you say yes you will have alot more guy friends|`|hpnZ8awvaa	It might be the way you dress?
A7ovwP94aa	If he is really interested in you it wil happen.You say you are not dating so I would just go with the flow.|`|6O5qWRjyaa	If you know he flirts back then he's shy also<br>  <br>  Guys like a girl that is confident<br>  <br>  make the first move...

YD6ItSH5aa	Well before you do anything you have to make sure you have feelings for this girl. if you keep flirting with her & end up not likeing her you, might hurt her. figure out your feelng & then take it from there.<br>  Figure out what you like about her & what you don't like. think about any other crush that you might have<br>  <br>  Brittany|`|C1PQhkUxaa	I think the problem right now is that you don't know her enough to know if it was lust or love. You have to get to know her more and see what happens. Good luck.
AA10532171	If you all are under 18, eh, I wouldn't want to be locked to one person.  Over 18 it gets a little more involved, then that is when you might want to consider only being with one girl.  But if your under 18 and get the feeling for someone new, talk to the current girlfriend to see her feelings on the relationship between the two of you.  Maybe she might want to be free to look around too.  No matter what, keep the lines of communication open, before you decide to move on or stay.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	The parameters of a relationship must be agreeable to both parties.  If the girl is ok with it, then ok.  The problem is when someone is trying to be monogamous and you are dipping and jiving.|`|SbiNNM3Caa	it depends on what a relationship means to you<br>  if thats what it means to you<br>  then you shoudl just break it off with all the girls<br>  and just have flings and mess around with random girls<br>  thas all<br>  you dont want a relationship is<br>  because<br>  it is...<br>  go look it up|`|AA11289793	No it isn't really good, you are just going to get a bad name for yourself eventually, and as girls mature they are going to want to stay away from you.<br>  <br>  So if I were you I would stop playing around and focus on one girl and try to sort yourself out...|`|5TIIgqhhaa	not to me. a relationship is a relationship, there shoodnt be any exuse to cheatt!|`|uLHtXibRaa	A man who wants to cheat should be castrated..and id happily do it for free..|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	i need more detail to have a good answer for u ...im sorry i just dont understand the  question|`|3e0IjGsYaa	So lemme get this straight: you're dating 2 girls at once, and neither of them know about each other? I'm not sure if i understood the question correctly, but if that's the case....<br>  <br>  IMPO: THIS IS WRONG to do to either of the women!<br>  <br>  It's cheating in my book if neither of them know about each other! You seriously need to take a step back and re-think the situation and the feelings involved. Or maybe I should pose the question like this: Would you like it if a girl you're really interested in were two-timing you?<br>  <br>  'Nuff said.|`|SuVmXhBDaa	As long as you guys haven't agreed on being exclusive she shouldn't expect more from you, same to you. I'm a girl, and I don't understand why girls assume they're exclusive with a guy just because theyre sleeping with him or have been to his house... When the guy is interested he MAKES SURE  to make it clear he want's to date you exclusively. Then they get hurt but if the guy is shady and hasn't really done or said anything about being exclusive she shouldn't assume that. That goes for you too,|`|u49dfBkDaa	i wouldn't accept that, i expect a guy to be faithful to me as soon as we've decided we're bf/gf, it works both ways, we stay faithful to eachother.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	As long as everyone is honest,  and everyone knows it's not exclusive... and as long as she has the right to date others as well, it's fine.|`|qcPrUL84aa	Provided she's cool with it, then there's nothing wrong with it. If she's not, then I think you know the answer.|`|dnpGVx22aa	NO that's called cheating.
SRaSbCZtaa	Not at all, you do what you feel is right when its time. Don't let other people's relationships affect yours.|`|LMPF5X4raa	depends how old u are..not really. only if ur ok with it. 2 yrs is prolly long enough tho..just do it if ur ready.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Not weird, smart.<br>  Sex should be saved for marriage.|`|np5VgFelaa	Unusual? Yes. Weird? No. <br>  <br>  Every couple is different when it comes to having sex and being intimate. Usually by the 2 year mark, a couple has had sex but that doesn't mean that every couple needs to follow suit. It's all about when both of you are comfortable with the idea and are mature and ready to handle the consequences(yes,it can happen).<br>  Don't let your friends peer pressure you or make you feel inadequate. It's your relationship and you can move as fast or as slow as you want to.|`|imxwB6zFaa	no its not weird. i had a friend who went out with her bf for 4 years and they never had sex until this year cause they wanted to do it so badly.|`|RWDsMDCtaa	Depends on your age and the values you have.<br>  <br>  I'd say no.|`|GgLXXmpAaa	No not at all. maybe shes just not ready to have sex yet. or maybe you guys are still to young. sex is a big deal not just something you do just because your dating someone.
s2YY7DTSaa	just ask him if you have known him for a long time he wont be embarrassed|`|CnM2U1bXaa	<a href="http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com" rel="nofollow">http://twilightfreakscz.webs.com</a>|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	hey i need u to do me a huge favor ....i really need a prom date and i was wondering if it could be you???...but if u cant its fine ... i just really think you are a cool guy and it would be fun to hang out|`|MFcSwTFpaa	Ask him, 'hey, will you take me to Prom?  so-and-so asked me but I'd rather go with you."  do it while touching him lightly on the arm.  A low cut top might help as well.  You don't have to be slutty, just act less proper.  A teenage boy's mind shuts down at the hint of female contact.  I know from experience.|`|v2qKmtY2aa	well guys r usually the ones asking....but if ur sure he wont ask than u should just straight up ask  him....trust me he will say yes im a guy and if the girl is decent and has a great personality than i go for it....just dont be shy act like ur talking to ur best friend and play it cool....im sure it will work|`|OJyBn47daa	Just come out and be like Hey we have prom this week do you wanna be my date? I was afraid of rejection too and I am really shy but how would you know if he wanted to or not if you haven't even asked him!|`|imxwB6zFaa	"would you go to prom with me?"<br>  <br>  that easy|`|jij9Fa9waa	When you are at church sunday, try and find a moment to set and talk to him, tell him your prom is coming up and you want it to be the best memory of your senior year, and if he would be your ESCORT, it would truly be great! Learn now how to handle rejection, it is just a way of life, there are so many times in your life that you will get rejected. You just have to understand everything happens for a reason, and usually it turns out for the best!|`|krIKhZzcaa	At your youth group, just pull him aside and ask him. Just be like- I don't have a date for my senior prom, do you want to go with me? <br>  The worst he can say is no, and I know how it feels to be rejected, but its part of life. But go out of your comfort zone, and ask him !<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|tXjwuTjlaa	I think you should just go up to him the next time you see him and just start talking then a little bit into the convo as him if he would like to go to prom with you. Maybe you could set up a small date so you 2 could get to know eachother like what you both like to make it fun.|`|lhJ1Yoc3aa	at my school a lot of people will ask them out to prom by decorating their car saying "will you go to prom with me?" or getting it said over the intercom. i once asked a guy to prom by decorating his car and he loved it and i ended up going to prom with him =)|`|AyFgGoq4aa	ummmmm girls don't ask guys to prom. Sorry but you have to wait until he asks u.|`|DzrPjcI9aa	let one of ur girlz ask him for u <br>  let dem make him talk to u <br>  well dat would work on me lol
5d8ff2ba83304381d12c6e0005538ec4aa	i guess you can ask snce you're already sure you like each other...or does he like you as a "sister", "friend" cause i mean, you can ask if he's gay...
BO14BwmRaa	It sounds like the guy has the same problem I have. He gets really close to a girl and then for some reason starts to drift away again. <br>  <br>  My advice chase after him if you like him. Take a little initiative. <br>  <br>  We guys get pretty damn shy even if we seem confident on the outside. He probably felt awful when you shot him down and that may have made him think that if he tries again the same thing will happen. So do the unexpected, ask him if HE wants to walk.|`|4pWxEk2Naa	kk, thats rough<br>  if i were uu id become his friiend 4 a little and talk 2 him and just make common, funny, silly convo with him, <br>  then ask him after a whilee y he suddenly is talkign 2 uu and simply ASK him about the situation<br>  then makee ur decision from there
POHWTDPRaa	Don't call him. That's just making a pest of yourself. Tomorrow if it turns out he didn't bring the book, ask him to bring in on Wednesday. There is no reason to be scared. You are obviously friendly enough that you have each other's phone number so you must have talked to him before and you lived to tell the tale so doing it again shouldn't make you nervous.|`|pcK9PvBGaa	just ask him for it he should be cool with it
XH2o1MM6aa	.The course of true love never runs smooth.There's always little hiccups,trials and tribulations along the way.Perhaps next time you quarrel,just hold your breath.Kiss your finger tips, touch his lips (with your finger tips) and say lets drop it.
7Mro3gfdaa	Well I think it was very nice of you to defend her, but it seems like your friend is more independent. You should respect that she doesn't want you butting in, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't bother with it. I think you should apologize for butting in, but let her know that if she needs any help that you're there to back her up.
4WszPA0Paa	No offense but ur coming off as kinda clingy... I know sakina is trying to help you but from what u said about your boyfriend.. if you try to contact him when he doesnt want you to, he'll resist you even more.<br>  <br>  Normally it's good to go to his house but he's avoiding it so he wants SPACE- call//txt him 2/24/09 and tell him u want to come over in a sweet way (since he's had a day + to get over it, he should  be ok with that)<br>  <br>  Sometimes ppl just need time alone to reset... and since u were in a fight when he was stressed, that kinda builds on the need to just get away for a bit... <br>  it's great u want to spend time with him and care about fixing his stress but he may need to veg out. He knows you care.<br>  <br>  I would be a lil worried about the drug thing for obvious reasons so maybe in a couple days just bring it up casually... don't get into a fight about it, just get the point across that you care about him then leave it alone. <br>  ask around to c if he's actually doing them, if not it may be good to not bring it up<br>  <br>  email if u need w/e <br>  Good Luck|`|A3ZXYbOTaa	I know how you feel, in my opinion you should go to his house or try to contact him as soon as possible. Also, you should ask some of his close friends about how he's been behaving lately or whatever they know about what you don't. Good luck! Oh yeah, and if he does try to go back to using drugs, stop him, it doesn't do anything to help his problems...-_-'|`|BIweLR4raa	yes, go to his house and talk to him<br>  make him realice that u care for him and and ur there<br>  what does it matter that his parents are there?<br>  they should be angry at you for worring bout their son<br>  they should be gratful that u want him safe|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	he might get angry... but i think that you should go to his house... cuz drugs are not the answer!!! make him realize wut it would do to you if he went back to doing drugs... tell him that your sorry for the argument... cuz yall really need to talk!|`|ZoeUEHnOaa	maybe he is CHEATING on you.|`|wWGG8opZaa	yea i think yuh shud prob. go to his house good luck|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	just wait <br>  text him
cdwUaSRaaa	well for one: maybe you shouldn't have broken up with him yanno? it's not that you weren't a priority, it's just maybe he really did need to focus on school a little more.. because let's face it.. school's the most important thing regardless when you're young. and he's probably flirting because he never wanted things to end and to be honest it doesn't sound like you did either.. so i suggest that you tell him in order for you to talk to him in a flirtatious way he needs to get rid of his girlfriend.. because you're absolutely right.. he shouldn't be flirting if he has one. and you don't have to get hurt in order to see him happy because he obviously wants to be with you too girl!!<br>  goood luckkk.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	Does he still have a gf?  If no or it's rocky, talk to him if you still miss him.  He was your bg to begin with but w/o talking to him about problems in your relationship, you stopped talking to him.  He prob got hurt b/c you stopped talking to him and he never got over it and prob wondered what happened.  Even if you're not ready to get back together, I'd tell him why you stopped talking and see where that convoy will lead.  Maybe just friendship or more.  Think of what you want, how you feel, and not just about everyone else...you sound sweet, but don't forget about yourself.|`|pXIQX9J4aa	i think he wants one of three things<br>  <br>  1. just to catch up with an old friend<br>  2. flirting with u so he can dump this new girl and jump to u without much single time<br>  3. flirting with u cause thats what he does with every girl<br>  <br>  if i was u id talk to him a little more to see what he's up to<br>  good luck
Ca7Xkjqxaa	I have that problem a lot! I hate it when that happens. Then sometimes you have to deal with people you don't want to. But just remeber it's only a science project. Just do the work and that's it. Good luck.
e52cc83463d91acf91b6b61881b4f14baa	Absolutely not.  I think that it is very dangerous (especially for a woman) to leave your family and friends.  It puts you in a very vulnerable position.|`|AA10248966	Yes, and of course, I am six toed.<br>  <br>  The answer is NEVER>|`|ByUS0k8waa	It would be Thailand and I wouldn't mind. However, Im married and I don't think it would be smart to move that far for a bf/gf but for a spouse yeah. We've talked about it.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I would if it was somewhere similar to the US - Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, etc. Anywhere else? No. But I would have to make sure my parents could fly out and visit me. Otherwise that would be a deal breaker.|`|GahiILuCaa	Depends, if it was from (me being english) like england to australia, or vice versa, or england to america yeah, anywhere else... nope|`|fYv0dtUFaa	boyfriend no...husband sure..my family would only be a plane ride away|`|AA11180444	One should weigh out the facts and what is the most important to him/her.  <br>  <br>  I would not.  No man is worth leaving all that I have rooted here....children, parents, family, and an established good job that could possibly take care of the bf/gf.|`|hiJ6yKhkaa	depends on if it a first world country or not, if i have to learn a new language to even communicate with the locals, and what they plan to do with their life when the get there, if its the help the people around them then yes.|`|GfCRiueRaa	I admit, I probably would. I don't fall for anyone often, but when I do, I fall hard. So I probably would. <br>  <br>  I thought about moving to Kazakhstan once (for someone). It was a combination of counting my chickens before they hatched and slight delusion. hahaha.|`|089rq2GOaa	Only if they're totally committed to the relationship.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	The only thing keeping me in this country now is my husband. I came for school and ended up meeting him and my intent was to move back home but i ended up staying after we got married.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	not for a boyfriend or girlfriend but if it was my husband i would go in a heartbeat|`|3kCQDUUGaa	no way|`|AA11584348	my family is very important to me so i don't think so
AA11538662	Nope I simply tolerate them while standing my ground. Hubby backs me because he knows they are wrong. I have been accused of marrying hubby just to raise my sons because I was a widow with 3 minor sons when we met. I have been accused of marrying hubby for his money but the funny thing is that my income is more than his between my kids death benefits and what I earn working, hubby is retired with 2 ex wives getting their paws in on his pension money.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I always tolerate and smile.  That's the name of the game!|`|kbz5S3waaa	i hate them all. When we lived in the same town as them i would smile and nod, hold it all in, but then we moved 5000 miles away, and they came to our house for a visit, and once it came to disrespecting me in my home, i drew the line, voiced my opinion (very loudly in fact) and made them leave. My husband stood strong beside me.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	No I don't really and yes I tolerate and smile. So long as you don't make it an issue with your husband then you have every right to not like them when they give you good cause. Now granted their are some real nightmare in-laws that will leave you no choice but to address the issue with your husband, but otherwise tolerate, smile, ignore, and stay silent if they like to push your buttons.|`|ByUS0k8waa	My husband I both dislike them so its pretty easy. Plus when they started acting like they were better then me so I googled them and dug up some dirt on them. Now its really easy to smile and just tolerate them all.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	I tolerate his mother and get along with his sisters and oldest brother and can't stand his older brother.|`|vRodocjcaa	I tolerate and smile, even though his bitter mother hates me and everything about me and tells everyone so, and even though his brother calls me every name in the book, and even though the two of them have managed to get the rest of the family to believe their cruel lies. I just have to remind myself that they will get theirs one day, and in the end, it doesn't really matter to the state of my soul whether or not they are good to me.|`|fKYi6C0iaa	I think everyone has to tolerate sometimes. I know I have been with my domestic partner (haven't got married but we live together) for two years, and his family loved me at first. But now, his uncle started telling me how I gained weight and just loads of stuff that the whole family gets in on.... and I have to smile and just take it. So I know what your asking about. It even makes me want to run out and cry but instead I just sit and smile cause I won't let them affect my day!|`|PdxMOlcaaa	My first husband I never got along with his mommy, she was so perfect, can you imagine a bi polar June Cleaver?  I used to take abuse from her like you wouldn't believe.  Most of the family was ok, I became a sickening pleasaholic.  Until I learned taking nasty comments was really not the thing to do and I could say no, I'm not going there.  No one has the right to treat you bad and your husband needs to be on your side.|`|fspDacdOaa	No Way!! my own father in law came out from europe for our wedding and he gives me his blessing then when i went to spend time with my family the night before the wedding my father in law kept telling my future hubby to be ... over and over again... there is still time to get out... nothing is permanent!!  ... he has never liked me... he calls our house on my b-day and asks to talk to my hubby!!  i just suck it up and let it go... just smile and wave!  i am sorry your in this situation... i feel for you!!!!! *hug*
hiJ6yKhkaa	get her something, show her what type of friend you are and what type of friend you want in return.|`|4gDvfLsIaa	i wouldnt, she was  jerk, and doesnt deserve one.<br>  yeah, id just get her a card.|`|SaPB4FPdaa	Ya! u should make her a CD... it should have the music that would like and maybe she would think u were a cooler friend|`|yT29OZuvaa	That's such a...jerky thing to do! If I were you, I would give her something small, with a little personal edge on it. Or you could give her a card with, like, 10 or 15 dollars in it. <br>  <br>  The gift card to aeropostale sounds good, too :) <br>  <br>  Also, tell your friend to be a little more considerate to you, she doesn't seem to be treating you very well at all.|`|w51hObZyaa	You shouldn't do something too big like a big store bought gift because she may feel like you are trying to buy her friendship or make her feel guilty.<br>  Try a small gift like a gift card or maybe a CD that you have of a band she might enjoy.<br>  She's your friend and you shouldn't just blow off her birthday if you remember it. Just think of something simple, but nice.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	how about something small like..... a pillow with an embroidery on it? im sure sh'eel love whatever u gave her.
SNC58uQvaa	Ru, run, run as fast as you can.<br>  <br>  Oh girl friend it is such a mistake to go backwards.<br>  <br>  I would find someone totally new and make a fresh new start.<br>  <br>  All of the reasons that you fought with Ethan are still there.<br>  <br>  Try someone new.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|A7ovwP94aa	Assuming you are over 18. I would put them in the past and meet someone new. You do not sound that enthused about any of them so I would just move on. If you really like Justin then you could give him another chance.<br>  <br>  I personally would stay clear of boyfriends 1 and 3.<br>  <br>  Only you can make the decision - the above is what I would personally do.|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	Put them all in the past. You can find someone better and hav a future rather than a past.|`|pcK9PvBGaa	justin sounds like the best choice|`|71VRvldJaa	I'd write off all three of them!<br>  Why don't you put some thought as to the kind of guy you'd like to be with.....make a list so you can see it on paper!  Write down the MANDATORY things that are most important to you.  When you meet a boy, if he doesn't have all those important things, don't waste your time with him!  There's absolutely no purpose in being with somebody just because you can be.<br>  You make it sound like you have to pick one of the three you described and none of them sound like good dating material!  The first one backed off after you put out....he was just using you.  The other two you've already tried and they didn't work out!  Giving it a second try isn't going to make it any better.  <br>  You sound obsessed with boys and desperate to have a boyfriend.  When you get desperate, you end up picking losers!  Go make your list and stick to it!|`|90hqtKNeaa	I think you should just talk to them, remain friends with them and see what happens from that point on. Its good to have a few options but it sounds like you are too confused right now to even know if any of them are worth dating (or just keeping around for that matter). Take some time to just be their friend and take some time for yourself and see which one is worth it then.|`|g8Z6Q1FCaa	First Boy: "I'm starting to regret it"(You did stuff you regret). <br>              "we don't talk nearly as much" (He's using you.)  Sorry to say.<br>  <br>  Second Boy: he ended up breaking up with me...He'll do it again. <br>  <br>  Third Boy: . We always fought and it got annoying, so we broke up,...that's no fun, he's not for you.<br>  <br>  Forgot all of them . You are better than that. You don't NEED a guy right now. Don't settle.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	Brent definitely no! Justin i would say no... you don't want him to think he can hurt you and run back when he needs a gf! Now ethan. To break up and keep in touch has gotta mean something! Maybe by now you've learned how to be in a realtionship without fighting. Give it a whirl with him!|`|2gc9wrzZaa	put them in your past, <br>  there are a milions guys out there and it sounds like the ones youve been hanging out with arnt the best ones, <br>  keep your eyes open youll find somthing better, <br>  <br>  -xoxo Faith|`|qqi2YlABaa	aright go back out with justin and tell him that if he wants to go back out with you he should hold on to you because he probably will miss a lot  if he doesn't.|`|yah14b6gaa	forget them they are old news. find some one more better then them i mean people always want to look forward to the future and not be held up by the past|`|M3CsxF2jaa	yes
411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	you have helped me so much,this hurts me to see that you are going thru this.<br>  One: I have learned to deal with them like this: say that they hurt you,i would look at them,and say that they are not being very mature,and that they need to grow up.<br>  Then,i retaliate. i say something to hurt them.<br>  If it is an adult,then ti is called verbal abuse and i,for one, do not tolerate it.<br>  If it is a child, mine,then they get a whippin'and no matter where i am at,they get it. If it is in public,I wait til I get home,then they get a a$$-whoopin, and good.<br>  My kids were raised not to disrespect any adult.<br>  If it is an adult,i would kindly tell that person, " You really should not go around saying hurtful things. oh,by the way: your ignorance is showing." <br>  <br>  That usually shuts them up.<br>  I am known for being caustic, in other words,: rudely funny.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	You need to work on developing how the "adult" you protects your inner child. Obviously it wasn't developed when you were growing up, probably because mom or dad would say something hurtful...thus parents couldn't show you how to nurture yourself. <br>  <br>  One thing that helps me is to empathize with the person making fun of you. Usually its from some stupid insecurity, i.e. mom and dad are divorcing, they get beat at home...in short focusing on why they could be insecure. In a way it provides an explanation as to why they're doing what they're doing. <br>  <br>  The other thing is to turn the situation into a joke for yourself. I.e when they're done saying these hurtful things, smile, give them the finger and tell them to **** off. It's always fun to see someone get caught off guard. :D|`|f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	Ignore them, they are having a bad day and they want you to have one also.

c02fb4873083bed3a514e7672c82be22aa	From what you've stated it appears to me that you are with him because you feel bad breaking up with and guilt yourself into getting back together with him.  That is very unhealthy. If you have so many doubts then you are better off doing a permanent break and following through with it.  Since you've played the on again, off again game with him it will be much harder to stick with it as he'll probably be begging and waiting for you to come back again.<br>  <br>  Make a clean break and move on.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11669938	OK, so u do u like that guy like crazy, just crush or just friends? and if u broke up with him, say Im sorry whoever, but I dont think I could hang out with u anymore, ( if u wanna be nice then say) I think UR 2oooo good for me, and i cant live with it, im sorry, ( if u wanna be mean then say) "Im not goin out with u anymore, u r a soft guy, who is doesnt return all of my emails, and is probably datin sum hussy/or girl behind my back, so buhbye andd i hope to never c u again."   the relationship just wont work out any ways, so u have to end it, im sorry|`|AA12173194	OK first off it might just be that he is the one for you, and it jus might be that he is very busy and can only sms you 1 every 3 times you sms him. I would say wait and see what happens cause if you loose him it might be forever and you should never do thing haisty!!!!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your day!!!|`|79c8f00951daea9ccf3afb9d9e7d1751aa	I think you might have answered your question.  If you guys are on & off, you're content with just being friends with him & you stay with him because of pity.  Breaking up is probably best, follow your heart... You should be with someone that makes you happy.  As for returning messages, I think that's a guy thing.  I hate that, us women need attention, when we don't get it....sometimes it makes us wonder.|`|94fa7803b6cbf85af3a070fccd95528baa	First of all you should never stay with someone just because you feel sorry for them, it will only hurt you both in the long run. In a way what you are doing is selfish, but it is selfish to both of you, you're not giving yourself the chance to see if there is anyone else for you, and you are leading him on. If he is in summer school and not returning your messages very often, maybe he is busy, remember don't jump to conclusions. Or maybe he is giving you a taste of your own medicine. So my honest answer would be to cut all ties with him, don't even be friends, or talk, just give that at least a month or two and if you still feel the same way, then go with that. I wish you the best of luck, LOVE is hard!|`|AA11179275	i think if you need to break up with him just do it dont feel bad because he is attatched to you because the longer you wait the more it is going to hurt|`|97bd4dc555cacca9701e4f26d6b78755aa	Break up with him for an extended period, and don't date anyone else. Clear your head and take a breath. 6 months without dating should clear your mind on him, and you'll have a better idea that you want him long-term or that you really want to move on.|`|c6f0ac7bcff1444159a55e9bd20a85c4aa	dear who ever,firstthing do u love him?and always fallow your heart and your heart will tell u what to do.
aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	You didn't get an answer before because your question is way too long.  In any case, this girl is simply not interested in you.  Ignore her.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	Definitely not reading that.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	YA and she is hinting she likes you! ask her out, she may be to nervous to <br>  <br>  mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkaOzvQKkZVx2ywcBbROIQrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223162429AAM5miP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FOtWOS0Uaa	hahaha, i didnt read that thing AT ALL!!!! i just skipped it and went to read the other answers and just like everyone said; its WAYY too long|`|BbT3DCHvaa	you need to condense this if you want people to answer|`|M3CsxF2jaa	wait until you get married|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	She likes you but doesnt want to ruin her friendship with her friend that likes you thats how some girls are. You should probably let it play out hopefully her friend will give her the okay.|`|9nJwsSvPaa	this fukkin $hit is way 2 long|`|U5LwIo1Jaa	i didnt even read it cut it short and than ppl will answer it... iight pce :)|`|A5nZFjEoaa	Ok well from a girl's point of view...she seema annoyed! If she really wants to talk you she'll find a way to. Just be he friend, but don't be too clingy and MAYBE it will eventually turn into something else.|`|EdDLydH7aa	It sounds like she really wants to be just friends and perhaps b/c of her parents she isn't allowed to date right now, just take it as it goes and be friends, nothing is wrong with that and if it turns into more that's cool too...just take it slow and don't rush anything and let time take it's course...good luck :)|`|FgqGhhShaa	I think it sounds like she might like you. All that stuff about her parents being strict might be true, but she might also be playing hard-to-get. You should just tell her how you feel - wouldn't you rather know how she feels about you rather than never finding out. Remember, have no regrets!<br>  <br>  Also, your question is a little long, so it might look a little daunting for people who aren't very good at reading, or who are just lazy and can't be bothered. You included a lot of detail, which is good because it helps us to understand your situation  better, but it might be a good idea to condense any other questions you post in the future, and you might get more answers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck with the girl!|`|PHp71Xt7aa	Hey! Obviously you have to right out all of this otherwise people wouldn't understand the situation would then.<br>  <br>  Anywayz firstly, you sound like a REALLY nice guy! & this girl is lucky that you are interested in her, you do not know how many girls would loveee to have a guy like you, one who is not a jerk or idiot.<br>  <br>  So, i suggest that you ask her to hang out with you, something casual & relaxed, like a milkshake or just chill together.<br>  <br>  Then you can get to know each other, have fun & let the sparks fly!<br>  <br>  Alot of her behaviour suggests she is in to you so I am sure she would want to hang out with you (eg- playing with her necklace is typical girl flirting). So ask her, don't be scared or play games, it doesnt seem like your this type of guy anyways!<br>  <br>  After hanging out you can kiss her goodbye... then go from there.<br>  <br>  Ask her out... you initiate the conversation...<br>  <br>  Good luck =))<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|Q4D5T5vwaa	if you both have feelings for each other, then it's a match. if not, you can just be friends. after that you never know... maybe your friendship with the girl can blossom into something more later on.
Ftz9UWPEaa	yes, u should be pissed off.<br>  just hope that prom sucks for her.<br>  the rest is out of ur hands, but treat her accordingly for her miscare of ur feelings.|`|1663aacaf477ab5d8cb4705d60ab324faa	Yes! That would upset the hell out of me!! What was the point of her asking you if she was going to ask him no matter what! She seems like a 2-face backstabber to me and seems to not have a care in the world of your feelings. I know it's upsetting but just shake it off..there are plenty of other guys out there and other people to be friends with!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Well now you know what kind of friend you have, if you can call her that.|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	Real friends don't do that to each other. She's no friend of yours.|`|SaPB4FPdaa	YA TOTALLY!!!!!!!!!I WOULD HATE HER AND I WOOULD NEVER SPEAK TO HER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! THAT WOULD PISS ME OFF LIKE HELL!!|`|0Tew2jDlaa	what a b*tch|`|kQoKAR5paa	Yes it is very wrong. First off why would she ask a boy who has a girlfriend to prom?Secondly why would she ask your ex?I could see it being understandable if a lot of time had passed since you had been together with that person.Assuming that it has not been awhile it's very inappropriate of her.|`|WmrERhMJaa	Yes I absolutely 100% agree with you. It's quite clearly wrong. And if you feel a little jealous don't feel bad. I never thought of myself a jealous person but when my ex found another boyfriend I felt extremely jealous. It's perfectly normal and I know exactly what you mean. You should confront her and ask her what her deal is.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	that's sooo wrong! you need to talk to her, because there's selfish and that's way beyond average selfishness! I would be so pissed!  you told her no and she openly went against you knowing you would be hurt! She's a WITCH with a B|`|v6cUS9OUaa	that is wrong. Your "best" friend must not care about your feelings to much if she is going to prom with your ex when you already told her that it was not ok.|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	yes that is wrong because she obviously told her not to but she did what kind of friend is that....|`|M5oze91caa	absolutely. she is sounding very selfish.|`|xpg7K7aQaa	That would upset me. A good friend wouldn't do that to you. I wouldn't get all dramatic over it though.|`|zWowRddEaa	no she should know ex's are off limits|`|gui4YVkKaa	ya totally!!!!!!!!! thats totally weird on wrong|`|vUl6NDE7aa	that is sooo frickken wrong!!!!<br>  i like would be sooo pissed!!!
1YdeUn1Caa	That's for a judge to decide. From what you say though, she will get the house. He has no job, can't keep one. Is violent. There is no way, he will be getting that house. Unless he gets a top notch attorney, she has no worries. <br>  She should have pressed charges too. By not, she gave him a license to continue.|`|aXYiOskmaa	he can go back any time he wants. no charges have been pressed and no divorce papers have been filed. nor has she gotten an order of protection. she needs to get on the stick and get things done or she's screwed|`|rDmMk9Soaa	She really should press charges and get a restraining order.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	she needs to call the cops and press charges,change the locks|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Brutal honesty?? The child should be taken from both parents. One the husband should not have hit the child, but the mom is guilty of child neglect and abuse for not turning in the offender to the cops. They both sound like they need parenting classes. Some adult punches my kid and the cops would have to pull me off of them. I don't believe in violence, but that situation could definitely provoke me to it. Both parents sound like Losers and if you weren't her friend you would probably be able to see that.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	She actually needs to file charges now before all evidence disappears and the she has nothing. this will prevent future problems as she will soon have to file for a protective restraining order against him for her and her daughter. Then as long as she can afford to she can remain there but she definitely has to file charges now or lose the chance. Tell the arresting authorities about his drug problem and anger issues. If she needs out quick have her contact a womens help group  immediately and they will help her. Good luck|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Without legal action being taken he has every right to live there at anytime. Sorry!|`|hGF6i3Eyaa	This how it will shake out-right now he has as much right to stay in the house as she does. She needs to file for a divorce, and there will be a property settlement. If they bought the house while they were married, the house will be sold and the money divided between them after other debts that they owe will be paid off before the house money is divided.As bad as the housing market is,they may owe more on the house then they can sell it for. The abuse of her daughter should not be tolerated. The guy should be arrested and charged with battery and abuse against a minor.
AA10702820	I think its okay to share your worries with someone...but it depends on who that person is. I personally share my worries with close friends of mine who I trust and who are there for me. Some people say and actually mean it when they say that they are there for you. And they can be trusted. Other people shouldn't even be trusted with your worries because they will blab it to people or will make you feel worse by saying negative stuff that brings you down.<br>  <br>  Some people like strong people who are always on top of the world and don't worry because thats who they wish they could be. Seriously though, who doesn't worry? Its impossible to be on top of the world every single minute of your life. Everyone has their ups and downs, some people are naturally happy and come off as strong but they still have their days. And just because you worry doesn't really make you weak, it just shows you have emotions and you're human. As long as you're not always down in the dumps and worrying then people should still want to be around you.<br>  <br>  By what you've said about what you thought, I think you should be careful. Some people make great friends who will be there for you, others won't want to be there for you no matter how many times you've been there for them. Don't hang out w/ people who won't be there for you because thats not a friend. Choose your friends wisely. :)<br>  <br>  Take care!!|`|AA11447210	Most people do share their worries and fears...that's part of what friends are for. Friends don't expect you to be perfect or always strong. They realize you are human, have flaws, have bad days, etc.<br>  <br>  Internalizing fears and worries and stress can also be bad for our health. Better to get it out by either talking to friends/family, or a counselor than to always keep it inside.<br>  <br>  If you are a person who ALWAYS has problems and complains, that might damage a friendship. Being around someone who is always in crisis can be emotionally exhausting and not much fun. There needs to be good times to balance out the bad.|`|7Mro3gfdaa	It's ok to let your feelings out to your friends, but you have to be there to support them as well. No one likes it if all they do is help you and they get nothing in return. It's fine as long as you give back to them as well.|`|XnPtnGvZaa	if its someone loyal and you know they wont betray you then yes|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	sometimes<br>  the less you say<br>  the better<br>  just be a good friend|`|A2SogiGCaa	yeah sure|`|ekEj2Mbiaa	No, I think it's 100% ok to share your worries with someone.<br>  If they were a real friend, they'd try and help you out with whatever it was you're going through.
d5lbv4fXaa	I think you should see him more offten. Even though he put you through hell he still is your father and you are still his child, that can't change. You can only be with someone once. If you stay mad at him forever once he dies you'll never be able to say sorry. I really think he still loves you to, but doesn't show it. This is your only time to get along with each other, so don't waste the time you two have left with each other. You don't want to spend the rest of your life wondering what it would have been like if you two had made up. Take a chance you never know just what might happen!|`|u7LSohRyaa	Making sure that you all has been said and done with him. You can still love a terrible person who happens to be your dad.

If you can't beat 'em and don't want to divorce him, then join 'em.<br>  Lie about everything, especially things that he will know or suspect is a lie. Eventually, he will ask why you are lying so much, then you can say, "It doesn't feel good, does it, when someone you love and trusted, lies to your face every time they open their mouths? How do you like it? You set the rules, I'm just playing by them. If you want to change the rules, and start telling the truth, then I will play by the new rules. It's completely up to you. What's it going to be?"<br>  I don't know what else you can do, except to show him how it feels, hopefully it will be a wake up call for him. <br>  I would really like to recommend counseling for him to find out why he lies so much, but he probably won't go, because he can't see that he has a problem. He most likely lies to himself, even more than he lies to you and others. That's why I think that giving him a dose of his own medicine may be your only chance to wake him up to what he's doing to you and his family.<br>  Don't be afraid to ruin things, how much worse can they get than to be married to a habitual liar? A liar is a thief and a cheater, and usually has mental issues that go very deep, causing him to have no self respect.

Sorry to say but he is not going to change and thats the reason he is my ex  now. He used to lie about every little things and I never understood the need of that. Some ppl are sick, and can not tell truth. They are addicted to lying. Try marriage counseling but I dont think he will change. Well, my ex did  not and it kept getting worse. It got to a point where he would lie about every single thing and it got so worse that I had to investigate everything about him, to see where he went, what he said, email accounts, etc. And guess what? I found out that he has been a gambler all those years, and dwas gambling our monies away!! So I spent years of my life trying to figure out if he was lying to me, if waht he said was the truth. We even tried counseling! Well guess what? I got fed up with it, I have a life my own too, and I deserve someone that was as honest as I was. I hope that yours change, Id say try the counseling and if that does not help, do not waste your time and life on someone that does not deserve it and does not appreciate you...|`|bDCSxkJtaa	When you know he's lying about something PICK UP on it and tell him you know thats not true and you know he lied about his age and his name and that he really is PINNOCHIO don't just go along with his lies LET HIM KNOW YOU KNOW HE'S A LIAR!!!

You could say here we go again with another one of your lies.. and you know I know every time you do.. so.. pretty soon I will not believe a thing you say because you lie so much.

It is true that personality disorders are very hard to treat and many insurances will not reimburse treatment solely for that because we don't have successful treatments yet.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you both get individual counseling in addition to your couple's therapy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

LeX9Z7jjaa	It's a very tough thing to deal with. In the last year and a half my boyfriend, and my grandpa and grandpa all have passed away. (my grandma just a week ago). There is no easy way to deal and no right way to deal. Just hold the memories that you have with that person close to your heart.. they are yours to keep and they can never be taken away from you. Right now I'm sure that thinking of him brings you sadness, but in the days and weeks ahead things that you've thought about that make you sad will bring you comfort. Hang in there and still try for you 4.0 and getting in shape for wrestling and even applying to his old college. Just because he is gone doesn't mean that you can't still strive for the things that you wanted to show him. He might not be here physically but his spirit is with you every day. Best of luck to you and so sorry for your loss.|`|W6uHaI1kaa	Just pray|`|XGgPhaDbaa	The Bible says that even the Angels rejoice when someone comes home to God. <br>  Don't be sad about your friend. He is in a better place with no pain and no disability.<br>  We always cry and feel sad when someone dies but it is really because we miss them, not because they went to be with God.<br>  <br>  You just keep up the good work so your friend can look down from heaven and see it.|`|fKYi6C0iaa	All you can do is know that they are watching over you. Its never easy to lose someone and I have had lots of death around me. It doesn't get easy to move on, but you have to remember it was there time to go. Nothing can ever change the memories and good times. And trust me when you get where you want to be you will look up and know they are watching. I know years have passed since i last lost, and it never gets easier, you just learn to deal with it because the world is moving and you have no choice but to go forward. And if everyone seems to be moving on, its just that everyone copes with death differently. I still hear songs on the radio and shed a tear every now and then. Just handle it in your own way, and stick to what you do. No one wants you to follow in someone else' shadow, I'm sure your loved one, wants you to stride in what you know how to do! And as for your grades, your doing a lot better than me!
BLaEQfdDaa	well from experience its about what you both feel, as much as we would like to be with someone forever, life doesnt turn out that way, and one person cant keep the marriage going either. when its over you will feel different, like not caring about things like you use, dont spend time together anymore, sex life has changed, you both argue more about stupid things..you both feel that its better being friends and go your own ways.//// worth saving, if the love is there start trying to being honest and open about things, you both have to sit down and talk, talk about everything, whats wrong what can be done to make things better, then decide where to go after that!!! good luck|`|xsG3woDCaa	when you no longer wish for the others company,you no longer catch yourself desiring the touch of your wife husband or other,you stop caring about their needs wants and wishes,or you just stop feeling anything.thats when to call it quits.mildred sent me here to help you with this.|`|YFg1bdwaaa	When you don't care anymore.  You will know when you reach that point.  If it doesn't bother you that the other person does things that use to bother you, you know to call it quits.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I think its over when you no longer feel for the person. When you don't care that its over is when you stop trying to make it work.|`|65m62rDraa	When both sides are willing to work hard to save the marriage.
xyQRD8ahaa	there are many ways of escapism!<br>  <br>  send her a mail stating that you have an unavoidable appointment!<br>  <br>  send her some flowers along with your mail - if you think that its not too costly.<br>  <br>  find other ways like telling her that you need to go for project works/exams/etc to keep away from the show!<br>  <br>  make sure you inform the same to all your relatives the same way.. so that all links would end up the same way!|`|Inw5heh8aa	if you two aren't THAT close, then she probably invited you to both because you're family and because she doesn't want to insult you by not inviting you to the friend one. (that is unless you say you're only gonna go to one and she begs you to go to both, then I'm wrong ^__^;;) So yeah, just say you'll go to the family one. besides, that way you can pitch in on a present with you and your mom or someone else. XD (you could do that with one or more of the friends too. . . )|`|24T71hYjaa	Go to one, or many, if you like, but only get one gift for all the parties.  A gift for every party?  That's rediculous!  And only get what you can afford (if $50 is all you can afford then so be it!)  If she snubs you, then that's her selfish loss, not yours.<br>  <br>  You can also politely bow out of some of the parties, citing real life events like work.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is made of money, and she apparently is thinking that the world is made of money when it comes to Her.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	My dad did not instill any confidence in his daughters.Send a sucky email!.|`|JLcMGcCOaa	They would be frowned upon... lol.

Good luck :D|`|hXpKechTaa	say your tummy hurts lol.<br>  your not obligated to go only cause she invited you.<br>  dont sweat it, i think going to one is enough.|`|AORcLwTNaa	you only have to go to one of them. if you feel like yall are friends more than just family members than go to that one. but if your more comfortable with the family go to that one. Also, if u do decide to go to both, you absolutley only need one gift. and if you dont want to go at all then send a small gift with a card . and let her know im sorry i cant make it ...|`|aXYiOskmaa	if you don't want to go, can't go or whatever , just don't go. it's really no big deal. i doubt you'll have to worry about being graceful about it at all.
71VRvldJaa	My granddaughter has webkinz and she's nearly 13 and I think it's great!

I'm a lot older than most on this site but when I was 13-14 I was still playing with Barbies.<br>  <br>  Is it really better that these young girls be out running around in sleazy clothes, obsessed with boys and bj's and having low self esteem because they don't think they are "hot" enough.

Becuz quite frankly its your life not mine so therefore, hence, its incomplete.. (sarcasm) >> i mean, it's only the rest of you're life that awaits you right? ONLY! no what I'm saying? Even if you're baby won't really know his own father its worth the risk.. oh well becuz I'm sure there's lots of stepdads who could make great examples and be greater toward you're kid(s) so yeah... hope I helped make a point? but whatever do whatever YOU feel its right.. one can only guide u through, you know.|`|nCxraniDaa	I think you should just leave him alone.

3ox4lYu6aa	In my opinion I would not change my looks for a guy. He takes me as I am or not at all. If I do change my looks then I would be someone I'm not and they guy would like that person and not the person I truly am. If a guy wants you to change your looks then he is not the one for you. Why should you change just for him? That's like saying he doesn't like you the way you are now. Only change if you want to change. Don't change just for him. You may not like the change and won't be happy.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Duh!|`|AA10702820	Eeek! Please be careful!!<br>  This guy has a girlfriend and you gotta back off because if she finds out about you (sounds like you're a secret that hes keeping from her) then things will not be good! Yes, he doesn't talk to you at school because of her.<br>  <br>  I was in a similiar situation where I liked a guy who was taken. I was told to move on but I didn't want to because I liked him a lot and I thought maybe him and I would have a chance. Don't expect this guy to drop her for you because if he does who's to say that he wouldn't do the same to you later on? When you like a guy and he's taken, back off and just be cool. This will be a test of his character and who he is. If he's flirty to girls while he's taken then thats not good. Some guys just like someone on the side or are players. Don't fall for a player like I did and hold on. Let go when you still can! I don't think you want your heart torn in two! Its not the easiest thing to do but its the  best thing you can do for yourself.<br>  <br>  Maybe if he breaks up with her then you and him can be together. But I hear about stuff like this all the time and the girl gets her hopes up only to wind up brokenhearted. Find a guy who isn't taken and who you can be with now.<br>  <br>  Don't fall for a dude and hold on so tight that you end up getting hurt cuz it could happen.<br>  <br>  Trust me!<br>  <br>  All the best!!|`|yT29OZuvaa	Yep. But be careful. His girlfriend might get a little jealous and defensive if she ever finds out that you guys are getting so close. She might just want him to herself, it's only to be expected, right? <br>  <br>  Start out by being a really close friend and offer advice and an open ear whenever he needs to talk about anything, even his girlfriend. <br>  <br>  Then when they break up, (hey, you're in highschool, not like they're going to get married) show him you're there for him in text and in person. <br>  <br>  Since you guys don't talk in person, try to change that. But don't make it flirty so people get suspicious that he's cheating on her for you, which would be bad (unless you want that).  Do you have any classes with him? If you do, then talk to him then. If you don't, try to ask him for homework help or something over text.<br>  <br>  Also, does he know you like him? <br>  <br>  And by that text, he either seems like a real charming playboy, or a really caring boy. Take your pic. :) <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	That's really wierd.  Sounds like he likes you but needs to be forced to pick just one.  If his gf knew that, i doubt she'd be happy.  I know that if my hubby (or even when he was my boyfriend or fiance) was talking to another girl, and flirting like that, i would have gone ballistic!  I'd tell him that i wasn't comfortable talking to him like that while he has a girlfriend.  And maybe that you like him but know that his gf would probably be upset if she knew the two of you were talking to eachother all night.  <br>  <br>  Oh and i'm having an ok night.  Just bored and since i've been pregnant i can't ever decide what i want to eat, i'm just not motivated to eat anything!.. I know i need to, just don't feel hungry!|`|xpg7K7aQaa	Hi. :) <br>  <br>  Your friendship with him sounds really sweet. I think your best bet is exactly what you're thinking. Just wait and see what happens. You don't want to say anything that could ruin this. <br>  <br>  If he never dumps this girl for you though, you might want to confront him or find a new man even if you don't really want to. You can always make time for this guy later. Take action!<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	omgee this is exactly what was going on with me. i think hes just giving innocent flirts. but if he has a gf, i suggest u cross him off your list... until hes single ;D

3iNobwVraa	Based on a psychological assessment, that states he is "possibly" abusive?  No.  Simply having the personality traits to be something does not mean one can be treated as if they had already committed the crime.  And, I don't think someone's children should be taken except under extreme and DEFINITIVE circumstances.  Possible doesn't fit the bill, imo.|`|SHARt1k3aa	If he abuses his wife, in time he will abuse the children.  I don't think he should lose custody, but maybe monitored visits depending on the children's ages.  and if the slightest bit of abuse happens to the children, then those visitation rights should be taken away.  If the kids are old enough to tell their mom they don't like going to dads because he's mean and hits them, then they are old enough to go visit him unsupervised.|`|AA10248966	No...However, if I had wanted to protect the kids, I'd had insisted the testing be done for emotional, behavioral and anxiety disorders in a PSYCHIATRIC UNIT< not phychology.|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	anybody can " possibly " be capable of anything....That's why proof is required in our law system...not speculation.....He should not lose custody of his children because an intern thinks he is "possibly" an abuser.
KVFYJrDJaa	I was in a similar way once, but I was angry all the time instead of laughing at the misfortune of others. First you have to want to change. Believe me when I say it'll be hard at first but wanting to change, REALLY wanting to change, means you'll be cognizant when you start acting the way you don't want to act. You'll slowly start catching yourself in the middle of your undesirable behavior, and eventually, you'll condition yourself to be different.<br>  <br>  Also, act the way you want to be. Just.... pretend. If you act a certain way, you become that way over time. Again, it's conditioning. <br>  <br>  In my example, I acted nice and helpful and like I wanted to be treated and over time, that's just the person I am now. Can I still get mad? Hell yeah! Mad as hell! But I'm not road raging and getting ticked at the old lady paying for her groceries with 100 coupons and pennies and wanting to knock out the stupid waiter that took 20 minutes to get my drink. And I'm better off for it. And you will be too. <br>  <br>  Want to change, act the way you want to be, and stick with it. It works. <br>  <br>  But never stop laughing at other people's misfortune, cause that s**t is funny! Just laugh on the inside unless everyone else is laughing, cause if you laugh with everyone else, you're ok.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Just be the way you are noting is wrong with laughing.|`|Ftz9UWPEaa	it takes YOU to change that.<br>  if u have to come on yahoo answers to change urself, then u must not care enough about the prob to put YOUR own input into tryna fix the problem.|`|NBErRe8Saa	theres no cure for being insensitive, you just have to tell yourself to change and do it.|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	well if someone tripped u should go over and help them get up.. if someone gets embarrass or something like that dont laugh try to help them out and dont laugh at everything u see my god.. lol|`|XeLZtw20aa	don't change your personality let people like you for who you are|`|Q4D5T5vwaa	no, you don't act like a whatever you said. it doesn't matter what gender or age you are, you can laugh as much as you want at anything really. i'm 19 and i laugh a lot too. when people trip, if someone farts or burps or sneezes, i laugh too. even when i fart burp or sneeze or trip myself, i laugh at myself too. nothing is wrong with you. i would actually be so glad to have you around, because you love to laugh. you're not mean in any way by laughing at things like those.<br>  <br>  look up bam margera in youtube, the guy from the shows jackass and viva la bam. he has such a great sense of humor, and is ALWAYS laughing. i always credit him for making me feel good about life and laughing. here's one of his videos: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tHoA9I-SF0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tHoA9I-S...</a>|`|N7fgm0U3aa	I'm the same way and you know what? People have straight out told me at times that my laughing was weird or loud or that I laughed WAY too much. I couldn't help myself, if something happened like that (ppl tripping and what-not) I had to laugh. But hey, I've been like that my whole life and it's just who I am. It used to embarrass me but I'm okay with it now and it doesn't affect me any more and I have plenty of friends who don't notice it at all. :) Just try and be positive about things like that.|`|mbvCTR2uaa	lol oh sweetie, don't worry about it...now, if you're laughing at things that shouldn't be funny- then maybe you should tone it down a bit...everytime you come across something that isn't really that funny, catch yourself and automatically put yourself in their shoes...hope that helps|`|0Tew2jDlaa	haha i laugh alot @ my school to! just little things that people do just really his my funny bone! i always say after i laugh somthing like your so cute or that was adorable... cuz that was really what i was laughing @! how funny and ironicly unique the thing that the person did..<br>  <br>  people with half a brain will kno that you are joking :)|`|eUbnK84Iaa	ok well first of all maybe you shouldnt laugh at someone when they fall, instead of laughing help them up. i know it seems weird but then that can lead you to have a new friend.|`|VZvLPUY2aa	Find new friends.

ifgzHzA3aa	I'm sorry, but being a bridesmaid does not obligate anyone to helping with the wedding.  The only thing they are obligated to do is buy the dress and be there the day of your wedding and be happy for you.  It's your wedding not theirs.  Who's the drama queen here?  They are supposed to be your closest friends/family, not free labor.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	You are right. One of the responsibilities as a bridesmaid is t help with planning and things. I am having the same problem with 2 of my girls. It took me weeks to get them to go get fitted while the other girls already ordered a month before. I finally told them if they didn't have it ordered by a certain date then I would assume they didn't want to be a bridesmaid. you have enough to stress and worry about. No time for other people's drama. Your girls should be helping you out and they should be trying to make it less stressful on you! that is their jobs!|`|cLrY0O4Uaa	They are not REQUIRED to help. Anymore, that expectation is dated. Put on your big girl panties and just do it yourself.
UJ1w74gdaa	aw! naming a puppy after you? thats so awesome!<br>  <br>  maybe spend a day with your friend or go somewhere exciting and pay for her, or get some new toys or a new puppy collar in her favorite color or new leash, and remember to tell her thanks|`|ADNmtsyZaa	I think that you should say Thank You and let it go. There is not much that you can do when your friend names a puppy after you. Thank him/her and his/her parents. I hope I was a help. You could also ask her if you could do anything for him/her? Bye, and good luck.|`|wSv40svOaa	I am assuming that she is naming the dog after you because you two are extremely close. If it were me I would buy the dog something.  Like a cute shirt or sweater.

Try and explain that the two of you would never work out because you're not right for each other and that he's just not the type of guy you go for.  He will probably persist a LOT, trust, been there done that, but you'll have to repeat yourself over and over, basically become a broken record.

You need to start thinking about him as the kind of person he is.  Think about it, if he was your husband he would be playing the same games on you and don't fool yourself about that.  He has probably cheated on you too.  I know his type all to well.  It's not easy to clear your head of that kind of person, but you should want more for your life than to be his toy.  He knows that he is getting to you don't give in.  Have a better life than that.

I don't know where you keep seeing his wife. She probably doesn't know about you. The one time I became attracted to a married man in school, I made a point to be friends with his wife so there wouldn't be any misunderstanding. This could be awkward for you if she finds out you know things you're not supposed to know. On the other hand, she might know and be willing to talk to you especially if she knows you're sorry. That would probably ensure you never saw him again at any rate.|`|gOtoO3vUaa	Seeing him is normal. Just leave him to live his life. If you get involved things will get even messier. None is trying to send you messages to get back together!!!!!|`|O0cHWym9aa	Do you want me to say that he is following you?<br>  I think you did the right thing.

And, move on with your life and get a man you can truly call your own. The reality is your decision to break it off with this man is going to be tested and seeing him is that test. Don't feel stupid, we all allow our feelings to get in the way of what's best for us at times. Continue to love yourself and know that you deserve the best.

A girl giving out her number to a lot of guys isn't exactly a good sign. But hey, it's worth a shot. The good news is, she obviously likes the attention and therefore will probably not ignore you. I would say drop her a text. Just be like, "Hey we met at the track meet. You ran really well!" or something like that. Don't try to impress her. If anything, be a little aloof.

GOODLUCK!|`|SzV2kYKDaa	Talk to her go ahead. You wont know if it's love until you get to know her.

xsG3woDCaa	over time you will undoubtedly become annoyed by your spouses habits,after all they were supposed to change everything about themselves to make you happy when they slid that ring on your finger right.the time to accept them as they are has past but maybe you can look deep enough within to find out why his story bothers you.heard it too often,isn't entirely accurate,isn't what you thought it was.whatever the cause you have to find the answer.mildred sent me here to help you with this.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I do this too.  I think it's just par for the course - you live with the person 24/7, they are bound to annoy you in same way or form.  It's natural.|`|7LJ2Tx2Yaa	I do the same to my wife.  <br>  <br>  It is you if you are like me.  I know it is me, but that is how I always have been and she knew that going into marriage.  <br>  <br>  To change, it would be hard.  Just realize what you are doing while you do it.  Maybe you guilt yourself then.  Other than that, it is probably pretty hard to change your personality.|`|WvOvoxLxaa	All people get annoying at one time or another. If you are doing this to him, then I don't think you really respect him. You may love him, but you don't respect him.  You need to ask yourself how you would feel if he said these same things to you.  If you wouldn't like it then you need to stop yourself when you go to open your mouth. Think before you speak, not only with your man, but friends and people in general. You may not realize it but you could be like this to everyone, but only think you are with your husband.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	You need to give yourself a gut check.  He is a sweet guy and what you are doing is taking advantage of his sweetness. <br>  <br>  YOU ARE MISTAKING SWEETNESS FOR WEAKNESS.<br>  <br>  I am glad that you recognize that you are doing this. If you feel the need to do this, then you don't REALLY  love him. If you really do love him, the despair and lonliness of divorce that you have yet to experience should be enough to make you wake up to what you are doing. You alone will be the demise of your marriage. Flip the table, what if he did that to you? Would you stay?? What you are doing is abusive.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	When there is some underlying resentment toward him (whether you know it or not), even the sight of him will make you want to call him names.<br>  <br>  Talk to a psychologist to figure out what are those underlying resentments.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Husbands are revolting.  They also bore a person to tears, and tell gormless stories you've heard umpteen times before, <br>  <br>  In short, they bore you snotless and it would be easy to be really hard on them at these times.<br>  <br>  However you probably do the same.  Do as you would be done by.<br>  <br>  Also:  find out what you REALLY hate about him and see what you can do about it.  If you can't do anything, here's an interesting fact:  my husband doesn't piss me off half as much now the kids have left home.  He used to drive me mental.  Teh sound of him eating his breakfast.  The way he used to walk past me while I was, say, reading adn say 'what are you doing?'  I mean Duh.  Drove me barking, barking mad.  <br>  <br>  Now I'm more mellow.  I moaned about his toast crunching the other day; he said 'and you always sniff!'  (yuck!  I had no idea!)  Well, that probably was part of what made me mellow.  Ooh, sniffing, how disgusting, and he never said.  I don't mind the incredible chomping so much now.  <br>  <br>  When you hate them, you hate everything about them.  When you like them, these things don't bother you.  Work out what's really, really bugging you about hubby and ask yourself if it's something you can do anything about, or if you just have to live through it, it'll be over in 5 years or whatever.<br>  <br>  Oh: and my hubby's gone ona  diet, and he's healthy, and he looks a thousand times better than before - things change, how you feel changes, it's really quite remarkable, and often it's something like the kids leaving home, or moving house, or something totally irrelevant.<br>  <br>  all the best.

When my bestie comes i will know it and you wil to :]|`|ka2mIbXLaa	i do, but for awhile i didn't!<br>  You don't have to have a best friend!<br>  (:|`|N6quCSuJaa	Yea i do;)<br>  thank's for wastingg 5 point's!|`|wWGG8opZaa	i have a best friend but i dont think its right when ppl have many best friends|`|8L7C3YMWaa	yes|`|iqsxk9k4aa	yes i do and we get along well with each other|`|AA10716061	Not really, I used to but he turned out to be a total jerk towards the end of our friendship|`|el8yX5q3aa	Yep...I am 61 and Margie and I have been friends since we were 4 !!!!  Isn't that great?  I also have a friend Kathy which is also a best friend and that one is about 32 years old.  I also have another best friend...EVA..and we have been best friends for about 11 years.<br>  <br>  We all hang out together...it is great.<br>  <br>  I have many other friends...but none I trust as much as those three.  We have been through a lot together..and we really have fun.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.  YOu will develop one as the years go by.  Not everyone has one until they are in college or settled down.<br>  <br>  It is hard to have a best friend throughout your lifetime.   You both change and grow so much it takes a lot of work.  You also go different paths.  Like Margie and I.  I went into the Army and she went to college...we both got married but I went to Germany and California...so there were a few years there where we just wrote.  <br>  <br>  But the great things about best friends...you always come back together.  It is like someone knows your history...knows you....and it is like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes when things aren't good.<br>  <br>  Hubbies are good for many things...but sometimes you just need a woman around.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Don't put your email  addys up here for every weirdo on yahoo to jot down.|`|lS0iN9K7aa	eh im 15 lol but still if u want to be friends :b <br>  aguila.1032@hotmail.com|`|w51hObZyaa	I'll be your friend. I'll tell you more over email, but I'm in that age range.<br>  Email:<br>  cutepepper616@aol.com<br>  :D.|`|hGMYCn2maa	I can be you're friend|`|vSiD4dxMaa	im 12. i'll e-mail you. my e-mail is haileyzirkle@rocketmail.com
QNuzWDc1aa	The same thing happened to me.  I felt really left out and it seemed as if no one wanted to be my friend.  Like one time, this big groups of kids went over to my 'friends' house.  I wasn't invited.  I asked if next time they got together, I could come to.  My 'friend' said her mom wanted to keep the same people, which was a complete lie.  We got into a big e-mail fight and now we rarely talk, even though it's not like we talked much before.  I learned to just ignore her.  My older brother told me that if someone treats you like that, they're not worth having as a friend.|`|UJ1w74gdaa	I think their just being mean, not true friends, talk to them and explain how you feel, if they start acting more like friends again then that's perfect! but if their still leaving you out try talking to the nicest girl in your class or school, it's always great to make new friends|`|69jCkURdaa	ask them why they are acting like this, why there leaving you out of things. if they give you stupid answers or tell you they mean things, just let them be<br>  when i 15 the very same thing happened to me and my friends ditched me. i noticed that i didnt lose anything becuz by losing crappy friends your losing nothing at all<br>  try to make new friends or use your time to study or to shopp with your mom, or cousins or siblings<br>  dont worry many teenagers go through this<br>  <br>  usually friends in high school are never forever!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|f2fyXyulaa	Sounds like they have changed. You might have to accept that but, if you would like, talk to them about how you feel. That usually helps ally of people out. Try it. Hope this helps!|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	maybe you should branch out as well and meet new people, make new friends :) best of lluck|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	i have no clue why... sometimes friends just drift apart... like me and my friend kyairra we dont talk anymore at all and i used to be able to tell her everything and then for some reason we just stop talking to one another... but i think the best thing you can do is just talk to them... and see what is wrong... like this one girl heather... we  were friends since the 5th grade and then all of the sudden in 7th grade she was like i dont wanna be your friend anymore... and i never changed one bit.. but what it was... was that one of the gurls that i was "friends" with was jealous of me... so she told everyone bad things about me and so they all dumped me... and after that i was really depressed.. but i have one good friend i met in the 6th grade that kayla(the gurl that took my friends away) tried to turn on me but she didnt... and now in the 9th grade me and heather are friends again... even though me and kalya still hate each other... <br>  well i hope this advice helps you!!<br>  Elizabeth Bonario|`|A2Ne8sdFaa	why don't you find a new group? or instead of being invited why not invite them? ask them to go the movies with you this weekend.
aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	My daughter is - and believe it or not she's only fifteen minutes from home.  She's had a very tough first semester (University of Michigan).  Her room mate is borderline psycho (I'm not kidding).  And she's come home quite often.  I'm also in a mentoring program and I check in on four freshman.  Two of the four have been over to my house numerous times because they're homesick and lonely.  So... you are NOT alone.  And remember, every year about 20-30% of freshman either drop out or move on to other colleges.  That's perfectly normal.  Even after all the careful consideration that goes into picking a college - you sometimes don't know you're at the wrong one until you've been there awhile.  Either way - I'd recommend you give it some more time.  Get a part-time job on campus, join a club or volunteer somewhere.  If you keep busy, you'll make more friends and not have too much time to sit around feeling alone and miserable.   And if you've given it your best shot - NEVER feel guilty about transferring to another school. Good luck!!|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	I'm not in college yet, but I am SOOOO nervous about going because I don't do well in new situations and meeting new people.<br>  <br>  So College is probably not going to be as fun for me as everyone else.<br>  <br>  And no, you are not alone.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I went far away from home last year and I was pretty damn lonely.  There were times when it was ok, but for the most part I didn't really have people to hang out with.<br>  My roommates were kind of crappy.<br>  <br>  I transferred back up to OSU, near my family. I now have an apartment with a friend of mine and I see a lot of my other friends often enough.  However, when we are too busy for our schedules to meet up and I don't get to spend much time with anyone for a week or more at a time, it still feels a little lonely.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you need anyone to talk to, feel free to message or email me :)|`|uGIIR9Beaa	I am at times, yes. I find distractions outside of college help alot. Making friends early also helps, as long as they are sincere and not only popular (though some popular people can be sincere).|`|RoTLnFGZaa	stay strong & keep your head up<br>  You'll get through it.<br>  <br>  No, but thought my encouraging words might cheer you up.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	no|`|Dt3t6KwHaa	Absolutely, I'm a Freshman in college and it bites, of course it doesn't help to be going to a school that has a ratio of 2 girls to every 7 guys!<br>  what makes it worse is that I have never had a girlfriend, and I wouldn't know how to start, especially when I go to a college where they're the minority...<br>  <br>  so, yea, it's not only you|`|A7ovwP94aa	Hi There<br>  <br>  You sound so sad. Have you only just started college? Try and get involved in some of the social activities and you wil make friends and won't feel as lonely.|`|37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Not miserably lonely.<br>  <br>  I feel that maybe I don't need/deserve one. But there is still a glimmer of hope... ;)|`|AA11289793	Yeah I used to be, maybe you should try making different friends.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	agreed
AA10962298	Your'e out of luck, and your kids are, sadly enough, better off without you.|`|Nfw1Yy6Taa	thats so smart to give up your kids for a man you knew for three months! wow i wish i was that smart!|`|EdDLydH7aa	ARE U *** N SERIOUS?????<br>  You gave up the rights to your kids for a man? <br>  Make that make sense!!!!! <br>  You gave up your kids for a man WHY??? <br>  You got what you deserve!!!<br>  How are you going to explain that to them? <br>  You got played and now you have to pay<br>  You need to get your priorities together b/c men come and go but your children are <br>  YOUR CHILDREN, forever, no matter who you sign your rights over to...wow...you need help all right...a priority check|`|kEtKp0Dlaa	you shouldnt give up your kids for any man... I'm only 24 and have 2 kids and know that. If he was a decent man he wouldnt make you choose anyway.<br>  <br>  Just let him go. Get your kids back and move on.|`|hNbu8Jwjaa	your kids are more important than some guy who doesnt like you.... you shouldnt give up your kids. most likely they love you a lot more than he does|`|mbvCTR2uaa	ok...this may sound blunt: Lady, go back to your children!! They should be your first priority! You should never choose a man over your children...you will regret...it was your choice to have your children. It was your choice that you kept. They are your gems and you should respect that. Your children won't be children forever. Love them, cherish them, and protect them, because the man your with seems like he cares nothing about your children or you. You deserve so much more than that. And your children deserve their mother. It's too late to go back in time now...Take charge of who you are: a mother and an intelligent woman...again I'm sorry if that was too blunt...good luck!
bxfInqBPaa	Ha, you deserve it cause you valued his money the most.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	What goes around comes around.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	If this is true.... I am GLAD you gave up your kids, so they won't end up like you, you idiot. *shakes head*|`|N4A3pKStaa	Get over him. If he openly admits he wants to go out with some 18 year old girl, isn't interested in your kids, and he rejected your proposal then he probably isn't interested at all. He might be using you for fun but he doesn't sound too interested. I would just let it go. Its so much easier than wasting all your time and energy on trying to win him over. I'm sure he isn't worth your heartache.|`|hs793CCxaa	I guess he realized that anyone who would give up their kids, would give him up in a heartbeat, if something better came along.<br>  <br>  He sounds a smart guy!|`|JkvlAVX2aa	If I can see that you value his "RICH" more than anything else...including your own kids, then there is a good chance that he can sense that you value his "RICH" too MUCH.|`|AA11319441	Whatever.   I call bullshit.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Hunny your one messed up person! You expect some guy that you've only known for a couple months to marry you after you gave up your kids? Honestly now come on! If anything he was just using you! You need to stop focusing on guys and focus on your kids! Your a HORRIBLE MOTHER! How could you do that to your kids??|`|jBigEy0Caa	You gave up your kids?  Who the heck did you give them to?  I never knew giving up your kids was an option.  I hope you are on permanent birth control.|`|os36Q3P2aa	If your not a troll then(which you probably are )  we can safely say KARMA  has just booted you right in the face ..thats what you get and you deserve it ...BUT  i dont actually believe you........|`|HGRBtDIiaa	you both sound like awful people you deserve each other... maybe you should go after him. maybe if you tie a dollar to a string he'll follow it...|`|SovaFpN8aa	This has to be BAIT!|`|fYv0dtUFaa	ha yeah...right...thanks for the 2 pts|`|AA11180444	First of all, you put your man before your kids.  Secondly, you listed all of his attributes but the most important was that he is rich.  So, you are the one who chose a man who didn't agree with your priorities, like your children.  The most important thing about your boyfriend should have been that he love your kids, that you trust him, have great communication and that you love one another.  If your priorities were in order this wouldn't have happened.  Someone who loves you like they should would never do that to you.  He obviously does not love you, why do you want to be with someone who does not love you OR your kids?!?!?!?!?!?!|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Are you freaking kidding me!!!!  You gave up your kids for some man?  And look at you now..no kids and no man.  Let that be a lesson to you.  I can't believe how selfish you are.  Your kids would have been forever and this man..well look at him..just left you by yourself.  Serves you right.  He probably thought if she could just leave her kids for me...what kind of person is this?  I know I would have thought that.|`|bDCSxkJtaa	WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED THAT YOU GAVE UP YOUR KIDS FOR THIS MAN ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS RICH "MOST IMPORTANTLY" YOU STATE YOU HEARTLESS B*TCH YOU NEVER LOVED HIM JUST HIS MONEY  YOU DON'T WANT HIM BACK JUST HIS MONEY  GO HOME AND BE A MOTHER TO YOUR KIDS THIS GUY SEEN YOU FOR WHAT YOU REALLY ARE A GOLDIGGING  WH**E|`|UUrqECXIaa	Maybe he sensed that the most important thing to you was his money. I really don't like to be cruel but you are pathetic. How could you dump your kids for a man?!  It's heartless and cruel.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	why did you give up your kids to be with him? big mistake! anyway, all the best trying to get him back it sounds like he doesnt want to settle down|`|16HqzRcfaa	try not to be so pushy. maybe he's just looking for a good time and still not ready to settle down.|`|vdujJeFHaa	if he rejects u find someone else he may not be ready read mey question and youll see what happen 2 me
LYeAQKW8aa	muffins|`|5exiXAQbaa	Sex|`|QPTlQCiSaa	hmmm good question.

Also, I like when a guy focuses his attention on me because a lot of the guys with girlfriends at my middle school hang out with other girls and flirt with them a lot. They also sometimes admit that they like another girl, and I would feel so embarrassed if he did that in front of me!|`|C8TkypCNaa	Well, I dont really care on what he looks like, all I want is a guy that can make me laugh and is nice to me, and he makes me have a good time with him!  :)|`|0iHL3fLLaa	i like them funny\<br>  nice<br>  sweet<br>   careing<br>  flirty|`|uLHtXibRaa	I would not be looking for physical qualities they do not really matter that much.. but the fact that a man is able to show that he loves me and is loyal..|`|rRlD215Paa	The most important thing to me is communication.  I like knowing I can always talk to a guy, and he'll be there for me.|`|XtSNsOkbaa	umm, its not completely about looks. im a girl and i look for guys who are honest, will always love you no matter what you look like as long as they love the real you, and a guy that understands me without bieng a jerk. by jerk i mean laughing at the problems i share, making fun of ny best friends or me, and cheating on me. Hope this helped!|`|i4ARGkHQaa	aww u sound soo cute lol well all i want in a guy is <br>  - to be cute / hot [ does not matter]<br>  - some one i can trust with my problems<br>  -tall lol or just about my height<br>  -a good smile<br>  -a Gentleman[ like open a door 4 me something like that]<br>  -and some one to make me laugh <br>  - some one that has a romantic heart <br>  - smell nice<br>  - last some one that can make out lol|`|zROjHRa7aa	Well looks R important.

MwAyjkpHaa	just get on top of him and start to move slowly. once u feel comfortable you can move faster,bounce,slide,grind,and ect. GOOD LUCK|`|0Bx2knr2aa	i guess that means you will be nervous, so turn the lights off and close your eyes if you need too, that's #1.<br>  be slow till you know what you are doing. being on top for us is not to please them... it's to please us! take control and if it feels good to you then do whatever it is you are doing. make him lay there and tell him not to move. it will help you figure out what moves are easier and feel better for you to do. have fun|`|gLqX7TG0aa	you just get on top straddle him and stick it in|`|yah14b6gaa	let me guess you just starting to have sex. if he has more experience get on top of him and let him grab your hips let him guide you go with the flow it comes naturally. if not just watch some porn videos good luck
3lqjbusaaa	ha yeah i have a boyfriend just like this lol. he was a virgin and had never even kissed or anything. but then i taught him everything cause i wasn't a virgin when i met him. but all i did was say do you want me to give you a ******* and he said yes lol. and then one time we got drunk and started making out which then we wanted to have sex. then the next day we did. so you could just like slowly make your way down to his penis and then unbuckle his belt and if he says what are you doing then say well i was going to give you a bj, unless you don't want me to and then he will give you the answer you've been waiting for.|`|6AryCyTJaa	ok well the best advice i can say is talk to him(if its a serious relationship) or when making out try to hold your body against him.  Lead his hand or stop in the middle and say in a sexy voice " Let's take this a little further".  If he's really shy and new to the whole thing its best to let him do it on his own. But it never hurts to lead his hands or Ask him to do something almost like you begging,(not really begging, make him beleive you want his touch)|`|dQ2oVA1paa	Hha Im a dude and can totally help guys want you to let them know things alot of the time they are shy because they dont know what you want seriosly you would be the coolest chick ever if you told him exactly how you felt, what he can do, and as for the new to it thing also like make him feel comfortable doin stuff alot of dudes are slow because theyre embarassed. Sorry but i wouldnt resommend any under the radar kind of stuff guys can be stupid you know, does that help please reply and let me know.|`|mbvCTR2uaa	lol Um, sweetie, he doesn't HAVE to think or be like all the rest. You should most definitely let him be himself. He sounds like he's either inexperienced or he's just not that comfortable going that route with you yet. You've got to be patient and just talk it out with him..see where his head is....it's really that simple...if you try to force it or try to talk it out, that may push him away...hope that helps.|`|gJPlY1ADaa	well you could just grab his hand and guide it to where you want him to touch you. maybe you should start off the foreplay. for all you know he might be waiting for you to make the first move, he might be scared that you will get mad that he's moving to fast.|`|JgvbCbXOaa	how bout play the nervous game ..like put your hand on his leg and rub it and work your way up repeating the words are you nervous as you keep gettin close lol<br>  but s**t if he dont like the game man baby call me|`|jMW3P2QZaa	as you are making out you can just slide his hand up your shirt lol. that should get things going.

ibFTUi1taa	This girl has issues. I don't mean that in a bad way though. She just isn't sure what she wants.<br>  If you do somehow date her again, what are the chances she will stay? Best to move on and let her sort things out. I know it's hard, but you can't wait on this girl, you deserve better. =)|`|90hqtKNeaa	"I might date you again" means if things dont work out with this guy over here or if Im bored and have no one else to date..then I will go out with you again. How about going out with someone that wants to date you and only you? <br>   If you really like this girl like you say you do, then the only advice I can give you is to tell her how much you miss her and you would like to try things over again. But based upon the 10 times that she has gotten back with that other guy, chances are it will happen again. If she gets back with that other guy, you should move on and start dating others or take some time out for yourself.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	It seems like you're her fall back guy and that's not good! you want to the first choice!!!  If you're a straight up kinda person you've gotta tell her that you're there for her now, but you won't be forever and you need to know where her heart is|`|wQcFLCXRaa	give her compliments or something to flatter her<br>  just little things will make a girl like you|`|4KTG7N1Paa	find some one new, it's so not worth it, It might be just me but I think shes just dating for the social statues and breaking up for the excitement.|`|kZHb7u9Waa	tell her about how much of a man you are (not bragging) and tell her how you wouldn't dump her like her other bf..hope this helps..>>|`|U5LwIo1Jaa	umm i think she dosnt like u an she likes her bf more cuzz shes gone back with him so that means she kinda loves himm... iight pce|`|rEx5MSdQaa	easy:tell her<br>  how you feel and is she's all like **** you<br>  then call me <br>  and i'll beat her ***<br>  <br>  JK JK<br>  no you could just <br>  tell her that you really want her back|`|epnymTJKaa	Do everything that you can to show her that you really care about her.  Compliment her when she looks nice and show that you care about what she has to say.  After you put in the effort see what happens.  If she does not choose you, when it is apparent that she is having problems with the other guy, then find someone who is more deserving of your affection and that will treat you in the same way.  Good luck!  Little things go a long way!|`|2rUjafaYaa	hey guy, if they keep breaking up over and over again, don't you think something is wrong with at least one of them? she shouldn't be telling you she "might" date you while she's over there breaking up and hooking up with some guy. you should just find another lady and move on because it looks like she's just playing games, look at her current relationship!!! good luck (:|`|gJPlY1ADaa	I would say don't waste your time on her because she seems like she don't know what she wants....she clearly likes the other guy because she keeps getting back together with him....it does not seem like she is interested in another try with you it seems she just told you what you want to hear....she too hung up on the other guy so i say you should find someone else|`|FmfdZyqsaa	um the best thing would be NOT to DATE her again cause your just gonna end up with a broken heart.|`|kvcIdORcaa	tell her, otherwise just give it up. if she wanted you she would be waiting instead of going with the other guy. obviously there is something that attracts her to him more than you to keep going with him 10 times.|`|hOeLMmDgaa	ask her out duh!|`|AA12360723	just walk up to her and be like do you want to be with me or not wat's the deal?  do you think this guy can treat you better then i can treat you? if she say yes then be like okay and walk away. if she say no then say lets try us one more time!|`|Bi5i5cvTaa	if you always find yourself gazing and staring at her<br>  well DUH! u should just ask her out<br>  again<br>  and if worse comes to worse........ <br>  she will just break up with you again|`|Bv5dJQMFaa	tell her how you feel maybe she feels the same!|`|dxeOlRBfaa	u need to make urself look way better than he does
angW1Lkfaa	Whey are they smothering you? 17 you should be learning  about life. No wonder some kids don't have social skills because their parents don't. Hell my boy at 16 traveled in 22 countries alone and handles it quite well. he is now 19 in Reno U, second year on the Dean's list and I know he is able to handles relationships. Parents you need a damn good reason to stop your son from experiencing<br>  life. If you have issues then you better talk about them. My boys have no trouble talking to me and I know they make good choices.  <br>  Time to let him grow up and if you taught  him right then he shouldn't have any problem, because if you have a good relationship he'll feel ok talking to you. Yeah I could mind my own business but your doing your boy an injustice and not helping him expand is not the thing to do. .|`|S3UxNOhdaa	Just don't tell them. This is a good rule for the rest of your life. Keep your personal business to yourself. Don't even go there in depth with friends and family..that way you can save yourself if it doesn't work out OR if it does. Good luck.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	before your next you ask them for rules they like you to follow,this should be something you all have input in for your nearly an adult <br>  then stick to that and it should help<br>  As a parent i not allow my kids to date before 18 so your blessed lol|`|1HTRWrawaa	Oops! you are on the wrong site. This is the marriage and divorce site. You want to ask this question on the "family" site.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Call it like you see it.  go speak to your parents.  "Am I allowed a girlfriend?"  Get a straight answer to a straight question.<br>  <br>  Once you have managed to get things clear, you'll know what to do.  It's likely that in the attempt at finding out what you can do, what's going on with the olds, it actually evolves.  People want to be fair, they just don't always knwo when they're not being fair.  Your parents have concerns they may need dealt with: that they haven't found a way to raise yet, so this sideways stuff like grounding you is their way of dealing with their fear, like teen pregnancy, and they should have just had a proper talk.<br>  <br>  When things go wrong, someone has to be a man: it may as well be you, it'll get this sorted sooner.|`|xsG3woDCaa	perhaps it's a two way street,maybe your parents are reacting to signals you are unknowingly sending out,coming home later.not accepting directions about household rules.short clipped answers to questions,we have all been through the parent stage and each experience is different,just muddle through it and you'll be ok.mildred sent me to help you with this.|`|QgTDhl23aa	they just want you to focus on your school work and they think having a girlfriend sidetracks you. which i'm sure it does. so if you keep up your grades and still spend time with your guy friends once in a while may they'll lay off a little. good luck|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	first, stop cussing. thats not good. also, ask them if they have a reason.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	They just think they know whats right for you but they never will know. just find a girl that will put up with it. or know how that is.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Your parents love U and want the best for U, even if U don't think so. Since I don't know the details, I can't say if they are being overly protective of U or not. Maybe they should get to know the girls first. But until U are 18 or paying all your own bills U R stuck with their rules.<br>  Sucking up to parents can work, it just depends on the parents. 17 is a very difficult age to be, so U have my sympathies. However as a parent of teens myself I know how worried I get about some of the kids my own hang out with. I try to be open minded, but it is hard to watch some of the relationships that evolve in my kids lives.<br>  U might try asking your parental units (when they are in a good mood) just what it is that they disliked about your former gal pals. They might surprise U and have sound reasons. Otherwise be patient, your time will come for freedom. I just hope U R ready for it. Maybe your parents are worried about becoming grandparents too soon. It happens all the time, and they may just be guarding against the odds. <br>  If U have understanding girlfriends they really should not have a problem with the rules set by your parents. Surely U can email and talk on the phone to your friends?|`|mBXu5G5saa	Well this is your parents house, not yours, you just live there.. and you have to respect their rules, i'm sure you are probably still in high school since they are grounding you as a method of punishment, they probably just want you to first finish school and do good it in, some kids do not realize how important a high school education is, until the day of their graduation when they see that all the honor students get awards and scholarships and they are at the top of the list and you can't barely find your name, then you realize why am i like way at the bottom of this list of like 700 people.. they just want you to take your life seriously because these girls.. even though you like them and they like you.. i can guarantee you that it is not meant to be and it will not last..how many people do you know that are married and have kids with girls or guys that they knew in high school..this is RARE, it is just a form of temptation and you have to be smart enough to surpass that! When you get older and wise enough then you will realize what your parents are doing/saying, trust me when an older person tells you something listen to them especially your parents because the minute you do not, you end up making the most ridiculous mistakes and then you're like "Man i should have listen to my mom or dad or whoever!" because i can tell you now i have gone through this and i am older than you so i know! just listen to your parents.. and keep this in mind what would you rather: a girl that you like but she is not guaranteed to be there forever or your family who is supporting you, by giving you food and shelter, when you have your own place, you can have girlfriends and be happy but right now just stay focused on school and i'm sure that is the message that your parents are trying to send to you..good luck and i hope you take this advice!

AA10670217	nothing helps more than finding out what your partner likes... you can be as experienced as the best of them, but it wont matter if u cant find what they like... and if all else fails and you're in a good relationship, just ask<br>  <br>  as for the basics, make sure you're in a comfortable position because you dont know how long you're gonna have to hold yourself there.  also, if you're getting spit everywhere, its not going to be that enjoyable for either person, so try to keep your lips tighter.  its usually best to keep your eyes shut so you dont give the impression you're bored.  also, never be too forceful, and just keep calm and relaxed.  keep in mind noone's great to start out with, and it takes most people time and practice, but dont worry about that....  just have a good time.|`|AA11864007	I think you might need to be a tad more specific with your question.|`|AA10148336	I know a good website for you lil youngster go to ask alice and get all the info about birds and bees and making out you need.|`|AA12228671	What do you want to know??

I'm trying to think where you can go for some assistance. I think welfare is only for people who aren't working which is ridiculous because with 2 jobs and a 2-year-old, you've got my sympathy completely.

We girls just need love and thats why we are willing do to these for the guy we love, and even when our guys cheat on us we hope they will change and continue to stay with them....we should really learn to respect ourselves and dump any guys that don't deserve us !

What you need to do is keep the relationship at a frienship level until you decide whether it will be a sexual thing or a potential long term. Then communicate your view on the whole thing.<br>  A woman has no right to be angry with a man if he's told her the truth from the get go and she knowingly accepted.<br>  Lookat it like this, just an example. If she wants to go away for a weekend and you've already got plans with your little people let her know that weekend is off but on so&so you'll be free and you can both go to yada yada. That way her disappointment will be less and she'll have something to look forward to.<br>  But if you just say no then thats being thoughtless.<br>  Then if she gets mad then maybe you should reconsider.<br>  Your children are important, but so is your woman. Take nothing for granted. She could be with someone else and she chose you.

If she can't take a hint, then she's psycho.<br>  So, to sum it up, I think your point of view is right on.|`|AA11184738	I think you have been meeting the wrong kind of women. What kind of signals are you putting out? Please don't say those things to a woman you meet, unless you want her to walk away. This may be how you feel but its rude to say these things, cause it makes it seem like you are making assumptions about her and you don't even know her yet.|`|bb61f38059f40992a14ae589c20280c1aa	get over yourself!!!!!|`|AA12335126	I don't think you are wrong in the slightest!!!

7d015b1b3abb382597a5f4218cfd9bd3aa	Para empezar creo que el solo echo de no haberse despedido de ti, eso te dice lo mucho que le importas. Mira no importa cuanto tiempo estubieron juntos lo que importa es la calidad de la relacion en el momento que el tomo la decision de irse. Haber porque no te dijo que te fueras con el? seria porque no estaba seguro de lo que siente por ti. Mi consego es que no lo busques. Buca otras amistades y diviertete con sanidad y cuando menos lo esperes el regresara y tu no vas a sentir ni odio por el, estaras super tranquila. Tu vales mucho solo es cuestion de que te des cuenta, cuando tu te valores los demas te valoraran y repetaran.

AA11370541	@#@#$@#$<br>  <br>  He is a yahoo answers member.<br>    Rare Indigo<br>  Participating since July 04, 2006<br>  He answered this question.<br>  <br>  For all IT Management people, have you ever been in a situation like this one?<br>  <br>  I've been into IT for the last 16 years, since programmer to CTO ( My actual position ). For all that time I'd bosses who either were IT people or were CEOs from an IT company, so all my bosses knew something about IT and I could work on IT projects with them knowing what I was doing.<br>  <br>  Now, I've been for the last 2 months in a company that is a nonprofit organization, my boss who is the COO has no knowledge regarding IT.<br>  <br>  Recently I had a long conversation with him ( He made the request to do it ), and told me he saw no good things about my work since I got into the company. I told him that I was searching for OLAP tools for the company ( Since there is no tool to do mining into the DB ), also that I was working with our TIC providers for the new site and deciding which shall be best for 3 developments we have, basically I'm doing my job.<br>  <br>  Have you been into a similar situation? If so, what did you do in order for your non IT boss to understand what are you doing?<br>  (6 days ago - 4 answers ) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He was given the best answer by the ASKER.<br>  <br>  Rare Indigo response was:<br>  <br>    Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  <br>  Yes, but not as the CTO. My situation was an IT project where I was the project manager and the sponsor was a techno peasant. The main thing I did to keep him in the loop (and out of my kitchen) without patronizing him was to clearly define the deliverables in lay terms then provide him regular progress updates. I have some IT related experience but I'm not an IT guru. I think this helped because I know that most managers and executives figure you are feeding them a line of bull when you start spouting off the acronyms. They figure you don't expect them to ask for clarification because they don't want to appear dumb but they also figure you know this so you are trying to pull the wool over their eyes. Mine didn't need to understand the minouche of every aspect of my work but he did need to know that we were at least making progress. In fact he has an obligation to do so. It sounds to me like your COO needs to be kept up to date a bit more without running to him at every decision. If he turns out to be a micro manager you should shop for another job. There's a lot out there right now.<br>  0<br>  0<br>   <br>  <br>  Asker's Rating:<br>  Thank you for your answer, tomorrow I'll be talking with my boss following your example.|`|AA11610394	ZNo sure dont.|`|a387b47faffe09fc15bd3c586d9a661eaa	Well, see.

This guy is obviously really liking her or he jsut wants sex. she  may be slightly attractive to him but still like i said easy sex and some boys are immature and like that.

ca04fb4375fb954bbfca701c7977cda7aa	I don't think it's obsession as such, but I do think you have a trust problem. (and possibly an inferiority issue - like I am not good enough for him etc.?)  I think you should speak to your b/f about it, before he gets sick of you always asking him where he was, with who, when?  I think he is a very patient guy to put up with your questions for 9 years!  You are a lucky girl!  You obviously adore this guy, which is a good thing as that kinda love is rare.  Just give him alittle more space Hon, so you don't end up chasing him away.|`|2c6369550e66045ab4061814c2e3e4d1aa	Sounds like true love to me, congrats<br>  <br>  Peace|`|512cf444493deeb31b71eea4a4346172aa	I think your having a docter Phil moment  been so long with this person you feel you have rights or own them like a toy or car, can drive a person nuts ...Seek help   ...I once felt like this after 9 years  turned out was right she was sleeping around ..Then I got help ,I'm single now.. just like that Billy Joel song its a matter of trust ..|`|84d1a9011fcb363c82ef2915ad0b172caa	i dont think its psb for obsessions to last longer than a year|`|34f423f5b2438432e51e6307d5137534aa	just ask him for the truth and c what he has to say|`|63050197a23c08a20730b3a4fc330100aa	Why are you so insecure he must have given you a reason to act like this? has he done it in the past?<br>  If he hasnt you need to calm down...<br>  you've been together for 9 years why would he do anyhting with anyone else??<br>  He's not been with you through 9 years of habit has he?!<br>  I think you really do acre and love him you just over worry about him you need to be careful no one likes bunny boiler?!<br>  It can put men off if your too pushy etc..<br>  Doesnt he deserve your trust?<br>  Look at it from his view point what if you were in his position and after 9 years he felt the way you are feeling for him now?<br>  Wouldnt that put you off after a while?<br>  Wouldnt it make u angry that u dont have his trust?<br>  Its not an obssesion your not weird this is how girls are we all do it go through it and do it all over again we're girls this is what we do best!!|`|d6dbfaf41b58cf05794ea2facec6ff16aa	It all depends why you feel that way, try to look into this feeling ask yourself, why am I suspicous of him? What makes me feel this way? Go right down to the root. If it is a case of you finding it hard to trust people (maybe because someone cheated on you once) try talking to a good friend about it, or family member.<br>  <br>  On the other hand: <br>  There is no smoke without fire, so if it is a gut feeling that you think he is up to something, look into it. It might be true.|`|f0db1990827614587210b0874cf3458daa	WOW, sounds like true love to me ur one hell of a lucky person!!!!!!!!!!! I hope it lasted a lifetime!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ask any girl who is uckable by your standards. Take her out somewhere cheap until you get to know her. If you see any signs of trouble move on as quickly as possible. The more you ask out and the less money you spend on them the better off you are. At some point, like winning the lottery, you will find the one. The one that likes you for you, or at least tolerates you very well. Good luck.|`|0168c0b3ff9508d761c7dbb747ac712aaa	Just get a bottle of jergens and a towel and date that for a while.

Also, when they turn away from you when they see you are staring at them. My friend who has a brother, who is shy and also very hot**, agreed with her on a sign of interest guys do but in a discreet way, she read in Cosmo.,  -shy guys in general will do this, they'll turn their torso towards the female of their interest but not their face, so it's a sign of the guy liking the chick, but only in a very discreet way. Say you're to the guys left, but he's talking to someone directly in front of him, he'll simply move his hips towards you-which would be  his left side, although still facing directly to his front-becase that is where he is caring the conversation.|`|67852d4a80e4d0e4f89855732bdc6e1caa	if he seems to avoid you on purpose and when confronted has a a hard time talking to you|`|AA12330405	if u know he is shy..........well then ask him.|`|f7b9ca01a4ab9a4cda35fe9c47f6a40aaa	Being an ex-shy guy myself I can tell you that it might not be so easy to tell if he likes you.  But, if you make it absolutely clear that you like him (and I mean absolutely, c'mon girls), then it will make it much easier to get together.<br>  <br>  Shy guys have a tendency to avoid having to make the first move.  If you make the first move it will ease his mind and will make him much more comfortable.

577c65badc4c3c922a9ed289ba83e4a6aa	Maybe it's misinterpretation instead of delusion.  Sometimes people give off mixed signals, and you shouldn't beat yourself up over it.  Sure it's a let-down to find someone has no feelings for you, but that happens a lot to people and you've just got to learn to get over it and move on and try again.  Don't hold your heart on your sleeve and instead wait a long time before you fall for someone so you can be sure of what or how they are feeling.  And, conversation and lots of it is what brings out the information you need to hear.  Replacing one person with another is the answer, so get busy dating others.|`|3120b2694153e774a6f992fd8b8b3a33aa	i know it takes time to get over it /heal<br>  but just dont rush to things something just happen 4 a reason <br>  good luck! =0|`|AA10143423	Avoid him, and move on.

And just imagine tying to start a relationship, while she's going through a break up at the same time...doesn't sound like much fun to me...Start thinking with the brain that's on top of your shoulders, instead:)|`|473a8737b27df1a8b706823ed912d275aa	She is off limits.|`|6b2295282db45f71615c496c217996efaa	Your friend's kid???? that is a NO,NO, HELL NO! even if she is in her 20's.

30eeb513e22e020ff200a9c432b12019aa	I do almost all the time, no matter what I'm wearing or where I'm going.  I don't like the confining feeling of underwear and enjoy the freedom of not wearing any as much as possible.  Whether I'm wearing jeans, a dress or short skirt doesn't make any difference.  If guys want to peek and like what they see, good for them; if not, they shouldn't be looking up my skirt or down my shirt.<br>  <br>  Either way, it doesn't bother me that they're looking...I can't see why that would be such a big deal for anyone.|`|0168c0b3ff9508d761c7dbb747ac712aaa	you can't go commando, you'll get poo marks all over your pants, then people will see them and point and laugh at you.|`|323d739999411fb993756c13dd5bfdefaa	lol going commando is not such a bad thing.... and no i dont do it personally. but i dnt think there is anything wrong .... especially if you wearing jeans or something.... when going to a nightclub opposite way some guys find it a turn on if u tell em that u aint wearin nothin underneath,
7NiLwiEjaa	Ok well the letters pretty good... actually, its really good, but dont ask her to hang out with you in it.  Just make it an apology and not a way to get her back.  If she accepts it, then she will get back to you.  If you say you want to hang out, she'll know thatll be an awkward situation next time she sees you.  If you dont bring that up, she knows you'll understand if she doesnt get back to you.  <br>  <br>  If that makes sense...<br>  <br>  But for her birthday, id say forget about it.  If you send the letter today, it should get there by mid next week and she'll have time to invite you over or whatever.  If she does, then you can worry about a present.  If she doesnt, just assume that as much as you want to be with her or hang with her, she doesnt want the same.  If you showed up at the party, she would just get pissed.<br>  <br>  But reallyy dont worry about it.  Im 17 too and ive been through stuff thats real similar.  It sucks hardcore but you'll find that if you look for them, theres other girls that are as good or better.  Three weeks ago i lost someone i thought was nearly perfect, and yesterday i met someone that seems even better... you just have to try to meet new people and forget about things that you cant control (her feelings)

If he'd wanted YOU, he would've asked YOU out and not his GIRLFRIEND.  yea, thats right, HIS girlfriend.  He wants HER.  Not YOU.  Once you get a boyfriend, you'll think back to when you asked this and you'll imagine some other bi.tch in your place.

zDnP7Jjyaa	Don't let him go.  Tell him how you feel and he will either go for it or say no.  You don't know how the relationship with his girlfriend is.  Maybe it is really bad and he needs assurance that there are better options out there.  A guy I worked with turned me on every time I saw him.  We stared at each other alot and some innocent flirting.  His relationship at the time was not so great.  I met him for coffee and poured my feelings for him all over the table.  He was shocked and told me he is in a relationship.  I felt good that he knew how I felt.  I was prepared for rejection.  A month later, he dumped her *** and we've been going strong for 4 years and have a 21 mo old baby.  So you see, you don't know until you try.

Cuando es amor piensas en esa persona todo el dia, te gusta su compa?ia y sobretodo buscas la cercania fisica, incluso un roce de mano o un beso en la mejilla te da diferentes sensaciones. Es cuestion de llegar a tener mayor cercania con la persona. En cambio cuando se trata de una amistad por mucho cari?o que le tengas no t imaginas ir por la calle tomado de la ma?o con ella, ni besandola, xq es algo q no nace. Muchas veces uno suele confundir una linda amistad con el amor, y en muchos casos es solo uno de los 2 quien se enamora, pero no es correspondido. Antes de actuar hay q saber reconocer si la otra persona siente lo mismo. Al menos uno de los dos debe dar el 1er paso, pero eso si se conciente que a veces al dar ese paso la amistad se termina. Es muy dificil y  mi me ha pasado, y duele no ser correspondido por el amigo que quieres, y ves que se aleja xq el no siente lo mismo x ti.

7NiLwiEjaa	Its not a bad thing that people say youre cute instead of hot.<br>  <br>  Lots of guys wont call girls hot to their faces because some girls find it offensive or just dont like hearing it.  From my experiance, they'd rather be called pretty or beautiful so thats what i say they are.  I never tell a girl shes hot to her face.  Thats something guys say about girls to their friends. <br>  <br>  But the difference between a hot girl and a cute girl is huge.  A hot girl guys pretty much can imagine themselves sleeping with a couple times and moving on.  A cute girl, guys imagine dating.  Guys will pretty much take either a hot girl or a cute girl because no matter what the images of them are, they are still thinking about the person.<br>  <br>  So basically what im trying to say is dont worry about it.  If guys say youre beautiful, its probably true and the guys like that about you.|`|W3HQwrgBaa	Cute I take home to meet mom, hot I take to bed!|`|Ia5RcFXNaa	cute because they are very nice and not full of themselves. they are so nice to look at.

Pero despues con ayuda de DIOS me di cuenta de que debia valorarme como mujer y sobre todo como persona, mas tarde conoci al AMOR DE MI VIDA, me case con el y tengo un hermoso hijito. No fue fácil pero si no cuesta no lo valoramos. Espero te sirva para algo mi experiencia. Besitos.

Sounds like there's no issue with her relationship of eight years, and basically she only told you that she likes you the way you are, which is pretty platonicly casual sounding if you ask me.  But you really don't like her the way she is, do you?  She has a degenerative disease, and you said you don' t like that.  Sounds like you really DON'T like her "the way she is."  Leave her alone.  Leave her with the boyfriend who obviously isn't concerned with her ending up in a wheelchair.  Then get a dog.

Moi même je suis en couple avec un homme qui a 12ans de plus que moi et cela ne nous a jamais empêché de nous aimer.

0c8b7c4465c6e3db52761bdfd8e52451aa	Well, there are two possibilities. If you like him back, then great! Friends make great potential boyfriends. There are some risks involved though. You don't want to lose his friendship, so take that into consideration. If you don't like him back, then tell him that you don't want to risk the friendship and so you need time to see if you want things to go further. Give it time. You could always start to like him after a while. Please don't try to stop yourself if you start liking him. After you tell him you want to give it time, don't keep talking about it. Just act natural around him, the way you normally do and let the friendship grow. Get to know him even more. You never know what will happen. I wish you all the best. Good luck!
7NiLwiEjaa	Its possible that babies will be made in test tubes.  Actually it has kind of happened already.  Scientists are able to put the sperm and egg in a vial and fuse them.  They then put the egg into a women where it will develop.<br>  <br>  I would assume at some point they could put the egg in a machine and it would develop there.  I really couldn't say how far down the line this is or if it is even being considered.  I'm sure it can still be done though.<br>  <br>  As far as people doing this for all their babies, not likely.  People have sex for fun and some do it to make a family and have fun.  Humans, like dogs, monkeys and all other mammals are developed to where our bodies fit our environment.  It would go against nature to start asexually reproducing.  Not only that, but to get pregnant and have a baby would be relatively cheap compared to having your kid grow up in a test tube.|`|AA12267746	Yeah...that's not normal...and I hope it doesn't become that way.

AA11347425	cheap and uncreative... Just Kidding!!!<br>  <br>  Flower meanings have been used to convey ideas, feelings and messages for centuries. The word, floriography, has been coined for the assignment of meaning to flowers. There is a meaning to colors of flowers, to numbers of flowers, and to groups of flowers. It is a silent language that has been largely lost to us through lack of use.<br>  <br>  In addition to the obvious choices of color and variety, the language of flowers also includes the way flowers are worn or presented. Presenting flowers upright conveys a positive meaning, but if they are presented upside down the meaning is the opposite. If a ribbon is included with the flowers and is tied to the left then the meaning of the flowers refers to the giver, but if the ribbon is tied to the right then the meaning refers to the recipient. Also, flowers can be used to answer questions. When they are presented with the right hand the answer is “yes,” but when presented with the left hand the answer is “no.”<br>  <br>  The Romans believed the rose was sacred to Venus, the goddess of Love.  Cupid, her messenger spilled nectar into the earth and it sprung up in the form of the rose.  The Greek myth attributes the rose to Chloris, the goddess of flowers.  She fashioned the rose from the body of a lifeless wood nymph, and other gods bestowed upon it it's fragrance and beauty.  The rose became the Queen of Flowers and it remains today the most popular and beloved of flowers, the most recognized as a symbol of love.<br>  <br>  Almond Blossom – Indiscretion<br>  Amaryllis – Pride; Splendid beauty<br>  Anemone – Forsaken; anticipation<br>  Apple Blossom - good fortune<br>  Aster – Variety, also Afterthought<br>  Azalea – Temperance<br>  Baby's Breath - Pure of heart<br>  Bachelor's Buttons - Blessedness; hope<br>  Begonia – Dark Thoughts<br>  Bluebell – Constancy<br>  Buttercup – Childishness (remember holding it under your chin as a kid?); riches<br>  Cabbage Rose - Ambassador of love<br>  Calla Lily – Magnificent Beauty<br>  Camellia – Loveliness; good fortune<br>  Canterbury Bell – Constancy<br>  Carnation – Alas, my poor heart! <br>      Striped - Refusal<br>      White - Remember me<br>  Chamomile - Energy in adversity; strength<br>  Chicory - Frugality<br>  Chrysanthemum – Cheerfulness in Adversity<br>  White - truth<br>  Clematis – Artifice<br>  Columbine – Folly<br>  Cornflower – Delicacy<br>  Crocus – Cheerfulness, Youthfulness; joy<br>  Daffodil – Unrequited Love, also in High Regard<br>  Dahlia – Dignity; Instability<br>  Daisy – Innocence; faith, cheer and simplicity<br>      Wild Daisy - I will hope<br>  Dandelion – Oracle; departure<br>  Dogwood - Pleasure and pain<br>  Evening Primrose - Inconstancy<br>  Fern - fascination<br>  Forget-Me-Not – True Love; forget me not<br>  Foxglove – Insincerity<br>  Fuchsia – Taste (good taste)<br>  Gardenia - Refinement; Joy<br>  Geranium – Friendship; <br>      scented Geranium - Preference<br>      scarlet - comforting; kindness<br>  Gladiolus – Strength of Character; Generosity<br>  Gloxinia – A Proud Spirit<br>  Goldenrod - Precaution<br>  Hawthorn - Hope<br>  Heather – Solitude<br>  Heliotrope - Devotion, Faithfulness<br>  Henbane - Imperfection<br>  Hibiscus - delicate beauty<br>  Holly – Foresight<br>  Hollyhock – Fruitfulness<br>  Honeysuckle - Sweet disposition<br>  Hyacinth – Play; I'm sorry<br>  Iris – a message<br>  Ivy – Marriage<br>  Jasmine (white) - Amiability; grace, elegance<br>  Jonquil – Return of Affection<br>  Laurel - Glory<br>  Lavender - Mistrust; distrust<br>  Lilac – Enchantment<br>      White Lilac - Youthful innocence<br>  Lily (white) – Purity<br>  Lily of the Valley – Return of Happiness<br>  Magnolia – Magnificence, also Dignity<br>  Marigold – Grief, Despair; sacred affection<br>  Morning Glory – Affection<br>  Mugwort - Tranquility, Happiness<br>  Myrtle - Everlasting Love, Fidelity<br>  Narcissus – Egotism<br>  Nasturtium – Patriotism<br>  Night-blooming Cereus (pronounced Serious) - Transient beauty<br>  Orange Blossoms - fertility and marriage (very popular today at weddings)<br>  Orchid – Beauty; mature charm <br>  Pansy – Remembrance, also Thoughts (from the French word, pansée meaning thought)<br>  Passion Flower - Religious faith<br>  Peony – Shame, Bashfulness<br>  Periwinkle – Sincere Friendship, Happy Memories<br>  Petunia – Don't Despair<br>  Phlox - Unanimity<br>  Pimpernel - Assignation, change<br>  Poppy – Oblivion<br>  Primrose – Youth<br>  Purple Lilac – First Love <br>  Rose – Red – Love<br>      White – purity; I am worthy<br>      White and red together - unity<br>      White Tea Rose - Girlhood<br>      Pink - Please believe me<br>      Crimson - Mourning<br>      Yellow – Jealousy, Infidelity<br>  Rosebuds – young, innocent love<br>  Snapdragon – No<br>  Snowdrop – Consolation<br>  Sunflower – Adoration, also False Riches<br>  Sweet Alyssum - Worth beyond beauty<br>  Sweet Pea – Lasting Pleasure<br>  Sweet William – Gallantry; dexterity<br>  Thistle – Retaliation<br>  Tiger Lily – For Once May Pride Befriend Me<br>  Tulip (all colors but usually red ones) Declaration of Love; perfect lover<br>      Yellow Tulip - hopeless love<br>  Violet – Modesty; faithfulness<br>  Water Lily – Eloquence; purity of heart<br>  Willow – Mourning<br>  Wisteria – I Cling to Thee; Welcome<br>  Zinnia – Absent Friends; remembrance, affection|`|AA11040219	love lol|`|3b79f49b0ba5db95356ea6c9d23f596caa	the sender is very interested in you ...... traditionally a dozen red means love.|`|93bbb6626481d0ca00a887df4cf85c74aa	That someone deeply cares for you and want to show you it by roses!All saying that you're beautiful and romantic!|`|AymEbHl7aa	To me it means, $59.99 plus shipping and handling.  Anyway, here's the answer below:<br>  <br>  One Dozen Roses Guide<br>  Primary Significance: Thinking of you 12 months a year<br>  <br>  <br>  When it comes to conveying a special meaning with roses, there is more than just the color to consider. The number of roses also plays an important role in the message, and the number most commonly associated with roses is one dozen. The traditional connotation of one dozen roses is love and appreciation, and when we think of a bouquet of roses, it is most often comprised of one dozen stems. This is a custom that has arisen from the significance of the number twelve within many aspects of nature, religion, and philosophy. <br>  During the Victorian Era, the practice of flower giving took on an added dimension with the advent of the Language of Flowers. This elaborate conception associated a different meaning to all manner of flowers, including roses. Many of the meanings we attribute to different colors and numbers of roses survive from this period. One of the most significant is the use of one dozen red roses as a declaration of love. One dozen roses have also become a representation of perfection and completeness. These associations can be largely attributed to the symbolism of the number twelve itself. <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  The number twelve is often used to represent a complete cycle, such as the 12 months in the year, the 12 hours on the clock or the 12 signs of the zodiac. In fact, cultures around the world from ancient to modern times have developed calendars based on cycles of twelve. The number appears throughout mythological and religious traditions as well. The recurrence of the number twelve across the natural and spiritual world has given it a sacred and mystical quality which is universal. These aspects all play into the significance of one dozen roses. <br>  Rose bouquets come in a variety of colors and are used to convey many different meanings for all types of occasions. However, there is often a common thread. It has become customary for rose bouquets to consist of one dozen roses. They can be used to represent perfect beauty or to express our complete love and gratitude. One dozen red roses have become the definitive symbol for true love. Whatever the occasion may be, when the quantity of roses is one dozen it adds a wealth of magnitude to the underlying message. This is why sending a bouquet of one dozen roses continues to be such a popular way to communicate our most heart-felt sentiments.|`|fvYCJqV1aa	well it means that they are red and there are 12 of them.|`|FdPmSFIiaa	Unoriginal!

I'd tread cautiously and protectively, believing none of what I hear and only a little of what I (MIGHT) see, but above all...... respect yourself enough to protect your self-worth and emotional state of mind (since she's demonstrated no respect/concern for yours).   Express your grief she has caused and future concern(s),for the salvation of a long-term friendship.    I'd make certain she understands that a true friend never deserts without an explanation. <br>   I would also set the rule: No respect, no friendship..... and sever the ties, permanently!   <br>  Now...........if I were walking in your shoes, I could forgive her, but, I'd also refuse a close bond/relationship with her, because, history usually repeats itself!<br>  Be You & Be Happy!|`|88df1079ce8b34b13ac32bbc8ca76b2eaa	I think that you should try asking her why she dissed you.

If you want to feel strong and confident please befriend this girl, when you are older you will prob feel guilty for not having helped stop her lonliness, Be a leader, you already have agood heart to have noticed, be true to your heart it will bring you happiness.  Imagine how you would feel if you were her, what would you want someone to do?|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Remove yourself from this negative bullying set of friends and go look for people who are nice, reasonable, and know how to treat a human being. The worst thing you can do is stay caught up in this kind of web of destructive behaviour these girls are into. <br>  It is better to have one good friend you can turn to and rely on than it is to have 10 friends who are mean and vicious to each other and turn on each  other over every little thing.<br>  Now go look around at the shy quiet girls. Im betting they would love to have a nice friend. Shy quiet kids usually are more in tune to who they really are and have compassion for others not meaness. Good luck sweety.
qhqTzwQAaa	When a guy really cares about you, he doesn't give you a reason to doubt his feelings for you. He'll be happy to see you, he'll try to make you laugh (even if his jokes are pretty lame), he'll comfort you when you're insecure about something, he'll stand up for you if somebody messes with you, and he'll be there for you when you need him the most.<br>  <br>  You can't tell if a guy is going to be faithful to you just by looking at him, but through his actions. He'll focus most of his attention on you and even though he might occasionally notice other girls, they won't even compare to you in his mind and he'll tell you so. He'll tell you you're pretty when you feel ugly; he'll tell you that you're a good person,when you've just said or done the worst possible thing you could do; and most importantly, he'll do anything to get your heart.|`|15a6149d844a3fb1c2541fbbd41e7873aa	In my opinion, it will show via his actions.  is he spending a whole lot of time with you?  is he doing lil things that you like..stuff he may not really care about but he did it to make u smile?  its stuff like this that should let you know that he really cares...|`|QlG7Sh4saa	if you satisfy him he'll do anything you say|`|8NsDzpV9aa	after you say that you love him as well. see if he carries on buying you presents, pampering you etc|`|3a79343129c9018836b74138009c31c5aa	Im not sure .. it depends on the guy but I can tell you this .. you'll know when he don't|`|132ef824bf5655c0a7e3840b375da961aa	He'll take is time and talk of how much he cares not just say he cares.

4ab49b667ab5c824be9acaba19e1027caa	Think of a breakup this way: you're one step closer to the one you're meant to be with." There are few things in life that are harder on a person than the time when they realize that the love they have worked so hard at, and spent so much time on, is finally over. For some, this realization is a complete shock and for others, they have seen the writing on the wall for some time now.There isn't a sure-fire way to mend a broken heart but there are definitely things you can to do to make it feel a bit lighter and ready for new love. First, allow yourself to feel what you need to and take all the time in the world to get over the person. For some people it may only take a few weeks to move on and others years. However long it takes, be okay with that. You can't live your life in the past, waiting for a second chance to do things differently. Doing so is only taking you away from experiencing things that could be better. Don't be scared to give love another try.So, you've found out that Mr. or Miss Right isn't the soul mate you've always dreamed about. Now what? The period of loss and pain doesn't have to extend on to an eternity of what ifs. After spending a few days wallowing in self-pity, you'll probably want to start making a few steps towards life after love. To help ease this transition, try a few of the following ideas.Letting loose on your emotions is a quick and self-healing way to recover from incidents of loss and pain. This is especially true of keeping a journal. Make a commitment to write for at least a few minutes every day.Keep your mind busy with new information. Whether you decide to learn a new word or how to do something new on your computer, it will help you keep moving forward instead of looking back.Get yourself out and about with a 20 to 30 minute walk. Just the constant, repetitive motion of moving your legs one after another is enough to help you put things in perspective.Just because you are not attached to someone doesn't mean you can't enjoy going out. Think of it as a chance to go to all the places you've always wanted to go.Maybe there is something you've always wanted to learn how to do. Now is the perfect opportunity to develop it! Try anything from bicycling, joining a walking club, sewing, bodyboarding or surfing, learning how to watercolor, or cooking.Best Wishes|`|715160da727e023377e8c00bc303d1d1aa	Probably the last thing you want to hear right now, but the only way to heal a broken heart is the same way to heal any other wound, time. <br>  Love is terrible in that sense.

AA10136027	i happen to be on the same situation right now, she's my best friend but I couldn't stand all her whinings! I tried to be patience and understanding but sometimes, she's pushing the limit.  i guess if you cant compromise and she's even making a bad impression out of you, i guess its better to let go of the friendship. Nobody deserves a friend like yours, and she can't even be called as a friend.|`|0235641a3fee892ed4f4e06575ff1cacaa	Seems to me you are hanging out with a lot of easily impressionable people that can't make their own individual judgement.  If you feel like that about her, she is definitely not a friend of yours.  I think you should be brave and upfront with her, tell her how you feel about her and that you wish not to be her friend anymore.  Then let her runt and pant all she wants, because there is nothing you can do about it and she is going to do it anyway, so why worry.  Then, take your time to develop a better relationship with other friends and when she tries to sabotage any of those friends, they will know who to believe.  Let her be the one going around in circles acting inmature.  Keep your cool and you will see that all will work out better for you in the end.|`|070262c3e47764de1fbad4a702594671aa	What would be a good solution is to just ignore her. What she's doing is trying to make herself look better by making you look bad!Just move on with your life!|`|64b372c414493ea0dc72bd862db8c676aa	A flight of stairs is your best bet. unless, of course, it's like 3 steps. then what you need to do is a good old fashion massacre.<br>  REV UP THAT CHAIN SAW! WOO!!|`|14e6d6dead2269ebd2a749e7bb493335aa	If it was in my case, I will throw it in her face and be frank in a nice way. Since she is so immature in her way of actions, you don't have to worry about losing her. 'Cos you really don't need someone like that in your life.|`|AA10154848	She really doesn't sound like a friend.|`|af0a3b6e1aa5fce4dea187f3fc46b6eeaa	tell her up front and straight what you just wrote and dont let her interupt you will definatly be screwed|`|b503e4b37e0f13f92d5f8cba5a625d74aa	just completely ignore her and make a new friend in her place,trust me,it works|`|d15f9ac89dbb83ee218993c2b1bdbc46aa	You need a new friend. Leave that one alone. Let her go on somewhere else. She isn't a friend if she is like that and you are better off without her.|`|a387b47faffe09fc15bd3c586d9a661eaa	Just ignore her.

cb0771bb7f50981245acdef3fc1d1134aa	Depends.  Your friends might tease you and you wont be able to handle it.  THINK!!!!!  Who cares what ethnicity the other person is.  Its about how they make you feel and vice versa.  Love is not skin deep.|`|477268d4c40a7eadac6b07c3cec8fe5eaa	Guys are guys. All are homosapien. If you breed with him you will produce the same species. So the real question is; Do care what other people will think of you if you go out with an Asian guy whom you like and remembered something you said a while ago?|`|070acd6453e880fd563a2a3c744a2757aa	sure go ahead, go out with him, lm sure you guys will have fun along the ho chi man trail,|`|4abcaf0d8ef2888225723c70d75b58a0aa	well,first of all you need to know that there's nothing physically or mentally wrong about asian guys.there are just from another continent.not from another world.we are all the same aren't we? i don't know why are you still being racist? perhaps your not. maybe you have never thought of being with an asian guy. off course, its nice for someone to remember what we have said-when we least expected it.and girl, dont dump your bf for this asian guy.why should you? your in a relationship with another guy.made friends with the asian guy and see how things goes. dont rush!!!|`|AA12199027	go with the asian<br>  i am sure he can make you happier|`|a2ccd8bef95fb5887de73dee210c7b89aa	You're concerned with dating an Asian, but not concerned with being a cheater? Wow... that's backwards.|`|1957443f6b9ae6b54ebe23bd2136fbe9aa	If you like the boy go for it. and if he is sweet to and very polite. Is the boyfriend is he sweeter than the other boy. I seen alot different nationality and they all have good looking and some are ok. but Asian is just the name of their nationality. It has nothing to do with his good looks or his personality. If you like him better than your boyfriend then do it and don't worry what other might think. There is to many people out there that like to judge the cover by is book. Don't be one of them. Everybody is made in God imagine. We are all the same in God eye.|`|4a4116fb587e459aaf1872141787a680aa	try it cause people will think your pregidus|`|5cb40658c93ec25bda227225061ea265aa	Don't take this advice from me...I'm only 11 yers old, but I think that u should at least try one date with the guy... and if it goes well...then dump the old bf but if it goes the other way around...just forget that u even went out with that asian guy and still keep the bf that u have now...GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  P.S. E-mail me if u try my idea! <br>  Millionlilacs@yahoo.com|`|6d1870f894f72ec6f051c732bfea88ebaa	I think you should stay with the guy your with. obviously the Asian guy deserves better than you. Your relationship will go no where because you are a closed minded person.|`|8ac81f7cd531c70bef926845d1f49c35aa	i know many ppl have probably said this, follow your heart and listen to "Listen to your heart" by D.H.T.  It doesn't matter what he looks like, its how YOU feel|`|a387b47faffe09fc15bd3c586d9a661eaa	Wow, not sure if that's ignorance or racism. Either way, date the asian if you like him.|`|c2cb45736c5eded6aac648301090309eaa	date the person|`|d112f65f2aff3da1e9ee19b6d724f1d1aa	don't be so discriminating of skin colours. The fact is that you already have ab/f and so your not free.  You said your not comfortable with the fact that he is asian, you have some issues to work through considering that we are all the same inside, dont matter that some are red, white, black, brown, yellow.   I think that you have abit of growing up to do anyway as your letting "feeling" dictate to you on a level that is really just lustful"|`|8012488b8476437d337adafb1508b9ccaa	Does the asian guy breathe the same air as you, does he bleed, does he feel pain, love and anger???  Why does it have to matter what race he is?  Grow up|`|a763cd15d7971bb3999c686bce36d423aa	first of all i really dont see anything wrong dating another race but thats just me cause im hispanic.... but any way if u think u like this guy maybe that means u dont really like ur present boyfriend as much as u think. Nut is really up to u if u want to date this asian guy and break everything with ur BF. cause u would not want to regret it later in the future u know what i mean. so.. i would just take some time and just think what excatly it is that i feel for ur bf and the other guy. it could just be a mixed feeling.. I guess all i can say is follow ur heart.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|bade31ad19092c2f666c9892175ab65baa	it shouldnt matter about race. if youlike him for the person he is then go out with him|`|dd9f5378e07af0e9f5b3d1107cf3137aaa	race shouldnt be an issue. who cares if hes asian and youre white. the only thing that matters is how you guys feel about each other. if you think that dating the asian guy will be better than the relationship you have with your current bf then give him a shot!!|`|e1db36ea51b020b7737e464d223f9aedaa	follow your heart... it shouldnt matter what the color of there race is nor what they look like.What ever makes you happy|`|e8bbf006ddc6ab92debc95bef199b360aa	Well i myself love asians soo yeah. Do whats right if you have a better feeling with him go for it or stay with your boy friend. ok you chose which one will make you happy?
AA11182664	do you wanna  go see a movie<br>  do you want to go to drink a cup of coffee<br>  do you want to go out with me|`|b003e08ad62881a95508ff6b4ad568c2aa	Wear what you always wear and be yourself...|`|0b94cec8b0db85465a34dd7396e3c071aa	ask sexly|`|83ae44526fb9c967d8ea5aa4d591d4a2aa	I'd say ask him on a group date like the movies this weekend, maybe Marie Antoinette. As for clothes, just wear what you normally would. We wouldn't want him to accept for the wrong reason!
a6a5597198c3182c2484a33c578c917baa	id say he is just trying to get some, but thats just me talking|`|24f0e7f6ff311da490811d358cf2f8e9aa	yeah something bad might have happened to him and he may have needed the comfort.|`|4ec2b0f2c6d27448024b5bf29145386aaa	That was fine. He just probably needed a hug or something. Believe or not men like hugs and kisses too, without being anything sexual.|`|ce1686b3b2bfe79675ff927d92a8737aaa	yeah|`|d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	depends on what u want.|`|da171496a33b39dc78267dd9ffb500deaa	No.  Especially he already asked your friend and then turned around and asked you.|`|bebe648d460c3d45c5d87447b041722baa	If you really like this guy then yes it was the right thing to do. <br>  If your friend doesn't like him then that is a good thing for you b/c you wouldn't want both of you to like him b/c that would drive a friend relationship into the ground.<br>  This guy must like you and if your friend doesn't like him then you should take him! <br>  Grl if you don't then I will!<br>  (Good luck!)|`|e2eb3a9b1fab4dde44b462af4606e16aaa	What? I'm old no guys asked such a question like that when I was young, what is that suppose to mean? If he asked your friend first and she said no then why would say yes and become second choice? You are first choice or no choice.|`|e5dc981ce9dc90c4118af2cc2e4e8d26aa	Well it depends on if ur friend liked the guy! Plus...Its heart breaking when your friend does something even as little as that with the guy you like...so be careful, it hurts to much.

If she is your best friend she will listen.|`|af05e79a32105d192831efe2e95bc13daa	try asking her if she could be with you when you want her there.  if she says no for some reason, remind her you are always there for her for soccer.  if she continues in the manner she has behaving in, do some of the things you would like to do on your own.  just a suggestion:  you might slowy remove yourself from your cousin's activities so it won't upset her.|`|430a2a7f068c9e8d9b4f112a66e86676aa	Maybe just sitting down with her and telling her that she is your best friend, and favorite cousin in all but that you feel a little like your not hers.  When she asks why, be gentle in explaining that you want her to be there for you sometimes, and just how much it would mean to you if she did.  If that doesnt work then maybe its time to find a new best friend.  Even though you go to the same school, there are all kinds of things you can use as excuses to avoid her without hurting her feelings.  At some point she'll start to realize that she maynot be comfortable with your friendship too.  I strongly recommend the talking thing.  Friends are a very important feature to healthy mental growth.  Try inviting her to something of yours and express how much you need her as much as she needs you.

You can live in freedom outside. Or you can be a prisoner on the inside. Your decision. But things have gotten way out of control between the two of you. So forget about hitting her, both of you should never lay a hand on one another. The boundary is crossed and right now there is so much animosity between you two that space apart is the only answer. This way you can get your head together and your life. If you both want to work on things, do it with a professional but apart for the time being. Things are getting to dangerous. And you don't want to spend the holidays in prison. So leave for awhile till things can be worked out civilly.|`|eedbe78294f2c3a234d3d7ce3e3abbbeaa	It is OK to call the police! However I highly recommend that you don't due to your prior arrest. It's obvious your walking on a thin line in the courts eyes. 237.5 PC is a 50,000 fine in CA. That is an expensive lesson to be learned not to mention your subjecting to prison time too! My best advise if church or other counseling is not helping! The truth be told! You must end your relation I know that hurts! However your hurting her, the kids and you in the long run, When will it end? It ends when you can face the truth no more physical violence on both parts that comes from ending your relationship..<br>  Good luck<br>  Bail Agent,|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I think that they two of you just need to be away from each other.

You shouldn’t be hitting her and she shouldn’t be hitting you, I think that you both need to go to anger classes and think of some other ways of getting rid of this range, before either of you go too far|`|AA11284720	Why don't you just leave so you won't go to jail and get a good lawyer!!|`|AA10143423	Yes it's okay to call the police.

It always gets worse, never better, though the abused believes they can avoid abuse by working harder and by avoiding irritating the abuser.  Alcohol and/or drugs are offten used, the abuse would take place even  if alcohol or drugs were not used. Alcohol/drug use indicates a low self esteem, but not always cause of abuse.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	mental problems!!!!!|`|039f4b2b6caf76397fc763695e105437aa	Most abuse doesn't start out as physical violence. It usually starts out as mental or emotional abuse. Such as "Your so fat. You should go on a diet." They constantly are degrading and putting you down. At first, you don't really notice because they'll phrase it as concern. "Honey, Your looking a little Chubby. I'm worried about your health. You should loose some weight". They will separate you from your friends and family. Usually, saying that they want to spend lots of time with you and other such things until you spend next to no time with your friends and family. The Physical violence won't start as a punch or even a slap. It may be as simple as a vicious pinch or a shove. This will go on and you won't really notice because he may say that he was just "playing" or got "too rough". The first time couple of times that they hit you they will be immediately apologetic and concerned. They may get you flowers or jewelry and you will be treated like a Queen for a couple of days or even weeks. Then he'll do it again and again. He'll become more violent each time until you are beaten unconscious or nearly die. At this point if you haven't left or sought help then he will kill you. This can take years or even months. I'm sorry about constantly referring to the abusers as male, because men can be abused as well and are less likely to admit it. I hope this helps in some way. I know I've been there.|`|2c6369550e66045ab4061814c2e3e4d1aa	I second that heheheh<br>  <br>  Peace|`|59829793c75351e9021f675896045399aa	Verbally first, sometimes the victim suffers from low self esteem to start with.

Be honest with him what have you got to lose he will not be rude to you if you are already good friends.

Naturally you or she will be reminded of something else, like a previous game or something and talk about it. After a few minutes, before the conversation is winding down, act like you have to go and say "Oh, hey can i have your number and call you later?" perfect excuse to get a number. Then you can talk whenever you feel like calling and asking her how she's doing. A friendship will develop first of course. If she says no, don't persist, and if you don't feel comfortable asking, just say see you-- later, in class whatever, and ask her when you do feel comfortable. Good luck!|`|AA10515893	Be confident.

ZuzSUymFaa	Hey, I have been in your shoes. The only thing is that I come from a large family. My father died on my birthday in Oct 2004, then my brother died 2 months later, and then my mother died 6 months after that in June 2005. It was horrible.  I understand the pain.  First thing you need to do is to spend as much time as you possibly can with your mother and the other family member who is dying.  Do all you can to make the time you have left meaningful so that when your mother does die, you will have no regrets to come back at you later. If you are a church-going person, then you could check with local churches to see if they have grief support groups. When my family members died, I had one sister who had a very difficult time dealing with this.  She contacted her insurance plan's counseling program and got into grief counseling.  That helped her tremendously. Please don't take this as insensitive, but since your father is no longer living, and your mother is dying, if you are able to ask her where any important papers are kept, such as wills, trusts, burial plans, and any other legal documents, this is very important. Nobody likes to talk about these things at a time like this.  Still, when my mother died, we were all in such a state of shock (there were 5 of us kids left), but we had to sell our parents' house and deal with their legal and financial affairs. Because we couldn't find my mother's last updated will, we had to use an old one. The old one made my sister the executrix.  She did not wish to be, but she took on the task.  It was a nightmare. My mother was very organized, despite us not being able to find her most recent will. As organized as she was, it took months to get all the paperwork and stuff in order, and it was very stressful to all involved. This is why a simple question of where important papers are kept can save you added stress when you are already grieving.<br>  <br>  That said, I want to express my sincere and heartfelt concern for the pain you are going through and for the impending deaths of your family members.  It is so hard to go through this. My heart goes out to you. I lost both my parents and my brother all within an 8-month period, so I know how it feels to lose several family members so quickly.

There is obviously something going on in her life at the moment that she felt that she had to run away from it.  Please, in the first instance, get this teenager some psychological assistance.  They may be able to work out why she needs to run away from home, and even more importantly why she needed to jump from a fourth story window.  Secondly, if she is paralysed, be extremely supportive of her in her recovery and the rest of her life.  She is definitely going to need it!|`|c7efd949a65039ac822d65e4a896e026aa	Well she obviously didnt want to stay then!
cd4bb38e33dc977673bdf578309c329daa	I'm really amazed at how many questions are asked on this site about nonverbal communicating.  <br>  <br>  Non-verbal communication doesn't work.  Unless your partner is Uri Geller out there bending spoons somewhere in the ether, you are going to have to verbalize what you want, what you need, and what you are feeling with your partner.  It's the healthiest, most mature, and only effective way to communicate.  If you have been with your partner for years, in close contact on a day-to-day basis, I would say you have some basis to rely on *some* forms of non-verbal communication, like a certain look, certain body language and movements, etc., but if we are talking not a long-term relationship, or someone you just like and want to get to know, nonverbal won't cut it. Sorry.|`|1c2c2cc0d77454de2a9f188da0d866b8aa	u do it anyways, its the best way to get info, or u ask there bestfriend which would lead u to them knowing u asked, which will give the same effect in the end.

Relationships shouldn't be tricky either a person wants to be with you or not, you shouldn't have to compromise on that issue. So i say just be truthful with each other. A good tip is to write down the pros and cons of your relationship and if the bad out weights the good then it might just be time to let it go.|`|c37940d0f82de77cf9f87cfbff836c9baa	I would just leave her alone and see what else is out there.

Would she smother you with hugs in front of the other guys? <br>  <br>  Chances are she's a tease and enjoys playing with your emotions to stroke her ego. <br>  <br>  I once new an attractive girl who would flirt with guys to point where they would dump their girlfriends. Then she would dump them. It was purely for her ego. I think she was very insecure or very vain.|`|ceb793a5a2ca74c997b0852f0f33cc1daa	Just go for the kiss, if she doesn't want to she'll turn her head away... standard operating procedure. But I would definetly not expect too much out of it. Even if she makes out with you, it doesn't mean that she's all that into you. It sounds like you're a teenager, at that age girls are just exploring their new-found power over boys. So have fun, but always keep an emotional distance. No matter how positive everything seems, always expect everything to go wrong. That way if it stays positive you'll be pleasantly surprised and will appreciate it and if it doesn't, you'll be ready for it and won't be caught off guard.<br>  <br>  I know that sounds pessimistic but it really works.<br>  <br>  ..oh and one more thing:   never ever act jealous!

Ask her on a date and see what happens. Ask her out for coffee or whatever isn't too committed or cost big bucks and just talk to her.

Either you have a hormonal imbalance or you are emotionally assexual.<br>  <br>  You may want to see a doctor to see if you have hormonal imbalance.  Specifically, women need some testosterone in order to be sexual, and there are actually testosterone treatments for women for the purpose of heightening sexual interest and response.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you may be assexual.  There is nothing really wrong with it, except you will have problems in relationships with sexual guys.  You probably need to either seek out someone who like yourself is not so interested, or you need to settle with living on your own.  There are many people in this category, and not everyone needs to pair up in a sexual frenzy.

I was in your position once- I liked a guy and he always would stare or smile at me, and I thought he liked me too. Then one day, I asked him out and he said he already had a girlfriend. That pig! So the point is that some men are pigs and would flirt with you/stare at you even when they have a girlfriend. Yet, there are some guys who would stare or smile at you b/c they are misleading or playing with you. He may do that to all pretty girls or because he's just trying to be nice. many just want to flirt but don't want a relationship. Last, he may be staring at you b/c there's something wrong with ya (i.e. you have a smudge on your face). So be careful if you decide to approach this guy and make sure that he doesn't break your heart and don't be upset if he doesn't like you like that.|`|0168c0b3ff9508d761c7dbb747ac712aaa	go up and punch him in the stomach when he's not expecting it then run away.<br>  <br>  that will make an impression.|`|5b3f2399620bfedde3d6937e17da04f4aa	tell him how you feel. write a letter and sign it...and see his reactions.|`|de5471b16fb735b65e39ff69dc787c09aa	If he is looking at you alot then it means he really likes you too and he is shy!<br>  Look at him back, smile, get closer to him.

Tell me this, do you feel confident in yourself. Not REALLY confident. Just confident. Like, you have a body that doesn't look ugly. You don't have a bad personality (being shy doesn't mean you have a bad personality, but he might take it to his advantage if he's the wrong kind of guy, I actually prefer girls that don't argue back and forth on a small situation). Do you think he cares anything else about girls? For example, maybe he likes girls that play sports and are into a lot of events. Once you make sure you are at least okay for the guy, then see if other boys look at you. If they do, that means you DO look pretty good or have a good personality etc., andI think that guy likes you.<br>  Everything fine? Uh-oh. How do you tell him? Lol.<br>  <br>  You: Hi, uhm, do you like me?<br>  Guy: ...yeah...how did you know?<br>  You: Well...that's good.<br>  <br>  That's a good way to TELL him, but then what?

Well, congrats to you, first of all, for keeping your eye on your goals.<br>  <br>  As far as finding women goes, it's been my experience that you're not very likely to find a woman that you want to take home to meet your parents in a bar. Bars are not conducive to women worth meeting. There are exceptions, yes, but you're right: that IS extreme.<br>  <br>  Outside of asking your friend Kelly out yourself (which you never mentioned whether or not that was an option), the next best thing would be to strike up a conversation at places that you frequent, like restaurants.<br>  <br>  Also, don't discount the online dating thing. Sites like eharmony.com and Match.com specialize in people like you who are a bit shy. They're anonymous, and the best part is that you can actually get to know someone (and they can get to know you) without you having to divulge too much personal information.<br>  <br>  It's all in how you want to pursue it. There's someone out there for everyone. Good luck to you.|`|c395fed41ca02908c152000994e4d0f8aa	First of all the bar is not a good place to meet girls, those kind of girls just want to screw you and than kick you to the curb.

If you haven't learned that penis size is probably the least important thing about sex by now, I truly feel sorry for you! Since the average penis size is between 5 and 7 inches (erect after puberty) I don't know why you would be comparing penises to the much smaller vienna sausages either.|`|20469c7b4819bfdb8b92a184b3df7689aa	GO GIRL!!!|`|jGce5pv9aa	It depends on the person.
AA11718451	1.  Stop expecting or hoping for the romantic moments.<br>  2.  Know that romance is for movies, commercials, and players.<br>  <br>  My male friends feel "fake" and the more their girlfriends forced them, it caused so much conflict.  Romance can be costly & time consuming and hard-working men don't have much of both.  <br>  <br>  Don't make yourself look like a "taker" in your relationship.  <br>  <br>  If you want to make a romantic dinner or something, then go right ahead but please expect nothing in return from him.<br>  <br>  My husband and i used to get into arguements early on in the relationship because i really wanted him to be romanitc and he couldn't, not even a little.  But he kept me company when he was tired, he stayed with me while  shopping and do little things he would never ever do for other people.  <br>  <br>  He compiled all the songs i like together throughout the years, built me a souped up computers that i can surf on, listen to music, write documents, and do my art all at the same time without slowing down.  <br>  <br>  He has installed a fan on my side of the bed oh a hot day while i was at work because i was complaining the room was too hot for me to sleep sometimetimes.  He always washes the car, pay the bills, and takes me out where i want to go on the day offs we have together.<br>  <br>  He has a heart of gold, is sincere, respects me and is a good father to our children.  <br>  <br>  He doesn't know how to write a poem but can help me with power point and excel, take great pictures of our kids, hlep me get organized and take us on yearly vacations.<br>  <br>  Stop pressuring him.  If he's the right one, you'll see and feel it.|`|6a48621693ddb95b8d80086a7af66a5caa	Just be glad he's not gay.|`|0168c0b3ff9508d761c7dbb747ac712aaa	Convince him to have a sex change operation and let him get outfitted with a vagina.

I know many women also search for things that don't exist. If you're looking for the romantic you see in movies or read in books, it's not really going to happen.<br>  How long does a movie last? How long does a show last? How long does a book last? Not as long as real life; therefore, relationships are much shorter and so they never show the part where the woman gets bored with the romance...|`|3d76a673e34594b387c1386787567662aa	all guys get older and you can not teach a guy new tricks either they are or they arent mine is good to me but he is not a romantic by any means sorry for the bad news but you go trying to change him and he will run faster then the others.....trust me|`|8GiaSROmaa	you are dreaming... you want romance read a book...most men are not romantic....thats just movies if they are romantic they are gay, if you want romance come to bed with you b-day suit all guys are romantic at first but once they hit it honeymoons over baby  sorry... just being honest|`|9e11b5422ce6c6410ed0b1f2734dce4aaa	explain to him what you want, if not, look for another one more romantic .|`|AA12307970	there are plenty of romantic guys out there, they just need to know that it is ok to be a sissy.

AA10294825	In general, guys are direct where as women are more ambiguous in the way they think ask questions and recieve answers. What does this mean, if you are unsure, just ask him. I think he will appreciate it that you came right out to ask so there is no guessing. Just let him know you are being honest about it.

So keep talking and be yourself & laugh together like you've been doin.<br>  <br>  If you feel like he wants to say things but is too shy. For example asking you to a dance, you can lead him into it by asking leading questions.

bd31fda524ce298ab76d8641e4a524d3aa	There's not much you can do except tell him how you feel--but don't do it in an accusatory way. Just say that these are some of the things you've noticed and it's been bothering you. If he hears you out and is receptive, great. If not, I'd say start by keeping things separate. Buy your own food and let him buy his, find someone else to bum rides off of or take the bus, keep any bills you have separate if possible. It sucks to have to do that, but it does avoid a lot of fights. Things with the girl will probably run their course and he might come back down to earth then. But in the meantime, just try to talk it out or keep to yourself.|`|2f68340938260121d10ebac3317ff1abaa	I think you need to pick your battles here.  Yes, it sucks that he used to be super-roomy and now he's just your typical selfish college d*ck, but you can't set out to change everything about him.  You'll drive yourself crazy, and you'll fail.<br>  <br>  I think the issues you have with him not pitching in for food and helping with the cleaning anymore are completely valid, and you should put your foot down on those.  Tell him that if he expects to eat, he should expect to contribute to the food budget, and that you also expect him to pull his weight as far as keeping the room clean, and that if he doesn't, you'll be forced to look for a new rooming situation.  Mean it, and stick to it if he doesn't follow through.<br>  <br>  As far as getting yourself to work and such, though, that's really your own lookout.  It would be nice if you could count on his help, but he's shown you that you can't, and so you should react accordingly and rely on yourself alone.|`|b114f89cfabb6ea2b0ceb70bc7d94b33aa	Find a new roomy.|`|b711a6de98d72c008142bb0b1769f953aa	walk up to him and put your hand on his cork-n-balls and say "we can't keep raw dogging it until you change."|`|1JjxYpeUaa	Its really hard when you have to live with someone who doesn't get you point of view.

73c6084fbad1e11c3464ca98280bfa78aa	I have a great one...when my mother passed away, we took easels and poster boards and tacked all sorts of pictures of my mother to them at her wake.  From her early years on.  The goofy pictures, the loving pictures, the family pictures, etc.  It was like no matter what we were going through at the time with losing her...we had those memories that would last a lifetime.  It helped eased the pain and made us laugh a little to ease the tension at the same time while we remembered those pictures.<br>  <br>  The other thing we did was...and this was hard, but I'm glad that we did it.  Each one of us children got up and talked about our fondest memories of our mother.  My mother was the fun loving type who was always late for everything.  I even made the joke about having the hearse drive her around the block a few times to make us all wait...because it's what she would have done.  It's not for everyone, but death, as I've come to learn, can be a really welcoming thing for some...especially if they've been suffering and it's taken away their character.  You don't want the loved ones walking away remembering that person's life as a tragedy....in a memorial, one is suppose to remember how that person lived....not how they died.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss...focus on the happy times you cherish and you'll make it through.  And remember, we all get reuinted one day!|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	None.|`|3DC4YadNaa	You can try this site  <a href="http://www.memorialserviceplanning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.memorialserviceplanning.com/</a>    or   <a href="http://www.seniormag.com/links/memorial-gifts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seniormag.com/links/memorial-...</a>

If so, it seems you've been dishonest and didn't like the result.  Becoming honest takes a long time but I would start with being honest in all things.  Even when it comes to little things always tell the truth.  Honesty can sometimes be painful to other people so you have to be careful about opening up too much.  Being honest does not mean to "spill your guts" about everything you are thinking and have done.  This is not helpful usually.  Simply be honest in the day to day dealings you have with people.  The past is the past and is best left unspoken.  When you wake up tomorrow decide that today you will be truthful and fair in all your activities.  <br>  <br>  The person you are worried about has already been hurt so being "honest" now, while good for you, will probably not affect the other person.  But, give them time (a lot of time) as these things do not happen overnight.|`|d1ab996d7dc68b5beea067904f20255faa	be honest with yourself|`|iSZugkvIaa	just tell nothing but the truth<br>  if you start to lie or have lied confess and apologize

816a9e83923269460e4ac561ef37f332aa	of course i'll keep you in my prayers :]<br>  my bf broke up with me too just a month ago.  we were together for 4 years off and on.  what a painful relationship.  look at it this way - now you're free to do whatever you want.  theres a whole world out there, full of many people.  people that you would have missed out on if you were still in the relationship!  it's beautiful really.  to get over him just do that - get over him.  allow yourself to stop worrying over him or worrying about yourself.  replace every sad thought with a happy one.  go shopping, hang out with your girl friends, or rebuild old friendships/start new ones.  deep down inside people don't want to forget their ex but you just have to let yourself.  if you forget him/get over him quickly that doesn't mean you never loved him, it just means you've allowed yourself to forget because it's the only way you can move on.  so just relax (yoga is good), and stay positive.<br>  <br>  more than anything i wanted to stay friends with him but Don't do that.  i will never grow as a person if i try to remain friends with my ex.  and it doesn't sound like you will grow as a person either.  it gets better.  when you finally let go.  i was scared at first but now i honestly feel better than i have for awhile.  live for you. love yourself and you'll find love again.<br>  take care.  :]|`|8w0786yeaa	I have a list that I use myself to help me get over someone.<br>  <br>  1.  Stop all communication.  The more you talk the longer it takes to get over them.<br>  2.  Keep a journal.  Write your thoughts down.  It helps...really.<br>  3.  Write a letter to him with all your feelings and burn it.  NEVER send it to him.<br>  4.  Get rid of anything intimate.  Goodwill always needs things.<br>  5.  Be very active.  Exercise, hang with friends, etc.<br>  6.  Don't get drunk.  It makes the feelings worse.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Even using these, it still takes time.

I gotcha covered. But I'm hoping you listen to what I'm saying. I want you to look at love in it's rightful way. You have to have it in your Heart. And it has to come from his Heart. Love isn't in your Body, or his Bank Account. Once the Heart has given up? So is the Love. If The heart doesn't have Love? It's over. Listen to your Heart. it's the only way you'll be forever Happy. Forever in Love. And he won't leave, if his Heart is in Love with you. Best to ya!|`|nuqV5KYMaa	no guy is worth ending your life! what do u like to do for fun? have an all girls night with some of your closest friends, don't talk about guys, do girly stuff. it might sound childish, but trust me, it will make u feel better. try to go out with friends, avoid loneliness, it'll make u think of him more. is there anything u couldnt do while u were with him? well, go out and do it! feel free, not depressed. breakups are bad, but with time, you'll get over it. hope u feel better! :)
246097442295eccccc0235f16f32d704aa	Well i have found that a broke heart sometimes can never mend but on the asspect time does heal all. We all have trials and tribulations that is we have to go through but the love of our friends and family will help mend our hurts and sometimes the hurt of the heart can be healed from another that makes it go away...

I tend to break anything in my hands at the moment i remember that feeling. But since you're a girl (i dont have anything against girls), you might want to remember all the pain he/she had caused you and really just punch some pillows. Whenever i am angry or heart broken, i throw my fist against a tree bark until my hand is either numb or bleeding. <br>  <br>  And for the next thing which i totally recommend. When your parents aren't home, just go outside and SCREAM at the top of your lungs until your neighbor comes out and tell you to shut up. (which sometimes i flip them off or really SCREAM curses at them.)<br>  <br>  But really, heart broken takes a long time to heal. And time is not what a human have. Just do what i just told you and just move on.<br>  <br>  ^^^^^^-------if you didn't like any of what i just said, you can just push this one away and look at the next one.....|`|AA11095376	Hello sorry i don't know whats happend  but you try to talk some one  who really care you  share view's    than you  forget  it  i hope if you like you     join me  cu soon <br>  <br>  <br>  bye|`|BTBXw0ujaa	im sorry that you feel so bad.

Your feelings for him will eventually go away if you stop thinking about him.|`|EU5whvZwaa	hi broken hearted, I feel your pain. I to have had my heart put into a blender, and the pain never really heals, not fully. You can only hope that you can find a way through each day and it will get better. When it comes to love though some stuff stays with us forever. sometimes we move on realizing that it was'nt meant to be and we can get over this person. Whatever you do dont do anything that you will regret later like getting addicted to drugs or killing your-self. Learn from your expeirience, it will make you stronger some people do drastic things not that you would, just dont. sleep with some else (carefully) do a lot of sleeping or working, something, anything to get you through the days until you can bare the pain and move on and do it all over again. I'll leave you with this note In life and relationships if your lucky you have 1 that will work out. think about it all realationships fail, so be carefull and have self respect.
AA11387869	Sometime in your life you meet someone else who makes you get goosebumps on your skin, and butterflies in your stomach.  You adore this person's company, and hate it when he or she has to leave you.  Your first thought in the morning, and your last thought at night, is of this person.  <br>  <br>  Ideally, your interests and goals resemble the interests and goals of the other person's.  You feel the same way about religion (or no religion), and you feel the same way about wanting (or not wanting) children.  You both share enthusiasm for a common cause.  You both have the same ideas of what life should be like, and very similar moral and ethical standards.

AA11722178	I'd have to say it definitely sounds like this guy likes you. Congrats, girl! But, don't jump to conclusions, he may just act that way around girls. I have a friend who seems to flirt with every girl he meets, but that's just his personality. Get to know him more, make it obvious that you like him, but don't simply come out and say it. Flirt with him, talk about him a lot, touch his arm when you talk to him. If he returns these gestures, he likes you. If not, then maybe he's just a flirtacious guy. If he returns them, you should think about going out with him.|`|44e6bad7e68408f41876c7785965617caa	Well Im Sure This guy likes you ......lol i remember those days.........but if he like you and you like him go for it.|`|ctBf2sE4aa	What, do you need a giant billboard?

But if what you have told is true, then it is preety obvious he likes you.<br>  <br>  But, going out with him right now is a little fast. First make sure for 100% that he likes you. Then get to know him a bit more. When the right time comes, make your feelings known.

Have you tried dating sites?  The growing number of young people on these sites grows a lot!  You get to see what you're getting into and all the "basics" about the person before you meet them.  Also, try Myspace.  If you don't have a profile, create one then browse your area for single ladies, then approach them with a message to show your interest.  Also I suggest after talking with someone on one of the sites, talking to them on Yahoo! Messenger to trade pics or even web-cam with them to get to know them better.  Good luck!|`|f9ff8e9db6b2eef1f29f0da12da62c39aa	you seem like a really nice guy, and i would totally date you if i weren't 12! plus that would be illegal, so yeah, but i hope you find someone really spacial, you just need to give it time! love ya! lol|`|cqaZ8kjsaa	it's being tough new in the city but going to the club by yourself is a good thing a girl would like that she can talk and dance with you all night with no int eruption any of your guy friends.as far as school find out what it is you like to do then go have fun with it when you go you'll find someone there with the same int rest introduce yourself whether it's male or female|`|e8c81fbd53d901d621aa283a427d6d1caa	Look...you need to also tell girls what YOU look like.

54eb668a7249694b0b9c18370ec81abeaa	That sucks, I think she definitely needs to be spoken to by your boss.  it sounds like her personal life is effecting her work, and the work place environment.  I would give her the opportunity to resolve the situation ( I would get an estimate from a body shop, and slap her with a nice bill).  Try to avoid filling an insurance claim.  If she does not take responsibility, then I would take it to your employer, who is obligated to provide a safe,and non hostile working environment for you and the rest of the staff.  The fact that your manager felt the need to lock the door tells me he or she did not feel safe either.  I would say dealing with vandalizing thugs is probably not in your job description.  I don't think your employer would be liable for the damage but,  perhaps getting them involved would light a fire under your co-worker, to take some responsibility.  However, she sounds like a total flake, and you  may never be compensated, she may only loose her job over it, but at least you would not have to deal with her Immature Drama anymore.  At the same time I would proceed with caution, if this is the type of people that she associates with, who knows what the rest of her friends are like.  Sorry, and good luck.

8e28ad49d99988787c3b86c641d381b6aa	Sounds to me like he is cheating on you. His interest in anal sex is a sign he is experimenting with someone else, and hiding his cell phone will mean he has Her number programmed in it.

On the other hand if he is not telling the truth, let him know that if he feels the need to be unfaithful then he needs to be a man and end his relationship with you, if for no other reason, it is just common respect. Don't waste too much emotional energy on people who don't make you happy or bring you internal joy.. life is too short and precious to sqaunder our love on people who don't appreciate it.|`|AA10993379	GET A GIRL TO ASK HIM OUT|`|d1efbb4481d4af1d8c650f6703a772acaa	Hit redial on his cell phone.|`|0e64741a0e9ba6595087a13e3fa73c41aa	ask if you can borrow his cell and search all the numbers he called and all his texts.  also, you could ask his friend and if he's an honest boy then he may just tell your friends.  it hurts to find out, but he may really want to just hang with the guys.  hopefully he's not cheating on you.  trust me if he is and you really cared you will want to curl up and cry for a few days.  good luck and find out now before any real damage is done.  but if he is cheating just move on and find someone better.  she'll dump him and hell get what he deserves.  you will probably find the right guy after that.  it may take a while, but you will realize that it was for the better and that you will grow and your expectations will raise because of it|`|7184bcdf506d7950ee18568f7fd5da1eaa	Get a girl which is hot to go on a date with him and catch him there - or just ask!|`|AA11610725	If you really think he's cheating, why do you need to catch him?  You should just break up with him.|`|VqJOccGaaa	Call him up often.That's what my guy did to me and never did i dare to cheat.Ask where he is everytime.Example if he says he;s in a bus,tell him i wana hear the sound of the bus.If he says he;s wth whoever,says"pass on to him""i wana hear his voice".If he hang up the call,msg"Pick up the call right now if you don;t want me to think you are cheating on me.He may think that you are so absurd to do all this but say you are just doing this to protect your love.Secondly,always take a look into his mailbox.You may be intruding his privacy,but who cares,better than being cheated yea..good luck!|`|a490f71d39194d222e6f10dc9fc9bdaaaa	If you think he is cheating why would you want to find out. Because if he is not than you are going to ruin a relationship over accusations and if he is than you are still going to hurt.  So if you can not trust him then just leave him.  Because either way you are going to get hurt and you do not want that., do you?|`|d2VPsZgwaa	If you think he's cheating, why would you want to waste any more of your time trying to "catch" him.

Good communication among other things is the key to a lasting relationship.  Show her in your actions as well as your words that you love her and want only her.  Do things you both enjoy together.  Include her in decision making and never make important decisions without her.  Be honest at all time, even if the truth has to hurt sometime, she will respect you for your honesty and not label you as a liar if you happen to lie and she finds out about it.  Do romantic things for her, little things as calling her to say you love her and a single flower out of the blue for no reason.  Sometime do the unexpected.  A relationship is a two way thing, so in turn I hope you have someone who would equally do the same with you.
0c98e72a20485bfbd0fce077366f1938aa	According to the research it is about even but that does not take into consideration any factors like religion or personal morals, character and integrity. I personally believe that it looks like more ladies do it because of the double standards in our country as well as it is just easier for them to. Guys don't take any effort to get into bed and ladies do. I also believe that ladies are more forgiving in relationships and that makes it harder to get them to cross the line, not that they don't cross it.|`|086e9faebcec9cee6887a8374e490a0daa	I'd say its about even nowadays.

37aba7f5022b5ddfb06909f37524a2bfaa	Well I think for guys the most obvious flirting by a girl is when they touch you a lot.  Either lean on you or hug you or just small gestures.  If you're sitting next to each other just rub shoulders.  Other things you can do is make a lot of jokes with him.  Make a lot of eye contact and offer to hang out.<br>  <br>  I think its cool when a girl who likes me flirst a lot.  It makes it a lot easier to know how they feel.

Wait a day or two then decide.|`|wPOdi82Naa	i'm in the same mood wondering if i should dump him or keep him. I say dump, and start over. How about you?
7NiLwiEjaa	To tell you the truth, id say he still loves you but he wants to get over you.  I think he would gradually want to make his way to be friends with you that way he keeps you in his life but can get on with his life with someone else.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there might be something there.  You might have to just wait it out and when he breaks up with his current girlfriend.. try to get with him if you want. If he doesnt break up with her, then he probably just wants you as a friend.  But after three months im sure he doesnt "love" her
7NiLwiEjaa	Well first of all, delete that picture so it wont happen again lol<br>  <br>  I dont think you messed up.  If she has a problem with the fact that there was a picture of a girl on your phone, shes probably gonna be the type of girlfriend that would yell at you for talking to another girl.  My ex was just like that.  If i talked to a girl she didnt like i'd get yelled at for it.  Its an awful situation to be in and its better to just forget about the girl all together.<br>  <br>  If you still want to try to hook up with her, I would suggest that you just flirt with her.  Pull bs lines like say shes beautiful or pretty.. never say shes hot etc... they dont like that.  She'll realize that you really do like her and if she brings up the picture, just say you forgot to delete it or something.  Thats the BS i pull on girls and it works wonders lol
AiQVBHSyaa	it would be random if he just switched seats all the sudden when another one opened up.  maybe he was just trying to make an awkward situation less awkward.  It probably just felt like he was staring at you because you felt so self-conscious...props to you though for taking the initiative with him...<br>  <br>  I'd forget about it though...
NchXOFcEaa	SARGE AND OTSY YOU HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD I THINK. THIS GIRL'S EX WROTE ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT HER!!!<br>  <br>  He doesn't love you. He is not in love with you. He obviously values your friendship, but if he really cared more about you than himself he would cut all ties with you so that you could heal and move on. If what he has written about your behavior is true then you two should NOT be friends because you clearly cannot accept him as just a friend, which is all that he wants from you. You are obviously still in love with him and him sticking around under the guise of friendship is doing you no good what so ever. If you really haven't gotten over him in 2 years since you split up, then you may be co-dependent and should seek professional help to get through this and move on.|`|S7vDVrINaa	im not sure but it sounds like you are still intrested in her. just tell her what you think and that you only want to be friends|`|b7916b0e32cf38a55d270209108691d1aa	I hope that you're not in college in the US.  Because you can barely speak English.  It would be more understandable if you just pounded your forehead against the keyboard.  I thought lesbians were supposed to be pretty smart.
7NiLwiEjaa	Ok a couple things here...<br>  <br>  First, you cant control your reactions after a break up really... its easy to say youre going to be friends afterwards while youre dating him, but its harder to say you want to be friends after you break up with him.<br>  <br>  And if he doesnt hug you at school or hang out with you then it seems like hes using you kinda.  If he just kisses you and wont bring you around his friends or go around your friends, he might just be trying to get some on the side... i know that sounds bad but guys do it.  <br>  <br>  So my suggestion to you, is to  break up with him and tell him he seems like he would be a better friend than a boyfriend.  try to keep it at a non-violent break up that way if he follows through with being friends you'll know he's alright and worthy as a friend at least.  If he doesnt then you just saved yourself a lot of trouble.  But it is a good idea especially in school to go out with people that are comfortable being around your friends.  Its good to have all of you hang out and have fun together.|`|295d643b990eb33150745775a47d649aaa	Well if you're looking at other guys then you're probably not getting what you need from the relationship you have now. I'd break up and if he's too immature to keep the friendship then he's not worth the time.

7NiLwiEjaa	I know what your'e going through... Its happened to me lol.<br>  <br>  Ok when it happened to me.. (im really shy too and my face gets red when im uncomfortable so its pretty bad.) I did what you did.  I tried to play it off like nothing happened.  Well i ended up becoming friends with the girl a few years later and she admitted that she liked me a lot.  Had i known that, we would have been together for some amount of time..<br>  <br>  Basically, its the hardest thing to do when youre shy like you and me, but if you want to have a relationship with someonen you like, you have to just come out and say how you feel sometimes.  Its easy to do it if you talk to him on AIM.. you could just ask if he wants to hang out.  Thats much easier to do than asking to his face.  That way if he says no.. who cares.  If you ask him to his face and he says no.. then youre going to stand there like an idiot.<br>  <br>  If you dont talk to him on aim...  start saying hi to him in the halls or wherver it is when you walk past him... If you walk in the same direction just start up some small talk.  Whats goin one.. where ya goin.. stupid stuff like that.  Do that a few times and see what he does.  If he likes talking to you, say youre going to.... the movies, lunch, dinner, etc... and see if he wants to come.  If he doesnt really seem interested in the conversation.. its most likely that hes not interested in you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.. just remember... the shy girl is never a ho.. and guys like that :-)

XIcbB7w6aa	If you have a crush, you idealize her and only think of the good things about her.  If you love her, you know everything about her and still want her and need her and want to be with her.|`|sZdGILd0aa	How you can tell is if you ask her out and want to get to know her more. If you get over it you only had a crush.
0oOrX0diaa	wow... geez louise... im not sure if he flips u off if he is such a good guy, but if u like him ask him wat he thinks about u and if he does not like u then u tell him u were just kidding!! lol good luck!!!|`|AA11991351	lol he sounds charming!!|`|RtHIEMGLaa	u dont need to ask only if u r sure he likes u....u can just ask anyone out theres no prohibition!!!|`|uOo5Xn8iaa	go up to him and ask him and if he does pull him|`|uPJt7wbhaa	go up to him and ask him! the only bad thing that will ha-pin is if he seas no

DzJyU7ojaa	Don't be a member of the "boomerang generation." You need to stand up for yourself and move out. You and your mother are obviously incompatable as housemates and you should enough of an adult to live on your own. I know it will be difficult, but you have to decide if the potential sacrifice (like getting a job) will be worth it.<br>  <br>  If that is not an option, you need to sit down with your mother and explain how you feel. Make her understand that you are an adult and can make your own decisions, with out her input. If she can't handle that, then ignore her the best you can and work on moving out!|`|AA11276475	you need to move out...your mother is trying to controll all aspects of your life..you are a little old to be in this position. Get a job and finish your education yourself. Others do it all the time. Until you are ready to stand up for yourself and on your own two feet, you are at the mercy of this woman. Good luck|`|jR1leJLQaa	i think that maybe your mom is just worried about you. she may think that the only way that you can be successful in life is if you do wat she says. my mom once told me all the bad characteristics i had....i felt crappy afterward, but it helped me to change. maybe she is not trying to hurt you, but deep down she is trying to help you. maybe you should stand up for yourself or ignore it, either one that you think that you would do better with.|`|lWvY0rZLaa	journalism? what's your major now? look at princetonreview.com journalists dont make much money

It could have been the way you said it, the words you chose or just that it wasn't what she wanted to hear and didn't know how to deal with it at that moment.  Give her time to absorb the information and she'll come back around, maybe a different person to you, but will return nonetheless.  :)|`|J3fhIzG2aa	Im guessing she was probably sad but openness and honesty and sharing is key to any good relationship good luck!
7NiLwiEjaa	Well It doesn't seem like he loves you by the way that message sounds.  It just sounds like he is writing you the letter because he doesn't have the guts to call you and tell you how he feels.  <br>  <br>  I would say do what you can to get over him.  It sounds to me like you two weren't really meant to be.  <br>  <br>  If he does call, just pick up and say... sorry, I'm busy right now, ill call you back when i feel comfortable.  Get the message across that you don't NEED him.  If he still wants you, he'll try to shape up.  And then you will be in the perfect spot to make your decision.

OSDuD2UGaa	Sweetie I'm sorry to tell you but yeah i think it's a big possibility..The reason why I say POSSIBILITY is because you won't know for sure unless you confront her about it or catch her in the act. So my advice to you is just to talk to her about it and let her know that you caught her in a couple of lies and you want the truth and see what she Say's. If she can't give you a good reason then she's cheating and you need to leave her alone..|`|3rFDS1pLaa	Yup shes cheating.  CALL CHEATERS..so joey grecko can bust her.|`|AA11285272	She does not belong to you and you are not married to her so she is not cheating on you.  If you don't like what she does then move on.|`|NqTDPzFkaa	pre-emptive breakup. catch her off guard. maybe that will turn the tables. regardless she's definetly cheating.|`|Sfl1mnPZaa	Dont think but just act cuz she is cheatin you. Talk to her and tell her wat you wanna her to know|`|bd450d3c101a3e37f5ac8be5a6f434c9aa	yup your right. I bet she doesnt even want to be around you as much as she used to.. Cheaters never keep their patterns .. She probably never fall asleep at those abnormal times and I bet after that call she hung up quick and didnt speak to you until the afternoon next day... All I can say is ur first instinct never lie|`|gIH3lshnaa	Talk to her. Ask her where she go last night, if she said she's at her sister's house, tell her that you went there. Ask the details of her where about first before telling her what you found out. That way you can corner to telling you the truth.|`|e0772bc055c15c86310db2b593e6444daa	Tell her you need some honest answers - If she ignores that - Then you have your answer - And you deserve better than that|`|435390163a4e541b09d69e6930758316aa	sorry man i think she is. looks like your going to start looking. or have a talk to her
7NiLwiEjaa	Yeah I know what you mean.  We actually asked a teacher of ours that and she said girls do want it too.  But if a guy has sex they show off to their friends and do all that jazz.<br>  If a girl has sex she gets to worry about being called a slut and getting a pregnancy test done just in case.  So it seems like they just need to resist more than guys do.  Girls also like a much more emotional relationship versus guys who will settle for just a physical one.<br>  <br>  But to tell you the truth, I've met girls that are hornier than any guy I've ever known.  It's actually a little scary.  I met someone that after talking to for 2 days, she was already asking me to come over her house and do her... As interesting as that week long relationship was, I don't think I would get into another one like that haha.... So stay away from girls like that.|`|Qicclxv3aa	I'm not a high school girl, but I want sex all the time.
7NiLwiEjaa	Yeah that sucks and I have a couple friends like that.<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth though, theres not a whole lot that I know of that you could do about it.  You could change your clothing style to look a little older but that won't help your face look any different.<br>  <br>  In a few years though you'll be happy.  You have about 3 years left to completely stop growing and if you still stay young looking then more power to you.  It'll suck now but when you're 30  you're gonna be able to hook up with girls that are like 20... so deal with the crap now and look forward to the future.
M8dnbY5Zaa	You just need to be more self confident and put yourself out there and if you see a girl that you like ask her out what is it gonna hurt the worst she could do is say no right! Tell chicks your in a band as a conversation started chicks love a talented guy so good luck!|`|7mZA2cSraa	no 1 is ugly!!!! jaut wait... u will found her...|`|AA11706931	you worry to much about your looks. only shallow people would date people based purely on looks. i for one date guys for who they are not how they look. if they're kind and a good person thats what should matter. oh and i didnt date anyone till i was 15. so dont rush into.|`|DzJyU7ojaa	I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 16. My fiance didn't have a girlfriend until he was 18!<br>  <br>  Don't rush it, you will just end up with someone you should have been with at all.<br>  <br>  Love will appear when it is supposed to!|`|gwpU448saa	first advice, get off heroine
6Rnzmd4gaa	Ah, cute. Young love. Well, here's what u got 2 do. It does sound like you indeed like him. His friends are probably the best link to knowing how he feels about you right now. Granted you have a brake up in the past, but since you're good friends now, I'd say the odds are in your favor. Being a guy myself, I have never had the guts to ask a girl out. I say you, in person, not one of your friends, text, e-mail, note, etc., no U, need to ask him out face-to-face, that way he knows u really like him. Say how u like but don't over do it that you scare him, we scare easy FYI, lol. If he replies with the same feelings, then start dating. If he doesn't feel exactly like you do, then just be friends a little while longer until the feeling is mutual, OK? Good luck and knock'em dead, lol. Besides, if it don't work out, I'm available  ;)<br>  <br>  I know it won't be easy to ask him and I know you hate hearing that awful word "no," but he might be thinking the same thing as you are, maybe that's why he hasn't asked you yet. Besides, u only live oncae and if you don't ask him, you'll just end up kicking yourself later for not asking.|`|0IrLAsuGaa	Take control of your life! Go ahead and ask him out instead of waiting around for him. Seize the opportunity--don't let it slip, or else someone else will get him.|`|GF5BmgCUaa	ask him if he still likes you. if he hesitates then he does or if he makes a big deal out of the question then he still does.|`|Xd4mDhTDaa	Hey im  guy but i know just how you feel!<br>  im in love with a girl named hannah!<br>  (not hannah montana!)<br>  telll the boy you like hem than ask hem!<br>  it may feel embarasing but the boys like it when a girl can have so much stranth to say that to hem!<br>  after you do that just stand there tell he seis somtheing!|`|AA12190584	Do not ask a guy out or ladies to make the first move. It is a big turn-off! I have brothers and many guy friends they tell me that.<br>  <br>  If he likes you, He will make the move no matter what! IF HE REALLY, REALLY LIKES YOU. ;-)<br>  <br>  Goodluck.
ldgGVzUZaa	well its ok to like both<br>  also when she smiles and you feel comfurtable with her<br>  looking at her smile can tell a lot<br>  and her eyes maybe but if you like her just cause shes hot thats fine too XD|`|75ba6439777d801704ef328e46b51726aa	its okay if you like both<br>  otter beautiful is were the attraction come into play<br>  inner beauty is if you like her personality|`|meuFOuwTaa	Imagine her with a bad personality, would you still go out with her?<br>  <br>  If so, you just like her for her looks.|`|T1U4SzLtaa	The outer beauty is what attracts you and brings you close to her. Her inner beauty is what keeps you close for the long haul. That is the way nature intends for things to work.
d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	It's hottttt!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I love a girl who is confident!|`|9qYOE7zRaa	Omg I wish I knew!! I'm always so shy but at the same time im the most out going person. i just dont want to wait for them to ask me out , but i dont want them to think im a desperate loser because i cant wait
4jCvyt5Jaa	Because he is "f" ing the chick.|`|AA11034403	Here's the nice way:<br>  Ask him how he feels about you.  He should have more to say than that he's "invested" in the relationship.  That's not very romantic or convincing.  Men can and do "divest."  Next, if you think he's worth it, start being more romantic and fix yourself up.  Monopolize his weekends.  He'll forget all about her if he feels like he's got something better.  <br>  <br>  Here's the catty way:<br>  Get her number and have it ready in your phone.  Put your cell phone in your pocket.  Press "call" when you're making out with him and let her listen to you say his name.  That'll drive her nuts and she'll back off.  If she ever asks you about it, say you forgot to put your cell phone on key lock.<br>  <br>  Here's my way:  I wouldn't trust the guy.  If the only thing he can come up with is that he's "invested" in the relationship, then I'd let him know that he's not the only guy who's interested in me.  Tell him, "I need more than history to keep this relationship going."  It wouldn't hurt if he said he loved you.|`|32b28b707fc11bf92004467b6f8ab243aa	It's hard to tell I would have to know the guy and know his personality.  It's all based upon trust or you can play spy.  That's the best advice i can give ya.  Try talking to one of your friends that know him they should have some good advice.
ez8CFgf1aa	Maybe its because With the guys that your close with, you see them as family, or even like one of the girls! I hang out with these two girls, and think of them as one of the guys, Maybe its just like you? Hope I explained your delema! =)|`|6nrrjPvLaa	Maybe you should ask yourself what is it about your guy friend that isn't attractive and could see yourself with that person|`|OfBzrdXmaa	maybe ur guy friends u relate more to as "brothers" and this other guy is just insanely cute so its sexual appeal
c233860527aa554acebd591cf8154a87aa	My twin brother has been in a wheelchair for all his life.<br>  He deals with it like you and I.   It's no different, except that he cannot hit you, which is improper anyway.  Even we, not in<br>  wheelchairs should never allow our angry to get that way.<br>  He lived with me all the time we were growing up.  Sure he would get angry with me during that time..he would say so..<br>  and sometime shake his fist.  If he did walk, he would never have hit me. He would even chase me with his wheelchair...<br>  ( it was manual).....after I was in a horrible auto accident,<br>  that almost cost my life.....I could not take care of him anymore. I could no longer lift him.<br>  That was the hardest, he had to go into a nursing home.  I could not feed him anymore, clean him up, since he could not use a bathroom.  <br>  After my accident and I received a settlement...I purchased him a electric wheelchair.  The nursing home I put him in,<br>  with his consent was only a mile from my home( and my husband's)...so as I got better..he would come over every day<br>  until about 10 at night. The elecric wheelchair was his legs...<br>  He met this beautiful woman, 10  years younger than him....<br>  in the nursing home.   She was in an auto accident, that put her in a wheelchair...17 years old then....it crippled her so bad, no legs, injury to her hands....she can not eat herself either. or go to the bathroom.....dress herself,,etc.<br>  Now, if want to deal with anger from a wheelchair...<br>  No problem...she says it as it is.<br>  Yes, they both come over for Holidays and I go there..<br>  difference Nursing Home, the one they were in, moved people out, that could never walk again.<br>  If you are in a wheelchair........speak up.....the only difference,<br>  which I know is alot, not walking.....Just say what you have to say....Don't hold it back......Put Them in their place!<br>  Hope this helped a bit...<br>  yes  me too, broke my femur bone....now we really are twins,<br>  in a wheel chair for 6 months. Yes, I really got mad, maybe more disappointed when the nurses aid stole money from my purse. I reported it....however, I did call her, and tell her<br>  how I felt....angry, disappointed in her...etc..etc.<br>  If you would like..email me....evelyn@cybercomm.net<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you or someone is in a wheelchair does not mean they have to supress their anger. If they are in a place, home, etc.<br>  and feel they cannot.....there are other places to live.<br>  I am been there, doing it.....and love them so very much.|`|6Smd54ceaa	If my wheel chair got angry with me I would just forget to put on the brake while on a hill and see how it liked THAT!|`|AA10669573	We have a friend in a wheel chair from an auto accident.

I admire him greatly, he was my inspiration to do chemo.|`|AA12198711	No.<br>  <br>  But being in a wheelchair should make no difference on how a person deals with anger, there is just maybe a little bit more anger to deal with.<br>  <br>  Anger of any kind will eat you up inside if you hold onto it and harbor bad feelings. If there are things in you're life you can fix, fix them. If there are things in you're life you can not fix, like the wheelchair, let it go and move on with you're life.<br>  <br>  That wheelchair is a challenge, take it for a ride!|`|EsUNJNS7aa	deal with the positive things you can do and think less<br>  <br>  of what you can't<br>  <br>  no matter what there are people worse off than u.<br>  <br>  just remember that

Fg4gVQC6aa	look, you're quitting smoking because YOU are ready to quit.  perhaps, he's not ready to quit, or does not ever plan on quitting.  you're a smoker, so you should know how hard it is to quit.  and, i'm sure he knows how hard it is and doesn't want to go through it right now.  if you want him to quit, the only thing that i can think of for you to do is to find a way to motivate him, and that's really all you can do.  be more like an anti-smoking chearleader than a "nagging" girlfriend.|`|AFO85YyAaa	First, stop nagging him.  He's going to do what he's going to do.  That might even be something you like about him....<br>  Second, quit smoking!  You said you were committed to doing it.  SO, do it!  It's going to be hard, no matter what.  And it's going to be harder with him smoking around you all the time.  SO, get ready for the fight, get serious about quitting, know what your obstacles are, and get over them!<br>  <br>  He's your boyfriend for other reasons that have nothing to do with whether he smokes or not, right?  Sounds like he's not willing to help you quit, so you have to do it alone.  SO, do it.  If you're serious about quitting to the point where you don't think you can live with someone who doesn't support you, don't move in with him.<br>  <br>  Sounds simple doesn't it?  I know.  It's not.  Good luck.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	There is no way that you should move in together as you have an issue with him an it will only get worse.Since he is selfcentered.An told you where to go.This is only the begining of what you will be in for Best of luck???|`|RQNzIEZoaa	either accept it or give him the boot but dont try to tell a grown man how to live his life|`|WaIK8WL2aa	I commend you for wanting to quit.  It was by far the hardest feat I ever accomplished in my life.  Here's the deal.  You want him for long term, right.  His continued use of tobacco makes him a short-timer.  In addition, he is risking YOUR health, also.  If he cares for himself, he will quit.  If he can't care for himself, how can he care for you.  Pretty hard nosed, I know but you need to lay it on the line.  "Don't quit for me, but until you quit, there will be no me."  I sincerely hope for both of you, that you succeed.  It will be a proud accomplishment.  Let us know how this turns out, will ya?  Best wishes.|`|lt4NKGEzaa	Tell him it's over if he's not concerned about his health. You obviously are but he doesn't seem to care. Addiction to smoking is a pretty bad habit, I had quit about year or so ago. Cold turkey too.<br>  It's horrible being around almost all of my friends because they still smoke. We all smoke other stuff too, but I've been way healthier since I quit cigs. Craving s hit me like a M*****F***** but I can deal with it.<br>  Being able to breath without chest pains more than makes up for the fact that I feel like having to smoke a cigarette every once in a while. You know what I'm talking about, maybe someday your dude will care. Or maybe just go and find one who does.
04zTDlqtaa	You need to relax & breathe. There is nothing wrong with you.  A guy is not going to find you attractive or interesting if you don't view yourself that way.  Self confidence is the sexiest thing a person can posses.  Look in the mirror, admire your beauty, and carry yourself with pride.  The rest will happen sooner than you think.|`|tXYyqA5daa	all your friends are in couples, and that bums you out. it's understandable. remember, you don't have to have a guy, or have guys show interest in you, to be a good person, or to be whole. focus on things other than guys, things that you do very well, put your effort and passion into those things, and you will feel better.|`|GAeJgMP3aa	a guy can tell when a girl is not confident and that is a huge thing a guy looks for so just know u r pretty and dont worry someone will come along someone always does|`|WdA6dktoaa	i'm going through the same exact thing, actually. but my friends always bring another boy along with us wherever we go and they always are interested. but the thing is...first impressions are everything. so always remember to smile and be confident when you meet people for the first time. don't be too shy, but don't come off too strong.
7lQcyFsaaa	Because the supersmooth ones have "been there done that"... that's why they're soooo SMOOTH!  So, be friends first, and let a good guy grow on you... who cares if he's not Romeo... he'll be the guy to make you happy and vice versa:-)  Don't give up on dating or be afraid.  Just change your tactics!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nlzN4aJdaa	Here~s a hint...<br>  <br>  STOP DATING LOSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rgR8hGi6aa	Because you wouldn't know a gentleman if he jumped up and treated you well.  (Not that you would be seen in public with one anyway.)<br>  <br>  I don't mean to sound insulting, here, but am I close to the mark?<br>  <br>  In a line of a hundred assholes, my sister could find the worst one of the hundred.  Are you like her, or do you want to end up like her?  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Change up your idea of who your dating candidates are.  It's as simple as that.|`|tXYyqA5daa	when a dream guy turns into a nightmare, it means you are dreaming of the wrong kind of guy. there is something that you are looking for in a guy that turns himinto your nightmare. just be careful. rethink what you want in a guy, think about your ex's attitudes, and changes, and try to avoid guys like them in the future.<br>  and then realize that love IS worth the risk, but it's a risk that should only be taken when love is a possibilty.|`|AA10935363	The same thing has happened to me several times with women, so don't think it's just guys that are guilty. Dream mates only exists in dreams. There are no ideal people. We have been mentally poisoned with fairy tales as children. All of us are human beings with weaknesses and frailties. No one is perfect, but I believe we can find a "perfect match" for our individual personalities. Even then, stress happens, irritable events occur and sometimes we need to vent frustrations. That's life. What we really need to work on as human beings is not using our mates as targets for our anger and disappointments, especially if they are not a contributing factor. Working on our weaknesses as a couple can actually strengthen the bonds of a relationship if both parties are willing.|`|REomw1s5aa	That's why you date. In most realationships everyone starts out on their best behavior, but once the get used to the person their real personality comes out. If you keep dating and getting to know people, you will eventually find that guys whos good for and good to you. It's all about not being in such a hurry. Just go out there and have fun.|`|htgKXZE1aa	stupido is funny|`|njrKjJVwaa	You said it right: dream guys - they exist only in dreams, the awakening is mostly sad.|`|AA12316977	Buys are bumbs, a lot like dogs they sniff every rear end they can.  your best bet is to just ignore them, they'll come around in good time.
99qhYBxKaa	totally agree with you.<br>  but alot of the females you are talking about seem to be young. they simply might still feel proud of having their periods. and by talking about it they are letting people know that they are now a "woman". young guys or any males for that matter really dont want to know. but its an animal instinct for animals "women" to let other animals "Guys" know when they are ready to mate. nearly every animal specie does it.|`|808f6b1fe76caee5219f61724e32483daa	why do you care what other girls do? & whats your question?
cIuvIe3Saa	personally i like women with a more natural look.but it all depends on how pretty or ugly the woman is and what type of setting it is. for example. im an asian guy and i hate it when asian girls or girls in general powder their face white, go out and drink. that just looks nastyyyyyy..i think men in general would probably like girls with a natural look.|`|QzeGJ7yDaa	The kind that she actually KNOWS how to apply without looking like a clown..... or trashy.|`|Ic9oWmg8aa	Natural.<br>  <br>  (I'm not a man, but I DO like grrls)

Ese es aquel que desde chico ha compartido tus buenos y malos momentos y que te ha apoyado siempre. Es aquel con el que nunca te has peleado, siempre has compartido momentos de alegria (puede ser que hayan tenido alguna discusion pero lo mas minima). Si la persona que dice ser tu amigo cumple esas condiciones, creo que debes confiar en ella. <br>  Pero a veces la persona que dice ser tu amigo, te dice cosas malas de ti por detras, nunca se sabe.<br>  En mi opinion, tengo que agregar que en quien mas debes confiar en esta vida es en tu familia. Espero que coincidas con mi poinion. Saludos y suerte|`|27fcf44081bb9d29aa42879f59753be7aa	Muchas veces escuche esa frase "no confies en nadie" aunque me es inevitable, como mi mejor amiga. Yo si creo, pasa que algunos esa palabra le dan un mal uso.

Friendship is a safety net; you can try to go higher or get closer, and friendship would always be there to catch you if it does not work out.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|3d29b3c5add26506676d0872c7b6f4b3aa	well, does it seem like he likes you at all??|`|owt0Cp5taa	i would try to tell him so it's as casual as possible.  if you're going to be really nervous, you probably shouldn't tell him to his face, because your body language will give you away.  online is horrible, so just go for the phone.  i think the best way to go would to be to check with one of his friends first.  maybe a mutual friend, and have them find out, just so you've got a little insurance.  if they come back with good news, if he doesn't ask you out first, then you can call him and go for it!<br>  <br>  but if you don't have a way to find out for sure and you tell him anyway, tell him that you don't want to hurt things between you two but you have to be honest with yourself.  if he says no say that you're all right and it's really no big deal and that you still want to be friends and hope that it doesn't make things weird between you two.  it'll hurt, but you've gotta keep a smile on.  the big part comes in the next few days.  you've gotta act like nothing happened if you want to restore your friendship, even if you're hurting.  if you still joke around with him and are happy and just keep everything normal, your friendship will be find, and he'll probably begin to wonder what he's missing out on.  be strong and good luck :}

El novio fue a buscarme como echandome pleito, diciendome que su novia le había dicho que la había chantajeado y que la acosaba, que siempre la buscaba y todo. <br>  <br>  Esta ni?a, Huguette se la pasaba en mi facultad esperando a que yo saliera, y así era como nos veíamos. Pero ella le dijo al tipo que yo era quien la buscaba y todo. <br>  <br>  También ese día que el novio me echo pleito llegó un amigo y cuando escuchó mas o menos de qué se trataba la situación mi amigo dijo "es la chaparra esa que siempre viene?" y se voltea con el tipo y le dice "siempre viene a buscar a chucho (yo)"<br>  <br>  Y pues el tipo todo enojado se fue y pues casi me le voy a golpes pero me controlé.

cRhh4eFuaa	No juzgues a tu papa, simplemente no lo hagas.  Yo no se porque tenga esas actitudes tu padre, pueden ser muchas cosas, su educación, el haber perdido a su pareja que aunque como comentas la trataba mal, imagina todo lo que habrán compartido con ella y de repente ya no esta con el!  También puede ser que tenga una depresión,  si es así eso es muy difícil de superar porque si es muy orgulloso como se ve que es no lo va a admitir ni a pedir ayuda, en fin pueden ser muchas cosas  pero es tu papa! y sea como sea siempre ha estado ahí no? <br>  <br>  Piensa ya no tienes a tu mami, pues trata de disfrutar lo que puedas de tu papa porque ahí esta* y por lo que cuentas no la debe estar pasando bien el tampoco,  si dices que te pide amor pues dáselo y elimina esos pensamientos malos hacia el abrázalo quiérelo, que no te importe que te rechace nosotros como hijos debemos ser humildes talvez si te acercas a el cambie y si no ya no quedo de tu parte.<br>  <br>  Espero que te ayude esto, no digo que tu estés mal,  creeme entiendo lo que sientes* a mí me paso igual,  mi papi ya no esta aquí pero me quede con la dicha de que aunque fue muy duro, nos insulto, nos corrió de la casa, y mucho mas, yo lo ame y murió en mis brazos diciéndole que lo amaba...  mi hermana lo dejo en sus últimos días, ella sabrá porque! lo hice pero  ya no la juzgo porque  veo que aun le tiene coraje y eso no la deja en paz, en cambio yo lo trate de comprenderlo  y eso me hizo ser mucho mas feliz y  se que en sus últimos días el también lo fue. <br>  <br>  Si a veces damos todo por una persona que ni es de tu sangre cuanto mas por tu papi no?<br>  <br>  Un beso.|`|5LhUvkLoaa	uuf! fuerte, a mi me pasa algo muy parecido, mis papas se acaban de separar hace como un mes, pero la relacion padre he hijas q hemos tenido con el nunca ha sido de las mejores, somos tres mujeres y creo q con un poco de suerte recuerdo q nos haya dicho t quiero alguna vez, pero no por eso he pensado q somos sus enemigas ni nada de eso, solo creo q hay algunas personas que quieren a su manera y son menos expresivos, m parece muy bien q no se dejen pasar a llevar, no porque sea su padre le tienen q aguantar todo, pero igual t aconsejo q hables con el y le digas todo lo q sientes, quizas el no se ha dado cuenta q esta actuando mal, en cambio el mio si lo nota pero no hace nada por cambiarlo y eso duele aun mas... piensa lo q t dije<br>  besos, xau ;)|`|6e8aee86546156a684881396fd8394d3aa	hablenlo con el ...|`|P56i6gZLaa	eso es lo que le pasa esta tratando de seguir su tiranía y no puede ignoralo y se dará cuenta que tiene que cambiar|`|kXiVzTnvaa	tu papa los quiere mucho lo q pasa es q seguro en este momento se encuentra confundido con algunas cosas y como q paga la rabia con ustedes lo mejor q puedes hacer es comentarle sobre el cambio tan repentino q a dado y decirle lo mucho q le amas y q quisieras permanecer unido con el !!!!!|`|fa50863d4f0eda824444aaa7427e1cfbaa	pues si no quiere ir que no vaya y ya.<br>  para que haces panchos.<br>  <br>  dejalo que viva la vida como el gusta, al cabo es de el y notuya.<br>  <br>  nada mas hazle saber que si tu mama se fue uds no tienen la culpa de su rabia.<br>  <br>  suerte y felicidades para tu sobrina|`|hhHNk0G7aa	evidentemente  tu papa  tiene  un problema  serio de  personalidad  y si no quiere  ayuda  traten ustedes  de  vivir  lo mejor  posible  y ayudarlo en lo que  puedan , lo demas  no te  preocupes  el  cosechara  lo que  ha  sembrado hasta  ahora<br>  suerte|`|1pSjluFCaa	mira yo tengo un padre igual que el tuyo, quieres que te sea honesta NO LO VAS A PODER CAMBIAR NUNCA. En primera porque es una persona adulta ya tiene muy arraigadas sus costumbres. Te voy a decir que  fue lo que hice y ojala te pueda ayudar<br>  primero no me deje contagiar de su amargura y pesimismo( porque habia ocaciones que ni siquiera queria ir a la escuela porque me desanimaba o cuando emprendia un  proyecto me lo hechaba abajo con sus cometarios)<br>  Lo apoyaba en lo que podía, porque apesar de todo como hijo hay un sentimiento de amor y como quiera uno quiere tener su espiritu en paz( con el quehacer de la casa y algo de gasto para la casa, para que no me estuviera fregando con que no se le ayudaba o para que no me hechara en cara que vivia de su dinero)<br>  Nunca espere ninguna ayuda de él y por lo tanto siempre tuve que tomar mis propias decisiones en cuanto a la escuela, la casa, el trabajo y  mi propia vida. además de poner limites. te lo digo porque si le hubiese hecho caso de no estudiar ahorita no tendria una carrera terminada.<br>  Y la ultima y la más importante no te dejes caer, ???animo??? hazlo por esa hermana y tu familia que te necesita. te diga lo que tediga y hací se tehaga un nudo en la garganta y un dolor de estomago no te dejes caer, hacercate  a lo que tu creas a Dios, a la vida, etc.Y llenate de voluntad una y otra vez.|`|ZH0oJPf3aa	mija la verdad tu papa esta afectado por lo de tu mami solamente entiendelo no ere nadie para juzgarlo|`|ZSxan7Wxaa	yo creo que se siente inseguro y el contacto con la gente (aunque sean ustedes) lo deja lijeramente expuesto, despues de una separación (sea cual sea) por lo regular entra nuestro mecanismo de defensa para que no nos vuelvan a lastimar, esto no quiere decir que este bien, simplemente perdio la confianza y entra un poco el egoismo, por eso es que no le interesa lo que haga sentir a los demás.<br>  <br>  Es una etapa muy dura en la que tu y tu hermana deben hacer equipo, creo que como personas jovenes tienen la oprtunidad de ponerse más ustedes en su lugar que el en el de ustedes por que mientras mas grandes somos más nos cuesta reponernos de las caídas de esta índole.<br>  <br>  Creeme mis hermanos y yo pasamos por algo muy parecido pero son etapas, muy duras, pero se superan, no te desanimes... cualquier duda cuenta conmigo|`|kiysYSqkaa	Es un caso difícil que no creo podamos resolver.

Digo sexualidad, no sexo meramente, y sí es una manifestación de nuestra sexualidad y que la reprimimos por los prejuicios. <br>  <br>  Esta es mi opinión, besos, abrazos, caricias y todo el amor a mis verdaderos amigos, siempre que ellos sientan lo mismo y se propicie este desprendimiento de los marcos sociales en ambos. En desacuerdo media humanidad, pero así me siento más feliz que debe ser nuestro fin supremo. a la otra mitad, un beso y un abrazo para este próximo 20.|`|o41GiEexaa	todo eso esta bien siempre y cuando no te pases y sea con respeto sin ofender ni agredir a nadie|`|JxHUUXR9aa	hola amigo.....mmmmmmmmmmmmh,..solo beso en la mejilla y abrazito normal!!gracias y beso!|`|584f823ac3e792a64656f4b7aa55c5d4aa	EL 20 de Julio también es el Día de Independencia de Colombia =)<br>  y bueno respecto a los amigos, permito que me den un besito en la mejilla y un abrazo <br>  <br>  xoxo|`|6fda770aa319f378599910977f6b47c9aa	Un abrazo y beso en la mejilla, amigo.....Pretendés más ?? oups !! la efusividad la dejo para la intimidad con mi pareja...<br>  Besitos inocentes =P|`|DDnpiV4Baa	el dia d la madre el dia del amigo el dia del hijo el dia d los padres el dia d lo q sea no existen solo existe el dia del comerciante el mejor regalo es el q se hace espontaneamente|`|c0c24d46f7744cc25a2f384825875ea8aa	jijijiji si eres open  todo esta bien|`|xxa0jAzDaa	tengo todos amigos .. y son muy repetuosos .. ya que con mi pareja los compartimos .. son hermanos .. siempre lo mismo besos abrazos.. y a divertirce y el dia lo permite ..

Seems like this guy has no idea what that means. the now ex-wife surely is better off without him.|`|3259d7fcc72545f67e78fa6dc2b97998aa	Uhh.  He couldn't of just told her that he wanted a divorce.  Anytime someone resorts to cheating instead of either severing the tie(divorce) or trying to fix the problem raises a red flag for me.<br>  Trust your gut.  Women's intuition is very strong sometimes.  But be smart about it.  His cheating led him to meet you....I would be skeptical...

I got in HUGE trouble for that!!|`|MzZAiy0vaa	I'm the middle one, and seriously from my experience the baby get's all the attention. Especially my sister. I'm tryin' 2 ignore her.

One thing you need to do is to understand that females are all individuals.  What one likes isn't going to be what another one likes.  You have to find a girl who likes YOUR personallity.  Stop trying to be what "girls like" because it will only end up with you being called a phony.

YDDxyfxjaa	I didn't want to date because, honestly, I had a future I needed to keep my eye on.  As I got older, it became more about low self-esteem and hiding away.  I finally went online and started dating, forcing myself.  I found my boyfriend that way, and we've been together 4 years.<br>  1.  My first boyfriend was just after my 26th birthday.<br>  2.  My boyfriend was actually pretty positive about it.  He was happy that I didn't have a lot of baggage from past relationships gone to heck, and that I didn't have the negativity toward men that a lot of women did.  He was a little worried that I wouldn't be serious or immature, but neither of us were looking for "the one", it just happened.  <br>  3.  We talked about a lot of things in the beginning, and it came out during that time, before we had met face to face.<br>  <br>  I will, for the record, state that I had opportunities to have a boyfriend, but things just never came through, and at a certain point I focused on getting myself established in the world, and romance just wasn't a distraction I felt I could afford.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3259d7fcc72545f67e78fa6dc2b97998aa	1) Yes but I was already in my sophomore year of college<br>  2) Thought it was strange that I was never in a relationship before.

XSHQBenIaa	Reina querida: ?El beso que le respondistes a tu mejor amigo lo sentistes como un beso de amor o simplemente fue motivado por un momento de ocio , sin darte cuenta de lo que estabas haciendo?....Creo que deberìan juntos analizar esta situación...es obvio Reina que ya no todo será igual entre ustedes dos porque el beso como es de público conocimiento, es el acto íntimo más comprometedor entre dos personas...El beso Reina, sin ponerle tanto color al asunto...está declarado poco menos que tener una relación sexual...así es mirado por los psicólogos al momento de definir actitudes y desarrollo de emociones en las personas....por esa razón es que existe tanta revolución cuando se da un beso...por que hay besos y besos...?Qué quiero decirte?...Tal vez tú no lo veas desde el punto de vista que lo ve la mayoría...para tí tal vez no fue tanto como para perder a tu mejor y más preciado amigo...Pero lo hicistes y ahí están los resultados...Te diré Reina por que a ustedes les sucedió esto...Entre tú  y ese amigo no existe una gran confianza y un gran conocimiento de sus respectivas personalidades...Es mas...ustedes son una pareja de amigos sin compromisos...por que cuando se llega a una relación de amistad de hermanos...esto no habría sucedido...Se hubieran respetado siempre y tendrìan muy claro cuales son los límites y el respeto hubiera primado por y sobre todo...Los amigos de verdad se pueden llegar a enamorar y eso es una gran verdad que las parejas de amigos  son y constituyen los mejores y más grandes amantes en un matrimonio...por que se conocen en el  más amplio sentido de la palabra...se aceptan sus virtudes y defectos...se consuelan y se saludan en todo momento...viven pendientes el uno del otro y se socorren en las adversidades...son compa?eros inseparables...hasta cómplices en las farrandas y aventuras...Lloran y ríen juntos ...pero sabes qué Reina ?...los verdaderos amigos se respetan y se perdonan también cuando meten la pata...por que todos estamos expuestos a cometer errores en la vida...no existen los amigos perfectos...por esa razón tienes que conversar con tu supuesto amigo y analizar juntos el problema...Si él te ama y te respeta a ti como su amiga del alma, te pedirá disculpas y volverá aser como antes...en cambio si su actitud es esconderse o ignorarte ...simplemente estabas equivocada en la elección de su amistad...Nada en la vida es tan malo y nada tampoco tan bueno como para que no tenga una vía de solución...Eres muy joven Reina y la vida te ense?a, debes aprender a vivir y aceptar frustraciones y alegrías...Un beso para animarte ..........Chauuuuuuuuuuuuu.........|`|7dbe7bc0014f45891ff95fb769c46613aa	tal vez lo ke sucede es que el esta atemorizado x ke cree que tu no querias el beso apesar de que le respondiste, lo mejor es hablar y aclarar la situacion lo que hara que la relacion vuelva a la normalidad, si es que el no siente algo mas que amistad x ti. suerte pero habla, es malo callar!|`|AtgJHr4Raa	Habla con el y di lo que piensas y lo que no quieres que es perderlo.  En mi lugar yo le daría su espacio y su tiempo para yo hablar con el de-jalo pensar bien las cosas y que se de cuenta de que el beso no significo nada solo paso.  Pero lamentablemente no creo que la amistad sea igual que antes de ese beso por que cada vez que se vean se van acordar pienso yo no se si sera cierto.  Solo te deseo suerte y que se reconcilie la amistad de los dos. bye|`|HcWz9uiFaa	No creo que tu tengas que buscar la forma de que esten bien, tu ya estas haciendo suficiente con tratar de que él se sienta bien.

No deben hacer como si no pasó nada, porque si se besaron es porque se gustan. El se debe sentir incómodo porque tal vez ya no quiera ser solamente tu amigo sino también tu pareja. Y es lógico que se aleje porque no debe saber como tratarte. Se debe sentir inseguro y con miedos. Tal vez piensa que rompe una amistad a cambio de un noviazgo y que si éste no funciona pierde tu amor y tu amistad.<br>  Trata de ordenar tu cabeza y una vez que sepas que es lo que realmente quieres habla con él.<br>  Suerte!|`|f2ea32358b65fb77acfc51335fd38146aa	Deja que pase un poco el tiempo. No apures las cosas ya que los dos parecen confundidos y pedirse definiciones ahora puede ser un error.

zCCZ0wmAaa	Sometimes when I say "I don't care", I really don't, that may be true with you as well.  But if you really have an opinion but are afraid to voice it, that's not good.  <br>  <br>  Maybe start by asking him.  Say "How about ____ for dinner tonight?"  Or say, "Let's go see _____ movie."  That way you have begun to voice your opinion, but in a non-threatening way.  <br>  <br>  When you do give your opinion, does he get mad?  This is not a good relationship, as you know from your home.  <br>  <br>  If you are afraid of his reaction, ask yourself why that is.  Is it him or you?  It sounds like he respects you if he wants your honest opinion, so why don't you respect yourself enough to give one?  <br>  <br>  If you try but continue to have trouble, a therapist may help you find the self-respect you need to stand up for yourself.    <br>  <br>  Wishing you the best of luck.|`|fkoTp79daa	First is your boyfriend understanding about this or a controling personalty.

It just u and ur child.|`|DrNIWNg8aa	As far as your ex taking your child he can't if you are a good parent money or no money! If you haven't already attained an education I say do your best to do so because with an education you can get better jobs and pay! If can't or already have just find the best job you can! PUT everything about your life in it's place put your child first and remember working hard and going to school is putting your child first because it will benefit them. Do everything you can to provide what your child NEEDS not what it wants!! And makes sure your child knows you love him or her! I don't know what seeing your ex means but if it means having a relationship then you have to decide what is best for yourself and your child especially if he is with another woman! Remember don't fight with him physically or verbally it is not worth it and don't let him threaten you about taking your child away because it takes more to being a parent than money!!!!!|`|xcey6CsIaa	move be cool and take him to child support. if he does care he would get back with you for the kid sake.|`|HmbNEmqAaa	Very good.

He's a shallow loser and only cares about himself and not about you or your child. He's very selfish. Try to push him out of your mind and don't worry about him. My advice is to pray.

AA10866651	I think you've answered your own question.  He broke your heart.  He cheated on you.  He lied to you.  He did things behind your back.  He played you for a fool.  This guy is a total loser and he's not worth your time.  You know this, now it's time to accept it and get over him and get on with your life.  You know you deserve better and there are plenty of guys out there who will treat you better.  As badly as this guy has made you feel, you know you don't want him back.  You just hurt right now because you aren't used to being without him.  But you will get passed this and everything will start to feel better soon.|`|3c8a130dcb44c454924a9d0a2d2a2902aa	girl how can u be with a guy like that...think of his bad sides like he cheated on u....u deserve better than tht...u cant take him bak...how can trust him again after he did these things to u...if he did that to me i would never even think about him|`|IAVcOYjbaa	I can honestly say he apparently did not love himself enough to give you the love you deserve. Do not beat yourself up trying to figure out the whys just take it as it is a lesson in love. Belive me the pain will take time to heal but one day you will look at this and realize he may not have been the one. Time and prayer will heal all wounds. I have been there myself and i know now he was not the one for me. But i still think about him from time to time. Keep your head up girl.|`|RVTyFPhOaa	Love is such a subjective term that it would be hard for anyone to say whether or not he really loved you. Clearly, he did not give you the type of love that you wanted from him, and that difference between what he gave and what you wanted is the whole point. Break-ups are painful enough without finding out all the things that the other person did wrong AFTER the fact. That can leave you feeling humiliated and betrayed on top of the pain of losing someone you truly loved. He didn't deserve you!<br>  <br>  Time is the only healthy way to heal your heart.

Yo te lo diré. Es una persona con quien te atreves a ser tú mismo. El no quiere que seas mejor o peor. Cuando tú estás con él te sientes como si fueras un prisionero que acaba de ser declarado inocente. No tienes que estar tenso. Puedes decir lo que piensas, mientras seas realmente tú. él comprende esas contradicciones en tu naturaleza, que lleva a otros a juzgarte mal. Con él respiras libremente. Puedes dejar salir tus peque?as vanidades y envidias, odios y chispas malévolas, tus maldades y absurdos y, al mostrárselas a él, se pierden, al disolverse en el blanco océano de su lealtad. él comprende. No tienes que tener cuidado. Puedes abusar de él, olvidarlo, tolerarlo. Lo mejor de todo es que puedes estar callado con él. No importa. él te quiere. él es como el fuego que quema los huesos. El comprende. Tú puedes llorar con él, reír con él, rezar con él. A través de todo él te ve, te conoce y te ama. ?Un amigo? ?Qué es un amigo? sólo uno, repito, con el que te atreves a ser tú mismo.

AA10215930	From one side, your mom did a mistake when she said she hated you, but I am sure she didn't mean it.  From the other side, take an objective look at yourself, what daughter (or son)  have you been, how do you treat your mom etc. Because from what I noticed, teens here in USA are very spoiled, rude and don't respect their parents at all. Many of them have everything, but they just don't value things parents give them.  Pretty much I was the same when was a teen, and now, looking back I realize how wrong I was and I feel so sorry, and now every time I  try to do something for my parents to relieve my previous mistakes.<br>  Best of luck to you.|`|4004e2dd44d3137c146b69aa16b0af15aa	Well, I'd disown her, personally. However, you may want to just ignore her for a while until she realizes that you don't need her.|`|6HV8BJsoaa	is there a reason y u think she said this?<br>  doesn't matter anyway she should not have said that she hated you. she doesn't mean it though darl...trust me i have heard worse things said by parents to ther kids.<br>  just wait for her to talk to you...that way she will know that what she said really hurt you...and when she tries to talk to you tell her how it made you feel...and that you would like to talk more....<br>  good luck.|`|7XdfTrQ7aa	how old are you (just wondering, since that would be helpful for answering question)<br>  <br>  does it have to do with grades?|`|9ioGK7vWaa	Young Grasshopper...Time will heal all wounds. She still loves you as much as the day you came from her womb.|`|Fza1Zgaiaa	My mother and I used to get into arguments and say things like that quite often...if it helps, what I used to do is just keep out of her way until she pretended like nothing happened... sometimes I would even just ask her a question like nothing was wrong and everything kind of went away...that's not the healthiest thing to do, but it got me through until I moved out... now we're much closer...our problem was that we were too much alike to live under each other each day!|`|HJ5eBpkOaa	I used the hate word when speaking with my teenager.  Very bad.  I was upset and frustrated with his behavior.  behavior which all teens have.  I had a hard time saying I was sorry because I didnt want him to think that I was more wrong than he was, but I was more wrong than he was.  There is no excuse for a parent to use mean hateful upsetting words to their children, NO matter what.  It is abusive.  Now are you behaving the way you should toward your mother?  Behave in a respectful manner at all times.  It doesnt mean that you have to tolerate her bad behavior, you can chose not to somehow but don't feed in, and dont accept her negativity.|`|py7qvJpaaa	probably once you tell her you are sorry for whatever you did, then she will tell you back.|`|0feaf1c170a2a2045c5bed92a8955002aa	Your mother has issue's, sorry.  No mother should ever talk that way to their daughter, she must be jealous, my mother is jealous of me still, so she may never get over it<br>  Good luck|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	well, are you?<br>  What happened that she would say that? OK she shouldn't have said that. But we all only human! go out now, and speak to her nicely later.<br>  Mine died last year. I wish I still had her.<br>  You might be upset, but so is she. Maybe shes going through the menopause too - did you think of that? It's like pre- menstrual tension - but about 100 times worse!|`|4992f4f0132d21c8e9caa0ec0991f0adaa	Your mom is a douche. Time to move out.|`|92a3a0be39f91b827bd6f6fdf62c796eaa	maybe shes on drugs. the reason your mom says these things is becuase her mom priobly said them to her. just ignor it and dont take anything she says personally|`|AA11049365	quit being a  damned brat....love you mother and respect her...you know you only got one mother|`|LJ2OqF1saa	the question is ..... what did you do?  Why is she mad at you? what I would do if I were in your shoes is to ask her why she said those things to you.  I just don't think any mother should say those kinds of things to their child. <br>  <br>  We parents tend to have expectations of our children to just be the best darn kids they can be, to be normal, to be respectful not only to adults but to themselves as well.  We all want our kids to be successful adults and it is for this reason that we discipline you, so that we can help guide you down the right path.  It breaks our hearts when we see that the friends and choices that you are making are sending you down the wrong path, and will not help you in the long run, but only hinder you.  I  would like for you to understand this.....we have been there...gone through the very same things that you are going through and have gone through....nothing changes, except that it becomes more extreme....but the problems are all the same....you cannot understand this until you yourslef become a parent, and see for yourself, that your child is going through the same thing as you did.  Pretend that you are a parent of a daughter....what would you want for your child....if you give it serious thought....you will see that you too want the same thing as your mother wants for you.....But without additional info as to why she is mad at you.....it is hard to know what the whole problem is.

OTHRvbTgaa	Maybe he was a little tired of his gf and needed some distraction. Or just wanted to feel loved by you. Sometimes people want to feel love of other people, even if they don't care about them. To have someone "just in case".<br>  <br>  Try not to take it seriously. If he wants you back, he will do something more obvious. <br>  <br>  And try not to think that you'll always love him. This way you are programing yourself.  Even the deepest feelings can go away one day, and you can meet someone who is right for you|`|LKRuwvYraa	Sounds to me this guy has some issues, I know your situation very well.  Been there done that.  First the guy has separation issues, meaning he can't be alone.  He is probably getting ready to break up with his current and probably trying to find out if your going to be his fall back.  You have to let it be known you will be there as a friend, but i wouldn't go any further than that until he has let go of all strings with his current.  Then if he wants to start a relationship, take it one baby step at a time, or you might be setting yourself up for more hurt.|`|a34e0cf087365f52555b4ec9cfccb8bbaa	There are really many possibilities on why he called you again.<br>  <br>  1. He wants to keep in touch and apologize for the negative way of breaking you two years ago.<br>  <br>  2. He maybe wants you guys to be friends because he thinks he can have a good friendship with you thinking it's better that way.<br>  <br>  3. He might have little feelings for you and maybe just want to hear you out and whats going on to you after the breakup.<br>  <br>  4. He realizes he's wrong and hopes that there is a chance that you feel the same way that he does which is you guys care or love each other until now.<br>  <br>  I guess what I would do is to go with it but do not keep your hopes up because if you do, you'll get hurt. If you later knew he's in a relationship, repect him. If he's not, then go for it.. Just make sure you did what you think is right to do and hopefully it is the right thing to do.|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	Well, did you ask him how he felt? If not I recommending that you ask him just because you do not want to get your feeling hurt and fall in love again all over. He might have had strong feelings for you but could not tell you so he left and separated himself instead. That’s why it’s important that you ask him this time. Maybe he loves you still and just waiting for clues from you.  Just jump in and do it what’s it going to hurt? Good luck!
XJz8KMhqaa	If you really feel that both of you are in love then soon enough both of you will come out and let each ohter know. Waiting is hard but scarying away the one you love is worse. Maybe he just wants to see how things are right now and just apreciate time with you.. If there is a connectioin it want disapear over night. Always be there for him and he'll be there for you. Maybe he's just not ready for any type of major move and that is fine because the longer you have to spend with each other with out strings is good for the both of you. If You can't handle it then you should really tell him how you feel just to get it off your chest. good luck.|`|63e3c89081ee6d1d4fed7ec0d11f81f8aa	I think you should have a big sit down, cards on the table, talk. Tell him what you feel and ask him everything you want to know  - don't be needy or over emotional but factual and honest. Look him in the eye and spill. Good luck! And if he doesn't respond, make sure he know you are serious, you love him, but can't waste any more time over a relationship that is going nowhere|`|78PYQDVLaa	If you want to date him, you're going to have to learn how to talk to him first. Take the drama out of the equation- while your relationship sounds like it has a lot of potential, it's not serious yet (you don't depend on each other) so the worst thing that can happen is you lose a possibility.<br>  <br>  Intimacy issues for men can be a little tough, but it's usually nothing a swift kick in the *** won't fix. Tell him the very least thing you want from him is a promise that he won't see other girls while he's seeing you, and then move on from there into deeper waters: hanging out every weekend, seeing each other's friends every so often, etc. If you never meet any of his friends and he refuses to call you before 7 PM on a Friday? He's probably pretty hopeless, especially if this continues after you speak to him. Be caring, but don't let yourself get played.|`|shBk4NHTaa	Just keep doing the movie thing as friends and don't have ANY physical contact.  He won't be able to stand it after a while and hopefully he'll realize he is in love.|`|4c27e28063700a3960fa200986703581aa	Sounds like he is playing you.  If your giving him anything, form a kiss on up, then I would stop, see if he stays around then. and go from there.|`|e4Stuj0maa	I wouldn′t say you are in love, it′s rather passion than love.<br>  Don′t you think that if he really wanted something serious with you, he would be your boyfriend?<br>  I think he is just using you because he knows that you like him and when ever he want′s, you will be there.<br>  I would say for you to move on, you will meet other people, people who deserves you.<br>  If you really want to go out with him, then go out but don′t involve too much, you will get really hurt and dissapointed. Have fun and don′t take him seriously.

Stop listening to them, listen to yourself, take a day to go somewhere where you don't have to see or hear from them and really think about what you want out of your life.  Do you want a marriage where you are always having to ask if he is cheating?  I know this is harsh, not always true in all men, but once they've cheated, they will do it again.  They can't help it.  If E was going to break up anyway, why did you stay with him?

OqIFYW3raa	The feelings go away when you meet your true soul mate.  A true soul mate is someone that will ADORE you like you adore them.  We don't always fall in love wiht the right people. and i was married to my first husband for 6 years, another 3 before divorce and had 2 boys with him, I thought i'd never get over him. "UNTIL" i decided to move on and try things that i missed doing, I became me again, found myself, not someone else. That leads to rebounding. I started going to the gym, feeling good about myself, having a ladies night out, dating more than one person, becoming very independent and confident in myself again. All along, in the back of my head he was still on my mind. Then, i met my best friend, my true love, the man iv'e alwyas dreamed of having. And we are married now, 2 more kids added to the bunch, and i sit back some days and think, wow, i'm so lucky, so blessed and am SO GLAD that i divorced my first husband or i would have never found my husband jack. Being with jack, i found out what love is really all about. <br>  <br>  So, with you, - just know when you watch these love stories in the movies, and the 'NOTEBOOK" is a good one, i would watch those movies and think, i want that !! and dont' settle for anything less than someone that will treat you like they cant' live without you!! until you find that. just move forward and work on you and find things that you love doing and find the 'YOU" again. and move on. and everytime you start to step back and want to call him or talk about the past or feelings, distract yourself. go to the gym, or call a girlfirend or take the kids to the movies. eventually, you will become stronger and it gets easier!!|`|8jyF7ii0aa	You have been through hell on this and unfortunately that is what will be more prevalent if you two keep going.

My husband has been cheating on me right from the beginning.  I really have no choice since I have 2 children & no good job.  I think of divorce everyday, but I cannot get out.  You are lucky, if you feel you are not compatible, you should leave & not feel guilty.  If you really want to try, you should & be happy about it.  If not move on....|`|pBpBbC8baa	The feelings will get easier over time.  If y'all didn't part on bad terms, maybe you will still be able to be the best of friends.  And maybe someday down the road there will be the chance to get back together.  As far as when you start to feel relief, that is up to you.  It depends on how long you dwell on it.  How long before you start deciding to rediscover who YOU are.  I would suggest maybe getting some counseling or find a support group for divorced parents. With a support group, not only will you be with people feeling alot of the same things you do, but you will also meet alot of great people.  Good luck.|`|db37620222fe9fd836fe702b7a60d8eeaa	you 2 well always be connected on some level but eventually it gets easier. time depends on you as a person for me it took 10 yrs for me to be completely free of feeling ..but i was not married and had no childern with her... but it tooked about 5 yrs and her moving on with anther guy and me with anther women for the healing to realy start..hope that helps|`|oOif6tfhaa	as soon as you find a new or start a new|`|vvX50Of3aa	How can I walked a mile in your shoes, when you don't tell me exactly exactly exactly why you guys are divorcing?<br>  <br>  Did you cheated on him?<br>  Did he cheated on you?<br>  Did you guys fight a lot?<br>  What????<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you guys are divorcing for no reason, it doesn't make sense.|`|099b875af641ee7291824adf37803730aa	i do not think the feelings ever really go away completely , there will always be those days when you think back on things and smile , but in time these feeling will become less often or at least less fierce , and as far as relief goes no one can say for sure how long it will be until that happens you are the only one who can decide that for yourself and it is not going to be easy or quick but it will happen when you are ready to completely let go of the past , by that i mean u will never forget him but , you will be able to mange it better and you can not get over him until you open your heart to someone or something else , the most important thing to know is never give up on love it may find you, good luck.
5rZZr5Vraa	If he has seen you before than that probably means he likes you or really cares about you if he is a close guy friend. But since he asked if it was you in a picture he hasnt seen you before? Then he's giving it a chance and hoping that you are prettier and probably want to see where you too can go.|`|AA11699190	he thinks you are hot but is too shy to say it!|`|sZdGILd0aa	HE MIGHT THINK YOUR PRETTY.|`|18b9c78a975f7c06edcf4aac14e12913aa	probably exactly what he said.

He obviously thinks you are the more attractive one.|`|AA11025973	He thinks your pretty:) But probably didnt know how to say it|`|IilPT7VNaa	he likes you
085bd5758dd2f9686aa2760800304c71aa	If you knew where he used to work you can try there they might have known where he went after he left or at least know his last name. If you know any of his family or friends from back then you can check with them. If he rented a place you can check with the landlord and see if he remembers them at least the last name or might know where he went. Best of luck!

Oy1BTxbJaa	It doesn't matter how young or old you are - if somone forgets your birthday - it hurts. And you are allowed to be upset about this. I would be too and I'm 27! It's a shame that he hasn't put any effort into your birthday. Maybe he's planning a surprise for the weekend?<br>  I'm sorry you've had a dissapointing day! But Happy Birthday anyway!! Many HAPPY returns!|`|oJO5Eohfaa	What did you do for his??<br>  Try getting some of the romance back it's not dead unless you let it die !!<br>  Us blokes always take things forgranted so make him suffer a little with this he should make more effort!!|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	You both need to work on that relationship....and not just at birthday times.<br>  If it worth having, it is worth working at.|`|AA11608825	I would go get some sexy lingerie. Put it on tomorrow night and see what he does.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the romance does die, but why is it always up to the man to bring it back? Try doing some little things, like "hot" love notes in his wallet or lunch. Just see what happens. <br>  It sounds like you need a little something to get the spark back and then need to have heart to hearts at least every week to keep it going.<br>  I know the romance feels dead around here when my husband and I don't talk. So we try to talk about things everyday, even if they are stupid, just keep it going. <br>  It's really sad when a marriage turns into roommates. There was a reason you guys got married, try and find that reason again!|`|XgLcxI2Waa	Happy Birthday! I can relate to your story. One B-day my (ex)husband starting eating my cake before I had even seen it.That was the year he got me the "Happy Birthday Nephew" card. Find a good time and have a  heart to heart with him about how you feel. Good luck.|`|grMruaLYaa	First of all, Happy Birthday! and many happy returns of the day! <br>  Second, this is your day, so enjoy it and make the most of it just for yourself, in spite of everything. <br>  For me my birthdays always come with a mixture of happiness and at the same time, some sadness. So like everything else in this life, nothing is ever perfect, no matter how much you expect from it, you just learn to take it as it is. <br>  As for your ungrateful husband, he is the one who is selfish, not you. Pay him back by ignoring him on his birhday, that will teach him right.|`|cf8c5482b3f8dd3d9fce6b24aac65773aa	He could be bored. Ive been in my relationship for 5 years and you need to keep things interesting. Any relationshp will go stale if you dont do tings to keep it interesting and that includes birthdays. Especially if you've been together a while, There's only so much jewellery you can buy a girl!! Sit down and tell him how you feel Have you been doing things to make him feel special?
a5a69ee90199701a57e09861dd53c661aa	Don't get attached until he tells you that he has feelings for you. He could very well be doing all that stuff because he has strong feelings for you at that very moment. He could have lost interest by the next day. You never know. You can't judge how someone feels about you after one night. Talk to him about it...|`|cciB0SmBaa	When a person makes you feel good you feel good both inside and out. It doesn't matter whether someone is in love with you or not. If two people spend three hours with each other, it stands to reason that they are enjoying themselves and both couples are happy. It seems your friend enjoys your company very much and is willing to show you just how much by hanging around and not just picking up and leaving after everything is over.<br>  <br>  It also shows 'me' that you, too, returned the pleasure he was steadily giving you. Don't mix love with feelings. There is a feeling of love, a feeling of happiness, a feeling of pleasure, and a feeling of security. Many many more, but these are just a few. I feel you're very lucky to have a friend you can be intimate with who will show you he has honest intentions toward your coupling. <br>  <br>  Remember this: There is such a thing as 'To Much Of A Good Thing.' Don't fall in a rut time after time with this sexual thing. Do other things and let the raging harmones slow down a bit. See how he acts when there is actually NO SEX involved when you're both together. This is how people actually get to know one another. <br>  <br>  I wish you happiness...|`|03c0e43a5791089c760711e822733fa3aa	no , in the first place I wouldn't have SEX ,unless I have feelings for her .|`|DlZJEvhFaa	If I guy didn't have romantic feelings for you, he would not do any of what you wrote about. It would be wham bam, and then, he would fall asleep because he didn't care. I don't think you have a problem, unless you want him not to care? Good luck.|`|LuSOWbrfaa	You just slept with the guy....he's going to tell you what you want to hear....he got what he wanted.|`|PSoItwfXaa	he's a keeper sounds like you found a guy that is crazy for you. honey this guy has emotion written all over him stay true to yourself and to him,and you will have a great relationship.|`|TOfI8iGlaa	-no guys don't do this unless they care--I roll over and let her sleep in the wet spot,if I don't care--From your "read" you sound as if a guy could care for you--good luck kid|`|2m1XgdEPaa	He definitely has feelings for you. Guys who don't tend to detach after sex.|`|RwLAmFB1aa	he most definatly has feelings for you !!!!<br>  i can not stress that any more!<br>  must be a really good guy<br>  i wish you the best|`|ff71dbb31b43751d4200dcce980fc5fbaa	Yes, it sounds like he has feelings for you. Because if he didn't we wouldn't go out of his way to cuddle and stuff afterwards.|`|gHHb4GI6aa	I dont think that any guy should do that if he doesnt have feelings- that will be the way he expresses his love for you. Make sure you both know how you feel about each other and maybe you could have a good relationship!<br>  Good luck!

AA11434429	well it's worked for a lot of people i know, using yahoo personals and similar sites. i wouldn't do it until you at least 18 though. i got mixed up with a lot of online people when i was too young to be a good judge of character, and feel really silly when i think about how bad things could have turned out. luckily i chose not to meet them at the last minute, but at this point in my life, i am quite confident that those people were not who they said they were. i have, however, met a nice man on eharmony now that i am 27, and we've been together almost a year. my advice is to be smart and wait. there are a lot of horror stories, and a lot of people who seek women online are after sex. be careful.|`|AA11354259	yeah, i hate to be blunt, but chances are he'll be 40 and very perverted. Try for somebody in the real world.

This is a toughie. Good luck!
N8T1qSZdaa	You need to figure out how you feel.  Don't mess with someone else until you know how you feel.  It wouldn't be fair.  Put yourself in the new guys shoes...would you want some guy trying to start a relationship with you, and he wasn't sure if he was still in love is his old girlfriend?  Get things settle in your heart and mind before you move on.|`|AA12316977	invite them both out and tell them that you ever is left standing after their duel you will worship until you meet somebody stronger, richer and better looking.  go for it!|`|D0ds8HChaa	I agree - you should figure out how you feel about your ex, and then move from there. If you like this new guy, and think that you would make a great couple, let him know you just got out a relationship and your still working thru the break-up. Be honest! Ask him if he'll have the patience to take it slow with you at the begining, and that you'll let him know when you're 100% ready to take the new relationship to a new level.
0abca33adb12687632da5c0960075834aa	Just tell them to their faces. Be like "You guys/girls are some of the best friends I could have but you'll are drive me crazy.

You will get someone who is on the outside of this thing that is going on with your family and you may see it in a better light and you have someone that is there for you .|`|wMR0LoTOaa	sweety speak up. you need to sit her down and explain to her but you need to be reasonable. don't take things out on her lose your frustration else where. But mainly be her friend and explain things. Go out and have a day alone with eachother to catch up and figure things out. My best guess is yes its on you because you're letting it fall and you know it so you're kind of siting back and watching it happen so step up sweety and talk to her, and try to hatch things up she may even be able to help out with the problems at home.

sp0rx2muaa	you gotta give him a dose of his own medicine....treat him the way he treats you and see if he likes it...|`|fcfd8d2df710804744b59418fa9d6f26aa	Trust is the number one thing that has to be in a relationship. But right now, who are you hurting more by not letting it go. I am not saying he was right, because he was not, but I think you are only hurting yourself by dwelling on it. Your feelings of not forgetting are probably correct in the sence that you will "never" be able to "fully" trust him any more. Plus, once a liar, always a liar !  So, my advice to forget, is to probably "forget" him.|`|y5WzW54Naa	This same type situation happened to my little sister.  Listen, honey, the guy is who he is and he will do it again.  It is part of his nature.  You also have to face the fact that he may be living a double life...meaning that the reason he didn't want to be seen with you out and about at the fair is because there was another girl he is seeing and the probability of her being there was very high.  He wanted to avoid a mess loosing both girls.  Guys (especially immature guys) throw fits to take the focus off of their guilt and project it onto you, leaving you standing there feeling bad that you even brought it up to begin with.  Don't fall for it. <br>  The remedy that we came up with was to show up at the same place (my sister/brother/and I) that the jerk was going to.  BUSTED...and there was no way out of it.  Keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open.  You'll get to see a lot more of the true person that way.  Sorry this is happening to you.
lhtkkQvnaa	Hun, im sorry..but no matter how much you think you like him..he has GOT to go. Any guy that would treat you so disrespectfully, and even hurt you..doesnt deserve you. You deserve someone who cares about you, and your problems (job). They have to love you for the ups and the downs (job). Its not right what hes doing, as a girl, i understand you want time with your man, and if hes not willing to give you some loving every once and a while...then you shouldnt be willing to keep up the relationship. Good luck hun, stay strong!
OHS5lG1Raa	For me it didn't work, but that certainly doesn't mean that it won't work for you.  I would ask yourself a few questions first, do you get along well enough to not have any problems like a lover's spat at work, or what if you were to break up would you still be ok working there with him and if it would cause any problems in the area of personal space the being able to get away from each other sometimes
5ZHHZDhBaa	the first thing to remember is its just high school having already been through it, i can tell you its not as important as you think. groups are mearly a front in most cases as everyone in them may be posing a front bc their afraid to show who they really are. dont change who you are, use what your strongest personality traits are like if your good at making jokes then have your friends walk by him with you and make a joke to see if he laughs or not. that might grab his attention. remember if he is a jerk then stay away. im attracted most to a girls personality, looks are second to me. dont ever change who you are to try to attract one guy and dont be so focused on him bc there are probably 5 guys behind you that are to scared to tell you they like you. your not desperate its a crush, dont give up until you know one way or the other even if your afraid of what you might learn about him.|`|01f1aa0ce2dca7a3ad43c6ac782be592aa	I know how it feels to have a crush, but dont ever make a guy think hes more than what he really is. if you like him maybe you should give it a try, cause at the end you can either say he was a nice person or you can say he was a jerk like your friends say. you'll really never know until you take that step and go for it. remember opposites attract, so who knows..maybe being from two different kind of groups is a good thing. the only thing I have to say is, dont ever go out of your way to make a guy notice you, your just as good as he is. maybe you can get one of your friends to apprach him for you and ask him what he thinks about you. its so hard trying to get the attention of one guy when theres tons of other girls probably trying to do the same thing, I just say take a chance and go for it!|`|AA11708680	u gotta ignore ur loser friends and approach this boi, get his number so u can talk to him|`|IsCnl0boaa	you should never give up if you want him to notice you then give him careds and presents maybe even love notes thats what i would do|`|0oOrX0diaa	well, just becuz he is in a different group of people doesnt mean u can say hi to him or talk to him. be aggresive! act like you are the prettiest girl in the room and just walk up to him and introduce urself and talk to him! if its meant to be then it will happen! the worst that will happen is that he wont like u in that way. u dont know wat will happen. hope this helps! good luck!
AA11143597	people in general are never satisfied with what they have.  It's human nature.|`|AA12296157	Because there's too many tarts out there who are desperate and willing to give them anything they want.|`|7cc42CSZaa	The guys that work hard to have the things they have --- are satisfied.

If a boy tells you that he does not like you and then continues to be nice to you, I think he has a problem. It may well be just immaturity however, I would be careful of continuing in this relationship as I feel that it is going nowhere. I suggest you look for a boy who will love you with his heart. You will know it when you find it my dear, it is certainly worth looking for and I hope you find it. - Peter|`|AA12255171	The thing is, if he liked you enough he'd ask you out. He'd bust out with all the confidence he has and make a move. If he's too "chicken" then your not important enough for him to put all his fears aside.<br>  <br>  With that being said.  Since your close friends your going to have to talk to him about it.|`|Xm2k3Oaoaa	He doesn't like u....hes just bein nice cuz dats how friendz r|`|AA10051908	Ohhh yes baby!!!!

I had a similar expereince with a friend.  Perhaps Jeremy is still in the closet...|`|px5jRFYTaa	Well if you have the courage ask your very best friend to go over to him and ask him if he likes you. But if he says NO then just move on or try to make him jealous by flirting with other boys.|`|x8ZTIHxOaa	He could just like you as a friend.  My guy friend is best friends with a girl and is always sitting next to her and touching her (again, not in a gross way), but he doesn't like her as more than friends at all.  Of course, he could like you but not want to jeopardize your friendship again.
f4b7111936f44eb6dba7bb72447b3838aa	Sounds like he is getting a little attached and doesn't want show it or admit.  One thing for sure is that if he REALLY liked you he would not be putting so many excuses... That's just a cover up not to get serious with you.  Define what you really want out of him, a serious relationship or a close friend?  If you want a relationship have a serious talk and tell him how you feel.  Ask him if YOU should trust HIM with your heart! Demand only truth.

He needs help.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cnwIpUPbaa	You and your brother should beat the **** out of this stepdad!!NO JOKE! YOU DONT HIT WOMEN .Period.
x5445f2Eaa	That's a tough one. Is it her little brother? A lot of big siblings are very protective of their younger brothers and sisters and will not like it if ANYONE hooks up with them. Maybe she thinks it would be a little weird if whenever you went on a date and wanted to talk about it you'd be telling her how good a kisser her brother was, etc.<br>  <br>  You should try and figure out exactly why your friend doesn't want you to like her brother. Would she be jealous of your time? Is she being protective? Does she think that you will hurt him? It is not unheard of for people to date their friend's siblings (hey, it happened on the show Friends!), but I've definitely heard of it causing issues.<br>  <br>  One problem that you will face is that if you were to "choose" the brother it would probably be very weird for you to ever go over to his house because your ex-friend would be there. <br>  <br>  One way to think about it... you already know that you have your best friend's friendship, and you have no idea how a relationship with the brother would go. Why give up a sure-thing for something that might not ever happen or might end after a few months? Friends usually stick around longer than boyfriends. <br>  <br>  I hope you and your friend find peace and happiness.|`|3jA3kQNaaa	Dont choose. Tell ur friend that u really like him and that u cant choose. If she's a real friend she'll understand but if she aint then kick her 2 da curb.|`|usm3HpG3aa	if she is truly our best friend i would not do anything to change that. find someone else to have a crush on.

Give it to her and say something like,   I like this scent, I thought you might like it too.  She might not get your real hint but she might just use it because you like it.|`|tgAiOURaaa	aaaaah i had a friend like this in high school! she smelt horrible. we'd give her signs and i mean people that didn't know her would walk by her and go UGH! and plug their nose. she still didn't get the point. it was so bad that teachers were going to get our guidance counselor to talk to her about it. she still, to this day, smells. even though i only graduated last year, but still! i feel your pain! esp. the riding in the car deal, miserable. it's hard though, because you don't want to hurt their feelings.|`|1W5Z32tGaa	I wish I had an answer for you (I know, why bother typing).  It's a tough situation.  She may not know she stinks, some people can't smell themselves.  She might be okay with you mentioning it depending on your relationship with her.  But she might get offended and embarrassed at first, but then try to do something about it unless it's just a bad problem she can't fix.<br>  <br>  I know your probably feel like saying "what kind of deodorant do you use....cause it's not really working.|`|e1a508e632bfb228c04d105ccc2adbb1aa	Try telling her in inadvertently. Sometimes using the indirect approach to such a sensitive situation, and letting the person see for themselves is always a good route. (Plus, you can avoid hurting your friend's feelings too badly)<br>  <br>  Say Something Like This:<br>  <br>  "Hey, let me get your advice on something: I have this really nice friend, and I really like hanging out with her. The problem is, her body odor is kind of offensive, but I don't want to hurt her feelings...What do you think is a SENSITIVE way of letting her know so that I won't lose friendship with her?"<br>  <br>  Then she'll tell you her answer...<br>  <br>  ...and now you know what to say to her. <br>  <br>  Good Luck....|`|eqdtE1Hfaa	I think you'll have to tell her if you are going to hang around her. Or you'll have to get used to the smell. If she's your good friend, it will be uncomfortable, but that will pass.|`|shBk4NHTaa	You need to gently tell her.  Maybe say - I am telling you this as a friend because I don't want you to be embarrassed, I know you are a clean person and take care of yourself but for some reason lately I have noticed you have body odor.  I think you should go and see a doctor because it could be a medical condition or something. <br>   This way you aren't telling her she is dirty, you're letting her know that you're concerned and that you don't want her to be embarassed.
BcVux7a2aa	Just notice if he treats you differently from the other girls, you said that he does the "Object taking" thing to lots of other girls. But what about you? Does he treat you in a different manner from time to time?<br>  <br>  Guys (like me) usually like to mess around with girls..... But the one I DO LIKE, im usually shy to her. But i keep my interest on her.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Uh........that's  kinda  childish,  isn't  it?  Scold  him.  Tell  him  to  "Stop  It!!!   NO!!  Wail,  "Oh  Nooooooooooo!"  Does  he  like  you?  I  don't  know,  for  sure,  but  he  sure  likes  to  "get  cha  goin...."  doesn't  he.  I  guess  his  teasing  makes  him  feel  powerful  over  you.  The  way  he  does  it.....taking  your  stuff  across  the  room  like  that.  Makes  him  feel  powerful.  Also,  I'd  guess  that  he  likes  you  to  scold  him  when  he  does  it,  seems  he  likes  to  exasperate  you,  as  long  as  he  can  get  away  with  it.  He'll  settle  down  eventually,  I  suppose.|`|d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	He definitely likes you because he gives you attention. However, it is possible he likes the other girl also. You should take steps towards a relationship if you want him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
utc17ps9aa	I'm sorry that you found out your boyfriend hasn't been faithful- I know how much it hurts. The best thing to do is to walk away. You shouldn't have to settle for less and there are men out there who will treat you better and give you the love, respect and attention you deserve.<br>  <br>  It's not an easy thing to walk away from someone who care so much about.  Of course you can also stay with him. In this case, you will always be suspicious and if he does cheat again, you have to share him with another woman. Some women do it because they rather be with the man and deal with the nonsense than be without him. But this isn't healthy and it certainly can't be safe (STD wise).<br>  <br>  If you were my sister I would tell you to leave him. Once a cheater always a cheater.  I doubt it was a mistake because he was having an "affair" and this suggests an ongoing relationship with another woman. It wasn't a one time thing and it wasn't an "accident". There are decent men out there and you can deal with this. Keep busy, go out, volunteer, pick up a new hobby, hang out with family and friends; these things will fill up the void and the extra time so you wouldn't have to call him.<br>  <br>  We've all been there but there the women who stay and the women who refused to be disrespected in such a manner. I hope you decided to move on because you deserve so much better.|`|tf8Le20Maa	I'd dump him or tell him that unless he stops seeing her you WILL dump him. One or the other. Good luck.|`|TNG7KwMmaa	have an affair of your own , nothing will hurt him more than that. preferably with his friend.
QmXFYNNcaa	If they like having strong gfs, then it's hott. But if they like to be the tough guys, who like girls who are feeble so they can protect them, then they wouldn't like it. Personally, I think it's great, but I'm a girl, so....|`|0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	I dont think that matters.  Some girls are very fit, pretty and they box.  If the girl is a manly and does boxing that is not so attractive.  Boxing is a hobby just like karate.|`|d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	It really depends on how she looks. The fact that a girl box doesn't concern me. I mean pretty and slim girls box too. So it definitely depends on the individual girl.|`|J7mSnQPpaa	I think ANYONE who boxes has oatmeal for brains, and if they dont yet, they eventually will.|`|W3HQwrgBaa	I love boxing, but not when ir's girls!

If he's past 35, it gets a little difficult, I would think!|`|HR6xbrbBaa	Its not nice to look at. Perhaps people may think she's your mother or aunt.  You would be a laughing stock among your peers and friends.  Can you bear it?  On the other hand, if you love her, why mind other people? If you think you will be happy to go on dating with that woman why not.  In love age doesn't matter.|`|ysozrpP1aa	no mybe a few years older but twice the age would be odd
iuvSvzBOaa	If you really would choose the friendship over the relationship, I would say ride it out and see what happens, but try not to think about it too much, because you don't want to be distracted when your all hanging out.|`|4HSuZLFtaa	Monica.  First, you look like me with glasses and probably 15 years younger...Second, saying "her" and "she" is not taboo if that is the case.  Most normal people will give the same answer whether you like a boy or a girl.  I think the answer depends on how old you are.  If, you are  under 18, I would suggest that you enjoy your friendship and your crush without revealing it yet.  You seem a bit immature and unsure of what you would do if this person actually did like you back. I think you need a few years to find yourself.  If you are over 18 (which I doubt), you can bring up the subject of your feelings when you two are alone, but be prepared.  You might lose a friend.    Good luck.  Crushes are fun...relationships are not always fun.|`|53r3KVHMaa	Just tell him|`|Z6TEop1faa	ask him! i did that with my best friend and we went out, we are broken up now but we are still best friends|`|3jA3kQNaaa	Just tell him it might be hard but let it out or else it will make u crazy|`|d3e2516104aac354bbafbb9eff805486aa	oooh.... i've delt with this in life alread y.. okay . when telling a friend you have feelings for them . . its a chance you have to take .. becuz after i was told i couldnt look  the person anymore the same .. after that i just started to like cover myself up .. but if you think the like you too .. then start a conversasion ... a long one too .. once you like pass 15-20 mins . then slowy start bringing in like '' when was the last time you hads a crush'' or ..''do u like someone '' something to start...
2hyP31E9aa	Start little, say your cooking dinner and you need some spices or somthing that if the meal didnt have it would still taste good but if you had the spice it would taste better, tell your partner "hey can you pick up this ingredient for dinner?" she picks it up great do little things like that eventually move it up a little more to things that are of greater importance, feed the dogs at a certain once or twice then eventually tell your partner your going to count on them the dogs will be fed every day at a certain time. Things like that build trust and when your partner is in dire need give them your word you will be there or  you will pickup whatever they need and drop it off, it will require some..going the extra mile so to say to show you can step up to the plate|`|2d9E29EPaa	Well.. I think.. theres still some doubts in the relationship.. so maybe the best way is to sit down and talk about everything you guys are hidding from each other or issues that might have been troubling both of you..

6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	No a shotgun is the same thing as smoking the actual thing, nothing different. Sometimes a person will not even catch contact from a shotgun it is not any big deal. However, if your thinking this is a big step down instead of smoking weed, no it the same thing and if you happen to take a drug test you will still fail and you still can be arrested for it so my point just don’t neither.|`|ZF8qSNEKaa	I have never heard of this, sorry. I tried pot a few times back in the day, but I didn't like it. The paranoia was too much for me.|`|jP3gNHdHaa	I tried doing a shotgun once.<br>  My pee pee got stuck in the barrell.<br>  And it was loaded.<br>  And the safety was off.<br>  <br>  never do that again.
3259d7fcc72545f67e78fa6dc2b97998aa	Way too much avoidance going on... Give her space...|`|YyMLMUYFaa	Wow... um.... Id ask her what is up. She sounds like she is doing a lot of thinking and not sure about stuff... so in turn shes avoiding you.<br>  I wouldnt push the issue though. Do something little... try to hold her hand like normal, or hug her.... if she pushes away or denies you then ask her "whats wrong?"<br>  Women can sometimes feel a lot of things after having sex with somebody. Especially regret.. and even more especially with a friend they werent really to have sex with yet. Right now that feeling may be greater than the feeling of continuing what you two had. Sex changes things.<br>  But no need for you to be left in the dark. Take the initiative... call her and ask her why she didnt call to check on you when you were sick like she used to. If she continues to avoid it or doesnt answer you, then give her space. Pushing when someone is pushing back is not gonna help the relationship at all. <br>  If shes a true friend she'll come around or at least talk to you about whats going on and how shes feeling.|`|18b981b6a093bad168e13353eec4efddaa	Maybe she's afraid that you're expecting sex again or feels pressured to continue from where you left off that night. Of course she is going to be confused though... You guys went from being so close and so sure about what you were and what you wanted to just complete and utter confusion. It might have been different if she could atleast remember what happened that night. Right now the matter at hand is just miscommunication, or lack of conversation I should say. Neither one of you know how to approach the situation but the only people who have control of it are you and her. You guys know eachother so well, theres nothing to worry about. I definitely think you need to ask her if you can talk one day after school, and just be completely honest. Tell her how you feel, tell her how things changed, why things changed, what you want.. Let her know there's no pressure to decide what you want to do about the two of you, that you really just needed to talk about things and clear the air because there was a lot of unspoken tension between the two of you. And then just take things from there depending on what was said in your conversation with her. Good Luck with everything.|`|9dbb6e56765e243d23f03441a7364f9caa	okay...................... move on dude!!!!!!!!!!!!! there is another girl watching you.......look over your shoulder and you will see her standing there.|`|YyYBv5bzaa	I would just talk to her and see if she still wants to be friends or not.

yfkcrn2faa	Its time to get away from him. If he is happy, let him be happy with who he chose from the beginning. If you were meant to be, you would already be together. The children deserve the chance to be in a happy home. With both parents. If he was unhappy, it would be a different story. The best way to deal with it is always be a friend if possible, but keep your distance as much as you can,|`|703018bd039c69163923e8186ed44a20aa	I am not going to lecture you, as it's not my place to do so, and  I don't think there's any need. You clearly stated that you are not going to get further involved with this guy. Telling yourself to ''just get over it'' isn't much cop, as you can't help how you feel. You can, however, decide how to act (or how not to act) on those feelings - and I think you are DEFINITELY doing the right thing by not starting an affair. As you've said, it would most likely lead to a great deal of heartache all round, particularly as there are young kids involved.<br>  <br>  I feel for you, having been in a very similar situation. Like you, I didn't do anything about it because it would have been wrong to do so.There's no easy or pain free solution, and this is going to be tough, but if your friendship is developing into so much more, you need to back off NOW before it gets any deeper - you don't want to take the risk of anything happening that shouldn't. It is horribly difficult, but you need to stay away from him. That's what I did, as  I couldn't live with myself if I had played any part in destroying a marriage and a family. Although I don't think these feelings will ever go away, I know that I've done the right thing.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way: you don't need to start an affair. What you have is perfect, in a way. You're very close, you clearly care for one another (albeit too much), and you have a good friendship. As you will never be together, you'll never mess it up, you won't hurt one another, you won't lose what you have.  So bear that in mind, keep your distance, and concentrate on your own relationship at home and your career. Let him concentrate on being the family man that he is.  Be strong.<br>  <br>  I admire your honesty, and I respect your straightforward approach and your refusal to become a 'homewrecker'.  You've done nothing wrong here and no reason to feel guilty. If more people showed such integrity and selflessness, the world would be a better place.|`|abf01838f7f56e56f12a1a1b38b3eab9aa	You need to find another job,if you don't you'll both end up messing up your and your partners' lives not to mention the children's.Get away from this situation and stay away,he doesn't belong to you.

oBQcc3kjaa	I doubt he's toying with you. To me, he does seem like he's insecure about himself. Its hard to end a long term relationship and overcoming it may take a while. I know it may seem hard to talk with him sometimes but be truthful to him. Sit down talk and tell him how your feeling and get him to do the same. The truth may hurt but its better than beating around the bush. It sounds like you caught him on the rebound so don't let go of him if you truely like him.

He wants to be back together with his ex and if that does not work out he wants to start a relationship with you.<br>  <br>  He probably likes you a lot, but since he recently got out of the long term relationship he probably still has feelings for this other woman.  Even though they are broken up he still has some emotional attachment to her.  This does not mean he is not totally into you.   In fact, I bet he really into you since he keeps you around otherwise he would have let you go already.  <br>  <br>  What this probably all means is he still has the feelings for his ex and because of that he does not feel right starting something new with you until those feelings have gone away.  He will continue to find out if he and his ex will get back together, and until then you are second in line.  It sounds bad, but its hard to let you're previous love go.  <br>  <br>  He is probably thinking its not fair to you and its not fair to him if a relationship was to start while still having feelings for his ex.  He wants to keep you in his life until he knows what exactly will happen with his ex.  Be careful, if things dont work out with the ex you could be the rebound girl, but many people do marry the rebound girl.

When I told a girl that I liked her, I was the one being surprised because she told me that she already knew that I liked her and was waiting for me to ask her out.|`|566509871e205408ba33e1df9563bef1aa	No. Just do it already.|`|CgI7JAmdaa	It sounds like she does but even if she doesnt, ask her out.
L51iKPpyaa	I dont think its wrong if there is a five year age difference. it is only wrong if you dont like him back. Just dont let him get any ideas.....|`|tvvnCgnJaa	Not relay there isn't much of an age gap and it sounds like you've known him a while so it should be OK for you to go out wiv him but be careful!
d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	Definitely yes, if you are in middle school.<br>  <br>  Maybe, if you are older than 15.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|65977b8d89744690ec12afb0cba6c010aa	yes its called how girls flirt when the stare|`|VnduoyzDaa	Have you asked yourself if you like her?

AA12095283	Weird,play around with his wart.Does he let you play to.Anyway he seems to be the best available
QXL1mY1paa	i think that its a big problem if you're not physically attracted to someone AT ALL. you do have a little leverage with the pretty face, but that will only last you for so long. maybe go out on a few more dates..not a lot though cause she might get realllllyyy hooked on you. if you still aren't attracted to her tell her right away cause you dont want to keep leading her on. <br>  it really isn't being shallow because you dont go up to people you think are ugly in a club or a bar! you go up to people you're attracted to.|`|1Q15uZbvaa	if you really like her you will see her beyond her physical looks, and besides its not her body your gonna be with its the whole her|`|AA12126640	WHY WOYULD YOU GO ON A DATE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS NOT HOT???

AsIjdNdmaa	It's possible to "believe" that, sure...But in my experience, a good relationship cannot be based upon good sex...Good sex is a part of a good relationship, but has never been a foundation of one...Really getting to know- and like- someone has...........|`|0b5a56782995bbba12d4a4575376a75baa	NO!!!|`|888307711a0f8df234d14e9a6b86fc5eaa	of course, sex is a huge part of the relationship.|`|AeAwgUE8aa	Yes!

d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	I like it when girls make the first contact. However, if you really like a guy, then don't flirt with him and every other guy around him at the same time.

d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	You should talk to him and be yourself. You can find out what he likes to do, from your brother, and talk to the boy about those things. You want to do what ever you want to do only when your brother is not around the boy because things get complicated whenever a sibling gets involved.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|236fa8b17b2e712b041b02b3bd28f04caa	Dress really great, I mean wear something mind blowing! Then hang out around them and flirt suggestively, compliment the little things, but dont try so hard because that'll make you look kind of desperate|`|IZYBKPsUaa	compliments, questions and personals<br>  <br>  <br>  i always like it when a girl that i like talks to me, and ask things about me, and tells me about her<br>  <br>  <br>  it gives you a feel for the person.
d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	The best thing for you to do is to talk to your boyfriend about how you feel. You may gain insights into your relationship after a talk with him. In addition, you should calm down and not make any rash decisions.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you|`|PyaXTpFdaa	Go with your feelings and don't worry about how much hurt is in a 2 wk affair.

AA11391968	Perhaps you should talk to the person and tell them that you need to hear the words "I love you" or "I need you" because it feels good.  People can be afraid to say too much because it may not be received well.  Work on the communication calmly.|`|AA11835699	Rather than telling us about it, tell them. They probably don't know how you feel because you don't tell them what they need to know.

5bbhqthYaa	one word conceited! What a bore......<br>  Honey, life has a way of throwing curve balls, where will you be then,  thinking that you have the world in your hands and finding out how little you really know? The world is a melting pot. It is those negative experiences, which give us a chance to grow, learn, and become stronger. To enjoy life and gain wisdom, we must face life "the good and the bad".|`|4D021FeQaa	It is probably not ok. It is not very healthy to have no friends even though you are happy now. Friends are not to be disposed of or not sought out because you don't need them. Friends help with life.|`|Y6K8S1zhaa	You should sit with some people at lunch and forget about it. Even though you are happy with a boyfriend. You should still socialize. <br>    I was the same way in school but now that I think back I think I should have talked and been more open to people. <br>    Just be friendly that is all. <br>    Separating yourself becomes lonely and isolated. Dont be a princess alone in a castle. Get down with the people and be real and be happy. Dont make the mistake I made.|`|5c4105a4e33dafefe6d451fd19cc9e96aa	You're an introvert, and you can't really help being that way. However, if you really do want to stop being so closed in, it starts within yourself. There's a difference between WANTING to make friends, or HAVING to make friends because you have to. If you keep telling yourself that you have everything that a girl could want and that you don't need anything else, you'll refrain yourself from going out there and being more social. Don't think of the negative things about people so often. Sure, there are cruel people out there, but aren't your family and boyfriend people as well? If they can be nice, so can other people. Good luck!

nCw3yTRjaa	I think that is  a great idea! And it's something they can always have and get use out of.

fXKu0kwIaa	Some people feel that variety is the spice of life.  They have everything they want in a relationship, but don't exercise restraint when faced with temptation.  <br>  <br>  It's flattering when someone attractive to you is attracted and available to you.  You don't want to hurt your mate (and figure you won't if they don't find out) and that you having fun with someone else doesn't deprive your mate of any love/attention.  In some ways it may even HELP your relationship because you'll feel better about yourself by having your ego stroked. <br>  <br>  There is just something magical about that first kiss or that first caress.  Romance and sex with your long-time partner is good, but it's hard to beat the excitement of experiencing a new partner.  You can suppress the urge to cheat, but some people are just so irresistible that you can be overcome.  You want to do the right thing, but you like the feeling of being wanted and want to make sure you still have the touch.|`|589dad13e8b4a4c5ae80009da5d441e3aa	I dont know but thats messed up!

If a girl asks out a guy, it is more than likely he will accept.  You may not realize it, but girls hold the power in deciding whether or not to go out with a guy.  If a guy doesn't want to go out, he can persuaded otherwise.  Not quite as easy for a girl.  Guys have to prove themselves worthy of a female's attention.  Females really have little to prove.

Cuando el aburrimiento había bostezado por tercera vez, la locura les propuso: “?Vamos a jugar a las escondidas!”...<br>  <br>  ... Cuando la locura contaba 999,999, el amor aún no había encontrado un sitio para esconderse, pues todos se encontraban ocupados... hasta que divisó un rosal y, enternecido, decidió esconderse entre sus flores....La locura terminó de contar y los fue encontrando a todos, pero sólo el amor no aparecía por ningún sitio...<br>  <br>  ... Entonces la locura tomó una horquilla y comenzó a mover las ramas, cuando, de pronto, un doloroso grito se escuchó. Las espinas habían herido los ojos del amor. La locura no sabía qué hacer para disculparse: lloró, rogó, imploró, pidió perdón, y hasta prometió ser su lazarillo. <br>  <br>  Desde entonces, desde que por primera vez se jugó a las escondidas en la tierra, se dice que el amor es ciego y que la locura siempre lo acompa?a..." <br>  <br>  Esta es la leyenda que explica la célebre frase "el amor es ciego". Muchos la utilizan medio en broma, medio en serio, cuando se trata de hablar de alguien que se ve muy enamorado y no repara en los defectos o fallas del o la amada. <br>  Y claro, hasta ahora sólo nos basábamos en esta leyenda, cuya frase final dio la vuelta al mundo. Pero...?atención!... porque el amor podría realmente ser ciego. No sólo el amor de romance, sino tambien el que sientes por un recién nacido o por tu madre, padre, hermanos o amigos. Y, obviamente, por tu pareja. <br>  <br>  Lo anterior fue comprabado por un grupo de científicos británicos de la University College London (UCL), quienes realizaron una serie de tomografías en los cerebros de madres jóvenes mientras miraban a sus bebés, y en los de personas que observaron imágenes de sus amantes. El resultado fue el mismo: en ambos casos los cerebros se "encendieron" de la misma forma.|`|dGO3bSWVaa	dicen que el amor es ciego porque el amor amor no se enamora de cosas ke ve..... si te enamoras de un fisico o de un color de piel o de ojos entonces no es amor hasta ke te enamores de sus sentimientos, su forma de pensar, su caracter osea cosas ke no ves.... por eso se dice ke es ciego :)<br>  <br>  TU OPINION ES IMPORTANTE PARA MI!! :)<br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlZm0XyT4guXg2VRZmTEsROY8gt.?qid=20070708011146AAbyqLC">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|47ede859cfd688c61d8d3fbcfc1e06f5aa	Es ciego cuando uno se niega a ver lo que es evidente para otros, por ejemplo, tu puedes ver a tu chavo como un angel, todo ternura y amor, justificas cualquier cosa que pudiera estar mal, y vives feluz viendo una ilusión;ahora, cuando hablas con tus amigos te dicen que es un patan, que te trata mal, etc, etc, al final de cuentas te ciegas por el amor que le tienes, y por experiencia digo que sucede y es doloroso cuando se abren finalmente los ojos|`|YvAOFZFraa	Por que no te importa ver los defectos de la otra persona por el simple hecho de que no quieres admitir que no es perfecta|`|wqcbmNSmaa	Por que las personas que se enamoran de esa manera no tienen ojos mas que solo hacia esa persona, una persona asi no entiende de razones, le da la espalda a todo.|`|z6cye5HXaa	el verdadero amor es mas que eso  pues pierdes todo el juicio y realmente ya ni razonas como cualquiera ciertamente NO CREES LO QUE VES  si no lo que sientes

If you do stuff like that, guys will fall for you really quick. And as a bonus, wear some tighter clothes. Nothing skanky, but something that can be eye candy. It'll drive em crazy.

En ese caso la experiencia cuenta mucho menos...|`|EX0VelCxaa	las mujeres maduras a parte que tiene mas experiencia, no tienen problemas, a la hora de salir y pueden hacer los que ellas quieran, nada mejor que eso para un hombre y mas si las clases de sexo son gratis jajaja. así ellos tienen experiencia también para después disfrutar con otras chicas, pero lo mas normal es que quieran sacarle algo...por eso las buscan mayores e independientes...|`|L7SeHqpjaa	No todos .Hay algunos que las prefieren maduras por el hecho de que aprenden cosas de ellas .<br>  Otros, jovencitas porque se sienten mas jovenes junto a ellas y otros lo que venga ,cualquier colectivo les queda bien???????????|`|Uz08B5Ceaa	Por la experiencia q tienen las mujeres ya q ense?ar a una cuando puededn tener una q los ense?e y los hacen espledidos amantes.<br>  Tambien puede ser q busquen mama complejo de edipo|`|oYKdGyWQaa	No siempre porque hay hombres maduros que las prefieren jovenes y hay jovenes que no le gustan las maduras eso es cosa de gusto ...|`|wqcbmNSmaa	todo depende de la edad <br>  cundo era mas joven me gustaban las mayores<br>  y ahora me gustan las jovenes.  tengo 29 a?os.|`|Wt0b9pUAaa	Para nada no conozco a ningún hombre que le gustaría andar con una mujer mayor que el, tal vez 1, 2 a?os pero no pasarte tanto, en mi caso me gustan mas jóvenes... tal vez a las mujeres le gusten los hombres mayores que ellas pero viceversa en ved no lo creo =)|`|SZq1QLAWaa	Pueden ser varios los motivos:<br>  1.-Buscan una madre.<br>  2.-Una mujer con experiencia.<br>  3.-Una prof de sexo.<br>  4.-Buena conversación.<br>  5.-Alguien para pasar el rato.<br>  6.-Dinero para utilizarla.<br>  NOTA:Yo soy una mujer madura y para carajitos mis hijos.Bye.
W3HQwrgBaa	There are many guys who would be very interested in you I'm sure.|`|Zq772U4Aaa	sure|`|3cBZ6L6vaa	Nope I'm a girl. xD|`|I7x5XHH3aa	depends how you look. im not like shallow or anything like that though. but personality wise i would. too bad theres no one like that around where i live xD|`|wFKhb5s2aa	on your  About me:   i like to enjoy life, hey might as well enjoy it while we have it.:)<br>  i am 14 years   i like america in fact my best friend is american,and my boyfriend too.<br>  <br>  Nope you boy friend is like (omg how can this happen to me I made a mistake) and you know I can't stand people be sad because of me !|`|yFimnMBWaa	No sorry I'm a girl and i'm not a lesbian I like boys and i have a bf but there's some1 out there for u|`|ehcouPdUaa	Why not ?What not to like?
ieHp1eXnaa	i dont know..but i hate it that we cant make our hearts break in half and love two people at one time..its hard..<br>  <br>  but choose the one you really love and not the one you just lust for...there's always the one who has more love for you..<br>  <br>  but dont worry you'll find the right one..|`|cMJYgIS9aa	I think it's possible to fully love two people. I don't think that there is a limited amount of love in us, but there is a limited amount of time and energy for us to act on this love. I find that it's more fulfilling to spend your time on one person, so your relationship can grow to it's fullest.|`|lRmOOGEiaa	i think it is, depending on the girl.<br>  however, instances where this actually happens are rare.  you can like two girls, but there will always be one who wins, and who you like just a little bit more.  that doesnt mean you dont love the other one.  its just...not as much.<br>  <br>  kinda like when parents tell their kids that they dont have any favorites.  pshh.  bs!
vZhVSYDMaa	Look at her when you talk to her and when she's talking to you, but don't stare at her like you're expecting anything. And, when you're busy, for instance, if you're studying something or doing something, don't put your life on pause just to look at her. If it's awkward for you it probably is for her too.|`|03693a2d9216d1b0fb02e46c23a040a0aa	you have to maintain eye contact when someone is talking but you are right sometimes it can turn into a uncomfortable situations, in deed its recommendable that when someone is telling you something that its embarrass or pain full you shouldn't maintain eye contact, also you will know that you have to look to other think when she take out the eye contact.<br>  <br>  but let me tell you, that a man that maintain eye contact while a girl is talking looks very sexy, at least to me.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  and remember be your self and the victory will be yours|`|96eb339b66a7b136e3985868d53786dcaa	make it natural. dont think. when ur talking look @ her 75% of the time. when she is saying something interesting look at her.....|`|dab3b1a98d4256fefe0b85c4ff98692baa	The best thing to do is not think about making eye contact! Get your mind of of that for real. it's ok to look around sometimes when you're talking you can look at her or look at your shoes, or the sky pretend there's something on your shirt or something or  a bug on the floor maybe , but when she's talking to you make sure you're looking at her not the entire time.<br>  More likely she'll feel more comfortable if you're not looking at her most of the time because girls can get very insecure that way,  when they know that a guy is staring at them.Just think about how you talk to your friends. <br>  I'm one of those girls who doesn't like guys staring at me the whole time i'm talking to them. <br>  DON'T CONCENTRATE ON MAKING EYE CONTACT BUT ON WHAT THE GIRL IS SAYING SO YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT ON THE SPOT WHEN SHE'S ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION ON SOMETHING IF YOU LISTEN TO HER MORE LIKELY YOU'LL GET CAUGHT IN A CONVERSATION AND  FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE EYE CONTACT THING!<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED =)
53QYfXL0aa	Don't trust your BMI man...its a horrible,flawed calculation. I'm around 15lbs overweight by my BMI but my body fat percentage is on 14% which is in that athletic to lean range. But numbers are numbers, exercise to feel better about yourself not to impress the ladies with your fisque. The confidence you will gain will do much more in that area than a couple of inches off your waist|`|nUbZ7Mbvaa	I would say you may be a little overweight but definitely not fat.  If you want to see fat, that would be me at 550 plus pounds.  I would not use the term chubby too freely as for those men who are overweight, this term has a certain connotation.
pkClMfuMaa	What do you have to lose?  Just ask her out and if she says no, then you can move on.  No use stressing over it.
727e469d9ab03f49b27c3b50501e7e50aa	That's a sign.  Ask her out.|`|yt5fXvFsaa	Ask her out on a date. It sounds like there's a good chance. Also say "date" instead of "hang out". It makes things a lot easier because if she says yes you both know that your interested in each other. If she says no you can still be proud of the fact that you took a chance.
dab3b1a98d4256fefe0b85c4ff98692baa	if she mentions her ex. i would think that she's trying to tell u that she is available or maybe that she's not ready for a relatonship. it depends on how much she's mentioning him. if she is alot then she really isnt ready for a relationship just yet.<br>  if it was just for conversation and a way to like break the silence then everythings alrite. <br>  <br>  hope i helped! :)|`|c7b55e12652f4ec81f89aa3a6ff9c9eaaa	That could be it, but she may also have been making polite converstion.
AA10517241	You have survived a life of living hell and it has made you much more mature than your years.  It seems that you bypassed the teen years so far as having relationships. <br>  <br>  With that in mind, it might be best to open up a bit and enjoy your surroundings and the activities that you are pursuing.|`|QDDpITshaa	im so sorry to hear about that i kind of kno how you feel... i think the first thing you need is confidence. you need to accept yourself. if you can do that then im sure youre capable of being more outgoing|`|e7f7f2e1698e02c954d91dee821d4c40aa	Seems like growing process. You are only 17.   Try to accept yourself as you are, you are a nice girl  doing what is right.   Don t think too much.   Better to do things.  Find out something you would like to do , as hobby, sports, gym, painting, music, reading good books.  No matter u don t have friends yet.  They will come to you, once you learn to love and forgive  yourself first.  Accept things like they are by now.  Make plans for the future and prepare for it.  <br>  And if you have the chance of counseling and talking  do it
AA11946092	i know how you feel with the picking sides.just try not to let them rip you in two with all of their pushing and pulling. stand your ground be strong and fight for your opinion to be heard. whether you believe it or not you have a side too even if it is staying on all sides of the playing field. but eventually they might give up trying to push and pull you,to pit you against everyone else. when they do give up go on living on your side never letting go of what you think is best for you. and put your side above their trying to do all of these things. don't worry even though it doesn't seem like it they are trying to look out for your best interests and they stick by it even if they don't see the damage they cause you.|`|Mdm06ITvaa	i know how u feel...all i can say is pray that everything goes better. God bless! :)
W3HQwrgBaa	Do what you want babe! Don't let anybody tell you different,|`|4vm1xlskaa	jason l  said it good enough for you i am not a guy but dont worrie about it if you like it then do it. i know its nice to be able to change something you may or may not loike on yourself without it really hurting just dont do it all the time becase it will mess with your hair. <br>  <br>  ~ GOOD  LUCK  WITH  EVERYTHING ~

I have done and yeah it worked for me.|`|AA10357331	You can't make someone like you ever!!..Just be yourself, and do what makes you comfortable. If you have to change who you are as a person to make them like you, then they are not the one for you??...|`|AA11871246	time will only tell, just be your self.

In high school it is all about popularity. So funny and so sad sometimes.|`|6ehYVOnuaa	Well you may only be looking at the girls that go for the popular guys(AKA popular girls). There are girls out there that don't look for that. Open your eyes you may see a few.|`|905401cc19618c03b78dfac56c5814bcaa	well, i am in highschool too. and i dont have your problem but i see kids getting treated that way and it disturbs me. you have to remember that you are just a kid and so are they, they are imature and shallow . and if people treat you that way then you really dont want to hang out with them anyway. join a club or something that your good at and you'll find some nice people that are interested in the same stuff you are, then you dont have to try, youll naturally meet people that you like and they will like you for yourself and not your looks.|`|NsFCKUgraa	I FIRMLY beleive ANY guy can get ANY girl. You just gata do the right things. first off, don't ever call them "chicks", they're ladies, or women... girls is somewhat exceptable. You have to show them that you're just as good as the preppy guys. Girls LOVE sweet guys, and gentlemen, be one or both of those and you're in. Just try randomly complimenting some of the girls you're intrested in... if you're intrested in one person in particular, give her some extra attention.. but don't smother her, you gata keep her wondering too, so still give attention to other girls Hope this helps, good luck man..|`|j0jXrDxfaa	Do you smell bad? Do you do anything interesting...are you interested in only popular girls....you gotta give everyone a chance if you want everyone to give you a chance...it goes both ways.
d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	You can seize your chance when you laugh at her jokes. Say something like "haha, I like you, you are so funny." You can even say "you are so funny, haha, I love you."<br>  <br>  This should help you on your way to a relationship.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

tvvnCgnJaa	Ask her questions like how are you? How was your day? What do you like to do for fun? Then listen to what she has to say and reply then complement her on something she's wearing and ask her out hopefully she'll say yes because she'll be touched you made the effort to talk to her and that ya noticed something pacific about her and not another girl and she'll say yes!|`|Otzj784saa	u keep urself looking as best as possible so you would repel girls?

And the hand signal was either sign language for "I love you" or it was devil horns and the guy's a metalhead.|`|803DM2jBaa	yup, he likes you, hes just afraid to ask you out or show his true feelings for u.|`|avBJaEZfaa	i think the guy likes you, that or he is just a big flirt. if you're the only one he treats this why, then he likes you.  also the hand gesture i believe is the sign for "I Love You" in sign language.|`|865f8edb3c0f07e74fbd0f7f5c95144faa	yes
KuEWosntaa	haha I'm not gonna take this question seriously, but if I HAD to choose, I would say brown eyes, but this is probably due to the fact that there are more brown eyes people in the world because it is the dominant gene!

Girls dig romance and the only way for the girl to lower down her defense is if you make her feel that she is the most beautiful, the most important and the most endearing person of your life. It's not an easy process and it might take a little time but you will eventually be able to graduate from just holding hands.<br>  <br>  Good luck and buy condoms unless you want to impregnate her.|`|tKWBpe4Uaa	1st of all. you need to learn how to write. that just sounds dumb when i read it.

Girls in such places have low self esteem and are subject to predators of all kinds: pimps, drug dealers, molesters and rapists. Most end up pregnant by absent men (married, wealthy rogues, pimps or johns) at an early age and stuck on welfare with no hope of a better life.

e79d53e21ab8260c444712e53bd7b7b6aa	Gotta find out what the common ground is. Same music? Sports? Pets? You can only go so far on good looks alone. <br>  <br>  If he knows that you like something he likes, it will endear you to him. Take a look at what he wears, what he carries... Try to figure out what he likes and bone up on it. Take a hard look at this girl he likes now. What's great about her? Must be something... Ask another guy (who doesn't know him and won't go blabbing) what's special about this girl. Tell him to be honest and check her out and give you the 411. It might be something you haven't even thought about. It might be something you don't have. It might be something you can use to your advantage =) <br>  <br>  Ask the new kid what he does on the weekends. If he answers, it gets him talking about himself, which gives you a chance to learn something (a lot!) about him. Usually what you spend your weekends doing is what you're all about. If you know what he's all about, you'll know how to keep his attention. <br>  <br>  If instead he asks why, tell him you and your friend were thinking about going to (insert somewhere you can get to -- mall? pizza? starbux? w/e) and it would be cool if he (and his friend?) could meet you guys there. <br>  <br>  Just a thought. Maybe you can't plan a meeting like that yet. But getting his attention outside of school would be a big help.

NWmi3XRGaa	Yo creo que los hombres buscan en las prostitutas lo que no tienen en sus casas, eso es evidente. Pero a veces también es que a muchos hombres les da vergüenza pedirles según que cosas a sus mujeres, sienten que la mujer se sentira humillada o que se enfadara y prefieren experimentarlo de otra manera. Quizá si no tuviesen miedo de comentarle a sus mujeres sus fantasías se sorprenderia de la naturalidad con que pueden tomarselo sus mujeres.

Por eso las mujeres una vez casadas no deben olvidar que su marido es el mismo hombre de carne y hueso con el que se casaron y que necesita y disfruta del buen sexo que tuvieron antes, si somos capaces de hacerlos sentir tan bien como lo haria una "prostituta" o una "mujer de experiencia"entonces quizas logremos que no vaya con ninguna de ellas|`|YCvZPCWjaa	Ahora resulta que muchos son unos santos, jajajajajajajaj.<br>  <br>  Mira cuando andas en el despapaye, y mas con uno tragos arriba, pues uno se pone venenoso, y ahi esta el problema, por que si llegamos tarde  a la casa y con ganas de hechar brincos, la mujer pues no va aquerer  y por lo tanto te quedas  bien filoso, por eso uno se enferma d elos nervios.<br>  <br>  Pero la verda, creo que es como mueven el bote, ya sea una mujer de la vida galante o una amiga con derechos, pues saben por donde atacarte y muchas veces creo que si tu pareja le has insinuado sobre hacerlo de diferente forma o utilizar ciertas cosas, y te dice que no, pues como que tambien es una monotonia, amen, de que alguna mujeres tienen ideas de que solo hacerlo de  una sola forma, por ejemplo de misionero y por que no, tambien el hombre tambien piensa asi.<br>  <br>  Pero creo que en la mayoria de los casos, no creo que sea para demostrar su virilidad o su machismo, como dicen algunos.<br>  <br>  Saludos y por cierto, creo que en la innovacion en la relacion esta que esta siga funcionando.<br>  <br>  Besos.|`|fZme1H70aa	A los hombres no hay quien los entienda....pues si tienes pareja, se supone que estas con ella por muchos factores, y si te falta algo en la relacion, antes de acudir una prostituta, se habla o se deja...|`|wqcbmNSmaa	Honestame no se.<br>  <br>  Nunca tube y creo que no tendre relaciones con una mujer de ese oficio.<br>  Creo que talves por miedo a contraer una emfermedad. y ademas por respeto a mi esposa.<br>  <br>  Pero esta interesante tu pregunta.<br>  <br>  saludos y *<br>  <br>  .|`|yRxPueoiaa	ps nunka fui kon una prosti, y supongo k debe de ser por k las put@s son uns digamos "profesionales" en el sexo no? y eso "su mujer" eso ya seria pa los kasados, pues kreo k la mujer kon el tiempo se va degastando y ya no es la misma nena hermosa  k se konoce, y por eso muchos tios se van kon golfas o kon sus amantes|`|EGhI76Opaa	Les hacen todo lo q se te ocurra y lo q deberiamos hacer todas para q no nos enga?en...Les dan la cola, les hacen petes, usan juguetes, hacen trios...les chupan todo, y saben como hacerlo....se entregan x completo...Y yo si alguien me gusta y le tengo confianza soy asi tb....|`|g6OdGFDkaa	Pues yo prefiero a mis amigas con derecho, antes de ir con una de esas.|`|9tjQbfVTaa	Buueno,  existe una gran diferencia de una putta y una mujer de mucha experiencia<br>  Ya que la segunda se quita todos los tabues y prejuicios sociales y goza de su sexualidad a diestra y siniestra sin que nada la perturbe,  en cambio las prostitutas lo hacen x dinero, y son mas activas y es mas propensas a que se contagien de alguna enfermedad venerea<br>  prefiero a las se?oras calientonas para que me ense?ene algunos truquillos viejos que tengan ahi escondido.......ha pero prefiero mas a las mujeres que se quieren vengar de sus parejas p x les fueron infieles.|`|RnTn7L8paa	yo nunca estar con mujeres que cobran por hacer tal cosa yo mejor me la meneo antes de pagar por media hora|`|ZZPD8o2haa	lo q pasa es q el hombre si esta con su novia esta pensando y preguntandose mientras tiene sexo cn ella= ?q estara pensando? de verdad me kiere? lo estoy haciendo bien? la llamo despues? me desaparezco al terminar? la llamoen la ma?ana para saber como esta? le sirvo le desayuno? ella se ira? y asi sucesivamente!"<br>  <br>  Mientras q un hombre cuando esta con una prostituta q no conoce es solo placer a la mayoria no les gusta pagar pero si les gusta las mujeres faciles y q no conocan nada de ellas hasta se les olvida el nombre!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Con una protituta el placer es mayor porq no tienen en su cabeza todas esas preguntas!|`|g7uQ6Kpsaa	generalmente para hacer cosas que con tu mujer no puedes hacer, como a la mayoria no le gusta el sexo anal u oral con una proti si lo puedes hacer, o simplemente quieres disfrutar de buen sexo que no te da tu mujer

QmbEp1rfaa	Por empezar: nunca creas que ser gay es malo, solo hace a tu elección sexual no a tu condición de ser humano, ?sabés?.<br>  <br>  Tené en cuenta que para los padres estas cosas son dificiles, primero porque son de una generación en donde estas cosas eran comunes pero se ocultaban y segundo porque lo primero que piensan es que vas a sufrir al ser "diferente"  es normal que piensen así, les pasan esas cosas por la cabeza, pero los tiempos cambiaron, los gays ya no son discriminados y de serlo no debe importarte porque es tu elección, tu vida y sos mucho mas que la persona con la que duermas.<br>  <br>  Yo como opinión personal te aconsejaría que aun no se lo digas, osea, al aprecer ya tiene algunos indicios, entonces dejá que vaya asimilando la idea,va a llegar un momento en que esta idea va a decantar y sola caerse de madura, ahí es cuando tendrás que tener tu charla y sincerarte, va a ser dificil pero eso no quiere decir que a la larga te respete, sos su hijo y en definitiva los padres deben entendernos y querernos pese a todo, ?no te parece?.<br>  <br>  Si tenés la duda que te eche de tu casa entonces desconocés su reacción, ?para que arriesgarte todavía?, no sé tu edad pero buscá tu independencia para que llegado el día, puedas hacer tu vida.<br>  <br>  Y no seas anonimo!!! ser gay no es una verguenza, verguenza es robar, matar, ser mala persona.<br>  <br>  No le tengas miedo a la discriminación, los que insultan tu condición son necios, tu sexualidad es tuya y por lo tanto sos libre de vivirla como lo desees!!!.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte y tranquilo, viví, disfrutá, hacé solo lo que sientas y sin culpas!!|`|8i8vJlGeaa	Estas en un caso difícil pero creo que debes de decirle tu la verdad por que si ella intuye algo y espera a que se lo digas o se entera por otro lado va hacer peor así que pienso que lo mejor es que se lo digas sin embargo entiendo que tienes miedo pero tienes que hacerlo por que será mas fácil y después podría ser peor por no decirle tu directamente lo que sientes, tienes que enfrentarlo y darle cara a la situación explicale lo que tu sientes y quieres, no se que mas decirte ya que tu mama tienes sus propios valores morales y para ella probablemente no le gusta los gay o lesbiana pero tienes que armarte de valor y decirlo tienes riesgos lo dijiste pero eres fuerte y los puedes superar.<br>  Suerte.|`|Xsdt23r4aa	No tienes porqué abergonzarte de tu vida, sé tú mismo. Es lo mas importante; creo que nada hay de malo en eso, lo malo es que haya tantas personas de doble vida, eso es peor. En mi barrio hay algunas parejas de gay, pero ellos no molestan a nadie; simplemente viven su vida. Sin embargo hay personas que la van de heterosexuales se acobachan en grupos relijiosos, hacen ritos dominicales, la mayoría catolicos, y despues se asocian con personas especiales en fiestas especiales. eso es mucho peor. LOS DE DOBLE VIDA.<br>  Yo creo que una pareja se une por amor, esto es comprencion, confianza, respeto, fidelidad, y sinceridad, por sobre todo. ??Sé sincero, contígo mismo!!<br>  Ese amor; puede estar entre dos personas del mismo sexo, pero amarse no significa usarse mutuamente y muchos hacen eso; amor no es vicio. gracias|`|Uhvscnu3aa	Amigo primero que todo debes saber defender lo que sientes,acaba con la cobardia pues a los problemas hay que darle el frente, al final es tu madre y te entendera pues el deber de una buna madre es apoyar a su hijo en lo que sea.Suerte|`|e3748f6e9bc8af28fe38aceb2280ec34aa	solo dicelo, es mejor q salga de tu boca q de la los demas. y no sientas verguenza de serlo.|`|fa50863d4f0eda824444aaa7427e1cfbaa	hola si eres gay y no quieres que sepan en tu casa  pues se mas CUIDADOSA.!!<br>  <br>  y si quieres ya dile tarde o temprano lo sabra.<br>  <br>  mia igual solo es como una curiosidad tuya y no eres gay. pero tu sabes.<br>  <br>  cuidate mucho y suerte con tu familia|`|mMXXIvVBaa	Creo que alguien dijo hace mucho: "La verdad os hará libres".<br>  <br>  Coincido con él en eso. La mentira te dará seguridad por un tiempo, pero al final la verdad encontrará su camino y saldrá a flote... y generalmente ocurrirá en el peor momento y con las peores consecuencias si no se hace nada antes. De ahí que siempre es mejor decir la verdad rápido antes de que la sangre llegue al río, como se dice.<br>  <br>  Uno puede enga?ar a todos, tal vez, pero nunca puede enga?arse a sí mismo. Mentiras y miedos forman un círculo vicioso: hay que mentir por miedo, y el miedo provoca más mentiras. Casi todos los seres humanos viven en esta atmósfera de mentiras y miedos y de ahí que la paz verdadera sea sólo un sue?o para ellos.<br>  <br>  Eso sí, la verdad debe ser dicha de la mejor manera posible. Ataques frontales y bruscos no sirven. Tampoco el echar culpas y los reproches. Los demás pasan por fases de buen ánimo y mal ánimo. Es preciso hablar con ellos y contarles la verdad de la mejor manera posible cuando están de buen talante, para facilitar las cosas. Después hay que correrse un tiempo y dejar que el otro asimile lo que le dijimos. Apurar las cosas y forzar a que el otro "nos comprenda" es no entendimiento de los tiempos de los demás.<br>  <br>  Por lo de no tener lugar dónde vivir, no te preocupes. Al hogar de uno lo provee un poder superior al ser humano. De cualquier manera, verdades como la tuya, tan fuertes, siempre se abrirán camino hacia la superficie, tarde o temprano, mal o bien, así que hay que tomar cartas en el asunto antes de que todo se nos vaya de las manos, en mi humilde opinión.<br>  <br>  Sí, me parece que ya lo sabe y probablemente ya te comprendió, pero está esperando que tengas el valor de encarar el tema. Ah, "valor", ?qué lindo sería tener esa virtud todo el tiempo!. Habría un mundo mejor para todos si todos la poseyeramos por igual.|`|5894e392aec6b79194b120d53e3a2fa9aa	primero! mis condolencias por la desgracia de peru.<br>  <br>  y segundo! no tienes porque salir del closet si no quieres!! me explico alomejor ella al ver ropa de mujer en tu cuarto piensa que te acostaste con mujeres!!! lo mejor es que le digas eso si nom quieres que te bvoten de tu casa y nada vivir dos vidas en tu casa eres hombre y afuera eres lo que quieres ser!! hasta que tengas una posicion economica y puedas irte a un lugar y vivir tu vida!!<br>  <br>  no somos quien para juzgar a las personas por sus razas religion politica o inclinaciones sexuales, somos seres humanos y debemos respetar a las personas tal como son.<br>  <br>  saludos hermano y qu ete vaya  bien!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  aclaratoria: los comentarios aqui emitidos com mi persona no tiene que ver con mi inclinacion sexual!! soy heterosexual y por ende respeto a los que son y los que no son!!!|`|712f0527b4bfa8b17869f5053ea70f21aa	si tienes ropa de mujer, no eres gay, eres transveti o no!?<br>  es con respeto, pero tengo esa duda y creo que tu tmb...|`|SPW6tf4Haa	pues no te a dicho nada porque tu madre piensa que traes mujere a la casa y te dice no hagas nada malo es que pienza que la vas a envarasar, pues mira si ya te anda por decirle a tu mama seria mejor que consiguieras un departamento y trabajo para poder irte ,porque tu mama tiene prejuicio y pues a lo mejor si te corre, pero no creo que sospeche nada, es una amenaza que traigas mujeres y las envaraces y otra cosa si no quieres irte de tu casa no escondas ropa de mujer  mejor cambiate en algun mothel o casa de un amigo  o escondela muy bien|`|XLXXXyVfaa	Para empezar, ninguna madre que eche a su hijo de casa por ser gay se puede llamar buena madre. Primero, antes de decirle nada, pregúntale qué opina ella de la homosexualidad, a ver qué te dice... si le parece bien, le dices tranquilamente que eres gay. Si no le parece bien, díselo igualmente. La homosexualidad no tiene nada de malo, es una condición sexual como cualquier otra y tu madre debería respetar eso.|`|Z1jZbnlUaa	Claro que tu mama sabe que eres gay, solo que ha de estar en una fuerte postura de negacion en donde como tu no se lo has confirmado ella pretende que no pasa nada o que mientras no se lo confirmes no lo dara por hecho y hara lo posible por persuadirte con sus comentarios para que recapasites y no le des esa confirmacion que tanto teme.<br>  <br>  Yo creo que los 2 se estan enga?ando o intentan enga?arse para no afrontar una realidad que tarde otemprano tendran que afrontar, lo unico que hacen es postergarla, habla con ella, dile lo que debe y tiene derecho a saber y agarra el toro por los cuernos. Estoy segura que tu te sentiras mas tranquilo y dale tiempo a tu mama para digerirlo , talvez reaccione muy mal o no tu no lo puedes saber hasta que no lo enfrentes, y si su respuesta es negativa , comprendela y dale tiempo, las mamas a final de cuentas queremos a los hijos sea como sea y pase lo que pase ella lo tendra que entender y lo hara ya veras, descansa, enfrenta lo inevitable y dale a ella un descanso de su duda tambien .<br>  <br>  suerte!!!!|`|mu9ikETXaa	Hola amigo. Ser gay no es malo. Es simplemente una tendencia. Nada del otro mundo. <br>  <br>  Mira, no sé cuantos a?os tienes,  pero déjame decirte que pues, desgraciadamente las mams observan mucho  a sus hijos. Pero mas a las mujeres, porque piensan que los hombres, son hombres y saben cuidarse mucho. <br>  Ahora, Si tienes miedo de decirle que eres Gay, pues entonces ingeniatelas. y cuando encuentre ropa de mujer, di que es de alguna amiga tuya o de tu novia. Hasle pensar que tienes relaciones con una mujer. Aunque algún dia cuando estés seguro de poder decirle que eres gay, lo harás.<br>  <br>  No tengas miedo. Muchas veces las mamas siempre nos amenazan para que nos arreglemos un poco. Por ejemplo, desde mi infancia, hasta mis 18 nunca habia probado la cerveza, tabaco, nunca habia hecho algun relajo por miedo, pero la gente crece y quiere ser lo que es. Por el momento bebo alcohol, pero moderadamente, no me gustan las escenas de borrachos. Mi madre no lo sabe, y me da coraje que salga con sus amenazas. <br>  <br>  Si tienes miedo, vas a tener que aprender a mentir.<br>  Espero que nadie mas lo sepa. Todavia no te des a relucir, porque de seguro le irna con chismes a tu madre y eso es mas doloso, porque entonces ? como defiendes tu postura? recuerda que a las mamas con cualqueir cosa que le diga la gente, le lavan la cabeza... ten cuidado, no salgas del closet aún, pero tambien podrías ahcer otra cosa. hablar con ella hacerca de eso. Por ejemplo, hablar de los esposados, de porque hay mucha infidelidad, de porque hay mujeres que se divoriciand e sus maridos, sabemos que hay muchos pretextos, luego dices que cierta mama de una amiga de tu amiga dejo a su esposo porque era lesbi o viceversa, y entonces ella te responderá, pero tu tendras que decirlo como si te diera igual, como si te fuera indiferente.<br>  <br>  Que no sospeche tu interes en saber que piensa de la Homosexualidad.<br>  <br>  SUERTE.|`|tFBIGXD6aa	Si tu madre te quiere de verdad no te va ahechar de casa pero tienes que estar muy seguro antes de decirle nada de cual es su pensamiento hacia los gays . TOdos sabemos que ser gay no es malo simplemente es otra forma de ser de todas las que hay en el mundo. Habla con ella exponiendo tus sentimientos y no te de miedo nada tienes que ser feliz y no estar siempre dentro de un armario que no te deje ni respirar.|`|1pSjluFCaa	Una madre siempre quiere a sus hijos sean lo que sean.<br>  Es normal que tengas miedo más si no tienes a donde ir;<br>  pero deberias pensar en decirle la verdad, las mentiras tarde que temprano caen por su propio peso piensalo bien va ser peor si se llega a enterar  por otro lado no crees.Mejor armate de valor y se tu quien se lo diga y no otro fulano, además si eres gay defiende tu personalidad que vas a tener o con la cual te vas a definir.|`|9oWiWkiQaa	a veces me pasa lo mismo, mi jefa encuentra tanguitas de mujer en mi cuarto pero es porke me divierto de vez en cuando con unas amiguitas ponedoras|`|OC5nicjyaa	Espero que te sirva de algo saber que ser gay no es malo, yo no soy gay pero si lo fuera le dijera a mi madre lo que soy y lo que siento y si ella  me rechazara, quiza seria mejor pues podria vivir solo a menos que quieras ser un mantenido toda tu vida pues de lo contrario puedes empezar a trabajar en algun lugar y mantenerte por si solo, animate a decirle si ella te quiere te va a querer como sea, no hay nada peor que vivir sin libertad.|`|RNCNWjCoaa	mejor sal del closet para que seas mas feliz y no te este cargando la chin. gada de estress por que no se den cuenta|`|e42afcaa297cccefc3c38329375351afaa	Mira no se si te sirva de consuelo pero yo soy bien machista y aun asi tengo amigos maricas y los estimo mucho y los acepto yo se que tu madre ha de estar asustada pero ya lo entendera y si no es asi no te asustes y lucha por ti mismo y pelea no importa que seas gay (perdona pero en Mexico no nos importa mucho como decimos las cosas) se como eres y encuentra la fuerza dentro de ti ya lo has hecho solo con tener el valor de expresarlo aqui y echale ganas que seguro sales adelante y nuna te traiciones a ti mismo.|`|gshshxRwaa	bueno, lo mejor que puedes hacer es tomarte coraje y hablar con ella, aclararlo todo desde el principio, ella entendera, eres su hijo y te quiere, como todas las madres, si te lo dijo en ese momento en tono tan amenazante es porque ella seguramente ve que el ser gay es malo, pero, no puedes estar asi, lo mejor que puedes hacer es hablar con ella y hacerle entender el porque de tu inclinacion sexual, explicale todo, comienza desde el principio, explicale el momento en que te diste cuenta que eras gay el porque todo, veras que te entendera, ella es tu madre, y sabe mejor que nadie que algo te pasa, anda, toma valor y diselo, todo sera mas facil desde ahi, suerte!!|`|hORfDaG2aa	tenes que decirlo, lo tiene que aceptar ella dile que no es una verguenza y no puede luchar contra sus gustos<br>  <br>  <br>  hay que ser muy macho para ser gay<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  valor!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  chau suerte|`|oW6YjIhaaa	El hecho de ser gey o ser un macho o una lesviana no significa que no tengas derecho a realizarte como ser humano, es decir trabajar, estudiar, ser un hijo de casa: En algunos países subdesarrollados no piensan las consecuencias de no apoyar a las personas que por desarrollo normal genético de la naturaleza algunas personas resultan gey o lesvianas, por ello existen muchas muertes de adolescentes que cuando sus padres no aceptan el género sexual de sus hijos éstos caen en las drogas, alcoholismo, prostitución y aveces se vuelven ladrones de casa para sobrevivir.<br>  Debido a ello en algunos países de Europa como Espa?a, Holanda, Inglaterra etc han aceptado al homosexual tal como son y tienen los mismos derechos que cualquier otro ser humano, y este grupo de personas trabajan en grandes compa?ias, algunos son ministros, otros son pintores, otros cantantes, etc. Por lo tanto si tu mami no te comprende, lo primero que debes hacer es buscarte un trabajo ahorrar lo mas que puedas, tambien debes estudiar lo que te apetezca y en el futuro puedes pensar venir a Europa donde serás bien recibido.<br>  Piensa positivamente y haz lo que mejor por tu futuro. Sé que en Perú hay un reconocido gey Coco Maluchi, y todo el mundo conoce que es un buen actor.<br>  No te preocupes si la sociedad te acepta o no, preocupate de surgir con tus estudios y trabajo porque ser gey no significa ser ingorante o un incapacitado.<br>  Sigue adelante con tu vida y pon oídos sordos a la gente de baja cultura acerca de los homosexuales.|`|sxawRx4Yaa	no tengas miedo a decircelo a tu mama por que ella es una de las personas que se que te van a apoyar por que  las madres por lo general son las que mas apoyan a los hijos quisas su comportamiento es de ese modo por que no todos estamos a costrumbrados a escuchar que alguien en la familia es gay esa es la razon por la que todos tratamos de buscar de arreglar la situacion pero en realidad no hay nada que arrglar por que en el corazon y en los gustos no se manda echale ganas no te asustes quisas sea dificil al principio pero al final veras que no es tan malo por que en fin no es una enfermedad que se transmite|`|t5F8exmSaa	Hola.<br>  Un par de cosas:<br>  - Ser Gay es tan malo como ser hombre o mujer. Es cierto que mucha gente lo rechaza pero en una época se creía que las mujeres no tenían derecho a estudiar o votar. Sabías que unos 100 a?os atrás mucha gente creía que los ****** no tenían alma?????<br>  - Yo fuí de la religión de mi mamá hasta los 20 a?os y decidí cambiar en forma drástica. Hoy soy ateo!!!! En esa época mi vieja tardó bastante tiempo en asumirlo pero el tiempo dejó todo eso atrás y hoy tenemos una excelente relación.<br>  - Los padres queremos lo que creemos mejor para nuestros hijos y en el caso de tu mamá debe estar convencida que es mejor que seas heterosexual y no gay. Pero lo mas probable es que si tiene que elegir entre dejarte en la calle o asumir que sos gay, la cosa es bastante simple...<br>  <br>  De todas formas no fuerces las cosas. Todo llega a su tiempo y solo vos podés ver el mejor momento de plantear la situación a tu mamá.

08bf43595004d99ab4dce32aa8d67110aa	Oh goodness honey you are not alone! I am a type of person who keeps my feelings to myself, but for my stupid older brother he is always talking about girls and rating them on a scale of 1-10, it's sooo aquward! I mean sure, I'm into boys, but I don't go flappin' my lips talking about them all the time, just because it's so incredibly weird! If it's weird for you just keep your feelings to yourself, or just talk about your feelings with some close girlfriends. It's totally normal don't stress it darling!<br>  <br>  Annie|`|bad85f5c907ea8f3fc7e0dc504bcb788aa	oh you arent wierd sweety.. it just means your hormones havent hit that level yet .. i started liking boys in the fourth grade.. and my parents thought i was really wierd.. and i had a friend who didnt like boys till she was about 15.. people are different.. so just think about it.. i mean dont you ever watch tv and wonder dang that boy is really cute?? thats exactly it.. and growing up with boys is diff too.. i mean i have a little brother.. and he kinda acts liek me.. and he likes designers.. my parents think its because of me.. ha so ya dont worry about it.. wait till you get to high school.. thats when the hormoones will hit :]|`|e98f996e112da711c784052b2d0ef18caa	u maybe just havn't seen "THE GUY"....U no the one that u dream of and can't stop thinkin bout.  U cant force urself to like someone so just give it some time.|`|nBK5ckcEaa	That's fine. I'm about your age and very boyish. I've only liked one guy for the past 3 years. Everyone thinks I'm weird because I don't talk about boys 24/7. You don't have to force yourself to like a guy. When it happens it happens. It may be hard but just ignore them.
727e469d9ab03f49b27c3b50501e7e50aa	Just tell him.  He's going to be crushed, but it's better than leading him on.
1urVHlJbaa	its great you feel this way, but i think love takes longer. but if you really feel that way, then thats great. more power to you.|`|AA11196103	it sounds like love but it might not be true love|`|RftEfMSAaa	why are you asking us ? lol .<br>  <br>  only you can truly answer that question ..<br>  <br>  so ask yourself, if u truly love this guy .. and the minute your mind makes it's decision .. then that's your answer .<br>  <br>  In my opinion .. yes, I do think your in love .|`|12MICN3Qaa	yeah thats love. i feel the same way about my boyfriend, and we've been together for the same amount of time you have too.<br>  <br>  YAY LOVE!! lol|`|WCfacymaaa	Love isnt real|`|apwOJJE3aa	how old are you? i can see that you are infatuated with your boyfriend. but i think this is already bordering on obsession. try to be mature in how you deal with him. if he looks good, i guess that's not a bad thing. but if he didn't look that good, would you still like him? also, i hope you don't humble yourself too much. if he gets upset, why do you cry? does he bully you? also, your "insomnia" is unnecessarily depriving you of sleep that you need. you have your whole future to be with this guy if you succeed in having a long relationship. just be careful that you don't take things to a level that you won't be comfortable with, like having sexual relations with him. that is the reason why i am asking how old you are. also, i hope that he really (truly) feels the same way about you.
1urVHlJbaa	well ask to hang out with him and his friends, its worth a try.|`|lGQ0dRUzaa	nothing you can do, usually it's "bros before hoes" not that your a hoe, but thats how it's gonna go.|`|HQ9Ay5bhaa	Start suggesting things you and him can do together and commit him.|`|AA11161349	get a new boyfriend|`|AVH2Jswcaa	puttttttttttt outttttttttt??<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh no!|`|ahNo3WNkaa	We all go threw it. It sucks..... Is he worth it????
1urVHlJbaa	he has a mind of his own, it was his choice. he wanted to keep talking cause he likes you not because you said so.|`|AA10816337	Try calling if you feel it must be done. It would probably relieve you a tad bit.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Well it really depends on how long he's grounded. I've gotton grounded for 3 months once because I refued to get off the computer but my friend had just died and I didn't want to tell my mom, than my friend "B" tried to call my mom and tried to take the blame and it only made it worse. So I would just try to not think of it and it really depends on how long he got grounded.|`|P48yVPHqaa	Well it really depends on how long he's grounded|`|WtQwsBBVaa	Yea next dam time his mom tells him to do something take a back seat. You are no force to be pissing off the mom. she will smash you both with one hand behind her back.<br>  Oh most importantly DON"T CALL HER!!!!!!!!<br>  Unless you don't want to see or talk to your boy friend again.|`|jQHzRWZQaa	well think about how he has got you in trouble??and don't fell so gulity........i mean!!!!! his mom is too strict....jk lol=)!|`|jX6GKJAAaa	well to him, i dont think its a big deal, if he really likes you then, you getting him grounded shouldnt be a really big problem, unless hes a complete jerk.<br>  <br>  Just apologize nicely and like give him a hug and stuff the next time you see him.<br>  <br>  dont call his mom, that would be so embarrassing lol.|`|xdO0cqK0aa	Well being grounded isn't the end of the world but calling his mom and being very polite would probably help.
aLF48jM3aa	i used to be in a same situation ..to be honest, more than once. usually when this happens its because even though i didnt have anything in common with my best friend i was too afraid and sort of lazy to look for new friends, everyone already makes their cliques in high school. but ur really lucky, ur going into grade 8, this is the best opportunity to make new friends, there are so many people from different elementary schools that love to make new friends. in a couple of years it'll be too late to really feel close to anyone, itll be rare. right now im in grade 10 and already people have their cliques planned out. me and my girlfriends became familiar with each other in grade 8, we were all looking for friends. now, however, we really couldnt care less about making any more lol. make the best of ur grade 8 year, its the best year for making good connections! you seem like a really sweet girl youd make friends asaaaap. and as for your best friend, it may be her personality is just cold and i can assure you shes not just like that with you. try talking to her ..be like i tell you so much why do you hide so many things from me? i give good advice too! lol. tell her high school is a really important life changing phase in ur life and if u have each other you'll be set. keep her by ur side ..dont lose her, but in the meantime try making some new friends as well, it doesnt hurt! <br>  hope that helped xox|`|9MpoHWsoaa	Yes.<br>  God.<br>  People change.<br>  Find a new best friend.|`|Mz5QuzG4aa	Your friend sounds like one of mine.  She's my bffl and she's not really the caring type. We've been friends for almost 16 years.. and I'm 17.. so that's love. Lol. You don't need a new best friend or anything like that. If she makes you feel good, keep her. If she's trying to get you to do bad things, you can keep her and not do it or you can dtich her. Maybe 8th grade will bring you more luck. Just try to overcome your shyness and say 'hey, how's it going' to random people in your school. With some 8th grade luck, you'll have a more compassionate friend asap.|`|76bd97a67e58ccc8979d745d0dfc90a6aa	I think you should, for the very reason that you are asking this Q.<br>  <br>  You can always make new friends and still be friends with your BF or mebbe add one gal to your group.<br>  <br>  Man is a social animal and thinking that "I can have only 1 Best friend" is crap.|`|FfkPN8Yhaa	I can't call her a best friend, since a best friend is someone that you can rely on through the good and the bad; a person that will support, comfort, and encourage you when you need it; tell you the truth when no one else will and will stick by you when the rest of the world has left you on your feet :) Ask yourself who are the people you can call at 3:00 am if something went wrong and which ever names you choose those are your best friends! She's just a friend enjoy her company and don't tell her any secrets that you know she can't handle! If you see her as a bad influence you try being the good one ;) <br>  <br>  Take care|`|T1INUqT5aa	BF is a great always but you must find out them. Once you find a best friend think that u r the luckiest person in the world.|`|tyIjAcMsaa	as one matures new interests and needs also develop..<br>  i guess you just want to explore new things, meet new friends.. and there's nothing wrong with that, in fact its important in developing one's mind and spirit. but it does'nt mean you have to give up your what you have now, your bestfriend.. she may not be perfect, coz nobody really is, but you must realize that not everybody has that.. somebody else may just be wishin for what you have now. one day you may outgrow each other.. you'll most probably meet other people.. but always treasure the friendship.

You and your siblings will be close someday,|`|ucT6YMIraa	I am the third oldest of 7 children.  My oldest brother who is 60, is and always has been a sociopath.  My youngest brother who came along after 5 daughters, was the Messiah.  Two years ago at age 42, he took his own life.  He left behind a young son and daughter.  I have not spoken to my oldest brother in 25 years.  As far back as I can recall, he was just plain cruel.  I have 4 sisters.  I speak to 1 of them on occasion and the other, almost everyday.  My mother never fostered good will among her children.  She was hell bent on causing conflict and dissension.  She enjoyed watching her children argue and fight.  She is 83 years old and still enjoys the fact that most of her adult children do not speak to one another.

To answer your question, I do feel the same way as you do, so I totally understand how you feel. But girl, you are only 19... you still have plenty of time ahead of you to find the One.

A2JbRcNJaa	I used to have the same problem with you when I was that age. It's rather difficult since I was taught to stay calm and not outgoing with opposite sex. What I did at the beginning (which I would not recommended you) was to lie to your parent that you are out with your girlfriends for some shopping etc. Not to make him suspicious I came back home on time. Anyway that's not the point!!!<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is? ...to make him trusted you. You got to act like a grown up lady. Be more responsible. And if you already are, just try to be more. Show him something that you are not a little kid anymore and that you know your limitation. And if that doesn't help, you might have to ask him guy to visit your house. You know it got to be step-by-step.  Don't rush into things. Me and my bf had that experience before and now we still together for 8 years now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  |`|LrVzkhl4aa	tell him you value yourself more then that even if he did want that one thing, that which he doesnt.

Understandable, but he should let you get into a new relationship. at least he knows its what you want. tell him all that.|`|o0GTrNumaa	Listen to your dad, they all say "I'm different" but that's all part of his game plan.

So just be careful..<br>  I bet this is what your Dad is worried about and I'm sure he only has your safety in mind.<br>  I don't think it would be good to go behind his back to meet this guy its probably best to let your Dad meet him, maybe have him over for dinner and to spend time with him at your house were your Dad will be or your mum...that way they'll feel that your safe and you will get to spend time with the guy...If the guy thinks that's lame then he's just not worth it because he should be understanding and accepting. Soon after your Dad gets to see this guy and is able to see how he treats you and his personality he will probably warm up to the idea of you being together. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  xx|`|wsC7Ei4haa	This is what i did, i met my boyfriend im still with now when i was 13 turning 14, he was 20.<br>  <br>  I lied to my parents for a few months until we accidently slipped out his real age, but the thing is my parents didnt care because they got to know him and loved him, they knew we loved eachother..<br>  <br>  thats what i say to do.|`|HZF5F04Faa	Listen to your dad, right now your dad controls you (he has the power to ground you and deprive you of your poket money) plus, right now he is the only one that truely cares for your well being AND actually knows what your well being is (together with your mum of course).<br>  <br>  The guy is 16, I think he's too old too.|`|cSOgWG8Oaa	maybe ask your dad if he will talk to the 16 yr old so your dad can begin to trust him and just try to reason with your dad and make compromises. and if that doesn't work. . . say you are going to a friends house. |`|QR5FfJsmaa	introduce him to your dad, show him hes a good guy, just act like good friends around ur rents to begin with til theyr used to the idea<br>  all the best! dont give up on love! it doesnt come round all tht often<br>  <br>  pls help?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqZSp.5.S2lUmpLJgWkH.73sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080929013157AA2ybYj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0LChg27Haa	i say you give up. the reason is your dad can **** up your life if you dont do what he wants. i know this myself.

LOL  |`|9FzzFrB4aa	hmm...okay well yeah that is weird but everyone is entitled to their own fetish or preferences. <br>  Like I really love guys with curly hair, as long as it doesn't make your life impossible to live its okay. |`|aJFISQFFaa	hey what ever tickles your fancy, ever one is different right. you've just got to find a girl who comfortable with you like that.. |`|3pFOHj8Oaa	LOL, I have yet to hear of that one.|`|Sou3ShZ0aa	im sorry but that's weird.|`|LvVM2NLGaa	its what ever you like hun..|`|E9mtblQOaa	gross what if she shardes her pants
B3fpwDasaa	I would feel like I was going to melt.

I'm HOT|`|OmTsqInzaa	"Is he talking about me?"<br>  <br>  No really, that's what would go through my mind.|`|vPsSxeFNaa	it would make me smile and i would probably reply back in the same sort of way but not like "yeah it sucks that there's only one pretty girl in the whole class" lol maybe i would say "hm yeah too bad theres only one cute guy in the class too" <br>  but i'de think the guy was sweet and since hes attractive fall head over heels for the guy(maybe :P)|`|kTBE4dYEaa	that is a nice idea, you might embarrass her in front of other people though, girls aren't great at taking compliments. if you want to tell her she's pretty though if you see her alone in the morning just tell her she looks pretty today and point out a particular feature so she knows you've thought about it|`|63830d8dcc41d39c6f9c6870522c7ac4aa	that he's full of crap. guys that age, well nuff said. he's feeding you a line of crap and you're falling for it lol. but its not all bad. he is young and it just might be a poor attempt at flirting with you.|`|SX4DDdpNaa	Hes dropping hints smart one. If he continues to talk like this it probably means that he likes you, but is to shy or afraid of rejection to tell you. You'll have to make the first move.|`|gln5DFzoaa	It would be okay but why not just ask her on a date if you both are in to each other?  She is prob wondering why you havent already asked her.|`|yN0gGHpoaa	I would think he was a perv and report sexual harassment.|`|qnLeqyq5aa	I think it is pretty clear.|`|gvVAxnTSaa	oh how cute, thats so sweet, hes so adorable...i think|`|mIt7vaG7aa	If I'm attracted to this guy, I'm thinking yes!  So this cute guy don't need glasses.  Anyway he's flirting  with you and their nothing wrong with that|`|RgchCljtaa	"wow, this guy thinks im prettyy...." then i might start picturing myself with him.<br>  <br>  can u explain why u want to know the answer to this question though?|`|KPp3R7uFaa	he thinks your pretty. tell him how you feel.|`|7lXUuRGaaa	be like thanks. and say your not so bad yourself.|`|xCqGkvruaa	i would be thinking HOW YOU DOIN'!<br>  <br>  <br>  unless he was a total jerk|`|SsI4LLUZaa	Do I know him?<br>  If yes I might just lightly smile.<br>  If not I would be very disturbed and not want him near me.|`|N7UCCGDDaa	umm i would love it. i would probably just be really flattered and i would probably just stare back at him for a second and keep on talking. but if i really liked him i would probably say its too bad there's only one handsome guy in this room.

OariSMoBaa	Okay, I won "biggest flirt" in my high school so I am practically an expert in this subject.<br>  <br>  First of all, you don't wanna freak him out, its really not a good thing. Just talk to him, be yourself.<br>  <br>  If you already know him pretty well, go up behind him and just poke him in the side, not hard, just a poke, smile and just be like hey (his name) <br>  <br>  Talking is definitely one of the BEST ways to flirt if you aren't to good at it.<br>  <br>  Then once you get better at flirting, you will be awesome!<br>  <br>  Just remember: maybe ask to sit with him and his friends at lunch, laugh at jokes (even if they aren't funny), and TALK, also "high-fives" are a great way to start!  Good Luck!|`|CUWraLciaa	laugh like a hyena from lion king...add in a snort here and there :::))) Just smile and laugh|`|e920ec7aa3d1a8d4c68cc75a84caa743aa	Make faces at him|`|AA12187979	Tattoo, thong hanging our and a breast job and legs that spread like butter.  <br>  <br>  Oh by the way if you go through all that trouble you will miss out on the young man looking for a shy teen age girl with some virtue as opposed to getting all that attention from boys looking to mount as many sluts as they can.|`|TesgbYKDaa	to me, it depends on whether the guy seems interested. say hes sticking to you at a party and you're interested as well, go with what he says and follow through w/ a conversation. laugh and make him laugh. also, if your in a situation where the guy is also sexually interested...go with it as long as its not progressing dangerously fast!
JGoJCgjhaa	Yes he does I mean how could he not|`|yTdW0hkzaa	Hmm...it's hard to know.  It's possible that he does, or he's just messing with you.<br>  <br>  I would ask him to hang out, and see how he responds.

iXTf79YYaa	I know how you feel. I'm currently in a relationship that i've been in since my sophomore year. I'm a senior now and I just don't feel the same about him anymore. Were not going to the same colleges, so were probably going to break up soon. It makes me sad because I used to really love him but their just isn't any spark. Our relationship has gone flat. I think there's a point where you just have to accept that people change sometimes for better sometimes for worse. Trust me when I say that when you meet the right person you won't ever have to question if its going to last, you'll know that its going to last.
cekGznDqaa	i think it shouldn't be an issue if you think he's a good guy. instead of looking at your size difference as something odd, have fun and play around with :) like tackle him... take him on piggy back rides... throw him onto the bed. he might actually enjoy it :P<br>  what do you say?
m7IU55Fjaa	i think you should ask him to let u kno where u stand but if he doesnt answer u hten im afraid   hes not interested |`|OFJFLs2Paa	The best thing to do here is just drop it. It all is going to get bad so I would just forget about the whole thing. He must not like you no more or found someone else the he likes. He would still talk to you if he still liked you. Sorry about this hope you find some that is closer to you so you can keep a eye out for him. Well good luck!|`|MX3kORmLaa	2.5 hours is not a LDR. That's a commute. Tell him to be straight with you, you can handle it. If he still doesn't respond, cut bait|`|XstaAKLLaa	it might be that he found someone else closer to him. because a guy wouldn't stop contacting you for no reason at all. if he's busy he still should have found time to send you a text/make a short phonecall. so either he's found someone else or he's lost interest ...I think the best thing would be to call him and ask him what's wrong. be honest with him and tell him that you feel that he's losing interest. if he's a real man he would be honest and would tell you the truth.|`|OMkj8jdAaa	If you two had an "in-person" relationship established previously, this long distance thing could have more merit. But if you've never dated regularly and now speak more infrequently it may be healthiest for both people to just let it go.

What more can you do? I mean she could ask her friends, even though I get the impression she doesn't want to...But if she did, they would either lie or tell the truth and who knows if she would believe them. I am not sure why she wouldn't want to ask...is she afraid of being laughed at? If she is then she can approach them sternly after asking them about it saying it isn't funny and friends don't hurt friends and not feel sorry for hurting them so in essence if they didn't feel sorry she would know they weren't her friends in the 1st place. <br>  And a note to you directly:<br>  Sometimes when people tell you things they aren't looking for you to fix it, they just wanted someone to listen and empathize with their situation...so kudos for being a friend....<br>  <br>  P.S. If this is your idea of a crisis wait till you become an adult! Life doesn't get easier...

We think about her only when she is happy and feel we must comfort her when she is sad. We think we must take care of her like it is are life depeding on the guy. Some guys only think about how you look though and when they see someone prettier or feel you have lost your spark they decide it's time to move on.|`|oen5x1Bgaa	I want to spend the rest of my life with her in my arms.

La reflexión y la acción pueden ayudarnos a acortar  la brecha que existe entre la manera en que estamos viviendo y  cómo queremos vivir. Se trata de un proceso que, a medida que se vaya  afirmando, posibilitará logros mayores. En cada paso es importante ver qué cambios se encuentran dentro de nuestras posibilidades, y darles forma.

Vemos en esa persona a un ser encantador que nos cautiva por una serie de cualidades que nos gustan y nos atraen, su manera de ser, comportarse, moverse, belleza, inteligencia, etc. Incluso a veces no encontramos una causa objetiva y concreta que justifique los sentimientos que experimentamos.<br>  <br>  Cuando la persona enamorada es correspondida, siente un deseo irresistible de estar con la otra persona, de conocerla y de ahondar en su vida. Pero cuando esto no es así y el enamorado no es correspondido, experimenta un sentimiento de tristeza y frustración que tendrá que ir superando para salir de este estado.<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos y *<br>  <br>  .|`|0ee3cba96c49569794592def36db10c2aa	Para mi es un estado de gilipollez transitorio.Saludos|`|1356c17ac6efefe865ba6dfd59a3d0d5aa	muy correcta tu Comentario ...<br>  es algo que viene sin previo aviso...<br>  te sorprende y te cautiva...|`|3d325475e542ac5712143c84d6b6a42faa	Es disfrutar el presente con una persona que siente los mismos besos, las mismas caricias, los mismos gustos, disfrutar un dialogo donde exista tema siempre.

Están enamorados cuando parece que uno no puede vivir sin el otro, les gustaría estar siempre juntos y los temas de conversación parece que nunca se acaban. <br>     Aunque, en un primer momento, lo que deslumbra sea la aureola física, esto sirve más para los hombres. Cuando se dice, "el hombre se enamora con los ojos, la mujer por el oído", se quiere decir que ese deslumbramiento inicial para el hombre es la belleza física, y que a la mujer le gusta escuchar palabras amables y románticas, que le permitan saber que ha gustado.<br>    Parece que lo más romántico es el flechazo, sentir esa atracción mutua nada más conocerse<br>  Para ello es necesario que estén de acuerdo en cosas fundamentales de la vida. Por eso, es importante ese periodo previo al matrimonio, para ponerse de acuerdo sobre muchos temas: cómo se aceptarán mutuamente en sus distintas formas de ser; qué planteamientos tienen una y otro sobre la vida espiritual y cristiana; cómo van a respetar el trabajo del otro fuera del hogar; cómo se van a distribuir las tareas de la casa; cómo van a educar a sus hijos; cómo son las familias de cada uno y cómo se les va a querer y aceptar en sus distintas formas de ser; cómo se van a integrar los amigos de una y de otro en el ambiente de la pareja; cómo cada uno debe continuar con sus aficiones y su formación interior y… bastantes cosas más.

Tell "them" that you are content and please just leave you be and that the right person will show up at the right time.  You may have to make the first move though if you find someone YOU  deem worthy.  I was single for about 8 years and heard all of those things and more.

The thing is some of us have different views on how love comes to be. Whereas I believe that love finds you, my friends say that you gotta get out there and knock on the doors and bust some windows sometimes. I think that relationships themselves are enough work that the higher being wouldn't be so cruel to need you to go all SWAT team just to find love. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but at that end of the day it's not your fate or his or anyone's that you're not together yet. It's all fate's timing.

Es un poco tonto aguantar eso y poner cara de "que divertido" o de " tienes razón" aún cuando sean familia.  Por qué tienes tú que considerarlos y permanecer en su compa?ía si ellos no te consideran y evitan hacerte sentir mal! Ese "algo" que te hace sentir incómoda te está diciendo que lo que se dijo o la forma en que se dijo no es correcta.  Si tienes edad suficiente y/o amplio criterio, tal vez podrías tratar de afrontar a quien hace el comentario -con amabilidad y firmeza- y preguntar si no tiene una manera más agradable de hablar o algo mejor de lo que se pueda comentar. Es mejor alejarse de conversaciones vanas y buscar algo bueno y/o productivo que hacer. Qué tal pensar y decir: Gracias Dios por todas tus bendiciones, luego sonríes y te olvidas de los malos comentarios. :)<br>  <br>  Que Dios te bendiga.<br>  Paz|`|1eI0sYrnaa	te entiendo... solo ignorarlos y darte cuenta de que si hay personas que aunque no sean de tu familia te aceptan tal como eres...<br>  saludos, cuidate bonito|`|IKSpNc2daa	Como es imposible cambiarlos no gastes tus energías en ellos, ignoralos y pensá que es solo un momento y ya se van

XHgxrhTYaa	you've asked this question again, havent you. And I ranted about racism. That's too bad. Well, the guy likes you , but is too afraid to tell you. So i guess, you have to do the job of initiating that relationship. I do this sometimes myself, when I really like a girl, but I don't want to look like a loser approaching her. I've dreamt of dating many of the girls that are my friends, but I've never actually approached them like that. Anyways ask him out, if he doesn't want to do it, at least be good friends. Eventually, he may come out of his bubble.|`|L301MBecaa	umm....im srry i dont really get it|`|O8SmRydsaa	one things sticks out to me, and that is that you said he is always sitting close to you.  When I was still in college I always sat next to this girl because I wanted to be the one she talked to and if she was talking to someone else, maybe I can catch somethng that I can bring up in a onversation.  Maybe I hear she liked a certain book and what do you know, I have that book peaking out of my bookbag the next week and make sure she notices.  Then I try to strike up a convo...Look for other signals...do you catch him peaking at you, often striking up convo's with you, sitting next to you, etc...  Hope this helps...PS...be confident!  i am a shy guy, so i know how hard it is, but be confident.
ELM5twqRaa	wow, i am soo sorry. i am going through the same situation. First suggestion, take her off of your facebook. She is not your friend and you don't want her to be. Second, i would tell him how you feel. If he understands that there is a problem and continues to act as if he is not in a serious relationship, you really need to rethink your relationship.  I personally don't think you are being irrational, but if he has never given you a reason not to trust him, have a little more faith. I know that can be hard to do<br>  <br>  Hang in there!!|`|JRqzkUxUaa	I think you have a right to be concerned. It is obvious that he still has a very strong attachment to this girl.

She probably still talks to him because she knows how much she has him wrapped around her fingers and shes just playing games with him. I would be VERY careful in this situation she may just be keeping him on a short leash as someone to fall back on it her relationship does not work out, just keep your eyes open and talk to her about it and tell her that you don't feel comfortable with them talking and maybe she'll understand.

b2DpR1EOaa	Como tu misma dices es muy fácil dar una opinión si no se está viviendo la situación; yo quizás lo haría si el feto tiene serias malformaciones, digo que quizás lo haria porque no sé si en el momento tendría el valor; antes pensaba como la mayoría de ustedes, que bajo ninguna circunstancia abortaría pero el haber estado muy cerca de ni?os con graves malformaciones me ha hecho cambiar de opinión, no los discrimino ni nada por el estilo pero si me doy cuenta de que su calidad de vida es terrible y mucho más si los padres  tienen una mala situación económica; es un dolor terrible para una madre ver que su hijo sufre y que es discriminado por la sociedad y no poder hacer nada, y cuando la madre muere muchas de estás criaturas son tratadas de mala forma  y ya no cuentan con el amor incondicional de la madre (no digo que esto suceda en todos los casos pero si ocurre con frecuencia). Creo que no se debería juzgar tan fuertemente a las mujeres que bajo circunstancias como éstas toman la decisión de abortar, es necesario analizar muchas variables a las que puede estar sometida una mujer para tomar una decisión de este tipo.

In the process you will be unhappy. You can't please everyone. Nor should you try. I don't think your ugly, and people who try to bring others down, do so to lift themselves up.

However, they were in a passing car and were unable to show their affection for you through any other means than the honk.|`|HxOt4j9paa	Gurl you kno they was doing it  cause they liked you but but b careful and check yo swag  cause they should be gentlemen and say hello|`|5yjrlwYqaa	either they thought you were cute or really ugly.|`|ZbhC0bXuaa	yea. that mean that they just thought u looked cute. |`|Ks84DOYZaa	No<br>  they were honking at the woman behind you<br>  |`|AA12305627	off course!|`|3griQEMAaa	either they thought they knew you or they thought you were cute!!!

7736c62316b98f00434255fb65e5c3e9aa	Whenever you want! kudos to you, now I want an eternity ring!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	An eternity ring has stones all the way around.<br>  <br>  You can pledge eternity to her any time you want.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You are past high school aren't you?|`|Q2MLikeUaa	Years ago it used to be after one year of marriage you bought an eternity ring for your wife others thought it was on the birth of your first child, but really you can buy an eternity ring any time you like, I had mine before we were married and I have now been married for almost 40 years, so he meant it, don't you think. Styles have changed over the years but I still like diamonds and is does not have to have stones all the way round, apart from anything else they are very uncomfortable to wear. You should know what your wife likes after 2 years, so surprise her sweetheart, I am sure she will love anything you buy for her. And yes it is worn on the same finger as your wedding ring.|`|aIgNU5PUaa	I'm not aware of any rules regarding eternity rings.  An anniversary would be good but any occasion is fine.  How about, just because.  That is my favorite time to get a gift because it shows my husband was thinking about me and not just fulfilling a gift requirement (like a Birthday).  <br>  <br>  As for the design, it just has to have diamonds (or her favorite stone) all around.  The bigger the stone, the fewer of them will fit on the ring.<br>  <br>  I think its sweet you are asking.|`|sqdsIHwAaa	used to be after at least 1 year. The design does not matter personal Choice<br>  wear it on the same finger as a wedding ring|`|kiYv9Elzaa	A eternity ring has diamonds in a line going around the ring,either just on the top of the ring or all the way round.i got mine on our first anniversary.its never to early to give one x|`|hH6kGUvBaa	When you both want to spend the rest of your life together.  An engagement ring is worn with the band. congratulations on your engagement.|`|2590ff94dee238fa148fd707c96bb4fbaa	It depends on you feeling. You need to know when is the right time. It should be after 10 years or after first years, you need to feel it.<br>  You wife must be happy with you, good luck :) !!!|`|wDTFAmC4aa	I'm still waiting for mine - hint to husband. But friends have got them from their husbands/partners after the birth of their kids. One friend's eternity ring is made with the birth stones of her 3 kids..........|`|LcOPL8gCaa	I think you can do it a couple months after wards, if you really love the person.|`|LnNeXnNiaa	Age is just a number, Whenever you feel that you're ready, You know her better than anyone so you know what she loves|`|OTittjXXaa	I think it would be nice to give her after an important event, such as the birth of a child.|`|UW0k9wusaa	Does not have a specific time.   Whenever you think the time is right.  |`|f3b291312c0ca402f95078e3ee2e8b3faa	I don't know but I will be following the answers to this one. Great question!
e8mlM1PXaa	Well if its not her fault because she was raped, tell her to get an abortion because she doesnt want a reminder of that inncident for the rest of her life, plus shes too young. I assume hre parents already know. Just continue to support her, take her out for a coffee or out to lunch of soemthing fun.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Wow, I feel really sorry for that she got rape.  It is a cruel world out there.  You should tell her that you will be her friend in every step of the way and do not allow her to have abortion.  Giving up the adoption is the best thing to do for her.|`|uUrJwk7Faa	Just be there to lend a hand and listen. That's all you can do, she needs support right now.|`|eofPbpzDaa	just continue being her friend and support her through everything she is going through...<br>  this is the time she needs a friend the most.<br>  and thats you.|`|HNHz3yBhaa	Just be there for her when she needs to talk,<br>  or anything.<br>  don't ever let her down.<br>  or she'll have nothing.<br>  show her you'll ALWAYS have her back.<br>  :)|`|g1AtI2t2aa	omg! that's so sad!<br>  mayb u could just support her... is she gonna abort?<br>  i probably would. just comfort her and stand up for her if people make fun of her.|`|A1cFVseqaa	If you really want to be the friend you say you are, you'll have to convince her to tell her parents, and hopefully her parents will notify the police.  I'm not going to tell you that this is going to be easy for her, because she will have to answer questions regarding her rape.  Be sure you let her know that you will be there for her through the entire procedure. Luckily, she will be referred to a counselor for help in dealing with the rape, and what to do about the pregnancy.  Please emphasize to her that there's no other way to handle this and that you will help her get through it.  |`|NIwNKYLJaa	If she knows who raped her she needs to take action because no women want sick people like that lose. And i feel terrible that that happened to her because it is not right! And you should just try to be with her no matter what she chooses to do.<br>  Good luck to you and your friend! It's good that you care this much about her!|`|Z7DKic3Qaa	Just be there for her. Let her know that she can tell you anything and you won't judge her. <br>  Has she reported the rape? I think she should even though she might be scared. Also I think she should see a therapist to help her through. Mainly, just be there and ask her how she's feeling and such. :D|`|A3Cd1WLIaa	well..first of all you have to convince her tell her parents if she hasnt..<br>  then you have to tell her to throw the baby coz she will ruin her life if she keeps it,and last you can just spend time listening to her and tell her that whatever happens you will be there no matter what,,wish u luck..xx|`|9SDuGMdVaa	just be the best Friend you can be and imagine yourself in that situation and how you would feel if your Friend stayed your Friend no matter what you were going through cause otherwise your not a true Friend ;D
Bwl8D9rhaa	I think you may have been drastic in changing th number maybe you should have ben mor specific with your felings and explain to him that going out isnt your cup of tea.  Just a thought but hes a man and thy need guidance if you give him other options he will stay in with you.|`|APx5Z1tgaa	So you just stopped talking to him? DON'T DO THIS! From personal experince it really does hurt. you need to talk to him and let him know how you are feeling and that your life styles are just too different. If you really do miss him and want to work things out, you need to call him and apologize and explain. either way..talk to him|`|FQ3RKqywaa	some may find the whole #change a bit drastic however i understand where your coming from the way his friends were treating you is almost like harassment. I understand that you may like him however if he wants to treat you this way he's not worth your time.
9i9I2rE7aa	i think you definitely have a chance with her..go for it. the age difference isnt really that big of a deal and neither is the height thing. goodluck.|`|c3fb34d2d6fa7de31b3dd0a86f7db0bbaa	a 21 yr old sophmore, ugggh - she should feel honored that you're intrested.|`|cd0KLq0Kaa	None of us can tell you if you have a chance or not, because we don't know how she feels about you.  The only way to find out is to be honest with her, and tell her how you feel. If you wait too long ...........you may miss your chance.   Talk to her man. Go for it.|`|AA10614217	If you really love her then you definitely have a chance. and for the height thing dont even worry about it I only feel weird if I'm with a guy at least a foot shorter than me. some girls even like short guys more than tall dark and handsome guys|`|AA12319210	it doesnt matter about anything if she likes you and you like her its all going to work out but yeah you do have a chance|`|fClk560uaa	if you think you too could have that "something"<br>  why not?<br>  and being six inches taller then her is perfect unlees she like reeeaaalllyyy tall guys<br>  so sure<br>  go for it!<br>  and if not<br>  its college isnt it?<br>  have fun<br>  :]|`|tNk1UNrKaa	Come on man! She's 3 years older and 6" shorter than you!!?  Who cares? Are you just looking for excuses NOT to make a move here? There is NO, i repeat, NO way to predict whether or not someone will be interested in someone else based on statistics. You talk to her so only you can pick up on her vibe. And even if you aren't getting a vibe that's no guarantee there isn't something there....she may just be shy too. Look, you obviously like her so heres the Options: 1)Make a play and get turned down- what do you lose? You feel a little rejected for a day or so and you move on-big deal.<br>  <br>   2)You make a play and she's interested--I think you pretty much imagine how good that will feel <br>  <br>  3)You do nothing and get nothing.<br>  Its a no-brainer dude, QUIT MAKING EXCUSES, QUIT OVER ANALYZING, AND GO FOR IT!!|`|wYKbfm7taa	No I don't think age matters because if you guys really like each other it should'nt matter what the age is also if she really likes you she wont care about height|`|xZ3xunXoaa	there's no any problem if u really love her, yes, u absolutely have a chance with her.
SfbvlXHNaa	It means he wants to ask you on a date.. or actually he DID ask you for a date.<br>  <br>  Some guys are more creative but pretty much, what a guy says, he means.<br>  <br>  That said, was it a photocopy? ;)|`|N4oLz5vsaa	YA HE MAYBE 4GOT TO PUT IT ON DER OR WATEVA FIND HIM IF U REMEMBER WAT HE LOOKS LIKE|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Oh my god that is the cutest thing ever, I wish a guy would do that for me! Wow, stop being so critical, just go have lunch for him this guy sounds sweet as pie, give him a chance. Next time you see him just be like, "So, when did you want to go grab some lunch?"|`|MS04z7M4aa	i wouldn't really expect a phone number and him asking you to lunch is better than dinner cuz' it's more relaxed. i also think the the paper idea is witty and cute so if the guys okay you could at least give him a chance. also this means the guy thinks you're pretty (the whole eye ans smile thing).|`|Mc5UBTnvaa	uuuuuuummmmmmm <br>  "every time i come across you my heart feels like complementing you on how amazing your eyes and your smile is...i dont even know what can I possibly say that would convince you to have lunch with me"  thats a good writer <br>  <br>  i think he just want to have lunch with you ,, <br>  |`|4HVp0PI3aa	that is the cutest thing ever<br>  youll pass him by again<br>  and when you do, smile<br>  see where it goes from there<br>  if he says anythings<br>  or compliments you<br>  giving you his number would make him seem desperate and he doenst even know you yet<br>  i wouldnt give  a stranger my number no matter how much i thought they were beautiful|`|aHfC0VX8aa	hahahaha, yet another guy that is stupid enough to not realize that us girls r smart enough to know that we want to know who we r going out with before we agree to meet someone we dont even know their name, hahah<br>  <br>  i would just tell him ur answer next time u see him<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081023212837AAeWgQX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|w73duOuEaa	i know these types of guys. i have to work at a place that deals with single parents and we get alot of single daddys trying to hook up with people.  My coworker experienced something similar to this but the guy was like 30 and she's 20 and he wrote her the worst poem ever. Usually guys like that are after sex so if you're down for the get down then i think it's cool otherwise prepare yourself for a possible crappy relationship.|`|5PNvOs9Yaa	dude he just wants a piece of yummy dummy yum yum stuff yeah u know whwere im getting right?? ok just tell him hes a stalker to leave u alone,,,, girl we all have our ways i mean hey we are women all men want is just a pice of our pie.. so hey y cant we do the same and just have a good banana split every once  in a while! lol|`|oOIaYQERaa	so cute!!!!  Make a note, he will be lurking around over the next few days.  I think you should call him by name, and go to lunch with him.  Give him a chance.  He's sure you'll say no, that's why he can't risk giving you his number.  he's too fragile for that kind of rejection.|`|AA10582147	That's sweet, but I would be immediately turned off to his grammar, spelling, and usage. The whole not having his number or a way to contact you is kind of weird.|`|NzPdZqH1aa	maybe he thought that if he wrote down the number it would be useless considering he dint know if you were interested or not in him..so why give so much info...i think what he wrote is more than enough..just go out to lunch with him..give the guy a chance..|`|AZPlINnwaa	no offence... but cheesy!!<br>  <br>  he doesnt kno u even and hes talking about how his "heart feels like complementing you"<br>  <br>  creepy!<br>  <br>  and what an idiot.. why leave just ur first name!! why do boys make things so difficult?<br>  <br>  good luck! <br>  be careful...|`|WpLREPFOaa	it's a bit cheesy for me, but if that's what floats you boat then hey ho.<br>  <br>  personally i would be a freaked by it.|`|ca5xkCuqaa	no just tell him you would like to have lunch with him the next time you see him. how much more do you want him to put hiself out thier. |`|rBmFe6Evaa	aww thats soo cute!<br>  You should try to run into him again around campus...i think the guy accidently forgot to write his number down =]]|`|lOMQSrlbaa	He is sensitive and not very bright.  Two strikes.|`|85LHYBVaaa	if his name is uniqe u can find him and i would want a number,maybe its like a one step at a time thing.|`|DFcoirTBaa	omg that is sooooooo cute, next time you see him give him a paper. Is he cute? Do you like him?|`|53R43zLGaa	thats cute wait till u see him again get to know him or talk to him
AA11044738	try to accept the situation. if your mom wanted to live her life like that then its for her to ponder. kb|`|GtazNrplaa	It sounds like one has schizophrenia and the other two suffering from depression.  Maybe you mother has found a new hobby by being slave master of her new husband. <br>  <br>  If I was you I would move on and get your life  on-track but don't forget to send something on Mothers Day and the other related occasion that you can send your love to her. Just give them the space they need and if the marriage fails then help your mother pick up the peaces but until then let them go.|`|cWl5pJ01aa	I wish I could give you a hug. My mom made really bad choices in her life, she married two men, one of them was my dad and the second was my stepdad. They were both abusive, like they would hit me and say nasty things to me. So I know what its like.<br>  <br>  No matter what she says, don't give up on your life hon. Suicide is completely giving up. Don't throw away your life because of her. It seems like your mom sort of cracked. Keep the lines of communication open if she wants to get back into your life but don't stand for this.<br>  <br>  Make a family for yourself with the people in your life, like friends and a boyfriend. *hugs* Wish I could be there for you.<br>  <br>  |`|WHWMdnuxaa	Hi dear,<br>  <br>  Like you have told here tell your worries to JESUS CHRIST He is there for you to solve this setuation. He is always waching over you and he knows everything.Though your farther or mother forsakes you he will never forsake you. you pray to him. he is able to chang your mother and give you the desires of your heart. God bless you.|`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	Make your mother understand things properly .Try to tolerate the situation created by her .Make your life secure and enjoy the life .|`|FzFSzilmaa	it's your mothers life to ruin however she wants...<br>  <br>  trying to get her attention from childish acts doesn't seem to work, so maybe you should move on with your life and let her do with hers as she will...|`|XgPeV2Vnaa	I guess this happened to me too. <br>  <br>  My mum was always there for us when we were younger but she started to get angry at dad and told him to leave. <br>  <br>  when he did she was upset and couldnt cope. <br>  <br>  i would go home  everyday thinking maybe she wouldnt be there and i couldnt bare it. <br>  <br>  i know sort of what you are going through. <br>  <br>  first of all look after yourself . she is fine, look after yourself first. <br>  <br>  now talk to her about it. <br>  <br>  she can stay with her husband but tell her you need her and you think she needs you. mother daughter relationships are touchy but you should be able to talk to each other. <br>  <br>  If you find your mother is happy , be happy for her, but dont let her abandon you. explain how much she needs to be in your life. <br>  <br>  good luck :) |`|cezPHCTdaa	If it gives you any prespective at all here is my situation. My mom is dead. I'll never get to talk to her again. No more home cooked meals, no more enjoying her company or having her around during holidays. It's rough, but my point is, we all only have so much time left to spend with our folks, you have to try and work it in, and cherish it. If you don't, you'll only regret it later. Just try and be a part of her life a few more times. If she doesn't see that you are just trying to show that you love her, then move on, it'll be her regret later on in life to look back on. Sooner or later, she'll realize this, and it'll be up to you to be the grown up, and be player about the situation, and let her back in. If not, oh well, at least you tried. No one could ever say you didn't.
AA11230763	yes it can happen.|`|RcjqA5Yeaa	oh boy i think so i wish it really could happen in my life!!!!!!!|`|zmwEcAjFaa	yes, its very possible.
qnxAN2t5aa	because that's just it, you feel left out! it's okay and completely normal to feel that way! just try steering the conversation some place else. best wishes|`|1d58a0751f7fb6228a95e6c370f555c9aa	Next time they start in about all the sex you're having, listen to how they're talking about it.  Bet ya they're just bragging to make themselves feel macho and studly; however, real men don't talk about their women like that in front of their friends.  These are not the kind of relationships worth being jealous over.  Sounds like your mates are at the stage where getting laid as much as possible is their goal.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there and don't be jealous of them!  They are so immature to brag like that, and the number of partners they have or times they have sex has absolutely nothing to do with being a real man.<br>  <br>  A real man is responsible, caring and loving toward his sexual partner.  Someday when you enjoy some meaningful sex, you will look back on these bragging sessions with more disgust than you can imagine!  <br>  <br>  Keep listening to them if you like, but from now on, observe how immature they sound, how little regard they have for their partners, and whether that's what a manly man needs to do to prove himself.  Good luck!|`|FNDGEsRAaa	Then make a lot of sex so you can boast about it with your friends! :-)<br>  Sorry, I'm joking: just feel ok when they talk about it! It's something natural, nothing to be ashamed of!<br>  <br>  Ciao, baci|`|f1d4892274fb0093612f50bb5aadba0eaa	tell them to shutup...whether ur getting any or not, who the hell wants to hear their friends talk about their sex lives for an hour?|`|gflGkFyxaa	i wouldnt feel left i would feel clean, becuase everybodies going around having sex with anybody they can find. why would you feel left out on that.|`|0gBaAyKWaa	its up to you how you feel|`|4RqdiYIkaa	Usually when a person brags so much about something (especially sex) that means they aren't getting it as much as they say. My advice to you is to not act like it bothers you...just ignore them and remind yourself about what I just said.<br>  <br>  If if gets to be too much for you then find other friends to spend some of your time with!  Good luck!|`|6Y6BRwDnaa	I always say he who boast the most is the one not really getting any.|`|8JV2VfOMaa	We all have things we are/arent' interested in hearing. When ppl talk too much about somthing we dont' really care about, it starts draining our energy somehow. I dont know what to suggest because I havent' figured it out for myself so far. But I understand how you feel. ;) Ps. If I get near to a solution, be sure I'll let you know.|`|9ZZzEvBFaa	Yeah i agree with everyone else, go get some and then you wont feel that way anymore|`|QJsq91ADaa	Its because youre JEALOUSE and you need to do the same thign so u can talk about it to lol<br>  or get new friends or try to ignore the stuff they saying|`|cEJGIhucaa	Well, do you ask yourself, do you feel envious, or is their promiscuousness disgusting you? If they feel a need to talk so much about it, it could be that they actually feel insecure about it... and hey,  a lot of blokes increase their sex exploits by a factor of ten every time they talk about them! If I were you, I wouldn't be intimidated by your peer's talk, everyone has different tastes, so stick with what you feel comfortable talking about. Try to steer conversations to your fave subjects when you sense that the talk is going to turn to sex. You might find that your mates see there is more to life than getting laid!|`|lYMiLj3jaa	Let me let you in on a little secret.....<br>  <br>  HALF OF THOSE STORIES ARE LIES!!<br>  <br>  All guys want to be the 'MAN' so to speak and as a result, they play the 'one up' game - If someone says something that impresses everyone, I cannot allow you to have all the glory, so I have to tell one better.<br>  <br>  - I broke my arm riding my bike and it didn't hurt - <br>  -Oh, yeah? Well I broke my hip riding a bull and I walked to the hospital! -<br>  <br>  Sound familiar?  That's just how guys are.  The reality is that they are scared of rejection and not being accepted by their peers so they think that they have to appear like they are a super pimp or player to impress other guys.  Just listen to the stories, nod your head, give them congrats, and continue being yourself.<br>  <br>  You don't have to lie to kick it with the fellas so don't.  Believe me those lies will eventually catch up to them one day.|`|ZhsPi7xcaa	You're jealous.<br>  <br>  Go find yourself a kitty and you'll have stuff to talk about, too.<br>  <br>  ~Kate|`|aufHfyu2aa	well they're just a bunch dumb-asses it sounds like...in 20 yrs they'll all be dead.|`|dwQ8BfGCaa	The main reason behind this reason is most likely that you feel left behind or that your lower than them. It is a common feeling in people and is often mistaken for jealously. One way to deal with it is change the subject. It is up to you what to do.|`|uNSLT6tBaa	cause you dont have the same experience to share who knows maybe theyre faking their stories you know *imaginary orgasm.|`|rjYOC3Wpaa	there having sex and your not?

If you are too available then he is not interested, when you ignore him then he becomes crazy about you. It is part of winning you over. |`|2a8FLwtaaa	He likes you a lot, but he's really nervous around you|`|Zg1HMXmiaa	yeah haha he totally likes you|`|mk6vYDUIaa	He likes you and is trying to play hard to get!|`|9FzzFrB4aa	i am going through exactly the same thing right now...I'm still not sure. |`|JIKY4whIaa	He's very insecure it sounds like. He can't stand it to not have you talk to him but can't stand it when you do....maybe he's a bit of a control freak, or perhpas bi-polar. Sounds kinda weird. You should probably stay away from this guy.
ji8J9k6Baa	You know~ after reading about one paragraph into the old question I didnt even need to continue~ <br>  <br>  This girl is too full of herself!!! She thinks the world is ALL ABOUT HER!!  <br>  <br>  No one deserves to be in a relationship with someone like that~ thats like living He--!!   I would not even want a best friend that was like that.<br>  <br>  A true relationship is one that is made up of compromise from both sides, and is based on unconditional love.<br>  <br>  You dont want someone thats going to try to control you by guilt!<br>  <br>  My dear~ the only love this girl has is for herself. She has made that VERY CLEAR BY THE WAY SHE TREATED YOU!!<br>  <br>  Why on earth would you want to put yourself back into that type of a relationship when there are truly good people out there???<br>  Just because your feeling lonely right now??? and shes all thats there at the moment?? Nope not good enough!  Other people want you to talk to her?? Let them get in a relationship with her, and find out how selfish she is.<br>  <br>  You live your life~ find someone that likes you for you~ and go have fun!|`|O06Ms8RQaa	If that girl was as much drama as it seemed in that old question don't bother talking to her she will probably still be full of issues don't be mean and avoid talking to her if she comes up to her cause some girls will spread rumors if you are mean to them|`|55b27233477334b407c194ffd5fb2502aa	If you guys were really best friends for a long time, maybe it's worth it to talk to her to be friends again.  But if I were you, I wouldn't date her again.  She didn't seem to treat you very well or appreciate you very much.|`|4KUWRPIVaa	you can do better|`|Rl8st4VJaa	nah stay away, shes nasty!|`|1R4dxlkaaa	let it go..they are ex's for a reason and should stay that way!|`|IIPCgK50aa	Man get over it already. If you were best friends before just go back to being that. If something is gonna happen it will. You need to man up and be mature... there is no reason in what you wrote to stop talking to her.
VqC7sjiVaa	No tiene nada de malo. Yo de hecho perdí la virginidad a los 23, con el que hoy es mi marido. Aunque para mi el respeto en una relación es algo más. Sinceramente prefiero que respete antes mis ideas, mis principios, mis valores .... que me de más importancia a como soy como persona.

tozeRMh9aa	You need to sit down with your parents and talk as maturely as you possibly can. Plan out your points and try not to cry, whine or yell. Ask them what their concerns are. Point out that you will be working on school-sanctioned activities that will have a adult monitor (only if this is true). Let them talk to the school if it will help them trust you.<br>  See if there is a compromise that you can come up with. Talk about your stress and crying at night. It's important that they know about that even if you don't get your way.<br>  Tell them about how important this stuff is to you. The reality is while you live in their house you must live by their rules. <br>  But the most important thing is to act like a grown up as much as possible so that they will treat you like one.|`|5yW0lCgEaa	It sounds like your parents are doing what's best for them and not for you.  I'm not sure what type of relationship you've had with your parents but if it's not something you can't talk about directly, consider putting your thoughts into an organized letter and giving it to them to read.  I understand their apprehensions of trusting your sister and being burned, but you are not your sister and punishing YOU for her mis-doings is not appropriate.  I can't guarantee that they will listen or respond in a positive manner, but you will be able to say that you tried to reach out to them and expresss your feelings.  You may even want to try talking to your school counselor or another adult that you trust.  Perhaps if your parents won't listen to you, they will be open to listen to someone that is in their own age group|`|a976657c90e5f3e30b05a1b7d59c8724aa	No wonder you are stressed!  You have absolutely way too many pressures on you including ones handed to you because of the way someone else is behaving!   I am furious that your parents are keeping you down and not pushing for your honours...its so narrow minded (please, I mean no disrespect and I know they are doing it because they are worried for you) but really!    Time to call in the troops - get a couple of teachers to support you and ask if they could negotiate with your parents for a couple of late nights.   Would mum or dad collect you from school?   If it would make them feel happier, organise to be collected.   As for the college applications - getting a bit stressed isn't a bad thing...gets the adrenaline going and makes you do the job and improves the performance.  Being over stressed will make you tired, crabby and tearful.  Just remind yourself that lots of people go through a lot worse and come out fine the other end.  Make sure you talk to your friends about it as sometimes just  having a good moan can make you feel loads better!  Push your parents a bit at a time for more freedom and I think it will be okay for you - its senior time - negotiate don't stomp!  Good luck.
wsDr6RMQaa	Fake it!!!  Pretend that you have confidence and act like saying hi to someone is no big deal whether or not you are scared to death. If you pretend like you have confidence 98% of the time the other person won't even notice! It's amazing how easily conversations can flow after you make the first initiative. Most people are in your position and so they are just greatful for someone to take the first step. Trust me, I am a freshman in college and without me doing that I wouldn't have made hardly any friends but now I know lots of people b/c I faked it, and the best part is, they still don't know that I pretended. |`|JsCXaedPaa	You have nothing to lose- everyone of your friends is gone, so treat this as a new, fresh start. Sometimes it helps to act first- if you act confident, eventually you WILL be confident. <br>  <br>  When eating lunch, instead of sitting alone go and ask someone if you can sit next to them.Introduce yourself, and try and talk about something you're really passionate about so that you're confident in what you're saying.<br>  <br>  Joining clubs and teams is also a really great idea- most of the time, in these situations, everyone is new to each other and so it's a great opportunity to make new friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11703558	I think you could learn a lot from a self-help book. Just try putting yourself forward. Ask a few people you know to go out to eat or go bowling. Talk to them about their interests. Soon enough you'll find you commonalities and you'll have a new friend. |`|noJmRSYGaa	do a joe from friends<br>   "how you doin?"<br>    :D|`|kw9mFkEgaa	get involved with sports and activities, even if you are not good at the sport like maybe get involved with track because you make a lot of frends, it's hard work but you do have a lot of fun<br>  also just give compliments to people maybe to a girl<br>  girl's really would admire you<br>  and just dont point your head down when walking<br>  it's hard but try to fake you confidents and dont let anyone know that you are shy almost.

CX1sBZLNaa	We don't like girls who play games. If you know a guy is interested, and if you like him, just make it obvious for him so that he can make a move. <br>  <br>  If you play games, he'll just think you're not interested and just get over you, so you both will be losers. <br>  <br>  There is a difference between not playing hard to get and being slutty. Being slutty is when the girl (before they are a couple) just throws herself at the guy, is really promiscuous etc. Not playing hard to get is when the girl shows her interest in the guy (by listening to him, calling him, being friendly/flirty with him etc.) but doesn't act slutty. <br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question, NO we don't like to  play games.|`|AA12095283	.Really like to try to win over a reluctant girl,Especially is she lets you know,she's not rejecting you.Just try harder.No girls who are good  natured and friendly,are'nt slutty|`|fAujnPDXaa	No. I don't like it at all. That doesn't mean I want someone who will just do anything with anyone. I just want a girl who likes me to be able to say so if I ask her, without playing games.

I mean, it's a fantasy thing - he wants to hear some crazy s#*t about what a whore you are but that's hard to come out of your shell like that (probably - unless of course, you are a complete whore).

AA11602135	It sounds like too many problems in this relationship to try to get back with this guy again. Somethings are best left behind and you probably should move on. How can you ever trust him again? I know its hard to let go if you feel he has a part of your heart but best to leave while he only has a little piece of it and not all of it then later on stomps on it.|`|rEBVhveZaa	this is very confusing it sounds like you two both haven't gotton over each other yet |`|HUzISSLYaa	good question!|`|3F0Ai04Oaa	Honestly..it's probably not what you want to hear, but I went through this before in high school. It wasn't fun at all. If you guys got into a physical fight what makes you think that wont happen again?. All this talk is drama drama drama. He sounds very immature. And you sound like you need to move on to the next best thing. Good Luck|`|3b79f49b0ba5db95356ea6c9d23f596caa	From what you have written, it appears to me that he is attempting to get a reaction and response from you that would make you subordinate to him .... as in starting the revised relationship with him having some type of upper hand.<br>  <br>  to get him to open up.... first understand within yourself what it is that you want for your own personal wholeness: then I would suggest being direct and explaining that you want for him to open up to you & what the details look like and feel like to you in a man being open to you.<br>  <br>  thoughts of wholeness and peace for you   : )
8RCA374Raa	don't waste yr money on  a promise ring!  the damm ring is not magical, from keeping u men from cheating , lieing,the list goes on, oviously she was disapointed by two other men that gave her one, it will be a joke to her if u gave her a prommise ring!|`|nTp7B8Zxaa	A promise ring is sort of like a pre engagment ring. It's almost like a promise to stay faithful to one another, and to be together forever. About a year ago my boyfriend got me one, and I wear it all the time, and dont take it off! <br>  <br>  Popular places are Zales, Kay Jewlers, Jared, and maybe even Tiffany & Co. <br>  They range from about 100-200 dollars really depending on what you want to spend :)|`|wfuy4Sxaaa	it's pretty much a ring you wear promising that you won't have sex until you get married.<br>  <br>  ; )|`|U3qTwOOIaa	its a very old fashioned idea from years and years ago where a girl promised herslef to a man, she would basically wear his ring to prove her love. then later on they would get engaged.  In this day I think its just a ploy for the female to get a nice ring thats all|`|IRCv14COaa	its a promise that u will never do anything to hurt them its a way of shwing that u really like this person<br>  <br>  just go to walmart there cheap like 20 bucks <br>  <br>  or target or ur lcal store
c810bbe1f8262d0bd8d1bab83b95fd1baa	Wear something skimpy, the more flesh the better.  You're going for the sizzling sllut look, the one that says "I'm banging someone tonight and it will be YOU if you smile."<br>  <br>  Simple, direct, and it does work.<br>  <br>  Oh, and bring some condoms with you, just in case he's too clueless to have planned ahead.|`|0588e387b9cbee8334c24835aea6ccc8aa	You need to tell him you are a "Cool Chick" a girl that EVERY guy wants around. You need to stop talking to him for so long, because you will get bored of him because there will be no mystery left in your relationship. Tell him you want to explore your relationship with him further, and that he could be one of those important influencing people in your life.|`|Dma9Oeg0aa	SEE GUYS WANT WOMEN TO TAKE CHARGR OF THEM THIS IS WHAT YOU DO CALL HIM OVER TO YOUR HOUSE AND ANSWER THE DOOR IN A TOWEL AND THEN IVITE HER TO THE ROOM BUT NOT FOR SEX BUT SEE IF HE WATCH YOU AS YOU GET DRESS TO GO TO DINNER OR A MOVIE IF HE WATCHS YOU THAN YOU ASK HIM IF HE SAW ANYTHING THAT HE LIKES|`|Htau1Dbgaa	Just be direct, guys dont get hints. Ask him out.|`|YOZeZXYpaa	u need to just tell him u like him and want to start dating. any hints u give he probably wont get it or he could be to shy to ask u|`|gl7UGY2baa	As per my knowledge i think u should try to avoid him for 3-4 days n he'll feel that he is missing something n than he realize tht he also feel the same wat u feel. But don't avoid him for more than 4 days coz it may goes wrong also.
dUZZPU6Laa	Just wait until he is alone, go up to him, and politely ask him if he is mad at you.  Say, "I've noticed that we haven't been talking as much lately, did I do something to make you mad?  If so I'm really sorry."  Hopefully he'll tell you whats been going on with him, if not, just ignore him and find another crush.|`|f87ef1c5d459948a29d8431faf2a6a95aa	lol...aww, don't get too worked up. highschool boys are unpredictable. you never know what idiot ideas have influenced what they do who they talk to or what they wear. i would let him go. he may have decided it's "not cool" to talk to eigth grades...who knows. but if you do talk to him. be casually friendly. say "hey...would you mind if i sat with you today?" hopefully he'd say yes. but watch out. good luck!|`|31f5af926958c9a63f4a94eb0b3505d3aa	leave the person alone
r4Ff4Mkqaa	Ok, just because someone "self harms" dosnt mean their bad people, posers, or psychos. it means they are suffering from depression and that should not be lookd down on. no one chooses to suffer from depression. Please don't catagorize people like that. and about your party, let him come. You might find out he's a really nice guy, or you might find out he's a douche bag. you never know untill you try and get to know them. First impressions are usually wrong. Good Luck and HAPPY BIRTHDAY! =D|`|yc0L86qRaa	dont call him a physco.....he needs love and support. think about it, WHY did he turn emo?i'm sure he doesnt self harm for fun. and yes, you should follow your  consicious, it's telling you either invite him or not invite him, dont lie. i think you should invite him though, give him a chance, if it gets really out of hand just tell him to to stop, politely. <br>  and HAPPY BIRTHDAY:))|`|8zIeHysqaa	Tell him that you were calling out all the names that you wanted invited to your mom or something while she was supposed to be writing them down as you called them out, but somehow she omitted the psycho's name, and you didn't doublecheck behind her.  He won't take it up with your mom, I DON'T THINK!   |`|oIjJJrGQaa	its better to just not invite him from the start then to say it got cancelled and that he later finds out. i would also just be straight with him but if u cant do that then at least tell those u did invite not to talk about it really obviously in front of him. just don't make him feel left out as that isn't a nice feeling regardless of the situation! hope this helps! x|`|292b6e70c064ba92c39108f65ad678fcaa	don't invite him if you're planning to tell him the party got canceled. Who knows what he might do...I suggest you to invite him, so you won't say to yourself in the future "WHY didn't i invite him?!WHY?!". Live your life. Live every second of it.
XmaHjQDqaa	What ever you decide, be safe and have a great time.  But there is one thing you may want to think about.  This is a milestone in your life and the next 5 years are going to be frustrating and confusing to say the least.  There will be days you find yourself wishing you could be 15 again if only for a day.  So, I suggest taking just a little time to do something you enjoy or have enjoyed as a kid.  It may be the last time you get to be a kid.  You have wished your life away wanting this day to come and you will understand that later.  Have fun, enjoy your special day, but be sure to say goodbye to childhood in a childish way!!!|`|7tLye0kdaa	Its your day!<br>  <br>  Spend it exactly how you want it no matter what it is!<br>  Dont come under any pressure! and dont make plans according to how others will look at it!<br>  <br>  If you have grandparents do spend some time with them too and c how special they will make you feel:)|`|6vWXO0d6aa	oh i know... a sweet sixteen. jk jk jk. a huge party with lots  of people. or just hang out and chill with a couple of ur friends. have a small party maybe. wat ever you do you know you HAVE to invite me.

NQoIviekaa	I think the biggest clue you gave is the "speaks in a kinder, softer voice" one.  She likes you.<br>  <br>  If you like her too, ask her out.  I can almost 100 per cent guarantee she'll say yes.|`|AA11864007	Seems like you are the shy one.  Just come out and ask her.  Perhaps she listed that name on MSN because she has recently gotten out of a bad relationship and perhaps she could use a friend like you to talk to.  But the thing you need to do is just come out and say what you feel and what you think and then let her tell you otherwise.  There is nothing worse then letting your mind play its own tricks on you and tell you what every little thing she does means or doesnt mean.  Just ask.  Get it over with and if she likes you then great if not then you can move on.

e1cd219bbe2ab556fdc5932ec17266aaaa	Federico: Yo hace muchos a?os, estuve casada durante casi 8 a?os con un hombre cuyos padres nunca me aceptaron. Terminó en divorcio. Entre otras causas, esa falta de aceptación hicieron que el matrimonio se disolviera. <br>  <br>  Creo que acá el tema no son los padres sino el novio. Ya que sos un hermano que se preocupa por su hermana cosa que me  parece muy loalble, creo que tendrías que sentarte a hablar con él a solas y preguntarle si la cosa va en serio qué actitud piensa tomar con respecto al rechazo de sus padres con tu hermana, porque para vos tu hna. está primero y no vas a permitir que sufra.  El momento de solucionarlo es AHORA que son novios, después el da?o puede ser mayor. La relación dentro de todo es reciente y si los padres están dispuestos pueden abrirse a la posibilidad de conocerla bien y no prejuzgar que, creo, que es lo que están haciendo.<br>  <br>  Nadie está hablando de que él se separe de su familia sino de que se pueda lograr una buena relación, si es que ellos quieren formar una pareja estable.   Lamentablemente los de afuera a veces, si uno de los integrantes de la pareja lo permite, influyen mucho en que ellos sigan adelante o no.<br>  <br>  Depende del novio. Pero para eso, no dejes pasar el tiempo, hablalo con él y sabrás que tenés que decirle a medida que él te diga lo que piensa. <br>  <br>  Las cartas como son y sobre la mesa. No permitas que tu hermana salga herida. Las cosas que no se aclaran de entrada se van tapando y luego estallan de la peor manera.<br>  <br>  Creo que si tenés el coraje de exponer tu pregunta acá, más lo tenés para hablar con él.<br>  <br>  Y por más que digan que tu hna. es una chiquilina...cuál es el problema?....por qué la quieren cambiar?..lquizás el se enamoró de ella por esas cualidades....<br>  <br>  Gracias Fede, ojalá yo hubiera tenido alguien que me ayudara en esa cuestión....Mucha suerte y recordá: tu hermana es más importante que él y su flia.- Cari?os.|`|5E4spuwfaa	Hola Federico: Te puedo decir que lo primero que tenes que hacer es acompa?ar a tu hermana, sobre todo si es tímida, y hacerle notar lo buena persona que es y colaborar con su autoestima. Además hacele notar, que su relación es con el novio, la persona que ella eligio y que la flia solo es un accesorio, esto para ambas partes. Es bueno, que se de una buena relación , pero al principio puede pasar que no, pero también se puede ir construyendo con el tiempo, todo esto es muy reciente, como decir algo muy rotundo. Con el tiempo la iran conociendo y se daran cuenta de que clase de persona es y si no lo hacen lo mas importante es lo que ella sabe que es y lo que su novio siente y piensa de ella y la relación que tienen. Espero que haya sido un poco de tu ayuda. Suerte, y que la Virgen los acompa?e.|`|FGOktoNUaa	hola Fede!!!!muy buena tu intenciòn de ayudar a tu hermana eso demuestra que la quieres mucho y te preocupa.El tema de la vida es siempre ese el de la aceptaciòn,y las consecuencias de si somos aceptados o no y sobre todo cuando es el problema de pareja la familia siempre mete la cuchara,puedo apreciar que tu hermana es igual de linda que tu,y tiene 3 cualidades imprescindibles en una persona dificiles de lograr,pues ser inteligente responsable y combinada con la sencillez,no tod@s lo logramos,y mas detalles que me imagino,(y te entiendo porque lo mismo me sucede y me sucediò jiji,era la novia ideal para cualquier chico)ah y no le haces propaganda,pues la verdad no peca pero puede incomdar a otros,incluyendo a los "suegros" y lo que pasa es que siendo tan perfecta como podemos ver,ya le empezarón a ver defectos,que como se viste como se comporta como habla,que si no es doble moral en fin que algun detallito "debe" tener,y lo encontraròn!!!y es que es muy infantil para su hombrecito,hay Fede!tu hermana vale mucho,y yo te lo digo sinceramente,tu hermana no tiene porque cambiar y mucho menos para darle el gusto a sus "suegrecitos",oye que sea introvertida no quiere decir que sea sangrona,y pues apenas son 7 meses que se conocen ya quien debe de gustarle es a su novio,y si a el le gusta como es tu hermana no veo necesidad de cambios,el amor es aceptar a la persona tal como es y es entre los 2,yo se que te preocupa tu hermana y eso habla muy bien de ti,pero la ùnica ayuda que le puedes dar es la de hasta ahora la de tu apoyo y cari?o filial,que muchos ya quisieramos,imaginate que alguien cambie precipitadamente su conducta para que la acepten los suegros,y luego que cambie la traten peor,no Fede,si ella tiene ganas de cambiar ella lo debe de intentar,si la familia de su novio es prejuiciosa alla ellos,yo no veo en la timidez ningun defecto,en el ultimo de los casos tu puedes ayudarla a expresarse,solo a eso,la conducta a menos que trabaje en relaciones publicas o ventas si le afecta,pues se necesita de una personalidad extrovertida,pero te repito tu hermana esta bien,y si tu,su novio y algunos mas la aceptan los demàs salen sobrando(y a los suegros no les das gusto con nada experiencia adquirida en mi persona y en mis conocidos y anexos)cuidate Fede!!!no es rega?o ok???salu2!!!!|`|HKqHdHUHaa	pues no creo que le tenga que afectar demasiado, ya que si tiene el amor de su novio, que mas da que no la quieran.|`|HuzronmAaa	lamentablemente va a tener que ser ella la que gane la confianza de sus suegros...sobre todo de la suegra...para ello deberá ser sumisa pero firme...ayudar en las comidas a lavar los platos, poner la mesa...etc...así irá ganando puntos hasta que la suegrita la considere buena ama de casa, sostén de su hijo, y todo lo que te imagines....<br>  no es fácil...algunas mueren en el intento.... pero...tampoco es imposible....ACTITUD....esa es la clave....<br>  suerte|`|SBq76XVRaa	No siempre se puede gustar a todo el mundo. Ademas a penas la conocen. Lo principal esque ella y su novio se quieran eso es lo primordial. Ella no tiene que cambiar nada de si misma. por lo que has contado me parece un encanto. Es cuestion de tiempo que esa timidez vaya desapareciendo o no pero a ella lo unico que la tiene que importar es ella misma y su pareja. En mi opinion las personas no tienen que cambiar para agradar a los demas son tal y como son. Y como tu dices tiene que ser una chica estupenda. Y si no lo ven es problema suyo no de tu hermana.<br>  Un besito.|`|dkSYZQlcaa	no depende de ti si no de ella en ver como es la forma de ser de sus suegros y ver por donde pueda llegar a agradarles , ejemplo en sus gustos y en sus disgustos tampoco digo que cambie completamnete que la acepten como es ,si no pues presenta ,suerte|`|qFz9HlhZaa	yo creo que ella tieen que ser y mostrarse tal cual es, lo importante no es que la adoren sus suegros, sino su novio, y yo pienso que si elos ven feliz a su hijo, van a terminar adorandola.<br>  mucha suerte.<br>  y ahi va una estrellita por tu pregunta, me gusto como la encaraste.<br>  kary|`|H7AEmXR7aa	la respuesta que yo te doy es la siguiente si los suegros de tu hermana no la valoran es por que a lo mejor no la conocen tambien  como tu ella debe seguir con sus buenas actitudes y conel tiempo la demas gente se dara cuenta  que tiene mucho valor como una buena persona.|`|R0DTPISIaa	ella deberia hablar con su novio, y hacerle entender que no se puede cambiar de un dia para el otro. El debe hablar con sus padres.<br>  Igual el caso me suena, que el muchacho debe ser hijo unico, o mal criado.<br>  Se nota una sobreproteccion por parte de los padres, lo cual significa que nunca les caera bien una chica que slaga con su hijo, y le buscara defectos, pues en un lugarm uy dentro, es como que les quita el afecto, que hasta ese momento era al 100% sobre los padres, y ahora lo deben compartir. Sin bien suena como esta enfermizo, el amor lleva a esos extremos, en especial cuando se trata de etapas de corte, n la s que el muchacho desea tener una vida propia, y la otra parte ( los padres), se sienten solos y abandonados, y hasta que ese hijop or el que hicieron todo, ahora se va. Ademas ellos tenian una una vida centrada en el hijo, y ahora deben reorientarla.<br>  <br>  Eso es solo tiempo, hasta que la quieran, pero no es importante lo que piensen los padres, siempre y cuando el no sea influenciado por ideas absurdas y egoistas.<br>  <br>  Es una dicision de ambos, estar juntos, y tambien la de permanecer juntos, en contra de todo.<br>  <br>  quizas sean o no compatibles, pero ellos como pareja lo deciden, y no los padres!!!!<br>  <br>  Solucion: mejorar su actitud en la vida, por ella misma, y que eso juegue a favor ,en su pareja. Cuando el hijo este bien , se reflejara, en la actitud de los padres, que a lver bien a su hijo, no les quedara otra que acpetarla, y empezar y portarse mejor con ella, y despues la querran  con el tiempo.<br>  Nunca crei, en eso de querer a gradar a los demas, y menos a los suegros, que son los mas dificles...<br>  aunque siempre hay excepciones..<br>  <br>  suerte!!!!!|`|fBeEKpFmaa	Hola:<br>  <br>       Te felicito por ser tan buen hermano y querer ayudar a tú hermana. En lo particular, pienso que la mayoría de las veces los suegros no van a aceptar de buena manera ni a los yernos ni a las nueras, si ella se ha comportado a la altura y no les convence a los suegros, con todo respeto lo digo, ese es problema de los Sres., se pierden una magnífica oportunidad de conocer a una buena persona. <br>  <br>       Yo te sugiero que no se preocupen por esos detalles ?por qué crees que los suegros (más que nada las suegras) tienen tan mala reputación?, de verdad, no es de a gratis. Que tú hermana viva su relación lo mejor que pueda, porque aunque se pare de cabeza, si no les cae a los Sres., nada más, no les va a caer y sinceramente, e insisto, eso problema de ellos.<br>  <br>       Suerte, que les vaya bien, bye.|`|gTLl5pcYaa	Buen día,<br>  De antemano te sugiero que tu la aconsejes mucho, y le digas que es lo que tu piensas que esta haciendo mal, porque es muy difícil que nosotros atreves de ti la aconsejemos pues nadie como tu que convives con ella para ver que posiblemente este haciendo mal. y así la puedas ayudar a que mejore sus conducta hacia sus suegros.|`|pPDnAWLgaa	hay un dicho y muy bien dicho que dice "no somos moneditas de oro pa caerle bien a todos" y  en este caso creo que no tiene de que preocuparse, si sus suegros no la aceptan no deberia de tomarle tanta importancia, total al que quiere es al novio, es decir, yo considero que para los padres lo importante es ver que sus hijos esten con una persona que los trate bien, en todos los aspectos, si su novio le da su lugar como su novia, si la respeta y la trata bien, creo que ella deberia de sentirse feliz, pues aun a pesar de sus suegros el no lo considera un impedimento, y quiza con el tiempo al ver que su hijo esta feliz con ella la van a ir aceptando, si tu hermana es chiquiada o no, si es timida o no, y si les parece o no, pues ni modo, ella no puede cambiarlo y menos para darle gusto a otros, quizá eso es lo que hizo que su novio se fijara en ella. <br>  <br>  espero que no se siga preocupando por esas cosas cuando hay cosas mas importantes en esta vida, que disfrute su relación en pareja ya que eso es lo que deberia importarle.|`|oJh6CLDDaa	?Sabés qué Fede?<br>  <br>  Coincido casi por completo con la respuesta que te dio "Sirenita".<br>  <br>  La cuestión es muy simple: El amor de VERDAD, es espiritual y surge por una gran identificación entre ambas personas en una gran cantidad de cosas de la vida que los motiva a intentar realizarlas entre ambos, en equipo.<br>  Abriéndose camino en la vida, como en una lucha "a capa y espada" dispuestos hasta a morir juntos en el intento, contra viento y marea tan sólo por estar con el otro que es quien está por sobre cualquier otra cosa o persona de la vida.<br>  <br>  Resulta evidente que los padres de él son de los egoístas manipuladores que intentan que ella "se adapte" a sus mentalidades y costumbres, en lugar de aceptarla tal como es y la quiere el hijo (tu posible futuro cu?ado), Ni siquiera se molestan en comprender, no sólo a ella, sino al propio hijo.<br>  <br>  Si el novio de tu hermana no puede poner los puntos sobre las íes, como corresponde, más vale que deberán pensar en hacer "vida aparte" de los padres de él y que esos padres LO TENGAN CLARO.<br>  <br>  Pero si el mismo novio no quiere hacerlo o pone excusas de argumentación débil... más le valdría a tu hermana no correr el riesgo de formar una pareja que no la respeta en todo lo que debiera y terminará haciéndole más da?o que beneficio.<br>  <br>  El argumento básico es ?con quién se casará? ?Con el novio o con los suegros? ?A quién debe gustarle y ser aceptada tal como es, sino al novio?<br>  <br>  Pero si el novio no hace (o intenta de verdad a toda costa) que sus padres la respeten por el amor que tienen hacia él, ya está evidenciando que es incapaz de defenderla también en otros aspectos de la vida y que su amor es MUY POBRE.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que el AMOR incluye respeto y hace respetar a lo amado, como también da y defiende la libertad del ser amado, aún para equivocarse por más que duela (y debe ser una actitud recíproca, no solo de tu hermana hacia él).|`|25ecfd38fa5d05d6d24bdf53298d9c35aa	mira en primera aunque los papas son papel importante en una relacion   te dire que no lo son el 100%    el principal aqui seria el novio y nadamas.....    ok mira que sea  bienc on el chavo mientras el chavo le guste y la quiera y todo eso es mas que suficiente...   aparte no somos moneditas de oro para caerles bien a todos  y no debe  ni tiene que preocuparse por nada  no se va casar con ellos  acaso con el chavo.... que sea como ella es y punto y final  que sea siempre ella  no tiene por que cambiar nada de nadaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.............   asi quemejor aconsejale atu hermana que no se preocupe que le heche ganas al amor y que deje alo suegros a un lado que importan  ya despues con el tiempo se iran dando cuenta y yaaaaa n o  nadamas ok  jajaja  me esalto!!!!!!|`|817fafac898ed171e9b392a4a450cc18aa	Creo que si su conducta es buena ella no tiene por que cambiarla y menos por los suegros. Yo le aconsejaria que siguiese su relacion como si nada, dejando un poco de lado la relacion suegristica y dedicandose solo a su chico. Con el tiempo ellos se daran cuenta de que ella es como es y que si es la eleccion que hizo su hijo bueno, esta bien.<br>  Si no lo entienden asi esta claro que son unos cerrados y necios y en ese caso son ellos los que deben cambiar, no te parece?|`|DDnpiV4Baa	corazon mientras se quieran tu hermana y el novio d tu hernana mas q suficiente<br>  pareja son 2 los d afuera son d palo<br>  decile a tu hermana algo q yo digo siempre:<br>  haz la tuya y lo demás q se la lleve put@|`|bwbBMgZ1aa	Te felicito por que sos un buen hermano y se ve que queres mucho a tu hermana,por que te preocupas por ella<br>  Prero pienso que vos no podes hacer nada ,es ella la que debe tratar de cambiar ,ser mas conversadora simpatica amable dejar la timidez <br>  Hace poco que esta de novia solo 7 meses ,me resulta extra?o que ya conozca a los padres de su novio <br>  ?Cuantos a?os tienen los tortolitos?<br>  Los padres de el no creo que no la quieran pero es muy pronto anticiparse alos sentimuentos que tienen ellos hacia ella<br>  DEbe ser una impresion que ella tiene de que no la aprecian <br>  pero no tengas muy en cuenta sus palabras por que la gente timida tiene reacciones extra?as piensan que la gente la rechaza ,que no la quiere ,pero son actitudes negativas <br>  por que a ella les cuesta relacionarse socialmente|`|p23oxseXaa	:) esas actitudes las tiene mi novia !! ella tiene 22 a?os y es toda una ninia<br>  <br>  es muy feo cuando no lo aceptana  uno como es, creo q ella tendria q saber q hay veces en q uno se tiene q adaptar a las cosas, osea, situaciones y personas.. <br>  pero por otro lado , creo q ella no debe cambiar, porque es "ella" originalmente ella y sus suegros tedrian q entenderla un poquito..<br>  te sugiero amigo, q le propongas una reunion con sus suegros , cara a cara suegros y tu hermanita, y q resuelvan sus problemas, porque son problemas q a la larga puede perjudicar su relacion.<br>  ella le tendria q preguntar a sus suegros, cual es el problema en aceptar una chica como ella.. no es dificil poder ser un poquito tolerante y dejar un poco de lado a la discriminacion.<br>  <br>  bueno espero averte eyudado un poco<br>  saludosa tu hermana ;)
GcNFoIDmaa	compliments are nice :)<br>  just say, "wow, you look really pretty"<br>  and just look into her eyes.<br>  then she'll know.<br>  |`|m8I8bVvraa	to flirt with her put your arm around her and walk around talking to her with your arm around her shoulder.  Also compliment her like wow you look gorgeous today or something like that.  Oh! And if you really like her you should ask her out.  One night after you guys hung out and had a really good time take her on a "walk" or just leave your group of friends and then say something like, "You know I love hanging out with you and you are one of the cutest girls I have ever met.  I really like you" and then ask her who she likes.  And if she says no then ask her out on the spot.  Just be like will you go out with me?  and then take her on a romantic date.  :)|`|o60ZhKCMaa	she prolly likes, i know i don't txt guys i don't like, if she laughs at the stuff you say that also a good sign. invite her to hang out wit you again and compliment her and just flirt with her. try making a move by kissing her at the end of the night, if she pulls back, she don't like u, if she kisses back, she like you. then ask her out. |`|cgGJUMchaa	Nice to hear you've found interest! Just be honest with her and your self.  She probably does like you and you need to be open with her, so text her a nice little note or even better and just talk to her.

She will come up with excuses not to get together if she has a boyfriend.|`|JhhNaQDvaa	One And Only Way --------- Ask Her.........<br>  But Girls , ya know <br>  they sometimes even lie...........its very difficult..........<br>  Another option is 'follow her' but if u get caught just run there's no turning back...................|`|LtJU1Ld4aa	um you ask her?|`|c92f72cfa72482cc99c74fb7674b226daa	You ask her upfront. Don't try to surmise if she is. JUST ASK.
cd0KLq0Kaa	First of all, it's never a good thing to go out with a friends ex. It usually causes huge problems with the friend. There are many others out there, and it is not necessary to cross paths with your friends. Also if there is someone you're interested in,there is nothing wrong with a little honesty. Go ahead and let your feelings be known. How else will you find out if they're interested in you as well?  One other thing. If your friends know that you like someone, they should back off. They shouldn't try to step on your toes if they are truly friends.|`|nN3HANaWaa	wow,your friend is LOUD.Tell her to tell her other friend that she really likes him,is it okay to date him etc..If she can't get over herself,think of some way to make her say it's okay,find a new guy or do something that makes her get over it.If it's still useless,well,it's better to let go if you think the friendship is worth keeping.After you make sure that she's not going to be offended or anything,then go out with the guy you like.Ask him out,flirt with him,all those stuff.Good luck with it.

Sex isn't bad for you unless you're a kid, in which case...shame on you.  2 weeks isn't very long, and sex everyday at that point is normal.

But under 18, it's not good for you in the long run.  For one, if she wants it all the time and you don't give in then she can go to someone else for this.  Secondly, if you can do it and satisfy her every time she wants it you may increase your chance of getting her pregnant.  Third and most important, if your relationship is based solely on sex then you may find yourself in a bad situation when the sex is not there, especially for her.  Bottom line, whether or not your +18 or under 18, a relationship based solely on sex will run dry at some point in time.  Having other things in addition to lots of good sex (for +18 yo) will make your relationship strong and lasting.|`|bda2611060a2d3a60b737b3e3bc38d4caa	Is this a bad thing? It's certainly not bad for your health. Don't you want to have sex with her? If not, tell her. I don't know how you tell her..personally I would feel hurt, unattractive and inadequate as a woman if my boyfriend told me this. There might be a few reasons she keeps wanting sex:<br>  a) she wants to please you 'cause she really likes you<br>  b) she finds it hard to talk to you, so she sees this as an alternate way of connecting with you<br>  c) she really enjoys the sex|`|rtQAZABmaa	i like this question basically she dont want you for you she just wants sex and any girl ready to give up on the 1st or 2nd week is a whore straight up but if you're not that type of person that give it up easily let her know she aint the one for you and you're willing to wait until you git married or whatever but if you are go for cause any girl like that you aint the onli person she givin it to|`|n2L9aQPQaa	Maybe she thinks this is something you want. Maybe she thinks by having sex with you often, she'll be able to keep you. If you're uncomfortable with having sex so often, maybe she isn't the right girl for you. But, if you care for her a lot, than address it, things develop into larger issues when they aren't addressed.|`|k8cxtt1iaa	You think once a day is more than enough?

Obviously, you two are not a good fit - it's like trying to put a square peg into a round hole. Either that, or all of your kids are a bunch of loons, and you should ignore them and continue the relationship.<br>  <br>  I personally would give my kids a benefit of the doubt.

It's a mistake to give children the power of approval over your relationship.
aR8fwFW8aa	My husband and I eloped 20 years ago.  I have never ever regretted that decision.  It was just the two of us at the courthouse in jeans  -  so us!<br>  <br>  This was a third marriage for both of us, we each had a daughter, and we just wanted to quietly make it legal.  We did get a few gifts from friends - totally unexpected (I  mean it was our 3rd marriage!)<br>  <br>  We are renewing our vows in Hawaii on 11/28/08 - our official 20th.  Again, eloping!  Just the two of us.  I really wouldn't have it any other way.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I think you are making the right decision.  And, if you want to have a party after you get back, you can get gifts then.  I totally understand the gift thing!  It seems like I have given out hundreds over the years.|`|32VP6BBpaa	Not sure I should answer, I haven't eloped yet. We're getting married April 1. We chose to elope for some of the reasons you did. Attention and money. We're hiring a photographer though, it's still our wedding day and we still want pictures. There's no reason why you can't hire one, some places even offer elopement packages that includes them.  We will be in a traditional dress and suit. Even though we're going alone, our elopement isn't a secret. We're planning it out, and everyone who should know, knows. We have gotten some gifts already even though we haven't had any showers. <br>  <br>  Some people have small receptions and parties after they elope. We don't want one, but maybe that would be an option for you. Some couples even hire a videographer to record their ceremony and play it at these parties. <br>  <br>  I don't have any advice about what your family would think. Our families and friends, if they're hurt or mad, they haven't said so. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|zd6lRfIXaa	My sister and her husband eloped. They went to Tennessee and got married in a chapel there. It was just the two of them, but they were able to get a package with a cake, tuxedo rental (she took a dress), and a TON of pictures... All for around $500. Then they were already there for their honeymoon! When they got back, they had a barbecue party so all the family could get together and celebrate... And give gifts! Don't feel selfish about the gifts. Years of giving does give you the right to receive! ;)|`|sJXjzgh5aa	when my parents 'used' to be cool, they ran off to vegas and eloped.<br>  then they came home and had the wedding that had been planned although they were already secretly married.  no one knew about the elopement except for my mom's sisters.  <br>  my dad let it slip last year when we were discussing his anniversary date (he still cant remember after 25 years) and i guess that secret has been locked up tight because ive never seen him mumble and get mixed up with words so fast before.<br>  <br>  now, they've got a stick up their ***.
wzpCMI44aa	Well, if you wanted to travel to Ohio, I have just the spot for you. You'd want to plan the wedding for Autumn, as the trees and leaves are just AMAZING that time of year. How about the John Bryan State Park in Yellow Springs/Clifton, OH? <br>  <br>  For the honeymoon, I'd suggest the Yellow Springs Country Bed & Breakfast. I actually had the first wedding there myself and am now their official photographer. The women who run it are amazing and so kind and helpful. I would highly recommend them!<br>  <br>  Plus, Yellow Springs is a very unique town here in Ohio. They're hippie/green/earth-friendly/organic and there are plenty of things to see and do.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ovnMPPhraa	Glacier National Park in Montana is gorgeous.|`|S5dtWq8jaa	Congrats~I got engaged on Rock Island and it is absolutely beautiful place to be.  I would consider going there to get married if it wasn't 5 hrs away...you have to take a ferry from Door County to Washington Island, then a small boat to Rock Island.  No cars are allowed there; they only camp-in campsites.  You will have to bring everything you need to have the wedding there (maybe from Washington Island??).  I think it is the best kept secret in Wisconsin!|`|RgFTYvoIaa	Where are you located? Yosemite National Park in California has beautiful scenery.

3Phjz0NMaa	Well, that's a problem right there, you're already lying to him.<br>  Depending how old you are and how old he is, that can get him in some serious shyte.<br>  And sorry to break this to you, but a boy saying your hot is like saying "I love you" on a first date, it doesn't mean nothing. As a whole, boy's think anything with two legs that open and a big of *** puffed out in back is hot and a boy's saying you hot pretty much means "you're decent looking enough to bang", sorry boys.<br>  And, really, girl? Haha, wow. If you want him to like you, when you go skinny dipping, tell him how much you want his hard manhood sliding up and down your moist insides, I bet my life he'll like you alot then.<br>  <br>  But for future references, boys are *****, really, they're hella nice to you at first, once they've gotten what they want they turn into jackasses. I swear this to you, but please, all I can do is off my opinion, don't just fall pussy over heals for this guy, make him work for it. Maybe seeing that you’re not stupid like other girls will make him like you, eh? Take it from me, I’ve put out to both sexes like a restaurant giving free samples, don’t screw up this early.|`|ZLTCPEpbaa	Well.. it all depends on your age. You sound really young to me and if you are the age I think you are (14) you probably shouldn't be behaving the way you do. You're looking at a *really* messed up future, kiddo.<br>  <br>  A relationship that began with a lie never got anywhere. At your age, guys only want you for sex, and you sound really immature: "omgoshh hes hottt" ???<br>  <br>  Go ahead, thumbs down me. But this is the blunt truth.<br>  <br>  Yea so first he'll skinny dip, then he'll say you're beautiful, then he'll say that he's never felt this way about any other girl, then you'll think he's in love with you and have sex with him, and voila, another teen mother. <br>  <br>  And then he'll abandon you, cos 1) he never loved you anyway, he just wanted a 'gina to screw, and 2) you lied to him, so that'll make him mad, 3) if you're 14, he's 16, you're both underage and shouldn't be having sex, 4) you'll be alone, and a teenage mother with a 99% chance of going nowhere in life, 5) If he's over 18 and you're under, you could put him in *JAIL*<br>  <br>  Better hear it now than at an abortion clinic and when your dead baby haunts you in your dreams forever.|`|veZ0o1RUaa	be honest with him and it seems like he just wants you for sex<br>  don't give in, don't let him take advantage of you to please him<br>  what do YOU want yourself? remember your dignity, and the consequences, and what your parents would say to this. |`|NkedDb5paa	go with him! if you really like him than tell him later when he already likes you so it wouldnt matter<br>  good luck!!!<br>  please answer mine <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqmeUGOMTNnicd0JApg.Tvzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081013120901AAM1XPu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dIMa7LdWaa	As long as hes not older then 18, go skinny dippin or just keep flirtin with him.

HH56ptnNaa	the lingering possibility of rejection|`|ddbVXDgAaa	i don't find it hard to talk to them. i find it hard to know what to say. so if i had something to talk about i would totally do it. doesn't bother me.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	because you're scared of rejection. Simple as that. The best advice i could give you is to never have any expectations when u go up to someone. The guys i find attractive are always the ones that don't seem like they're truly that bothered. The ones i can talk to and get along with, but surprise me by not making flirtatious remarks or asking for my number. It intrigues me, and makes me want to know more. They don't seem in the slightest bit desperate, and they don't blow their own trumpet either. Worse than seeming desperate are the ones that tell you about how much money they earn or what possessions they have. Better to find out the amazing things about u hap-hazardly, little by little, so the girl starts to think, "hey this is a good conversation. This guy's quite intriguing and i'd like to know more". u see? Good luck with it. And remember, we don't bite!! They ones who do are SO not worth it! remember, one day their looks will fade and all they will be left with is a bitter attitude and memories of the days they were beautiful.|`|uybAtO7Yaa	It's because you are afraid of being rejected.

JXPQliz3aa	i dont think you shouldnt be friends. you have to stay friends. maybe oif you start doing little things for her like tell her she looks nice on days she doesnt and stuff shell realize your amzing. and chances are her boyfriend doesnt exactly like the fact you two are so close and might break up with her or something, but as long asd your there for her and your still nice and the same you that you are now, you two will end up dating you sound like a really nice guy, and she would be insanely lucky to have you.|`|YhYRLspLaa	I think that you are on the right track go your seperate ways|`|mkQDDgMHaa	well maybe try dateing other girls to get your mind off her,and try not to hang out as much,its not going to be easy but i promise you will be ok .who knows maybe there could be something later down the road with u guys and unfortunetly we always want something we cant have ,but i think u should definetly start dating and have fun with it,and hopefully u can still keep her as a friend just try not to get to personal with her that will make it even tougher keep a little distance ,good luck
gdAhrfOYaa	what were you trying to prove by suggesting to go separate ways? were you trying to make her feel guilty for not liking you?  you're doing a wrong thing if that's the case.<br>  <br>  you should actually stay close with her, don't give up now.  yeah she may not like you and you may be in the friend zone but who knows what the future holds.  her and her boyfriend might split and she will then need you for comfort and then would be your chance.  but start preparing yourself for that by building some attraction with her so that she can look at you in another way than just friends.

c8a70c26e27453869cec3cd200977d57aa	If he talks to you more, that means he does like you. By the you've put it, it does indeed seem like he likes you too. He may be shy and wants YOU to say it so that it is confirmed, once you do that you can kiss him or something.<br>  <br>  --
h0xEE3fqaa	same thing happened to me after prom<br>  <br>  almost the same thing, word for word<br>  <br>  he came around though, just hang out with him whenever you can and be as sweet as possible<br>   <br>  i hope it works<br>  it is an annoying feeling, i know!|`|jojur4Uhaa	It seems like he definately liked you maybe you lost feelings for you and is looking at another girl or most likely just wants your relationship to stay strickly out of the school doors i say sit him down and talk about it maybe he is just pulling back because he thinks you feel a different way about him|`|h0z5S6BSaa	You can only be cool too and don't start to act desperate.  This stuff happens to all of us, guys and girls.  Patience is a virtue, remember that!|`|8l65wkYNaa	maybe he really likes you.... he acts weird during you're math class maybe becoz he won't let any of your clasm8s notice him that he likes you..... that's my opinion.... |`|EUdor2Uwaa	thats a lot of trouble to go for a girl you do not like. I say he likes you.|`|X3Q3nXoRaa	hmm this is confusgin. i hate when guys do that! well its hard to say cuz some guys just dont think anything abotu what they come off as. most guys arent going to be showing that much excitement or w/e cuz they dont want to seem gay, but if he went thru all that to ask you to homecoming then i think he likes you. i think that maybe hes just not the type of guy to act differently afterwards. i know its like confushing,  but dont get upset or act like ur mad, just casually ask him whats going on- say something liek hey, so i had a great time with you and id really like to keep hanging out with you more. see what his reaction is-if hes like fidgeting or like uhhhh then hes prolly just thinkin its a one time thing. if he acts like he wants to hanf out again like ya thatd be fun or soehing like that then hes feelin it too. good luck!!
68c0a470a9b2d166fae302fd0d7b03c8aa	No that's not true because if her 1st love doesn't work out then she'll keep moving on with her life and fall in love multiple times until she finds someone she knows she wants to spend in the rest of her life with. It could take one try but not necessarily. It could take up several times.|`|AA12346188	Yes.<br>  But they do not mind having variety entertainment.|`|R1xlYacCaa	no that is not true, a woman call fall in love as many times as her heart will let her.  when a woman loves, she loves with everything that she has.  |`|Np6vDWO5aa	not really. but yes a girls will nevr forget her first love thats true. ifher first love was ver good and supportive definetely she may choose him as the last love but cant be sure. what if the first love was a fraud??? she may lookfor somenone else but she will never forget the first one |`|AK1uyEc0aa	man in which century are you living in? you know my female friends change their bf's at least once a month and you say that girls can be loyal?|`|bLTwL3zEaa	no|`|mbV6U8QUaa	No and Yes....she will never forget her 1st love...but will move on if it is not True...so its both....depending on situation...!!!

35326f7ca030bc54df0e73b87c5284c7aa	Personally I would find it great to have a girlfriend who has not had a boyfriend, not because she might be a virgin, but because her perspective of "men" would hopefully not be soured by bad experiences.  There would be a specialness (and a big responsibility) of being the first man to woo her heart.  They say that your first love is always the strongest.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Because in 2008, men still feel inclined to be the first man to have intimacy with a virgin. They automatically think, that if a girl is 18, she is a virgin and they have to be the first !! Those in their late 20's or early 30's, don't want the thrill of the "emotional part" of a virgin. |`|3SNhXpf0aa	Because they feel safe. They dont have to worry about being inexperienced because the girl is just as inexperienced as he is.|`|uTdDFcSjaa	There's a huge difference between the dating practices of 18 and 27 year olds. <br>  <br>  I'm thinking there would be MAJOR concerns raised with a chick who'd never had a real relationship by the time she was 21, much less 27.|`|WicEEMOmaa	guys think that if you havent had a boyfriend that you are cleaner and more pure... and they like that you have nobody to compare them to in your head...|`|gv0aTZSlaa	Exactly i want to know the answers as well,lemme see, the answers you get.|`|8cd6f71a520f4fcd36ea7320aa8e0e44aa	 for self confidance would prefer some1 less exprienced. but otherwise would prefer some1 who knws d game.|`|wjB6181Aaa	i don't know for sure but it could be to do with they might think they are still a virgin as they may or may not want to be the first guy |`|XM0a9VaIaa	Well from personal experience guys think its weird if you havent had a boyfriend but i have no idea why |`|wg04sfuUaa	simply innocence
wcBjzEPsaa	well if he told your friend, and you might like him, why don't you try to hang out with him in a few days and flirt a little / little more. see how he reacts. i HATED one of my girl friends guy friends, i wouldnt talk to him at all. well, after a while the same thing happened and we dated for a while. <br>  <br>  so i guess you truly never know until you try, right?|`|5zr20mxCaa	omg, u need to get to know the guy MORE!<br>  <br>  you "think" you like him?<br>  love is not a mybe thing, and u really have to know him for sure.|`|2lqlyC2Waa	i think u both like eachother, but you're both actin 2 shy. just let him kno how u feel if u really like him. its that simple ;-)|`|GXqDLt8Zaa	hangout wiht him some more.<br>  ask him out somewhere...<br>  get to know him more.<br>  then see if you REAllY like him<br>  then BAM! ask him out babygirl|`|yRv2uhR7aa	tell him how you feel.<br>  he should feel the same cuz he been talkin 2 u every night

BUT on the other hand if the reason you went out with her was more, remember the things you liked and try to tell her about your pet peeves and such.|`|7f6RdfJ7aa	Your a guy never bargain your relationship or drop your standards.

f2ff10ee1f165a8a13d3f1a2286c4d98aa	Wait for guy #1! You will regret it the rest of your life if you don't! Never give up on someone you truly love, just because someone flashes an engagment ring or money. Stay with guys #1. They say the grass is always greener on the other side. Keeping that in mind, as soon as you and #2 get engaged  you're gonna wish you stayed with #1.
cY5O8p0oaa	i think it's natural. Everything loses its novelty eventually. There's nothing wrong with that though and you can try and turn it around. Why don't you both try something different, either in your daily lives, or possibly in the bedroom. I know you said the sex is still good, but there's always room for improvement! =P<br>  <br>  You could also try spending time apart.

Ask her out on a date.|`|7ZTEeN3Haa	I think that the sign is she has not spoken to you in a while. She obviously knows your number so whats her problem? Did she text you to ask for a favor? If so that's a red flag.<br>  <br>  If women like guys they call them, and call them just for the hell of it. It sounds like she wants to keep you on that friend/like a brother list.
ToILKl6waa	Some people are just naturally sensitive. What you can do as a good friend and confidence booster is keep caring for and supporting your friend. When he is pessimistic and says negative things, argue and say that it's not so bad. Or whatever the case may be.<br>  <br>  When he has days when he looks in any way unhappy, act genuinely concerned and tell him he can talk to you. Give him your trust and listen to him. Point out things that he has like a family and tell him how it can always be worse. Relate it to your life and how he may have some things that you don't. Also, it always helps to remind him that the future always gets better. He is in control and he has to have faith in his potential. Best wishes.|`|nLMifJfVaa	Get him a girlfriend that'll cheer him up for sure,|`|h93BIVd2aa	Sounds like he has lost all his confidence, just be a good friend and also listen to what he has to say.

W3HQwrgBaa	Since I'm 6' 2", I would feel very awkward.|`|730e891c7e55971ff8a6964521abea38aa	I'm 5.6" tall and my short stature had always been an impediment for achieving poise and self-confidence. It was about two years ago that I met my wife and we almost instantly made connection. She is about half an inch shorter than me but I would always feel a little insecure whenever she wore sandals. This would make her look much taller than myself. Not that anything wrong with that but society collectively feeds us with some stereotypes and a guy shorter than a woman would always raise eyebrows. My wife (who back then was my girlfriend) was conscious of myself being a little uneasy. She started coaching me on improving my dress coordination and also suggested that I should try wearing those Walktall shoes. Doing a little research myself I gathered some info on stretching exercises. Although it’s true that exercises will not make you grow taller but it definitely helped me improve my posture. We certainly have more height hidden behind our slouched back and shabby dressing than we ever realize. There are some very basic stretching exercises and vertical fashion techniques that together can make a noticeable improvement in one’s height. And lastly it’s all a matter of perception. It all boils down to how we perceive ourselves. A better height can add to our confidence, but again, it’s our mind that perhaps makes us insecure. Some short dudes possess endless energy that makes their presence much taller than their height.  You can follow the link below to get more info on posture exercises and some basic visual height enhancement techniques:<br>  <a href="http://www.walktallshoes.com/grow-taller.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.walktallshoes.com/grow-taller...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1d768e7a234d9ca7dba0589db675d2eaaa	It wouldnt really matter for me ..  i been with girls taller and shorter then me.. their height doesnt determine how their personality is or humor..  ..   either one is just fine with me...|`|9jVOtuuJaa	ooooh i feel your pain. i'm tall myself.. and i'm ASIAN.. asian girls are short.. but me.. damn.. i'm like an ogre.. ahaha. noo but yes it's soo normal to feel horrrible about dating a guy shorter than you.. dude. i wish i can wear heels with my bf. soo don't feel horrible or shallow. but i feel the exact same!! :)

81ba9e29c8d8522419be34537c790133aa	It is hard being on your own, even a short distance from your family. Mothers were made to worry,I know . My oldest daughter did the same thing moved 2000 miles away then broke up with her boyfriend called home wanted money for a place so on and so on. The best advise I have would be talk to your family on a daily basis if possible and let them know you are okay . I am sure your mother has faith in your judgments even if she does not say it.|`|b0da2911ca503a64885add2620126818aa	If you are of age, the apron strings must be cut sometime.  Good luck.  Lori

I reccomend talking to your girlfriend about it. If she doesnt have a problem with it i dont think it makes you a bad boyfriend, if she does and you would like to quit you might want to look up some counslers in your area.|`|91dd90bc592f3359016be7d23fc02b3aaa	So his options are porn or cheating with strippers?  Wow, that's stunning.<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is that she's going to be your wife and you should talk to her about this, preferably now before the marriage.<br>  <br>  Find out how she feels about it.  She may be cool with it, especially depending on what you mean by porn.<br>  <br>  If it hurts her, you have to ask yourself if you love her enough to stop.  If it hurts her and you won't stop, do her a favor and don't marry her.|`|AA10726404	There are two kinds of guys.  Those at look at porn and those that don't.  The latter, are liars.<br>  <br>  As long as you are not totally obsessed and ignoring your girlfriend, I don't see a problem.  She'd probably rather you do this than hang out in bars cheating on her or going to strip clubs.|`|hd9AcbEHaa	i have no idea if your a bad boyfriend because i dont know you and you cant expect us to judge if your a bad boyfriend just based on that... but i have no idea WHY you proposed to her in the first place, since its obvious that you dont love her near as much as you say you do. if shes not good enough, save her the trouble and break up with her... find someone prettier or better or whatever the heck it is youre wanting..and dont marry this girl since shes not good enough.|`|4viHKDKIaa	not only you are a bad boyfriend but also a bad person shame on you|`|AA10634854	I dont really think there is no harm in looking at it.

But some people it can make he/she feel like he/she doesnt mean alot to you. You should go with how she feels and if she doesn't mind then its cool, but if it does then you should respect it.

3259d7fcc72545f67e78fa6dc2b97998aa	That occupation calls for a goo hustle, you know playing the role.  <br>  He may be reminiscing about the old days but he is with you and has a job in a bank, obviously he is trying to move on with his life ( I am sure the money he makes now doesn't compare to the dough he was raking in as a stripper/escort) by taking a "regular, every day" job.<br>  Unless he is giving you a better reason other than reminiscing then give him a chance, people do change.|`|AA11714935	This sounds like a question of jealousy. Jealousy is about a lack of trust. Do you or don't you trust him? If you can  think about that and say yes, continue on with the relationship and leave the past in the past. If you can't decide or if the answer is no, the relationship has no chance and it's time to go. You say he's still bringing up his past. Have you talked to him about your feelings when he does this? He may not even realize it bothers you  unless you say something about it.|`|OKIUZOBfaa	I'd say only if you can deal with the reality of the job. Male strippers often times are much more physical with the women than the other way around. At female clubs guys are generally not allowed to touch the woman. However in a male strip club, the women are encouraged to touch the men, in some cases they become REALLY physical and sexual. Alot of times after the show, the women come up and want to have personal encoutners with the dancers. He may have some stalkers<br>  <br>  Some women can deal with it others cant. Me personally, I couldn't. You have to know yourself to get the answer to this questions, before you even evaluate him and what he does about those situations. I wish you the best.

Why can't he get a woman his own age? It's illegal for a reason. I would speak to your parents before you decide anything. Please, please, please don't do anything with this guy.  Cut him off. I'm sure that if you are as lovely he says you are, then you can find a hundred other guys your own age who will get you, and respect you a heck of alot more than that guy.  I am really worried about you, even though i don't know you, because i have seen way too many stories about abused or hurt children to not be.|`|8rKZWmZVaa	well 99% of people on Yahoo would say he's a pedophile. im the 1% dat thinks he could actually like u. u shul kno whetehr his intentions are good or bad. as long as he doensnt try to get in ur pants too soon, ur good to go|`|hmeMZ6ySaa	First of all he's 28, and talking to a 15 year old girl like he is, he might have issues like i don't know, pedophilia.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't do anything at all. You should stay away as far as possible!
8Gs7pTBaaa	I know how you feel dude...<br>  Im 18 and havent had a date either...<br>  lets just keep our heads up because when the right person comes...we'll know...

CX1sBZLNaa	If you like the other guy more than your BF and he asks you out, then dump your BF.
8adb98a4bf8348e3249823c0b04b4d38aa	i think if you like him you ned to stop playing games and tell him that you like him.
oen5x1Bgaa	I hate the feeling of "missing the boat." Especially when, like a week later, you say to yourself "OMG, she was hitting on me, and i said nothing!" I know it feels bad, but there's not much you can do about it if she's moved on. You can try to respark those old feelings, but its not a garauntee.|`|KMtD5OjJaa	People want what they can't/don't have.

vtclMptpaa	Ok so the one you really like laughs at dumb jokes. Ask her to go to a funny movie with you (have a specific one picked out before you ask). You should be able to tell by the way she acts if shes into you. <br>  ~Don't ask her out in front of your backup!<br>  ~If she says no wait a few days, maybe a week, before you try the backup girl. You may shock her and she may say no or whatever but really just need to talk it over with her friends...some girls have to get second opinions. Which is why you cannot run from her to another girl! They probably talk!<br>  Good Luck!|`|FSMZyIo1aa	The worst thing the girl can say to you is that she don't like you the same way and that isn't that bad you can still be her friend so go for it ask her out.  If it don't work then you have a back up.
NprvAB4Waa	this is bad<br>  espically if his best friend is your boyfriend you either need to tell him that you're starting to feel like there's something more and you dont like it<br>  and end it<br>  or just seperate yourself from that.<br>  <br>  DONT lead him on or flirt back in anyway possible<br>  you'll **** yourself and him and your boyfriend up<br>  so just dont.<br>  talk to him<br>  dont try and be cute or funny just talk to him|`|Wy69CWLQaa	hmmm i definatly think he has a litttle crush, well next time he asks you to hang out just say"yeah id love too but just as friends, right" that way you know that hes either interested or not and he know that your not interested, in like the nicest form ever.|`|XKDVLj3uaa	He either likes you are he's playing some sort of cruel game.  If I were you, I would try to separate myself from either him or the situation.  If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you might consider telling your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Jacob<br>  <a href="http://theadvicesite.com" rel="nofollow">http://theadvicesite.com</a>
754c8d292f978fa8bf6dd8a464986deeaa	what are you shy ? Where ever,when ever you see her next start with a big smile and full eye contact. That a sure way to get her attention. Then next time you see her in the halls ask her if she is stalking you,also with a big smile.The name of the game is communication,do it in any manner possible ,just make sure not to chase her ,if you know what mean,women take that as a threat,as they should. keep it fun and  honest ,I bet you will sweep her off her feet.
lySBBYBKaa	Wow text speak on forums is really annoying.  (Sorry..)  Don't know really coz I don't know what she likes....perfume?  earrings?  What are her hobbies?
o2dnH9WAaa	??<br>  <br>  Of who? Anybody? More details.|`|kxzBNeHnaa	no
dUZZPU6Laa	I would just tell him what your dad said, and then suggest a group date.  Then your dad wouldn't be mad, and at least your boyfriend would still get to go out with you.  I know that's not exactly what your boyfriend wants but its better than making your dad mad right?|`|sAAct4cpaa	just tell him your dad wont let you go out with him.but that doesnt mean you dont like him anyless,right?|`|9640b74490ea2f08b7671d2f5c95b6ffaa	You have to realize that your dad is worried about you. If your bf can't respect that, then maybe its time to look for a new bf.|`|O7mnsqKwaa	well family before friends -- bfs included. so... go with your fathers wishes. i know it sucks big ones, but you know... thats life. maybe in a while he will let you date and that will DEFINETLY be good. or just convince your dad to let u have one. or just date him and dont tell your dad?<br>  <br>  hope i helped!!|`|ffab2b060ab71c912503505517a36a78aa	You need to be honest if you really like him. There is no reason you have to go out alone. I did not go out alone with my girlfriend for like 5 months and I really came to like her family and got to know her much better.|`|tgFO3Hkdaa	Have your dad tell him.<br>  <br>  And have dad do it while he is cleaning his .45
p4XCrsrOaa	Why would you want to start a relationship from this? There are so many issues already between you two, that getting together is the last thing you should think about. She doesn't have a geniune desire to get back with you. Seems she only wants you back to just make herself better. Seems, she could careless how you feel. You dissed her? ..how, by moving on after she dumped you! <br>   Please don't waste your time playing this game with her. Be a good friend if possible but as far as getting back together, it would be bad idea. She will continue to make you feel bad about dating someone else, you still feel bitter about her dumping you...not a good base to start something with someone.

dbA2WFmhaa	hmmm well lets see.........answer these questions first:<br>  <br>  1) Do you like the guys personality?<br>  2) Have you ever met this guy?<br>  3) Do you know what the guy looks like?<br>  4) Is this a long distance possible relationship?<br>  <br>  First evaluate your answers to those questions and then I believe that you will come up with a definite answer for yourself. I am currently residing in Texas and have a long distance relationship with a girl in Canada. So long distance relationships can work out. First of all we all do not know this guy whom asked you out. you should know the answer to your question by now........Holla.......|`|9c23c870f2f97aaa8608416cf2e5c791aa	yea go for it if you know him as in your friends with him but not when you're just talking to someone online.

vDNYJ6bUaa	I agree I would be rude to her. I have a "friend" like that at the moment. I would be very very rude to this "friend" but some of my other friends I think are scared I may push it a little to far. Anyway I think you should be totally rude to her. I mean who cares she is your EX-Friend am I not correct? I mean she is already being rude to you. So be rude back. I mean my friend is huge compared to me so I am a little intimidated but yeah. Anyway be rude, I mean if she says anything come back with a nasty comment. If she is smaller than you dont worry, but.......If she is bigger I would have a friend around. I dont think that she could do any real damage. I hope this helps.|`|6xdXTjUdaa	naww...be totally rude...one time.  Tell her next time she rattles your chain...you'll punch her lights out.  The time you get out of prison (for assault) is when she'll be coming out of her coma.  There is no sense in walking thru this turmoil with her till hell freezes over.  End it now.
oen5x1Bgaa	not really. We do think about it alot, but every 7 seconds is a bit much. It also really depends on the situation the guy is in. If he's surrounded by women, he might even think about it more than every 7 seconds ;)|`|GQzlF0mTaa	Yeah they do|`|aLxDHeRpaa	No, most of the time we're just doing other stuff, and it never even crosses our minds.|`|02b2b3ac2ecfcd6fbea22fdd6bfdd082aa	No.  Honestly guys think about sex as much as girls do.  Statements like this one are usually made more for comedic affect than as a statement of actual fact.<br>  <br>  A better question would be: is it such a bad thing if guys do?|`|52JjKvMuaa	This is proposterous.

You won't do anyone any good if you lie and pretend to feel something that you don't.  I think that you should just tell this guy how you really feel: you love him, but you are not IN love with him, or something like that. I've been in his situation with women before, and you probably can't avoid breaking his heart, even a little bit. But if you are a good and supportive friend, it might not hurt as much. If you don't like being called "hot" I would nicely offer that as advice to him and let him know that there are plenty of other great women out there for him. Good luck|`|D16HHdHfaa	"I love you but your my brother and I wouldn't fell right kissing my brother." then hug him and say "Your like, my best friend, ______. (state name her)."<br>  -Decks<br>  P.S. Works fer me.|`|KK2Fux4Faa	this happens to me all the time, just tell him exactly how you feel, and either he'll be fine with it or not, just don't avoid telling him because you want to protect his feelings, that never works, hesitation will only hurt both of you and possibly others. You may be scared to hurt his feelings, but your more afraid of revealing your own, and thats the fear you have to face.|`|LAPk02Nqaa	Girls are all the time saying he doesn't like me because I'm not as attractive as that girl, but I'm really a sweet person but they wont even try to get to know me.<br>  <br>  It's a double standard, this guy (as you have said is really sweet and is your best friend) why does he have to be drop dead gorgeous? Why can you not accept that he would probably treat you so much better than any of the stuck on their self pretty boys. You know, you don't have to marry him if you don't want to, but you could at least give him a chance to make you happy. You never know, he might be the best thing you will ever find and you're going to let him walk away.<br>  <br>  Try dating him with an open heart and give him an honest chance, if after a couple months you aren't happy then explain to him that you would like to go back to being just friends, he sounds like he would be satisfied with that and he would rescue you if you were alone on the highway with a flat tire.<br>  <br>  I seriously doubt this was the answer you were seeking.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NOErxmCLaa	first of all U tell him that U don't feel like the way he feel about u.<br>  But don't forget to reveal b4 him like wat u mentioned in ur question that he is not cute to u but he is sweet.<br>  <br>  bye bye!|`|Qcrqn1ckaa	i think either way its going to hurt him.... as a guy i would want to hear the truth from a girl instead of being tortured. so my advice would be tell him but also say you want to stay friends and all. its going to be tough but if he truly does like you he will understand. good luck my friend!!!!!!!!!!|`|T8HYZI5xaa	Why don't you "love him like a boyfriend"?  You just said that you dumped your boyfriend because he wasn't supportive of you, and this guy, who really likes you, is your good friend.  Your best friend is right- you really should go out with him.  It seems like he would be supportive of you.|`|mNpoW7Thaa	Um chances are if u say no to this dude ur probably gonna crush him for like the next 4 years. lol havent u ever seen that movie just friends or whatever with ryan reynolds|`|p9yeIfCDaa	You ,your friend and him, Threesome|`|tCP6IyN8aa	well, as a guy, i really cant imagine ever saying "i like u cuz ur hot." i dont think that he REALLY loves u. just dont be too hard on him, tell him that we can be friends or something just i dont feel the same way. Its really cool of you to be friends with him tho.|`|wFQzCulvaa	Question:<br>  <br>  What does you being voted "hottest girl in school" have to do with anything?<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with the question your asking.|`|zsONLLhwaa	Just tell him you don't think of him in that way. I'm sure he'll understand and if they only reason he likes you in that way is becuase "you're hot" then he's probably not in love with you or anything that serious
oen5x1Bgaa	Personally, bro, I would have dumped her just as soon as I found out it was true.  Then again, I am a very spiteful person by nature.  In my opinion, If she did something like this, then she is probably losing interest in you.  I don't doubt that she loves you, but she is looking for something else.  Good luck to you.|`|ILxQYrrPaa	well i don't know wat to say but do what u think is best for u and also ma advice is noo u should not give her another chance because if she really loves u she really would of said nooo i am not single i am taken and in a relationship or something like that but its up to u because i don't want u to do something that will make u regret it in  ur whole life|`|mF7JNSGZaa	You found her out. You can't trust her, I'm afraid. If she tells a guy she's single, then it is to keep her options open with him. There is no other explanation. She's looking for your replacement. She feels ashamed and embarrassed now, and will say anything. When things are back to normal: she'll do it again.|`|LQXK3OVSaa	its your life dude...do u think she will do it again...if so, run now|`|ecf8b59e7b0704fa5bb133591fa8a93eaa	like..i only tell guys im single, if im sic of my bf..or the other guy dusnt like me. hmm...if shes that upset and u love her that much then keep her

No, you won't FORGET about him, you'll just learn to put it on the back burner....you don't want to be all over someone who's just not available.  I wouldn't say forget about him......I would say try to put something else first in your mind....it's tough.  No question about that.  From your post, I'm thinking you're in high school....if that's the case, trust me....he won't be the last!  Good luck!

aO7F5PHYaa	Call your sister first. If you think she can be you guardian and help you, you should be able to call her and tell her everything that is wrong and ask her if you can live with her. <br>  You don't want to run away and then something goes wrong and you appear on the news. "Another teen rape murder". Anyway, she is your mom, try to talk to her and get things straight. I know you want to talk to somebody but don't now who. I have the same feeling. Except that you have a 26 year old sister that can listen to you without nagging. And trust me, this will pass. Do not run away.|`|AA11138696	if you cannot stay at home then you need to speak up and try for some arrangement that will let you stay with your sister.  If there is a problem like abuse your sister can petition the courts on your behalf.<br>  <br>  What seems to be going on is that you are a typical 13 year old with the normal parent problems of a 13 year old. You need to grow up and not run away.  Your parents are trying very hard to raise you and you are making things harder  Your problems are not really problems as you will discover is you succeed in really running away.   There are very dangerous people out there just waiting for fresh little chickens like you to come running by.  They will roast your little butt for you and you will pray for the "problems" your parents are casuing you.<br>  <br>  You need to thank God that you have parents that care enough about you to not let you have your own way.  Stop crying and start praying thanks for your blessings.|`|KPDOrmTsaa	Call the runaway hot line.  Call first call for help. <br>  You are not old enough to take on the dangers of being alone, on your own.  You may think you're all grown up and tough, but you should not have to feel so abandoned in this world.  People who are homeless, some of them started out just like that...  <br>  Is it really the only option you have?  Maybe your mom is the one with a bigger problem.  But at this age, you need guidance from a counselor, pastor, or somebody qualified to do so.  <br>  I'll say a prayer or twelve for you.  May God keep you safe.<br>  You need to realize also, that you need court documents for your sister to be your legal guardian.  And that takes time as well.|`|CSn9TRyhaa	Again talk to your sister,  before you do Anything''   that way she  will help you  and ask your parents,  if you could live with her  a little while|`|dpQiwHGVaa	Running Away is not the correct path you should choose. If you are really having problems with your family you should talk to another adult you trust (A teacher, a grandparent, a neighbor, a friends mom, ect.) they can help with how your parents can change or getting you to your sister in a safer way than you going yourself. If you feel comfortable, talk to your parent maybe they are stressed or they are having a hard time.

zm6Mn5xfaa	HI, yeh im not exactly sure if i can answer this question perfectly but your voice should become deeper any time from your age now until 15, that is the age where a males voice USUALY breaks. But until then try sharing your concerns with your friends im sure they will understand and help stick up for you.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|fX5TSna2aa	First of all, realize that the reason other people bully others is because of their own insecurities in who they are.  They make fun of you because that is the only way they can "puff" themselves up.  <br>  1.)  It really varies and probably the person who could really give you an accurate age would be your father<br>  2.)  The best answer is to approach your teachers, administration, or counselors in your school and let them know what is going on.  <br>  I hope you get through this with some excellent support around you.  <br>  <br>  I was bullied as a kid for being Asian since I was in grade school up until college and I personally know it sucks.  I personally know that without faith in Jesus Christ and knowing how he himself endured shame, cruelty, and insults from those he came to save, I would have did some things that I wouldn't have been proud of.  <br>  <br>  Only when you realize that your identity is held in being unconditionally loved by the only person that matters (God) can you rise up and not be influenced by the way these bullys are treating you.  You are loved and you are a child of God.  Walk in confidence.|`|9VqYh6OXaa	You shouldn't have to deal with this sort of bullying, its unacceptable and I understand how it could destroy your confidence.  You need to realise that these people have issues with themselves and take it out on other people picking out things that probably don't even exist. <br>  <br>  As you're only 12 it is likely your voice hasn't broken yet, this usually happens when you are around 13 up to 16 so you haven't got that long to wait.  Don't feel your voice has to deepen for you to get over the bullying.  Having a lighter voice than others doesn't mean that have an excuse to call you gay or a girl.  If you can make sure they don't see it getting to yourself (perhaps laugh in your head at how ridiculous they are being) then they will soon tire of bullying you and your voice will deepen anyway so then they will look silly! I suggest telling someone in confidence about the name calling such as an adult or a teacher and see if they can help you out.  Don't worry about the bullys finding out as usually the teachers are stactful and say that a teacher overheard them calling you names.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking up a self defense group such as judo or karate to build your confidence up.  Here you can make new friends and learn to defend yourself at the same time.<br>  <br>  Hope you sort this out and this has helped :]|`|AA10965241	First - all schools have a fairly strict policy regarding bullying - particularly if the bullying involves slurs regarding sex, race or religion. A trip to your school counselor or principal letting them know that you are having these sorts of things said to you is definitely in order. You may want to let them know that you do not want to be identified as the person complaining, but ask that the people involved in this sort of behavior be reminded that this sort of thing is not cool and will not be tolerated by the school.  The policies usually involve suspension or expulsion and these jerks need to be reminded of that. <br>  <br>  Second, your voice will change very soon. For most boys it is around the end of Jr.high or in their freshman year of high school. Keep in mind though - there are a lot of girls who like guys with a sweet voice - so don't let the garbage of a few people make you feel like you have some sort of problem or something! Chicks dig it, but they aren't so hot on jerks who are nasty to other people. Who has the advantage here? You! <br>  <br>  If you want to get your digs in? Tell them that your voice may be high now and that will change - but they are ugly and there is not much they will be able to do about that in their future! Ha ha!|`|SRszztxbaa	don't worry i have a guy friend who is like that his voice changes at age 13. don't let them get to your head, i bet you you'll grow up to be smarter and hotter than they'll every be.|`|yFP21Ftfaa	my friend has the same problem.<br>  what he does is just ignores it and doesn't let it get to him.<br>  the next time someone calls you gay or a girl, just ignore them and think of how immature they look and how dumb they are.<br>  everyone is different and people have their flaws. its no big deal.<br>  1. well i really don't know the answer to this question since I'm a girl but probably in like a year or two??<br>  2. just ignore it. dont let them see that it bothers you because that's what gets them going. for some reason people enjoy seeing other people doubt themselves and feel like crap.<br>  people used to call me names because I'm bigger and taller than everyone in the middle school. i just ignored it and they saw they were making no difference so they just stopped.<br>  hope i helped! =] <33
2mcDKo4Naa	Oh my gosh.  This is a hard one...it's very difficult to say because it's different for everyone.<br>  <br>  In my experience, there have been times when I thought I was in love but wasn't. (with each more serious relationship, I felt like...woah! this is totally different from the last one, this must be it!)<br>  <br>  Now that I am really in love, I can honestly say that it's very different from what I'd known in the past.  And it's not all exciting or crazy feeling. (I think that's the infatuation stage)<br>  <br>  For me, love is simply a quiet, comfortable, safe feeling I have deep inside.  For the first time in my life, the whirlwind of thoughts in my head has stopped and there's just this calm feeling left.  It was a bit strange for me at first.....there are moments when he holds me that it feels like we're the only ones in the world-like it melts away for a second. <br>  <br>  I feel like I can totally be myself, and bare my soul to him (skeletons and all).  He never judges me, and I know we can talk about anything.  I feel like he's a part of me...like he's my family.<br>  <br>  It's very hard to explain, and I'm sure it will feel different to you.  We all experience emotion differently....this is just my story.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped.|`|AA11077909	Emotions --how we feel about each other <br>  Ethics --how good or bad we are for each other <br>  Joys --how much we satisfy or dissatisfy each other<br>  <br>  <br>  Sensual love. This is sexual desire. Greeks called it epithymia<br>  <br>  <br>  "Love is that first feeling you feel before all the bad stuff gets in the way." <br>  <br>  <br>  Love is what makes you smile when you're tired." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Love goes on even when you stop breathing and you pick up where you left off when you reach heaven." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Soul has the same nature as Love.<br>  It arises out of the giving of the One.<br>  Soul is the Kindness of the One<br>  Divine Self incarnate.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Love is greater than any thought,<br>  idea, or conception of meaning,<br>  yet it is the reason why we have thoughts,<br>  and why meanings are sought.<br>  <br>  "If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate."|`|MrK90kLlaa	It will come easy, no worrie no trust issues, sex will always be great all good and natural
z8m6C3XKaa	Mine's longer ;)<br>  <br>  I'd say i went through the same issues as him, on a smaller scale (and if i can say, with better reason).  This is just my opinion.  For some reason, it seems like he doesn't think u pay him enough attention and he wants to see you make a sacrifice for him.  I'd say he also has anger issues and sounds like he's very sensitive.  Sounds like you both love each other alot, so don't let something stupid (you'll think it's stupid later) ruin it.  Unfortunately, he asked you to sacrifice something he has no business asking you to sacrifice and something that is important to you.  <br>  <br>  He may be ignoring you to "get back" at you.  To show you he doesn't need you and he "wants" you to feel like you need him.  It seems like a low thing to do, but many people do THINK that way when they in an emotional state.  You are probably seeing him at his worst, and if you still love him, than obviously it's worth getting around.<br>  <br>  It's wrong of him to expect some of those things from you, be patient with him and take the higher road.  Like you said, try not to lose your temper, let him know that u really do care for him.  Don't let your anger keep you from doing something that shows your love for him.  If he does something you find unacceptable because of his condition, you have to choose for yourself what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Stay strong and patient cuz you've done all the right things so far:)
92fba6a4ccaa869b71abf3751ea496e8aa	think about it like this... was he with his gf when 2 you made out???<br>  <br>  if he was... then consider him a cheater.... he did it with her he may do it with you...!!<br>  <br>  if he wasn't...: all he wanted was to make out with you and give you hopes... don't let that happen...<br>  <br>  live your life, go out with others, if it was meant to be it will be...|`|KsvR9xXPaa	...hope you'll be happy to let him go when later down the road, some other girl tries to snatch him away from you.<br>  <br>  you need to grow up!|`|brnRa5xwaa	I think the best thing to do is tell him how you feel. Allow him to decide if he isn't happy in his relationship and if he should end it. now always keep in mind what comes around goes around *KARMA* if he allows you to take him from a person he is "serious" with don't you wonder if at some point the same may happen to you when another female comes along?
VIwuoTo7aa	Define desirable...I only find people with good morals and average looks to be desirable. I don't go for conventional good looks.|`|K8GpK6dPaa	Hmm, yes.|`|XEtb5hHRaa	yes, but what is desirable to one may not be desirable to another. Some guys like the whole "high-maintenance" look with lots of make-up and fakey hair, whereas other guys like a natural beauty. For some guys, looks aren't even that important and find a girl that can hold an intellectual conversation much more desirable. What is desirable varies from person to person... so if you are feeling "undesirable" right now, don't worry because chances are, there is a guy out there that desires a person exactly like you!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|roxG6k9daa	haha the word desirable implies that they are wanted. So yes, guys do want to date girls they "want." If what you mean is really attractive girls, then yes and no. Guys do like attractive girls, they are just naturally wired that way, however, if a girl has other qualities and the guy is not completely superficial than he may take a  less than "desirable" girl over a "desirable" one.
YfX8frB6aa	Not all guys want sex. There are a few good men out there. Now I'm not saying that you haven't had a hard time with guys, but but if you just wait and watch you will find a guy who will respect you for who you are and he'll respect you enough to keep his hands off of you until you're ready to take the next step.|`|VIwuoTo7aa	I would much rather skip the sex aspect of it entirely and stick to romance. I like that warm fuzzy feeling a lot...it's more fulfilling and lasts longer.|`|1sKwIgeCaa	Most guys just don't think with their heart, you have to make it clear right at the beginning what type of relationship you want and then if they really like you they'll try even it out.<br>  If they just dismiss all the romantic stuff then you know he's only after one thing and by not giving it he'll either change his mind or chnage his girl - good way to find out how commited they really are.
AA10914156	Here's what you do. You get a friend to just hide in one of the stalls. That's it. If things get out of hand then you have someone to help. If things don't then she can just pretend that she doesn't know you. But if she leaves, make sure she knows not to go far.|`|dKBplWjbaa	he's trying to get sum,either humiliate you,or even harm you|`|KmTFr41Maa	it's very obvious, he wants to have SEX with you in the toilet.<br>  <br>  Always remember, you lose your virginity, you lose you dignity.|`|026e661768286d694012781576f62eaeaa	omg ladies toilet??....hey maybe its a suprise or somehting go ahead it might be worth the risk..<br>  <br>  but just incase make sure your friend stays outside the ladies room.|`|NuzxoE8Taa	it might just be a jk|`|VvXEkWLuaa	maybe he wants to give you a gift or surprise you or something...<br>  <br>  hopefully he isn't a freak rapist...|`|u214Tordaa	maybe hes a phycho rapist and wants to screw u in the bathroom. nah seriously dont do that. lol|`|uEZKxH7raa	He wants to have sex with you. Or it's a joke.
cn49BbRiaa	Men make time for cheating, so dont take your eyes off him.<br>  If he really cares for you then he will make time to see you. Is getting a car more important than being with you. Maybe you need to check up on him every now and then.|`|9GFMUtl5aa	He won't be cheating. He just wants the car so badly but knows he might have to sacrifice your relationship for a few weeks or months. It might be tough but stick with him it should all be worth it in the end, even though at the moment you feel the attention is more on the car than you. At least he rings and at the end of all this you'll be able to spin round in his car.|`|07c59ce49effdfa897487d7dfc3299c7aa	At least you have a man who works. Think about that for the furture for the two of you. It goes from a car to a house or an apartment. If he is someone you can see being with then it may be worth only see him once a week so he can work for things he wants.|`|1rpnNVkOaa	Do you say you dont trust him? <br>  His car is very important to him, it seems. <br>  If you have the feeling you cannot trust him, its time to reconsider your friendship.|`|HpMFjImvaa	1. You should admire his discipline and diligence.<br>  2. It is only temporary until he gets his new ride.<br>  3. If it bothers you that much help him out with some of the money.<br>  4. I highly doubt he is cheating because he is making the effort to call you so much that is alot of phone calls. <br>  5. Do little things like make him lunch and drop it at his job maybe you can get in a smooch or two on one of his breaks.<br>  6. Don't saythings like "someone else can give me that attention",  unless you are ready for him to say it to you.|`|f18c0588799ddf6345b5edeb891f2241aa	Honestly, both of you are being a little bit selfish. There's a lot of talk about what you want for yourself and not enough about what the other party wants. You need to trust your boyfriend more and he needs to try to see where you are coming from. Girls are different from boys and sometimes boys need to be reminded that we need more TLC that we let on. Girls sometimes need to remember that boys are less sensetive and find it harder to understand our needs. Be patient with each other. Have an honest talk with him without accusations and raised voices and discuss what exactly you what from each other. There's no other way for you to come to a compromise and if you don't really communicate about this it will only escalate. Good luck.|`|qYwoTMmOaa	the key word is to trust. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If you love him all you can do is give him the benefit of the doubt and convince yourself that he's not cheating on you. Once a week isn't THAT bad I only see my boyfriend once every couple of weeks although I'm probably a bit younger than you.|`|xRYAzh5Naa	Hi, I know what you say may upset you but you've got to face up to the facts. If he has just received a new car then he would need to gain extra cash to pay for it. However i personally don't think he is cheating on you. My reason for this is that he's coming home to you even when you say "the attention your not giving me someone else would give me" Now if that was me then i would get rid of your straight away, so he must love you to come back to you. If your not satisfied with my answer and you still feel that he is cheating, then when he is working call the office and ask to speak to him. What ever the answer they give you im sure you'll know if he really is cheating. Good luck finding out and remember be nice and I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

1lVnUZoqaa	Mejor que les dieran trabajo y alimentos,eso seria lo ideaL. saludos|`|Pq7Sr1Qgaa	Todo aquel que estudia economía tiene que resolver esta pregunta: ?Por que el gobierno no fabrica más dinero para repartirlo y acabar con los pobres? y otra similar: ?Que pasaría si desde un avión tiramos billetes sobre una ciudad para hacer a la gente más feliz?<br>  <br>  Sencillo. Al haber más dinero circulante, la gente comprará más bienes. Al haber más demanda de éstos, disminuirá la oferta y los precios subirán, y se desataría una inflación incontrolable. Con la inflación, la moneda se devaluaría y aumentaría el desempleo. Con el desempleo, aumentaría el comercio informal y la delincuencia.<br>  <br>  Esto sería más da?ino para los pobres que fabricar dinero. Saldría peor el remedio que la enfermedad.<br>  <br>  Por esta razón los gobiernos tienen que vigilar el circulante, ya que es necesario que esté en equilibrio con los demás factores económicos de la nación en cuestión.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|skFqYm1Raa	buena pregunta carnal , sin duda tambien checare las respuestas yo, <br>  saludos suerte|`|1pSjluFCaa	sabes, es interesante que alguien piense en una solución como la tuya, pero el dinero no es la mejor opción para  los ni?os pobres.<br>  ?Claro que el Sr Dinero ? hace la vida más placentera y relajada.

He should be understanding about it. And believe me he wants to kiss you, especially if you've been going out for two months. He's probably just shy so I suggest that you take the initiative to start hanging out with him more outside of school and then you'll know when the time is right for your first kiss. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Especially if you're his first girlfriend, he's probably really shy and unsure of what to do. Just try to hang out with him outside of school more first, and then one thing will lead to another.

I am happy he was brought in to my life but I wish I had someone to share the babies growing up with.<br>   Plus too a guy is never worth a woman's time if he plays head games. Look your self in the mirror and say "I am Beautiful, I am confidant, I am strong! No man has the right to treat me like this!" <br>   Don't let him make you go to him, let him come crawling to you. And a man is never supposed to make a woman shed tears of self doubt. Be your self and If he can't understand that then really...............
E2xDowKraa	Yes, it's a shame that some people have to act that way.  If your sister wants to handle this directly she can approach the girls and talk to them face-to-face.

KxUA4Y8aaa	look them in the eyes, rub their neckk ..it makes them want you. believe me.|`|AA11305954	Try the 90-10 approach.... Get close to her, and take hold of her, most easily by putting your hands on her hips. If she's okay with that, look her in the eyes and hold her gaze... If she's still okay with that, then move closer to her, slowly, approaching her as if you're going to kiss her, but stop when you're 90% of the way there... and keep holding her look... If she's going to let you kiss her, then SHE will come the last 10% of the way.... (we're probably talking about two or three inches away, no further)<br>  <br>  If she doesn't finish the kiss, then you're SOL.|`|K6bbQdhBaa	Try and closer to them every day, not like physically, but don't rush it. Ask them out if you havn't yet, and then see what happens from there.|`|AW1cwrwBaa	Let them know how you feel is the first step, maybe there feeling the same wawy.

You can ask for a kiss but you cannot force this person to do something they might not want to do.
L1tu1Qq8aa	Tell her how you feel about her, I suggest do not get her drunk or anything else like that. If she accepts your feelings about her, start out by asking her out. The process of getting to sex is slow, so be very patient... Don't expect it to come soon, and better yet, don't expect her to agree with you.|`|QP16RIJ2aa	Don't go there!!!! it is way too complicated for sex....maybe not worth losing your best friend....<br>  <br>  if you must try then ask her out, but tell her that you'd like it to be a date, and remember you and only you are responsible for the consequences of your actions...|`|c92f72cfa72482cc99c74fb7674b226daa	You can not and SHOULD not manipulate or force people into doing something with you.

k1ARLRTMaa	uhm, well it's always difficult for me to find a guy that i like for longer than a week. [bad i know!] so i typically do not date guys. i go for the friends with benefits. i've been in 2 of those. one lasted about a month. in the 1st one we both liked eachother but we were to busy to be serious. so when we "hung out" wed just talk for a few hours and then mess around for an hour or so. && then other one was more benfits. i mean we were friends, but hardly. <br>  personally, i would rather be in a relationship. that way you could always have someone there that loves and cares about you. the hard part with friends with benefits is that you CANT get attached. you have to go into it knowing that nothing more will happen. its hard [esp for girls] bc you do want something more to happen. thats why hook up buddies dont really work. |`|arveqFadaa	It depends on what you like. I have been in both situations and when I didn't want a relationship, or something more casual the friends with benefits worked great. A real relationship is great when you're ready and have the time to commit to it. Sex buddy is good too because you can just come and go as you please without having to worry about all the mushy feelings that come with a real relationship, sometimes you just want to have fun without all the drama of a relationship.|`|cPe9Y9CAaa	lol persian princess i see your persian :D im persian as well lmao ^^<br>  anyway, yea i think relationship works better tho, i mean when your not in a relationship then non of you are limited right, so for example your "FRIEND" can go and do the sex with other girls as well right? so i dont know but it just doesnt work for me, me personally i always looked for serious relationship, if thats what you want maybe you should get into the relationship but if you dont really got that much of a feeling for him and just wanna have fun then friends with benefits seems to work fine<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ZWbB6N7laa	Boyfriendddd, why fell used? You can have intimacy and a respectable relationship.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	friend with benefits is kind of stupid because your both just using one another or one person likes the one their sleeping with while the other has no feelings for them its just sex. Boyfriend is better in the since of if the relationship is going some where and your both stable enough to handle it. Otherwise I wouldn't do either. Someone always gets hurt and its usually the girl.|`|hJCeiMadaa	Boyfriend cuz you can feel loved and special and hello you can have sex too
EnSDDCDiaa	He will call you back.<br>  A friends with benefits situation is usually more favorable to most men then having a girlfriend.|`|BD2SyGIJaa	All guys are different, and I hope your guy is really willing to be just that, since that is what you want.<br>  <br>  Me, personally, I will take a steady relationship with a girl, even if I have to wait a really really long time for the "benefits" to come, rather than have a friend with benefits. In fact, I don't want a friend with benefits under any circumstance. I want a friend, or a real relationship.<br>  <br>  But that just goes to show that all guys are different and there is no right or wrong in this situation, really. It depends specifically on the guy you're talking about. <br>  <br>  Hey, if he said he agreed to being friends with benefits, why wouldn't he call?|`|kNSCc8p2aa	is it so hard to call him? or text him? |`|gKQDNpS3aa	so what if he doesn't call? i'm assuming he's your ex for a reason, right? ask yourself if you really want this to turn into a relationship or if you just want the attention =]
5Ba2o3oxaa	whispered in the ear in a overly public place. her mind will start ticking from there for when you are alone|`|CdodDBf4aa	yeah as long as it's like in an appropriate situation then it's all good.<br>  just prepares you for what's coming next.<br>  i reckon when you're alone with your girlfriend somewhere and she's up for it.<br>  if she's in a bad mood, forget it.<br>  that just pisses me off.|`|AcWUwJgzaa	i love dirty talk at anytime it turns me on all the time if you want to talk email me lol|`|f75b685bb68bb0249f48907f9500eea4aa	Calling 911

8d4279f50bebdeae167080bd5f519a29aa	What turns me off is stupid flirtatious comments.  The funny ones are cool but the obnoxious comments are lame.  Your right, not all are shallow but many are tired of being approached by almost everyone from the oppsite sex just trying to get her in bed.|`|VAfyKWmUaa	A turn off to me is: A guy with bad breath, poor hygiene(Teeth).

Makes them feel important and wanted.<br>  <br>  This is why bars arent the best places to meet quality ones.|`|pAoOWIA0aa	Lol. It's either to get out there and flirt, but they don't find anybody interesting, or they were just bored and wanted to look nice but not meet anybody. <br>  Try meeting girls by having your friends introduce you to their friends and so on until you know lots of new people, including girls. Or try volunteering or working out or taking a class in something.....you will meet people this way.|`|wNpuV9L9aa	Well some women , not all of them, may do that on accassion if they're having problems with their, boyfriends, or husbands.

n9zoJzpQaa	We just don't have the time to put into it as we used to before our own families got started and jobs. I was looking at my daughter the other day at the water park and I noticed that every new kid that came up she'd go over to them and make friends with them right away. I mentioned to a lady watching her kids about how it amazed me how kids can just do that. Go right up to one another and act as if they know someone and be friends. She said "yeah don't you wished we had stayed like that?" Yes I do...Yes I do...|`|WPaBrlQYaa	When we were young,our minds were innocent and our thoughts were pure.We did not thought of having anything such as money or cars etc as our parents will provide for us.As we grow,our parents can no longer provide for our daily needs.We depend on ourselves to get what we want.This desire in us turns MOST human into seeking benefits from everything they come across to.That includes your friends.These humans will fake their emotions and attitudes to get something out of you.Which is why it's really hard to get a real friend in the adult stage.it's just life,we have to live through it.<br>  <br>  However,life isn't all that unfair.We had our memories when we were young.Sweet,loving and caring friends around us,back when our thoughts were still pure.treasure the memories you have,it's the only time where true friendship takes place in your life.|`|AA11864007	well there are many reasons for that.  Main one is that people are just too busy to properly cultivate a true friendship.  Another problem we have as adults is that we are very judgmental and we judge others and dont want to be friends with someone because of this or that.  As kids we just play with whoever.  WE dont care if they drive a certain car or look a certain way or what color they are or what position they hold at work if they are skinny or fat all we want to do is have fun.  But as adults we are clouded by our own personal objections and prejudices and that makes it harder to make friends that are worth keeping and maintaining.|`|HSGsMKfIaa	I stick close to my family.

a2189b8fdc6a2c5ff33ef1ca52ea8a4daa	omg this sounds so familiar. this happened to me. one of my exs who is very close with me called me one night drunk and he was trying to kill himself. i told him to stop and my friend called me and when she heard me crying she called him and told him what he was doing to me. and i called him and i was crying. and he eventually stopped. he said he stopped because he heard me cry and begging him to stop. you need to tell him that you care about him and tell him the truth. tell him how you would feel if he left you. and you need to keep bugging him. i know it sounds annoying but really you need to and when he says he will stop, you need to bring it up because its still going through his head. call him.|`|PPJXJ9Kvaa	hmm<br>  if hes pretty sure about killing himself CALL THE POLICE<br>  he will be angry at first but will realize that u did it for him<br>  for now?<br>  let him cut<br>  he is probably not doing to much harm and it might tide him over till he can get real help<br>  u also might want to tell ur parents<br>  they can call dss or somehting to get him help|`|osb5H9gZaa	tell him you cherish your relationship and to do everyone, especially himself, a favor and give whatever is causing him so much distress a break and that you want to help him and you will always be there for him. tell him that there is nothing sadder than watching a loved one die in vain and he has the strength.|`|3cccb9a8cd2ce6159e3b9bef9fb6ac41aa	tell him some one does care about him.<br>  <br>  <br>  thats the reason your talking to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  it should make him feel better =)|`|s4T9TxbHaa	'don't do it'?<br>  <br>  or call 911 to his house|`|x2ZRmaoWaa	Ask him if he cares about you <br>  you have been there for him the whole time and you really don't want him to hurt himself because he'd also be crushing you and he doesn't want to do that for a friend thats cared for him so deeply does he?|`|1u5y4i9kaa	tell him taht suicide is never the answer. remind him that he has you no matter what. remind him of EVERYTHING he has in this life that is worth having. you should probably go over and talk to him pronto....and i mean face to face.|`|AiFbiuGvaa	DO NOT LET HIM.<br>  God will always love him.<br>  jesus christ died on the  cross for his mistakes.<br>  there is to many suicides in this world.<br>  do not let him.<br>  please, tell him not to do it for you.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	...does he live in new york=/
ctWfI5h0aa	What you need to do is give me her email address, so I can show her this post and prove how much you really care about her!!  I could seriously do that if you wanted a third party to talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she is pretty insecure about herself and maybe a little selfish since she is asking you to change yourself - it's okay to change your schedule, stop talking to a few people if she really hates them, and spoil her with gifts.  But changing your style?  Your life?  And the time you spend with family?  She might be pushing you to become someone you're not, which isn't healthy for you.  Since you love her, just be there to support her and help with her insecurities.  Best of luck.|`|XglHtSx0aa	Well something like this happened to my friend, so I know where you are coming from. You should never ever change your life or you for somebody. If you love her that much to do so much for her and she not realize it, maybe she's not worth your time. I mean I know I hate saying it, and know it is true when it happens to be me and my boyfriend/girlfriend. But if she keeps saying you don't love her and you give her gifts and walk to her house (which I would love if somebody ever did that for me) then maybe you two don't belong together.<br>  Okay I know this might sound so cliche or whatever, but to find love, sometimes you need to let go of the one you love.|`|hy45DHxgaa	WAY .......<br>  TOO MUCH   D R A M A  !!!!!|`|8f758e699c3dae9cd3420048843862b3aa	from what you have said she doesnt seem to be commited to this relationship or she is very inmature. you shouldnt have to change at all, she should like you the way you are.|`|kC7kBwvEaa	mabey shes uncomfortable with u<br>  <br>  or she doesnt want to be a lesbian anymore<br>  <br>  just a thought<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmICF.4yTNYALveYHzjDOyjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080709164936AATXtWx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|V3dKMaRXaa	you deserve someone better. you shouldn't have to change for anybody, they should like you because you're you! <br>  talk to her and tell her how this makes you feel. and that if she doesn't stop then she will lose you|`|WuNqb0Nkaa	She sounds like she's cuckoo.  Twenty voice-mails and e-mails in a day?  That's pretty excessive.|`|NyvUd46Waa	so<br>  ...<br>  your a girl and your dating a girl?<br>  what?|`|AA11433268	I don't know either of you, so I could be way off, but she sounds like a particularly needy person, who appears to constantly need to reassure herself that she is loved - "you don't love me" - to provoke a reaction that confirms to her that you do love her, that you don't want to break up with her. Unfortunately this sort of insecurity may, perhaps, come from inside her, rather than it being inspired by anything you do or have done, and, in that way, there is not a lot else you can do other than ask her how you can reassure her so that she believes you.<br>  <br>  It is not a healthy relationship if she is wanting you to change to be more like what she wants - again, this may be a way of 'testing' you, perhaps even subconsciously on her part, and a way of making her feel more like she can rely on your love. Unfortunately, while this may seem like it is working to make her more certain of your devotion, it obviously isn't as she is still doing it and will keep on doing it, and is only really succeeding in making you unhappy and having you question yourself.<br>  <br>  Whilst it would appear that you do love her very much, you can't allow her insecurities to devastate your self-esteem at what is (and please forgive me if this comes across as condescending) a fragile and formative age for you in terms of relationships and relating to other people. She may be projecting a lot of her pain and worry onto you, when you simply want to love her and be there for her. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck in your relationship - none are ever easy! - and please, don't believe things she may say in anger, or to provoke a reaction, as being true judgements of you and your character. From what you've said, she just seems frightened that you don't want her, or may leave her. Ask her how you can reassure her that that's not the case, but if she comes up with something that is either impossible for you, or involves you becoming something that deep inside you know you're not, then you will need to question what both of you are getting out of this relationship.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents. xx
htsQ6HXCaa	im the same way.<br>  <br>  i just try to be myself, and i know its hard.|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	try socialising n accompany with sum of ur trusted frnds.|`|GWGbmH0Daa	I can be shy also around new people. Oddly enough though, once i get to know people I am very talkative. Initially, its hard to talk to someone i don't know - but it helps if you talk about something both of you can relate to - for example if your in a class with someone, you could mention to a classmate how an assignment was really hard and how you cant wait to be done with it. Usually a person would agree with you and reply to what you said...<br>  <br>  Or if you were at a restaurant you could ask someone how their food taste and if they eat there alot... Usually asking a question that requires more than a Yes or No answer is good. Or make a comment or joke about something. I tend to be a bit sarcastic and crack some jokes, which helps to lighten the mood. <br>  <br>  its also best to talk about what you are familiar with. If you watch movies ask the person if they've seen a recent movie or what they've seen recently. Talking about Tv shows or sports are good topics for stimulating conversations too.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Trust me, it gets easier with time. Just go for it :)|`|ZvRtoqLiaa	first. you must answer for yourself - why sometimes you are not shy.<br>  if you can answer for this question you find answer for your question|`|7WeLk6Rnaa	zanax|`|tOXBJCvKaa	im shy too.. lol

yLOPoODbaa	That is pretty difficult to answer... Drew is beautiful because of her personality in combination with her face. Eva is sexy - as opposed to beautiful.

The thing is, if you know you will never see the one guy again, your feelings for him will wane naturally over time.  I would be afraid the same might happen with the second guy who you think you will see again in two years.  I don't know how old you are, but two years is a long time, and you are sure to meet someone between now and then who interests you.  The same might happen with bachelor number two's feelings for you (are you sure he has feelings for you?).

If you like her a lot, then get into some awesome sport like football, soccor or basketball and talk to her about that. In every opportunity you get, talk to her as much as you can. |`|8052a63d386f57a5453412aecd1de123aa	Take a breath, clean out your head, go up to her, ask her to go out with you.  It's that simple.

SIzKIe1iaa	To get someone jealous, you have to have the "look".<br>  <br>  You have to look sexy, yet not sluttish sexy, smart, but not to smart, cute, and irresistible overall.<br>  <br>  You have to use your body and your language to define yourself, show to him who you are, and what he is missing. Give him signs that your still interested, but do not be abrupt. Act as if he was a friend, but then be a tiny bit flirt at points. Give him a smile when you first see him, and hug him if its appropriate, first impressions count. Look happy to see him, ecstatic even, and show him that you can go on without him, but suggest non-verbally that it would be better with him.<br>  <br>  Maybe get him a small gift? Nothing romantic, but something that he can not keep his mind off. <br>  <br>  To make him insanely jealous, talk about other relationships you have had, and the other guys near you. He will envy them if he likes you and will slowly crawl back to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|jDO9o5aPaa	Put on the sexiest outfit you can find. Look so sexy that all the guys try to talk to you. When you do that guys think "Man, she looks so good....How could I break up with That?" and he will really get jealous when he see other guys looking at you. You don't have to get another guy just be yourself and if that doesn't work just tell him you want him back and become intimate...kiss him or something. Once you wrap your arms around him and make that spark come back. He is going to want you just like you want him. |`|iutMByklaa	Just dress hot. Believe your sexy. If you emit that sexiness it will drive him crazy. Try not to talk to him too much, and make small talk chat. Like you're not that interested. Show him that you are doing great without him. Don't be b!tchy, but show him that you are confident. Him knowing that you don't need him will make him jealous. Just be radiant!!|`|b607d4858b482a42739ce347b0b90087aa	flirt with the other guyy alot and smile.

I'm sure that's not the only reason he broke up with you... if you really want him back, just talk to him about it. Good luck.|`|WRX8Ttodaa	Be careful about making him jealous....he might feel hurt and angry and never talk to you again. It is a dangerous game. You should just say...."let's be friends and hang out". that will get you exposure to him and he won't think you are desperate. then after several times of "hanging out", see if he still wants you....go from there.|`|jCPBlUeEaa	my advice is if you want him back.. its not going to be that easy but you can try act comfortable around him and flirt alot. <br>  But keep in mind that love comes unexpectedly and you can't control it.<br>  <br>  Hannah.|`|uvUDXNLHaa	dress in a really nice outfit for ex. if theres an outfit he always thinks you look hott in wear it.and maybe  do something sexy w/ ur hair.flip ur hair alot and act confident like you can survive w/ out him|`|tNB151XSaa	um... first thing, DONT call that guy. and dont put out more. you'll just get a bad reputation and he'll think you are gross.<br>  second, just stop caring, and he will definitely go crazy.<br>  at least... if the feelings are still there.|`|DgyNFHYiaa	bring another guy.|`|z8C8Db42aa	well flirt with others or say he's so cute really soft to him and point to cute guys then ask him if he think he could hook up a date with one point to some of his talking friends|`|a7427621b20f1763267d7903860aa7efaa	Have you ever considered just being mature and honest?|`|8zlvyBfuaa	he is your ex for a reason dont go back to him...|`|otklvzpJaa	if there is anything he has said you dont do enough of do more of it.

t9KytOdgaa	Well - if he doesn't like you then he doesn't deserve you! What has he done to show you that he doesn't like you in THAT way? Is it worth losing a good friend? Why don't you try to hang out with him and see how he reacts. When you're in a convo just say - what are you doing this weekend? Invite him out with one of your good friends so neither of you feel awkward and see how it goes. Maybe you guys could go bowling or something.

wWrWmfUlaa	Just straight out tell her that she's annoying. She'll probably get sad and won't talk to you anymore, then you'll be clear. The nice thing to do would be to give her another chance if she tells you she'll be less annoying but if you don't want to then just tell her that you just simply don't want to talk to her anymore. It's a very good thing that you're concerned about this girls feelings but sometimes it doesn't matter no matter how much it may hurt this person. Sometimes hurting somebody can hurt you too but it really doesn't matter in this case.|`|YlJcwkQxaa	it sucks when ppl cant take a hint, but keep on being discreet so she'll get the message.

Try to ask him lots of questions and joke around with him to keep a conversation going. Eventually he will become more comfortable around you.<br>  Also, get his phone number, email, or Facebook. Sometimes it's easier to chat online. You can get to know eachother better this way, and then when you see eachother in person you'll be used to talking!
wGpla9xraa	Same could be said about women and getting into wallets.(ROFL) sorry had to meet one stereotype with another.<br>  <br>  But seriously, men who lie are hiding. It's natural for a guy to become attracted to someone and for some reason or another they start to feel like they don't match up, the nice guy that feels this way usually walks off stage never to be seen again, the maggot loser lies through his teeth to mask all his negative qualities. In other cases, you'll get a sincere guy who lies because he's ashamed or feels that the girl is "out of his league".<br>  <br>  the guys that lie to get in your pants, want only that..to get in your pants. So saying "lying gets you nowhere" isn't applicable to them. It's not like they're: "OMG she's hot!! I'ma lie to her, have sex and then have a meaningful relationship."<br>  <br>  And they don't do it to hurt another persons feelings, it's not a malicious act. What it is is selfish and unsympathetic. They just don't  get it...well, some do but most don't. <br>  Liars suck, but not all of them are necessarily *beep*holes. <br>  <br>  |`|ZaMzRSrraa	because they are afraid of rejection and have a low self esteem<br>  <br>  <br>  WHY DO WOMEN GIVE IN ANYWAY  WHEN THEY KNOW  THEY ARE LYING ?|`|AA11849364	Lol, because they are men.

While women try (and this is the usual stereotype, it can go both ways) find life long partners that connect to them on a emotional, physical, and mental level that no one else can. But Men see it as a game. Its about trying to get the best and comparing their winnings against someone elses winnings. A very sad Truth. <br>  Now of course after a while men start to mature at age 30ish and start thinking clearly enough to realize that they need someone to help take care of them when their 70.<br>  Now back to your question. well the even sadder truth is, no one really knows why someone would want to hurt your feelings. Hell he most likely didn't mean to and only needed a boost of self confidence off of you. But men cant ussually be themselve because their views of themselves are so dark that they seriously cant see why anyone would ever see them as a good prospect. Men go through the same problems women do. They just have to deal with it in an alternative way.

I think that in order to influence him in to wanting to do more with his life then play in his band you need to give him a bit of tough love. Stop paying for things that he should be paying for and encourage him to find work. I am not saying that your boyfriend doesn't want to find work, after all, some people do just get stuck in a rut and all he needs is a good kick up the *** lolz and a reality check and am sure he will realize that its time to pull his finger out and bring something to the relationship. I know its a really obvious thing to say, but, talking is the only way that is going to solve the problem tell him no longer that you can continue supporting the two of you- as stupid as it sounds he may not even realize how you are feeling. You are obviously a really hard worker and care about your boyfriend a lot to worry and want to help him. Hopefully if the relationship is strong and loving  and he will be out there searching all he can for a job to bring something to the relationship. Good Luck.<br>  Hope This Helps x|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Find someone who wants to join the human race and who wants to contribute to your relationship. He is a free loader, bum, mooch, leach, lazy.

And if a girl asked me, I would probably go out with her even if I wasn't planning on asking her out.<br>  <br>  And if your still to shy to ask him yourself, atleast make your presence known to him. Go up to him and just talk to him. I assume you've met... if not, meet him or bump into him.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Get over your shyness or watch him end up with a girl who wasn't afraid to ask him out.|`|RourHWB2aa	Just do it.|`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	That is the feminine body language .|`|FSzViWKmaa	don′t be shy and hunt that boy!|`|010e19f149ca4d52d45d1e56e06050e1aa	Tell him anyways! =) Hopefully he likes you back, and you two can date! Just gather your nerve and do it.|`|d7vyYNLQaa	the same thing is happening to me|`|KhK7Gt83aa	if ur to shy to talk to him the question is how can u go out with him???<br>  <br>  if ur not gonna talk to him when u go out what would be the point, he may see you as a brick wall (Sumone who dont talk).

But u gots to let him know ur intentions<br>  <br>  good luck|`|BDQPiZUEaa	a) make sure he's at least a pretty good friend<br>  and<br>  b) try and be a little more outgoing and flirty<br>  <br>  personally, I'm one of the shyest girls in the world when it comes to this... but one guy finally got over my wall... now everything's better<br>  sounds like you really like him though<br>  hope it goes well!<br>  ~H|`|JBjQxrHkaa	ur like me...i let that guy slip away from me....so, because i dont want da same 2 happen 2 u ill give u some advice....da best thing 2 do iz ask 1 of ur friends to ask him wat he thinks bout u and then hav them constantly inform u bout him.....while she/he iz doin dat u could try being friends wit him ...maybe try making conversation...wit da guy...da guy i liked i was first his friend and he got me 2 fall 4 him(he liked me first... then he started talking 2 me and i started 2 like him).. so dis iz proof dat dis work....as u gradually create a friendly relationship wit him, wen da right time comes, ask ur frined to ask him if he likes u...if he says yes then tell her to say..then y dont u ask her out?!...but u hav 2 become friends first and dont become 2 comfortable wit being his friend or else youll lose him........good luck...im cheering u on!!!!!:)|`|mSvxkGOHaa	i've been in that situation before :)  haha  its fun but not so fun at the same time.  um  maybe if theres gunna be like a school dance that u don't need a date for just meet him there?<br>  <br>  i'm not sure. but if you want anything to happen, you kinda gotta make the first move unless u know he's gunna ask you |`|46ZC4urUaa	You must ask him yourself...it's critical.  And trust me, if a girl blushes and smiles when she asks a guy out, it's one of the most attractive things ever.  Just be yourself and ask him out.  You can do it.|`|kCvUtY22aa	<br>  If you stare directly at him for long periods of time I'm sure that something will happen.  I'm guessing you'll burn your "like" into his retinas.  |`|7246253f10b3c63eb3f0f3e8b3e6ebdeaa	I would just write him a note or something..<br>  Or tell him straight up to his face.<br>  |`|rqsvBIhraa	Umm tell him u wanna be friends with him and always keep conversations with him, hang out in the holidays and weekends. And then when u get closer confess. Dont say ur too scared coz honey its now or never.|`|SHWv4Pp5aa	i think u shuld talk to him and then get to know him if u guys click he may ask u out before u have to |`|cJDdR3tBaa	Go talk to him see what his interests are and make a date based on something you both like |`|PyxznYiRaa	Just tell him, i like u more than as a friend|`|K0E44V7Baa	Well my advice really is to just go for it! I'm a shy person myself and I asked my current boy out! You've probably heard this before but the best way to get over your inhibitions is to...FAKE it. Pretend that you are confident and totally loving yourself and life! Having that kind of attitude really does draw good things towards you. It's called the law of attraction. When you project good feelings outwards you end up getting good things back. It sounds too good to be true but try it you might just be pleasantly suprised. Now this does not mean you walk around with a big goofy fake smile on your face but it does mean that you ask people how they are before they start a conversation with you or go up and hug one of your good friends just telling them that you are really happy and to have a good day. I know it sounds a bit lame but you will see what I mean. <br>     You know that girl who makes you jealous? The one who always seems to be so confident and never backs down in any situations, whos always smiling and talking with boys? Do you notice how it's easy to talk to this girl and how everyone seems to want to be around her? Thats because of the confidence she is projecting. You can be like that too.<br>  When it comes to boys get to know your crush a bit better. Flirt with him at school (if thats where he is with you), smile at him and make eye contact! (very important!!), get your hair done or do something that makes you feel really beautiful (it will show when you are around him), The better you feel about yourself the less shy you will be! Life is wayy too short to let yourself miss out on a guy you are totally pining after! After you've gotten to know him better, if he seems like he's into, returning your flirting and stuff just ask him if he wants to get coffee with you sometime, or grab a bite to eat. Its not as scary as it seems! Remember that in high school and in life in general everyone else is just as scared s h i t less as you :) <br>  Dont forget the eye contact thing. Super important.<br>  xo<br>  Goodluck, <br>  -H
6rq90qIraa	If she got pissed off and jealous is because she likes you but she probably is confused whether to go to her ex or go to you.

KAFG6s5Waa	First off I'm sorry to hear about your dad that has to be very difficult.<br>  I'm sure it is going to be strange for you with whoever she dates. It will take time for you to adjust after losing your dad just keep in mind she is happy now and that's a good thing. You could try to minimize occasions where you would be with them together until you feel better about it. Best of Luck.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	is your father-in-law single?  if yes leave them alone.  she's happy, you should be happy for her.<br>  if he's still married, talk to her about the problems she's causing doing this.|`|JuNf9cnJaa	So your husband’s dad is dating your mom?  Loll well that’s a nice tight network isn't it? lol  Hey look on the bright side... You love your mom... and you love your husband’s dad too.... So what better remedy for you and your mother!  You don't have to invite both sides of the family over for gatherings, and you only have 1 set parents to deal with now, not 2!  I think the only thing weird about this is the fact you'll have to explain it to grandchildren and what not IF you have kids, and it might seem weird.  BUT there is not blood relation to the two of them, therefore there is NOTHING weird or gross about it.  In fact say your mom had met him before you met your husband, and all of a sudden you meet this guy you don’t realize is your mom's boyfriends son, and walla, now you'd be weird.... but really.... not weird at all.  Be happy for your mom, and try and look at the situation on a lighter more comical note instead of thinking it's weird and demented... Remind yourself there is NOTHING weird or wrong about ANYTHING that is going on.  The only thing that is going on is 2 people are newly in love and need the support of their children... ie: your husband and yourself :-)|`|UnWSYaWRaa	even though it probably won't last, you should talk to your mom and who ever's dad it is. let them know that you aren't comfortable with the situation. let your mom know that you don't mind that she's dating, but you wish it was someone else--and explain why it bothers you.|`|VVtQIYdAaa	happiness is an elusive and wonderful thing to find.<br>  Unhappiness is a lonely painful life...<br>  How painful is it for you to see your mom  find happiness with the father of who you found happiness with?|`|5I01tsgYaa	There is nothing you can do but let the relationship run its course.  It may make for some awkward family gatherings, but your mom deserves to try to be happy.|`|vk6sczbLaa	Talk to them honestly about it. Get counseling for all three of you if it becomes more of a problem.|`|EJyzzyDwaa	Who your mother chooses to date is up to her. Besides, you said that she is finally happy for the first time since your father passed away, so why can't you put her first instead of yourself and just let her be happy.

He told me how beautiful and amazing I was, but then he found out my age. We ended up meeting again when I was 19 (and he was 25) and we dated for a year. It didn't work out in the end, but it was fun while it lasted.

You like this guy after all.  Please answer this question for yourself: Does he have your best interests at heart?  If you're not sure or only think he may then it is best for you to be careful how much time you spend in his company.  Are you really ready for a real relationship with intimacy?  He may appear mature but what ultimately do you mean by that?<br>  <br>  Does it mean he doesn't laugh about "boogers" nor makes fun of how you style your hair?  Does it mean he has a good job and has fun partying on the weekends?  It isn't a good idea to "date" someone as old as he is when you are 16.  Perhaps guys your age seem "too immature"?  Too much into sports?  Not interested in girls or ?<br>  <br>  Anyway, please be careful and not rush into a relationship with him or any guy.|`|6yYtBMuYaa	Are you kidding, when I was 16 I was with a 29 year old, now that was hotttttttttt <33<br>  <br>  And why help?

Since your 16 though you should be very careful.   <br>  <br>  Also, unfortunately it is technically illegal when your underage to be with someone that much older.  Even though 5 years isnt that much.  <br>  <br>  Its your choice what you do.....|`|tvLqya87aa	16-20 is the age where you tend to like anyone. During these years you establish physical sense.

He may try to take advantage of it. <br>  <br>  You are playing with fire.  You need to end this before you get burnt. He could get into serious trouble if he takes advantage of you.<br>  <br>  You need to stop drinking or you will end up an alcoholic by 45.

37ZqEi0Maa	I went through my parent's divorce too. I was about six years old, and I remember how hard it was to move out of my house and into another neighborhood with my mom and sister. Also, coming to terms with the fact that I would only be seeing my father one day a week was heartbreaking. I still get emotional sometimes when I think about how I never had the chance to grow up in a normal family, and I'm still emotionally scarred when I remember the arguments they used to have. The best answer that I can give you is that it will get better in time. You just have to learn to accept the fact that even though your family is separated they are still your family and they still love you. I know it sounds cliche, but truly that is how I learned to cope. Your parents will find their own happiness too. My dad was just remarried last month and it gave me some peace of mind. Follow your heart, and give your parents the same love that you would give them if they weren't divorced. Yeah, divorce is no fun, but you'll find balance again. If you're having a hard time, you really need to talk this out with your family so they know what your going through. The best of luck to you!<br>  -Vanessa|`|966uN0Yzaa	hon - there are so many more worse things that life can throw at you . <br>  <br>  youlll stop crying eventually. in the next few months it will become less common. then eventually you will only cry at night. then you wont cry or be upset at all. <br>  <br>  my parents divorced when i was 6. i cried in the illustrated pattern above until about 1 year ago. But i had so much sh*t to cope with in my life.. i think it might take you longer to get over it. <br>  <br>  at the end of the day - sorry but i will be harsh to try to make you wake up and stop feeling sorry for yourself - GET  OVER  IT <br>  <br>  it is so common these days. |`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	YOu need to ask your parents to get you into counseling to help you deal with it all. Divorce can leave scars on a child. Try to remember that it is your parents who do not want to be with each other any longer, not you. They love you just as before if not more. Keep your head up, things will get better in time!|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Ask your parents to let you talk with a counselor to help you deal with the split. You should not have to suffer so much.<br>  <br>  God bless you. It will get better and easier.
WvvcBBKqaa	I am in kind of the same situation. Do not tell that she is pretty and things like that come on .... thats so old. You can say stuff like ... hello beautiful or ... hey what ya doing thinking about me ? ... I am a girl and things like that make me laugh and be happy so its better when a guy has a sense of humor. Do not say things like hey ... I saw you today you were so pretty oh my god !!!!!!! No way you are going to stress her.|`|iJZ5Efb0aa	call her baby.<br>  put 'lol' alot.<br>  smiley faces are good too.<br>  um and text her alott.<br>  just not over doing it because that'll be annoying.|`|9FzzFrB4aa	Just be comfortable and don't try to hard. <br>  <br>  don't think of her as the most special girl in the world and if you consider her as a somewhat friend who you can flirt with, it makes it easier. <br>  <br>  Be natural and calm. |`|L2Tvu7VLaa	I would suggest not. Girls tend to be better romanced face to face, or AT LEAST a hand written letter. Not text. Also, if she decides she doesn't like the text, or think it's dumb for whatever reason she can send it to all her friends to laugh about. Do you really want to take that chance?<br>  <br>  But, if you insist on doing it this way there is one flirt text that worked on me. he sent me a text that gave me a nickname but in another language. And then said he wouldn't tell me what it meant till we went out again. I agreed to go out with him again and he said that it meant "my angel" i thought that was adorable.|`|Tm03bMLKaa	two words-<br>  <br>  wink smiley <br>  <br>  hahaha ; ) works every time|`|6yZ48A2Paa	tell her how pretty she is and how much u was thinkin  bout her

LnyEMVFAaa	yes, sense of humour makes the nervousness disappear, and make girls comfortable immediately, and guys with sense of humour is very friendly and you can be yourself around them, they make you feel at ease, they talk a lot so theres no silent moments... <br>  other guys try to be funny by making fun of other people, and thats not funny at all... be funny without getting other people feel offended or hurt... you cant be funny if you're afraid to be laugh at or you cant laugh at yourself<br>  <br>  confidence is great too, no matter what you look like, if youre confident, girls will notice you.. if you're confident you dress nice, your posture is good, you talk comfortably, you make eye contacts,you laugh alot, smile a lot, u dont let yourself down, u dont whine or complain a lot, always think positive... thats sexy but not go overboard with confidence, you'll scare girls.. just dont put yourself down and think less of yourself, and dont talk about depressing things<br>  <br>  adventurous personality is attractive too and also intelligence or a great talent...<br>  <br>  a caring, friendly and loving nature is also attractive|`|r8VvBxM6aa	Definitely.

fShlKEfYaa	so it sounds like the place is in your name, correct?  Who is the owner for the dog - the person who owns the dog needs to have the primary responsibility for cleaning up after the dog. If the dog is your boyfriends' and your dog, then you are responsible, and need to pay them to take care of your dogs or put the dog in a crate so the puppy learns to hold it until someone lets him outside. Do you have a written list of the rules? If not make a written list and post it where all can see. Get together for a meeting and  review the house rules. <br>  Next Invite your friend to have lunch with you because you need to talk - just you two. Treat her to the lunch. Explain to your friend that the roommate situation is not working out like you had planned. Tell her, that from what you can see -  it seems that she is unhappy too with the situation at home, and the living situation is not motivating her to improve herself or to find a job. Tell her that you are concerned about her and that the roommate situation doesn't seem to be working out for her. Ask her if there is something going on that she is frustrated by or if there is anything you can do to help, is she depressed, is the boyfriend situation ok, etc? Then listen to her, because she is your friend. Tell her you want the best for her, and if you can help you will.  It's possible that she and her boyfriend want to move but didn't know how to tell you.<br>  Then if you feel it will not work out, tell her that, from what you are hearing and seeing, "it sounds like it would be best for everyone if she and her boyfriend move out". Ask her how much time she will need to move out because you want her to be as ok as possible, but the living situation has become unbearable since the boyfriend moved in. If she says she really wants to stay, then tell her you will give her some time to find a place, and in the meantime, she will still have to pay rent and buy her own food and necessities. Then in one week, ask her if she found a place, if not - ask her how many places she saw and whetehr she would want you to go with her to help her to look. If things are not 100% better in one week, tell her she and her boyfriend have 30 days to move out. Provide a written letter address to each one of them that they need to move out by xx/xx/2008 date. When you let someone move in and collect rent, then they have a month to month type arrangement, so check the landlord tenant laws to be sure you comply with those laws in your state.|`|FH0nwdptaa	Are they getting a discounted rent? If so, then I see your point.  If not, then you need to be handsoff and realize it's just a money deal, not a housekeeping and assistant deal too.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, roomates don't work out.|`|oOIaYQERaa	set the boundaries here.  THEY are USING you b/c they have no appreciation.  they think "we pay rent" so we can do what we want.  Set the rules, if they are going to stay there, even as rent payers, there are rules they need to follow... Make a list and sit down, they need to buy their own food and groceries, they need to not use your shampoo, or put in money for some, they need to go to the store and buy toilet paper.  Don't do their dishes.  Do your own, but you can tell them you expect them to be done in a timely manner, b/c its just not making you comfortable.  Tell them these rules are being made to save the friendship, not hurt it, and also tell them that you are not kicking them out yet, and maybe tell them the things they do right.<br>  <br>  BTW, why do they have to take care of your dogs?  I think this is the one thing as a fellow dog owner, that I'm not getting, you can ASK if they will let the dog out, but as a roommate, it's not their responsibility, it's merely a nicety.  I had a roommate that made it CLEAR she would not be letting my dog our or watching him and I never took advantage.  I would ask her if she wanted his company or not, I would tell her just put him in the bed if he gets on your nerves.  If you are asking them and they are saying yes, then not doing it, then that sucks, and you might want to mention it, then again you might want to let it go and just realize they are not going to let the puppy out or take care of it.  Maybe theink about a crate training, you may think it mean, but it's very beneficial for apartments and potty trains them quickly!  Good luck.
oEYrC1Wsaa	Either take the bull by the horns & write up house rules - no exceptions (make sure she signs them especially if there's a  lease involved).  If this girl can't or won't agree to proposed rules, & changes her mind (as in the coin toss/bedroom incident) I wouldn't want to share.  You don't seem to have matching maturity levels & you would probably end up doing all the cleaning & other stuff just to keep the peace.   You have enough pressure on you already, your @ college & need to concentrate on achieving those goals, you don't need to be worrying over B/S she might bring home through lack of maturity. <br>  <br>  Although it might be a bit tight stretching for your own place, it would more than make up for it knowing the place will be exactly as you left it, not arguing over whose doing what etc.   You will also have your privacy in tact & room to move regarding study arrangements & times.   I know you've written should you "stick it out"? with this girl (sounds like Princess ***** Face her way or the highway, moaning to mutual friends all the way - you did write she's bossy, spoiled & controlling), but you are only going to put more pressure on yourself which you can do without quite frankly.  I think you really have answered your own question. You might save your friendship too.  (That's if it's worth saving). <br>  <br>  You would be surprised how much uncomfortable living arrangements can affect your study performance.   You need good grades. So stand tall & do what is right for you.   Good luck.|`|oOIaYQERaa	DO NOT MOVE IN WITH HER.  It's bad enough the way you can feel about someone who isn't your friend, when you live with a friend you really do run the risk, the very likely risk it will ruin things.  It sounds like you are pretty aware of what you can handle and are wise to know this will really hurt the friendship.  Sounds like you really want to distance yourself from her, but if you move in with her you will just resent her, b/c you did the opposite of what your heart knew was best.  You are wise and I wish you the best.<br>  <br>  btw, the way we do it down south is if you get the bigger room you pay a little more rent.  Like 30-50 bucks.  but if she AGREED to the coin toss and then pretty much threw a temper tantrum, this is the tip of the iceberg for you.
oOIaYQERaa	Yeah, you basically should consider this.  You paid a few bucks (i hope not too much) to find out whether or not this person is worth your time and friendship.  Consider yourself lucky.|`|fevwIVouaa	Sooo...he owes you some money?<br>  How huge? If it's not very huge, just let it go.<br>  But if it's really huge, go for it.<br>  And if he wouldn't talk to you, why don't you're the first to talk to him?<br>  I mean in terms of open conversation, like <br>  'Hi, how are you doing?'<br>  <br>  Do that everyday, and your friend maybe change his behaviours.<br>  Maybe he act like that, because he ashame of you lending him some money.<br>  <br>  ^__^|`|4D7tU3Ilaa	Why won't he talk to you? Leave him alone for now and when he's ready, if he ever will be..he'll come back to you. If after a while, he hasn't come back to you, walk up to him and say, "Why have you been avoiding me?" Just be yourself and be stern.

It's going to be hard but it's better than dragging it out.|`|MIqJRlzAaa	Why not just tell him, You're a nice guy but I don't think we're right for each other.

AA12126809	First of all do all the crying you need and vent whichever way you normally do. For me it's music and racing and then b**ching to my friends. After that you need to keep yourself busy and detach yourself from the situation emotionally. Once you do that and stop associating sweet memories with him and the way he made you feel than you will be able to see him without feeling anything. It really helps if you learn to compartmentalize and detach yourself emotionally.

O06Ms8RQaa	He sounds like he is sensitive, which is something most people don't expect from a guy so don't listen to the options of the skeptical woman. You have already apologized, he's proablaly really upset not just at what might have led to the fight but probably he's upset that some hurtful things  might have been said. I know that when my wife and i fight we tend to same some things and it sounds worse then how we mean it, in fact the first time we faught I did cry cause I figured the fight would ruin our relationship (that was while we were just dating). Give him his space, he will probably be ok make sure he knows that you wish that the fight never took place and that later you can work on what ever the issue was that started the fight.|`|m7whe6zTaa	if a man is crying, that is not good, unless he is really, too sensitive. cause men only cry if they are REALLY hurt. so, i think you should both have some space for the night, and the next morning talk to him alone and tell him u should not have done that and u desperately are sorry.|`|50yWvMIDaa	Give him time, right now he won't want an apology.

Right now, he is feeling hurt and angry and does not want to hear your apologies. When he calms down, he will be in a better frame of mind and will be more willing to communicate with you.<br>  <br>  Men can be very stubborn and tend to have big egos. They cannot handle insults very well. They also find it hard to apologise.<br>  <br>  Also, ask yourself why did you say those things? How hurtful were they? Is it possible that he is over-reacting? Or were you unnecessarily cruel? And why did he say hurtful things to you? If he really hurt you, it is okay to let him know.|`|6SQiRWPUaa	Really? He's hurting, bad.

N00pHxwJaa	PLEASE READ:<br>  Please ignore the silly responses you have received, as, till they can relate or understand your situation they shouldn't frawn on your problem. I am 100% straight so i cant relate to your situation but, i can sympathize and try to help you. Its not your fault that you are attracted to any particular person- whether that be man or woman and what ever age too. And, for you this, just has to be someone the same sex as you and a lot older. I personally dont think that it is love and agree with you that its more of an infatuation and give it time it WILL pass- trust me, Am sure you have plenty of crushes  over time and they passed didn't they? I think the best thing to do would be to stay away- i know that's not the answer you want or you think you need, but, in order for you to get over this you need to stay away. You have even admitted that she doesn't feel the same so there is no chance the two of you would ever have some type of relationship other then, a student, teacher relationship, so why agonize your self by teasing your self with something you cant have. At first it will seem hard, and you will think about her all the time but as the days go by it will start to fade. <br>  As far as your sexuality you sound a little confused and you need to work on this- find your true you. Be your self as no one can love you more than that .<br>  Hope This Helps x x x |`|ABzfSuMNaa	sure go but.......wow thats a situation i have never heard of..but what does ur heart tell u to do? and i think it would be better to follow ur heart then ur mind but dont just come out and tell her "hey i find myself attracted to you" just....i donno i say just follow ur heart|`|WTlG48Ypaa	try and ignore it. its never good crushing on a  teacher!xx

e3S1xaEcaa	Ready has a different meaning for everyone, and for guys it is always much sooner than girls.  Do you know the history about the other guy/guys she has slept with?  It could be possible that she slept with someone much too early, and found herself dumped because the guy already got what he wanted out of her (this literally just happened to me).  It is a good thing not to start the relationship off on a sexual basis.  If you think she is a good girl and you would like to stay with her, then spend time getting to know one another.  Things never work out when you move to fast.  A girl always has her reasons for wanting to wait, and the reason is usually her not wanting to get hurt.  Don't rush her and don't put any pressure on her, because then you might find yourself as the one being dumped.  Just respect her decision; she will let you know when she is ready.  And your homies are right--don't ever break up with a girl because she isn't putting out fast enough for you.  That would be an extremely selfish thing to do.  And remember, classy girls are the good ones.  Besides, if a girl slept with you after 1 day, you would probably consider her a **** and not have much respect for her, right?  Just think about it.  Good Luck!|`|uRfCTBjFaa	Virgin or not, giving *that* to a guy is an extremely important thing to a girl - if she doesn't feel ready yet, then don't push her! If you're willing to break up with her just because she won't sleep with you yet, then no offence, I agree with your brother and your friend. You're not dating her for the right reasons if that is all that you care about to the point that you will leave her if you don't get it.<br>  <br>  You know you're in a good relationship and truly happy when you can be with someone and NOT have to sleep with them to prove anything. You should prove your feelings through words and kindness and compassion first - physical things show lust more than love, anyway.<br>  <br>  Don't push her - its only been one month, and that is not long at all by relationship standards. Maybe she's not ready because she feels that sex IS all that you are after from her, and she does not want to be used. I can't give you a straight answer about anything, or determine your life - but that's my advice, and how I as a girl feel about it.|`|ADzrlCeHaa	haha a month? i complained after 2 months, and i still didn't get laid untill after over a year dude...and she was already 18...she'll be ready eventually but the only way she'll really be ready anytime "soon" is if you (yeah right) actually shut up about it and tell her u love her...but yeah it shouldn't be too much longer if she really likes you, and isn't a virgin|`|1hTrVYrUaa	you should give her time, one month is too soon.. even if your not a virgin, if you really care about her you'll stay with her and give her time, <br>  when she's ready it will be better, dont  make her feel uncomfortable.. <br>  give it time, it will be way better when she actually wants it too.<br>  |`|6z6prixnaa	well if you've only been together for a month and you already want to sleep with her, no wonder why she doesn't want to sleep with you.  its only been a month. shes not ready..   maybe if you wait until she's ready, it might take a while till she will be.  but its worth it.<br>  anyway, i wouldn't worry too much|`|ZbHZhPKJaa	I did that to my boyfriend to see if he would stay or just want one thing and that it and it took me like 5 month to give in but i want to make sure that he didn't want one thing and she want someone to stay with her and maybe other guys left her and they just want one thing but give me sometime |`|xHxThQniaa	Buddy. if a woman says she's not ready, she's not ready. You can't talk her into it. There isn't going ot be a definite reason, the reason is she's not ready. That's all there is too. Just accept it and treat her like a lady.|`|YI6fAau7aa	Women honestly get nothing from sex unless there's trust there. Im not saying she doesnt trust you but it takes a while for us to be ready. Be patient.

If she is not ready then she is not ready, if you care about her then wait, show her some respect.  Dont ever, EVER pressure a girl into doing something that she is not ready to do.  A month is a short amount of time, you were lucky enough to find a girl that has some respect for herself and doesnt want to give it up after a couple weeks.  I think if you could post a question like this then you dont deserve her, she should dump u and u can go find some skank that will give it up to you the first night like she has to every other guy on the block...|`|k9vEbo0xaa	1- Your brother and best friend are right.<br>  2- Maybe she's afraid of something.<br>  3- Maybe it's her time of month.<br>  4- Maybe she changed her mind and wants to wait until marriage.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	What is wrong with your girlfriend is her boyfriend.|`|kWEr4Cvuaa	Be cool and relax.

Really, if it's real and it's true, why would it even matter.  If you're crazy about her, you're brother and best friend like her, and you've only been together for a month, dude, roll with it.  Respect her and her feelings!  True love waits!|`|AYMItQJ9aa	maybe something horrible happened in her past relationship. just give her time. you guys have been together for ONE MONTH, that's still not a long time. and I understand you being crazy about her but if you do care about her why would you want to break up with her simply because she doesn't want to sleep with you.|`|8miIDbjWaa	okay if it's only been a month then slow down, some ppl don't sleep together until they've dated for like a yr!  All i'm saying is that if you were her would you want to rush right into it?  Alot of times girls are more cautious about this type of thing.  Give it a little longer, and don't break it off.|`|mGL1JKrkaa	Wow, that IS early. Leave her alone.  She's trying to figure out how she feels about you and if you're decent.  Gals give away part of their heart when they sleep with guys and she is sparing herself pain.|`|sWgwJ2cMaa	Maybe she is old school and cares enough to take care of herself. If she loves you it will happen and if you love her you can wait. |`|0Pf6yvhwaa	dude obviously your with her for the wrong reasons. shes testing you to see if thats all you want. she should lose your a$s<br>  <br>  go ahead and dump her youll be doing HER a favor|`|g2SKb8TDaa	it has only been a month though...oh men always so horny..
6hgiRL7Vaa	He can't be trusted. Rehab counselors should have told you that. He is an addict and will always have a craving for drugs. Each day he must renew his committment to staying clean. That includes avoiding drinking and any other physiology changing drugs, legal or not. <br>  <br>  You are fighting a battle you lost before you started.  He is still using, that is why he doesn't want counseling. They would require a urine test and it would show the drugs.<br>  <br>  You can drag him to the clinic and put him through rehab, but it won't do any good until he is wanting to quit on his own, he likes drugs, and after release from rehab, he is going to use again. He has already shown you that.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, you and your child will live in squalor, be evicted from one flat after another, and have bad credit from his using the money for drugs and getting credit cards you won't know about until the credit collection agency sues you. When he can't get money from you or credit, he will start selling family and your things for drug money.<br>  <br>  Worse, strange men will show up at your door demanding payment for drugs fronted to your spouse. When you don't pay, they will threaten to hurt you and your child.<br>  <br>  It will hurt, but the only thing you can do at this time is shut him out of your life and your child's life. Staying with him will only enable his drug problem, and endanger you and your child. <br>  <br>  The symptoms you describe, the craving for sugar, and binging are consistent with opiate / morphine / heroin use.|`|GUnhxlQfaa	Love is based on trust in a marriage.  If you do not trust your husband then leave him.  You deserve to be with someone you can love and trust.  If there is even a slight change that he is doing drugs again, you and your children do not need to be around him.  He needs to get his life straighten out and you cannot do it for him.|`|80578b521ef7675f058613b674088db7aa	I guess it depends how it affects you. Yes he has addiction problems, but how do those really affect you? Can you live with him on money binges or sleeping binges or can you be understanding that that addiction has to come out somehow? Can you take over all the money so he dosen't blow it? Can you get him addicted to excersize?|`|RI5RLN2Jaa	i think you should leave him.Because maybe if you leave him he would want to change to impress you that he changed.At least he didnt cheat on you,that wouldve been worser. HE should really go to rehab.<br>  <br>  P.S WiSH YOU LUCK.|`|h15IMPsFaa	Yes leave him. It will only get worse.<br>  Mildred sent me|`|Alyvp37Maa	That is really a tough decision and a decision only you can make.<br>  <br>  Would he go for marriage counseling?  During marriage counseling the therapist could suggest independent counseling for him.  It helps when its not coming from you.<br>  <br>  If all of these fail, I personally would go to counseling to help me through this tough time and help me sort out my feelings so i could make a decision.<br>  <br>  Best wishes and i'm sorry you are going through this.|`|pbwAJ9zOaa	If you really love and he is willing to get help to save your marriage as a final ultimatum then try that. Let him know how things will change between you two and if he refuses treatment you will have to let him go. It would also be beneficial to get all of his loved ones to do the same with you. The theory goes if he does for you long enough he will want it for himself by the end of treatment. Your trust can be regained with his good behavior.|`|qJDcX4UGaa	Go stay with your parents or a friend until he begs you to come back and promises to go to counseling.|`|aOinzEvYaa	You need to pray for him.  Marriage is a commitment.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	In tough times in life...this is when he needs you the most. trust me if you leave him he will be destroyed...read about the addictive personality and or addiction problems. he cant control himself. I would encourage that he seeks additional help and if he doesnt then yes...consequences need to be added. But he needs you...now more then ever to be a supportive, loving wife. But if he does not get help after you have shown so much love and support...he needs to be elft on his own to ruin his own life. Keep trying and encouraging him to seek help and to get better...remind him how much you love him and want to see him improve and how you will stand by his side through this dark time...hopefully he gets better...but if he does not or stops trying...then yes...he needs to suffer consequences. But as long as you see effort and IMPROVEMENT. Not just effort....then be there...otehrwise his life will be worse off then it ever was to lose you. Remember...there may be a time in your lfie where you needs someone's love and support...you would want someone there right?|`|8F3IHGADaa	I would give him an ultimatum - go to counseling or you're leaving.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately most addicts can't see what they truly are and you will never be financially stable with him as long as he continues his destructive habits.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	What are you guys doing to address your husband's problems?<br>  <br>  You're not going to be able to fix this on your own, you need professional help.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i am not going to tell you to divorce your husband, but i know you know that if it is negatively affecting you and your son you have to do something about it.  that can be anything, from divorce, to talking, to kicking him out until he goes to rehab, or whatever it may be.   and you don't deserve to be so sad.  if you think it's done, chances are that it is done.|`|rff71wi4aa	i went through the same but i was not married and only with the person for 5 years but he got caught up in drugs and treated me like total @ss..it was bad so i left and been happy since but in your case<br>  <br>  ((((((he needs rehab, instead of using drugs now its alcohol and eating and spending lots of money. ))))<br>  <br>  <br>  tell him if he doesn't go to rehab you will leave. and see what he does<br>  and if he doesn't then divorce him you don't need to be going through this mess. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  and im sorry<br>  i actually know how you feel and what your going through|`|1TXJDiedaa	You need to have an intervention.

Let me start out by saying that a real man that cares enough about his spouse would suck it up and go to counseling.  Your husband may be sick but please understand that you are only one individual and there is only so much that you can do and allow yourself and children to be subjected to.  When someone has an addiction they often have more than one.  <br>  <br>  Anger and having to defend yourself is not something that you or your children should not be subjected to.  We are our children's teachers when it comes to life and acceptance.  You may have forgiven the act of what he has done but you will never forget it.  Forgiveness does not necessarily mean staying and being a "doormat" (I have been one and am too).  There is an excellent book that my marriage counselor told me to read it is titled, "Codependent No More".  I found my copy a Barnes and Noble but I am sure that you can find it online.  <br>  <br>  God has not allowed us to live our best life yet.  This may seem like the hardest decision that you have ever had to make.  But you never know, it could be the best one! Good-luck to you and your family.

Jh0yyYizaa	I've got a friend who lies alot too. <br>  <br>  And really, you just shouldn't encourage it.<br>  <br>  Talk to her about it and make it clear that lieing doesn't lead anyone to anywhere. <br>  <br>  Then think carefully about shes saying before you believe it.

I would think it was all right and I'd probably try talking to you.|`|tvvnCgnJaa	I'd think it was weird and that maybe he was shy so i would go over and talk to him and see where it goes! xxxx|`|SsI4LLUZaa	I would think he has no confidence and continue doing what I was doing.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I would think that something strange just happend lol <br>  <br>  And if i liked him I'd probably be mad that he didn't have any guts!<br>  <br>  But if he talked to me agian I'd probably let it go.
ise05jjUaa	Yes very normal, take advantage of it.  In a year or two you'll be complaining he doesn't want to be with you sexually, usually how it goes.  By the way he's not that old, he's far from it.  As the years go on, his libido will slow down, once again I'm sure you'll be complaining to at that point that the two of you don't have sex all that often, so again, take advantage of it now while it last or someone else will, if you get what I mean.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I've been married 7 months too :)<br>  It's perfectly normal, don't worry about.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	"So old" at 25 years old, Honey you have a lot to learn.  There are ways, maybe you can rent some movies, to teach him so you can get some pleasure too. <br>         I'm sorry but, I lost it when you said "so old......|`|oxmkllnWaa	very normal... heck at 25 he's half my age and I know I want to make love with my wife virtually every day, I want to satisfy her and please her in many ways... so yea newlyweds in their 20s a couple of times a day is "normal"... <br>  <br>  if YOU're not getting off try adding a tablet of arginine (otc amino acid, get it at the drugstore) every afternoon to help the little man in the boat stand up taller.|`|41NyT8oPaa	well he is not old at all, and it is normal, be glad that he always want to do it with you and nobody else, but keep your eyes open.|`|3ad05f51839ba1e01125f9c9a1ac29a9aa	its not normal for 22 yrs old girl to have low sex drive.<br>  how come 25 yrs old guy is considered OLD!!!!!!!<br>  give him what he needs or he will look for it outside...z|`|1IDSGM71aa	Yes it's normal. You are an idiot if you think he's old or that his sex drive is abnormal. If anything, yours is abnormal. I mean, women don't hit their sexual peak until their 30s while men hit theirs in their 20s, but still. You've been married for only 7 months and only have sex once a week? Jeez. I'm 19 and my husband is (almost) 21 and we've been married for over a year. The only time we didn't have sex more than once a week was while I was pregnant. I thought I was going to die without it, but we couldn't because I was on bed rest. <br>  Oh, and by the way, he isn't too old to be having his first child either. You're both too young and haven't been married long enough to be thinking about kids. Yes, I know I'm younger than you say you are, but we got pregnant by accident about three months after we got married. I was on the pill, too. We didn't want to have kids for another 10 years. <br>  You have a lot to learn if you think he's old, if your situation is even real. My guess is that you're a bored little troll.|`|onbwN4csaa	The lack of sex from the woman you love will only lead to bitterness, resentment and anger. It will also allow him mind to start looking outside of the marriage. to satisfy what he can't get from you.  <br>  They say a gut is in his peek at 16 - 25 years old<br>  I have to disagree<br>  My was from 14 years I'm 51 and still PEEKING with no end in site<br>  would like it daily some twice.|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	Oh my gosh, 25 old. LOL That's funny. My husband and I are 38 and we do it ever day sometimes more than once a day. Yes it's very normal and if you put him off to much he's gonna start look at other women. You need to satisfy his need. A marriage always works better if your BOTH trying to put the other spouse as a high priority. This way both of you are getting what you need.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Oh am I laughing my head off! 25 is old???<br>  <br>  My hubby is 52 and I am 35 and I am still beating him off with a stick everyday! He has to help himself if I dont want it but he aint mind the 3-4 times a week that he gets it.<br>  <br>  25  - old! Still laughing!|`|ywP6zokPaa	J, to be honest I think you should be happy that he even wants to touch you after what you did, besides maybe he's making sure you don't feel the physical need to do it again. Your both young enjoy yourself.|`|56b67ae7a7d42f99ff2ecd43af8e2067aa	Yes, it's normal. Once a week is too little sex for most newly married couples.|`|BItkg1f0aa	hes not near old yet, and yes its normal, hes attracted to you and you should feel great about that|`|TUNvbXbgaa	my man wants it every night and some morning s we been married for almost 4 months but been together for 3 yrs|`|lj2NyXp5aa	he can always get it some where else. would that make u mad.?/////|`|lemQUobOaa	go on and enjoy it ur his wife as wife u should give to ur husband what he wants from u either wise he will start finding some where else it is normal condition dear try to understand him he also love u that much|`|QNQP1lIiaa	I think he should go off with someone else.

7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I allowed my husband to pick the wedding date that way he has no reason to forget our wedding date. His mom told me that all the men in  the family tend to forget and if my husband does not want to be in the dog house it is best to allow him to pick.<br>  Our wedding date is August 28th, 2007.|`|I3V7hE32aa	Originally, 10/31/09, because Halloween is our favorite holiday.  We then decided not to wait so long (it was August 2008 that we made this decision) and changed the date to 4/4/09.  This new date has no significance, but was far enough away for me to have time to plan the wedding, soon enough that we didn't have to wait too long, and it didn't conflict with any plans that our immediate family members may have had.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	Rephrase your question please :]|`|sGP6s7uraa	Why is this for school?

People do different things The day the met a special number for them dead relatives birthday sometimes its just what the venue has available. like ok we want to do it in august the venue might only have on weekend free so you either take it or move your wedding|`|2VGFMCBXaa	I'm not sure if I am reading this correctly.  I think you are asking how we decided on our wedding date?<br>  Well both of us really enjoy the fall and we want to have pumpkins, hay bales and autumn leaves in our wedding so we decided October has the best atmosphere for that.  Also this gives us plenty of time to plan.  The exact date will depend on where we have the wedding and what is available. <br>  Does this help?|`|9YWmMyT7aa	January 31, 2009 at 11am in Washington DC. We chose that date because it was not during the wedding "season" and we could save money (we were on a tight budget). Also the date was available with our reception site and the church.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	August 22|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I always wanted a summer wedding.  My husband didn't have a preference.  So I chose June.  My parents' anniversary is June 17th and the 18th fell on the Sunday that year so that's the day we picked.|`|AA11603468	You just have a talk about the times of year that might be best for oyur needs, then go from there...we knew we wanted to marry in winter because of his business, then we looked at dates that would be good for travelling because we were having a destination wedding, then we further narrowed it down to accommodate my monthly cycle...some couples will plan dates around their church's availability, or any other reason that it important to them--like it being another family member's anniversary or something like that.
Ew5fb4hQaa	For a story, eh? I love stories! Here, let me write out a quick story for you...<br>  <br>  ___Samantha stared at her phone. Not one call. She hesitated for a moment. Should I call him? she pondered this thought. Usually he'd have called her by now. She picked up her phone after what seemed to be a lifetime of waiting, and dialed her best friend's number. Surely Daniella would know what to do.<br>  ___"Hello...?" came a drowsy voice.<br>  ___"Dani? Is that you?"<br>  ___"Yup... Who are this? Ha..."<br>  ___"Daniella, are you okay? It's Samantha." she was worried. <br>  ___"Sammy...!?"<br>  ___"Daniella! What is with you?!"<br>  ___"Fun last night... No. I mean. Can't tell... Bye-bye!"<br>  The line went dead. Hm, that was strange. Daniella hardly ever gets drunk.<br>  ___Realization struck her. Frantically, she dialed her boyfriend's number. Can't tell... Daniella's voice rang in her head.<br>  ___"He-"<br>  ___"What happened?!"<br>  ___"Hangover... can't talk."<br>  ___"You've never gotten drunk! What's with you? And what did you do with Daniella?!"<br>  He was silent for a moment.<br>  ___"I'm sorry..." he sounded like he was crying, "We did it."<br>  Samantha dropped the phone, and it cracked in two. She fell to her knees and started crying. <br>  ___"There's no point," she sobbed, "How could I have thought that my boyfriend really loved me? How could I have known if my best friend really cared for me?" Samantha knew she was being dramatic, but she also knew that this was a far more dramatic moment than it seemed. She picked up the broken phone, and slammed it against the floor. She picked up a shard of plastic, and stalked to her room. She shut the door, and sat on her bed. She picked up a piece of paper and a pencil, and wrote,<br>  ___"I thought you were faithful. I thought you cared. But instead you tell me that you slept with my best friend. Or, at least, I thought she was my best friend. I know you always knew I was a drama queen, but I suppose that this moment really proves it. I hope that in the future, you won't do what you did to me to someone else. Sincerely, your over-dramatic EX-girlfriend."<br>  ___She put the paper on her chest and picked up thee shard of plastic. Squeesing her eyes shut, she did it.<br>  ___And that was the last they heard from her.|`|73NHzJuAaa	First of all it'd be over no questions asked shouldn't put yourself in that situation, second...you be lucky to ever sleep with another girl again... my rule you cheating is uneceptable you wanna do it you break up with me and at least have the decency to say I want something else. last but not least listen to carri underwoods song " before he cheats" and then go tell your girlfriend so you can get it overwith|`|cewWPIzIaa	I'd leave his a s s and dump her as a friend too.  Alcohol is no excuse for poor behavior - you should be capable of knowing when to stop drinking before it severely impairs your judgement and makes you sleep with someone else who you shouldn't be sleeping with.  I've been really drunk before and even then I knew that sleeping with my friend's boyfriend would be wrong!|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	I would be devastated. It wouldn't matter if they were drunk or not. They still would know what they were doing. I would probably dump my best friend but I might try 2 work it out w/ my bf.

hco1t4Staa	Acredito que a palavra 'namorado' em si, significa fidelidade e comprometimento.<br>  A partir do momento em que você se envolve seriamente com uma pessoa, pode até pensar em outra, mas o que predomina é o seu compromisso (pelo menos pra mim é assim).<br>  <br>  Se uma pessoa troca de "amor" como troca de roupa, isso n?o é chamado namoro.<br>  .........................................|`|yBUOyQG9aa	N?o,porque quando você resolve namorar significa que quer um compromisso sério,a partir do momento que n?o quer nenhum compromisso a pessoa pode apenas "ficar",ter uns peguetes...Enfim n?o há necessidade de ficar trocando de parceiro o tempo todo.Mas o importante é a pessoa se sentir bem e feliz com seu estilo de levar a vida!<br>  b-jusssssssssss e tudo de bom|`|wy7gA9Z4aa	A minha ex-namorada sim, o pior que é sempre os mesmos, mais eu acho que ela é t?o boa, que fica um tempo com um depois com o outro e sempre a gente aceita ela de volta, mesmo sabendo que é apenas por pouco tempo.|`|RiI4mVwqaa	Eu trocava muito, estou cada vez melhor, selecionando antes para n?o estragar a amizade só porque quis ficar com um amigo.<br>  Antes era igual trocar de roupa mesmo.|`|lWvavPUAaa	claro que n?o só namoro se houver amor se houver amor n?o vo te pq fica trocando de namorado.|`|gbjAKvX4aa	Quando estamos na adolescencia, as vezes fazemos isto so para competir com as amigas. so para ter a ideia que somos a boazona do pedaco e que todos os meninos sao loucos por nos.<br>  <br>  Depois dos 20 e poucos, isto e sinonimo de que algo nao vai bem e que nehum cara aguenta ficar com a gente por muito tempo.

a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	probably because the grass never really is greener on the other side.  the sex or intrigue or whatever from the easier woman will never compare to the first woman.  they had something deeper and more rewarding, and although it takes a while to realize that, they do.  whatever got them together in the first place is what he is missing when he looks at his life.  that spark, that click, that energy, whatever.  it has nothing to do with physical intimacy or anything like that.|`|jabjwLfnaa	He just hasnt discovered your "secret" yet. Once he accomplishes his goal of bedding you down, he may be gone for good. But, you should realize he's a cheater and more than likely will cheat again. Cut your losses and find someone better.|`|x0jbfxl3aa	You answered your own question "dump the one he loves for an easier woman"...He realizes there was more to her than he thought and that the piece of asss he dumped her for wasnt worth it.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	maybe he sees you as the new easier woman|`|lj2NyXp5aa	hes lost his mind./////|`|FJpmr2Ylaa	Yeah... I saw those moronic answers... ignore 'em!<br>  <br>  Here is what I think... men usually leave women because they are not getting the one thing they crave... admiration!<br>  <br>  It isn't because she is younger or prettier.<br>  <br>  And if he wants to come back to you... it probably means he isn't getting the admiration from the other woman either! And now he is missing you... and he is remembering the good times you had together...<br>  <br>  Here is a pretty good article of tips and advice what to do if your ex wants to get back together with you again...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps...|`|ERFzm2JYaa	This is a good question.  Sometimes people are only interested in momentary happiness and satisfaction.  We try to push out of minds and hearts that which really means something to us. We would rather cover up and deny sometimes that we feel at all.  Maybe the man felt that he was missing something in the relationship and went to seek it elsewhere only to find that it isn't what he needed at all.  <br>  <br>  But be careful.  Words are powerful and some of us fall into a trap of just believing what we hear (because it is what we want to hear).  Some people may try this just to see how much they can get away with.  However, we are human beings and we do make mistakes.  Not every marriage will fail due to infidelity and sometimes some understanding can go a long way.  Good-luck to you.|`|Pdu131uKaa	A morning woody and nowhere to put it.  That'll do it every time.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Because he was think the grass was greener on the other side of the fence.  When he got over to that other side he found out it was the same old grass, and he just hadn't taken care of his like he should have.<br>  Red
kNwqpAMWaa	Seriously you got to relax and let it flow ^_^<br>  <br>  For guys to sense love isn't cool, I mean it spoils the surprise but its usually at how privately the girl hangs out with you and talks with you alone ^_^<br>  <br>  Don't be so observant over things because this could make things awkward ^_^
SL3BFDjHaa	Well start talking, paying more attention, be more intimate... etc. just be romantic!!!!!!!! (She will love all the attention!)|`|s3cvyLYtaa	with words and actions|`|5FogPrZaaa	Words and actions, definitely.|`|NPhPvV85aa	The best thing I can tell you to do is to tell her. If you wait then the love of your life might escape your grasps. When my bf told me he loved me I was the happiest person in the world, mainly because I've wanted to tell him that for months. Just tell her you'll never know what she's been thinking.|`|6uhnyEYEaa	tell her you love her... with words. you have to b the one to ask her out and everything though... because girls never do that. lol|`|BT7t8aWaaa	Words and Actions come first.<br>  ...then maybe a Gift wont hurt.<br>  (: Be Your self too.<br>  And Good Luck!|`|h7nRNxsIaa	It may sound like an old cliche' but take it from me, you cannot buy love, and if your actions do not back up your words then your words meant nothing.  You show her you love her by listening to her...truly listening.  If you do this you would not have to ask this question because you would know the answer.  Love is give and take, it should come naturally, it is also priceless...listen and then actions will follow :)
tvvnCgnJaa	You should break up with your girl as its not fair to string her along.|`|0hHw5IK7aa	You just answered your own questions there " i can't go on if i have feelings for someone else, i think about her alot :("<br>  <br>  No point in being in a relationship if you're in love with someone else. You'd hurt ur current gf so much more if you left it and left it and left it and then broke up. Now would be less painful.|`|dMsHXc4Paa	I am sorry to say this but i think that you might be looking for some sort of escape and you have found it in these other girls that you think that you are in love with and because of your history the feelings might crop back up again. <br>  The relationship can be rocky which might mean you will think about the whole relationship in general, but if it has been so rocky the whole way through why have you stayed with her? The whole time you cant have thought about another girl, so you must love her somewhere. It depends on whether you are willing to loose her to take a risk with another girl. The best advice i can give is, dont leave the one you love for the one you like. <br>  Hope this helps <br>  x
AA10027242	Go for it, but tell him you want to talk about it first.   Tell him about your concerns, and about how you feel about the situation.  You can decide what you want to do after hearing how he responds.  If you don't feel like you can speak to him about it, then he isn't the right one for you to be having sex with.|`|b985e1bb4dd7c02708ee4d73e11f0946aa	Do not have sex with this guy.

Whores take sex for money and honestly, there are times in my life where I've considered that potential.  You ARENT a whore.<br>  What would loose respect from anyone is you having little or no respect for yourself.  <br>  All this fear reaks out of your posting and thats sad.  We all deserve sexual freedom and thats what your wanting in a sex buddy - sexual freedom.  Still, this does not make you a whore.  It makes you a person with physical needs.<br>  <br>  CALL THAT FOOL and get some Christmas LOVE  : )<br>  <br>  But before you do that - relax your worried about things your mother would say and this is your life, not hers.  Define YOU for YOU - not for your mom or someone elses perception of a whore
Wg9d7bhhaa	well first off guys never tell your friends crap you have to do it all i think he likes you but he could be leading you on i would try asking him if he wants to hang out and get to know him at like a basketball game or a dance yeah know what i mean just find out if he likes you for you or your looks first then make your move so you don't get heartbroken OK just hangout and get to know him first don't just judge it by a class try to get to know him!

xu0HiYEOaa	It maybe good for about a few days, but he is still going to talk to other females and maybe have sex with them. I don't know you but you might catch feelings and be mad about him doing his thing. That could break up your friendship..|`|sVPToYvKaa	The "FRIEND WITH BENEFITS" relationship, rarely works out in the long run. No matter who you are, when you have sex with someone, especially more than once, or on a regular occassion, feelings develop. In the end, ususally one person wants out, and the other is left attatched and hurt. I don't reccomend it. I think the 2 of you should be friends, minus the sex, and both try to find other partners [:|`|lqzmJlrRaa	Yes be sex free friends. If romance works itself in then that great, maybe you'll establish a relationship. Aviod lust, that will destroy chances of both friendship and a relationship. Take it slow.|`|xccRugjHaa	You want to have sex whenever you want!  Just keep it FWB and if at some point later you or he want a relationship, then maybe try that.|`|cEaODF8Raa	wish i had a friend like you.|`|Q5KFND17aa	friends with benefits?|`|TQzDd2zCaa	tell him you want to have sex again (: <br>  life is to short!|`|m0KleJrvaa	keep doing what your doing|`|ahUUuINpaa	Yeah you have fool around with him but my advice is just be careful and dont get preg coz if you fall preg than thats it!!! So take your time and dont rush things. newy you have a top day today!!<br>  <br>  byeskies!!<br>  Tatarings!!|`|DtEupwa2aa	You say that the friendship works great- and that is wonderful to hear.  Try to "pull back" and take it easy on the physical side of the relationship and work on just being around him and getting to know each other better.  You'll begin to get a better idea about what you like about him, and what you don't care for so much.<br>  <br>  Many of the successful relationships I hear about between two people typically start with those two people being sex-free friends first, and lovers later.  It doesn't really matter that you have already had sex- what matters is that you're compatible both in bed and out of it.<br>  <br>  Take your time and figure you just need to get to know each other better.  Let things progress naturally and don't try to force anything to happen.  Remember that it's a relationship, and above all else it's supposed to be fun, happy, and resilient.  Good luck!|`|capqMpiCaa	nothing good will ever come of what your doing now. you can't casually have sex with a guy and not somehow get emotionally attached or emotionally confused about him, as you've already experienced. If he doesnt want to think about the future why are you with him? just to have sex? that is selfish, dangerous, and wrong.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	ok since you both are so confused and keep changing your minds the you should either remail sex free friends or you should just have sex and not plan to be anything play it by ear and see where it takes you. but dont expect anything out of it if you continue to have sex or else you will surely end up hurt!|`|sr7jX2wYaa	If  it is working out  great the way  it is  leave it as  it is,  as the saying goes" If it isn't  broke don't fix it"*|`|cxVmq2kraa	Just be careful.<br>  <br>  Gettin preggers would make you 2 stuck together for EVER.<br>  <br>  <br>  Help?<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090128151040AAAMxgc">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|v21tWMG7aa	perhaps if you aren't mature enough to commit to one thing, maybe talking to him about what happened, like what was good, what was bad, etc. will help|`|AA10531094	Stick with the friendship. . . less confusion.

SoLSd9Lyaa	If you started liking her for her looks, body and her personality it's just you admire her but not the crush one.

6G1rUVpkaa	don't worry about it because everyone develops at different stages and ages, and some develop later than others. <br>  im sure you Bf does like you because he wouldn't be with you other wise and looks and the size of your boobs don't always matter to guys well ok they normally do but if he is with you then he obviously does like you and have feelings for you, but if you are really worried talk to him :D|`|iT3caD9zaa	i actually stop going out with someone for having small breasts when i was like 14 but wow did that bite me in the *** she now is a 36 D some girls develop late but now i'm a little older breasts aren't as important so it depends on how mature your bf is:D|`|GBu1M42Raa	if he loves you he won't care he'll see you're heart, and hon you're breast don't stop growing until you're in your early twenties.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't worry if you had bigger ones they'd probably bother you anyway xD  trust me i know.|`|LSqFxEaJaa	Don't stress it. Things will happen soon enough. And if your bf dumps you, or doesn't like you because you don't have a large chest right now, than he would be doing you a favor by getting rid of his shallow ***.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	Boob size does not matter if a guy really likes you.|`|mNJFttV6aa	Take it from me!  Small boobs are MUCH BETTER!!!  When you're my age you'll appreciate it.  If guys judge you on size they are worthless and you need to move on anyway.|`|5UHLMnT9aa	you sound just like me when i was in highschool and around that same age.. i was like 90 pounds 5 foot and had no boobs... luckily i had a real nice butt so everyone commented on that at the time.. but im sure your boyfriend doesnt care about your boobs..i have been with the same guy since i was 14 and of course my boobs have gotten much bigger over the years. ( im now 20) but he never made any comments on the size of my boobs.. i remember when we first started having sex i wouldnt even take my shirt off because i was that insecure.. i realized later that i just needed to love my body and accept it.. and one day i did... you will be fine and if your boyfriend would ever break up with you or anything over the size of your boobs you can def get better.. just hang in there hun your just in the awkward stage right now.<br>  <br>  p.s. its better to be skinny then fat!|`|DhcQC9DBaa	maybe your just a late bloomer.<br>  and yes guys normally care, but it also depends on what they like. some men like boobs some like butts or others are creepy and like other things.<br>  im going to guess he like boobs since his ex's had larger ones but it could also be a coincidence.|`|rdQGlTvSaa	its not that big of at deal... as long as ur not flat as route 2... i find small boobs hotter then big ones actually... big is kinda gross... cuz boobs r bacily fat... yea its kinda gross and big ones have veins and stuff|`|DctewcVIaa	excuse me aren't you a little young to care about what your boobs are like at this age, its not all about your physical appearance you know
bGlZ8I2iaa	Many people confuse definitions of the different aspects involved in relationships. <br>  Love is when another's well being is AS important as your own...not less than nor more than but EQUAL to.... <br>  Friendship is based on trust. The greater the trust, the greater the friendship. Trust can only be tested by allowing yourself to be vulnerable to the violation of the trust.<br>  Then there is the 'chemistry'...that little tingle you feel in your lower lumbar region when you are with that person....<br>  Your 'soul mate' is the person you can have all of these things with...and they can have with you.|`|QGLOrnRlaa	What if you were my soulmate? Should I be able to tell, just from reading the words you wrote? Should I be struck by a strong and reckless spiritual impulse? <br>  <br>  It's a nice thought, anyway. When you're in lust with someone though, you'll convince yourself of anything.|`|lObEjUh1aa	this is fantasy, and is based on a feeling you want to capture.  sadly, a person is a person .... not a feeling.  if you want relationships that actually work, you are going to have to get past the fantasy and focus on the reality of what is practical and functional in your relationships.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sure does...not everyone gets to find it though.  Even soul-mates have challenges in marriage, nothing stays fairy tale perfect forever.|`|lj2NyXp5aa	no such thing, just luck./////|`|UONwTWIQaa	the first answer, "just say it," hit the nail on the head... nothing stays perfect forever... but, when it comes to love, real, true and honest love, even if you dont have butterflies as much as you used to, i'll bey my butt that most people would still take the bullet for their significant other... i dont think i believe in soul mate so much as, everything happens for a reason... i was married for 6 years, so was my fiance, and we both got divorced around the same time... i wasnt interested in him when he asked me out, but my best friend told me to go have fun, not to sit on my butt at home... at least it would be a free dinner.. and it turned into an amazing love story... and i couldnt imagine being with anyone else... it was a fairytale at first, where everything was too perfect to be true, and that has since faded, but my love for him hasnt, nor his love for me, and thats the most omportant part...|`|1a482ad88d562e8424d386c68e5908a7aa	i believe i have found my soul mate. we've been together 2 years and our love has only grown stronger. and it was very strong to begin with. then again we have a lot trying to keep us apart so i think it makes it more exciting and keeps everything fresh. it creates the romeo and juliet effect so we have a very strong desire for each other. but still, we've been together 2 years and we have a true, established long term relationship. i guess its that thing that sets us apart from most other couples that helps us persevere through it all. i hope the "reality" never sets in for us.|`|DWmNl8kaaa	I belive that there is someone out there for everyone.|`|UGIfMTj1aa	I don't believe in fairytale love - that is just what it is a fairy tale - there is no prince charming, sure there are good guys, but not perfect.  No one is gonna come to you on a white horse and be the perfect man.  And I don't believe in "soul mates".  I do believe that there are people out there that you will be fall deeply in love with and will be good for each other, but not soul mates.  What if you think you find your soul mate and he/she dies.  Then what - should you not ever be able to find another again, because your soul mate is gone?  No - I just don't believe that there is only one person out there for everyone.  And true love is a friendship and commitment to each other - it is working through your problems, having good times and bad and never giving up.
P3OWfxi5aa	OMG...this is horrible. if thats true then thats HORRIBLE. you cant hit someone over something like that. anyways i think you should just keep it secret for now. maybe ask ur friend if theres anything she would like to talk about to you. tell her that shes ur friend and she should be able to trust you with anything. if she says no then just let it be. if she says yes then discuss it with her. but if she doesnt say anything then maybe you should talk to her boyfriend and maybe her boyfriend should talk to her parents and tell them about himself and make them like him. then maybe they wont be as hard about it. i hope everything works out for your friend =]] good luck

Uj5kuzoJaa	He's at typical male pig. This is the kind of thing that makes us women not trust the guys we're with. I would drop the whole "friendship" with him. He obviously only wants to see you for one reason. If you don't mind being the other woman, then go for it. If you have no interest now that you know he's married, let it go.
osZ5zVEDaa	Having been around this behavior in the past I have had some experience. I am not sure if you have gone to Alanon. it is for Alcoholics and Addict family members or even friends to help them in dealing with all the craziness that occurs during this time. In the end what they tell you and is truly the best thing you can do is tell them to get help through AA or the like and that until they are clean you will have no contact with them. Until your Son hits rock bottom this will never get better. He needs to hit a point where he shocks himself and decides to change his life. You should support his sobriety, but not his addiction. <br>  <br>  Yes I do believe he is manipulating you or at least trying to.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I don't think it matters if he is pulling your strings.  He is an addict, and they will always try to get away with something.  Stay tough, you will help him more that way in the end.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, I am so sorry you're dealing with all of this.  All I can tell you is if he's an addict, he very capable of lying.  One of my best friends got into drugs years ago and lied, stole checks from my checkbook, pulled all of our strings, tried to manipulate us to feeling sorry for her, tried to get us to lend her money.  It was only when everyone turned their backs on her that she decided to do something about it.  To this day, though, I don't trust her in my home.  You may want to get some therapy for yourself.  Just so you can cope with all your feelings of loss and sadness and guilt.  Get help for yourself.  Good luck to you.|`|i15KoiJhaa	If your Son has what is referred to as "Meth Mouth" then no, it would not be uncommon for the extractions to be needed.<br>  <br>  I am sorry your going through this.... I can only imagine how devastated and heart broken you are... the Love of our Children is sometimes very painful....|`|0LvWiESWaa	I would tell him that unless he is contacting you to give him a ride to a treatment facility, there is nothing you can do for him.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard. Stay strong. Enabling him only makes him sicker.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	How does he have a myspace and a cell phone when he's homeless?|`|nX1QW5GCaa	A lot of good advice already.  Curious that all this started after you stopped visiting his "Myspace" page.  I don't know much about this site.  Can he see who's viewing his page.  If he can, he may know you stopped looking so he's finding other ways to get "information" or maybe "disinformation" to you. If this could be the case, create a new ID on hotmail and check from that.<br>  Otherwise, if he's an addict, be VERY careful.  He could suck you into the same old routines as he's done in the past.<br>  Good luck!|`|bzQNHfunaa	honestly i think hes testing you. u are his mom and he knows that u care and will always be there. as much as it hurt stop being there for him. he willnot change unless he wants to|`|lnd249Lsaa	I really dont think we should bother with this one. Lady, you need to call Maury or Dr. Phil.|`|dVlLahozaa	if he is an addict he needs some sort of medical attention|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Oh Baby , put my name on it then....lol..lol...lol... We'll get you a good one, PRETTY and staight!.|`|VwnLufUAaa	Yes, I think he's pulling your strings. He's said, "I'm homeless and cold, I got beat up, and my teeth are all rotting out of my head". What mother wouldn't be concerned about those things?<br>  <br>  Yes, it is possible for a person to need that many teeth pulled, especially if they're doing methamphetamine. That drug causes your teeth to crumble away right down to the gumline. It's also possible this was caused by a disease (my mom lost all her teeth when she was 18!) but given his history, I'd be more likely to suspect meth.<br>  <br>  It's brave of you to not help him out anymore. Most moms can't do that. As you've probably already learned the hard way, coming to his rescue does more harm than good. If you give him a free pass to not take responsibility for his own life, he'll have no reason to change.<br>  <br>  Whether or not he's an addict, you're doing the right thing. This must be heartbreaking for you, but by not helping him you're giving the only help you can give.|`|unVj43Xxaa	Definitely sounds like he's trying to get your attention and he wants to guilt you into something. That's a hard one. I'd be really tempted to help my daughter if she was in that situation but I think I'd have to stay strong and let her find the right path for getting her life straight. The only real help would be finding job leads, food banks and things that are tools for things he wants which is probably money because giving money would not be well spent and would be a temporary fix which would make him dependent on you. How does he afford a phone but nothing else?

He did not stay away from F,B and R (Richard). R might use you to get back at her and well. Do not waist your life and time to see if he will tell you the truth. Just know that he did and leave it and leave them and move on and find a good man. He is not a good man so stop waisting your time. He is not think about you while he is with her now so be done with it. Go party with your girls and flirt and meet new people.Go shopping and have fun...Tell F to F off and  Tell B she is a B and tell R ty for the info and wish him good luck. Good luck to you too. <br>  PS there are way too many men in this world to waist more time on this ONE.

z8m6C3XKaa	Well Vegan, you've given it your best shot and now it's time to pull the plug.  He obviously hasn't made it past the intellectual age of 12 yet, and you're right, you don't want to stoop to his level.  Fighting back at him is what he wants.  It ignites the situation and feeds his drama.<br>  <br>  If he's so petty as to tell your secrets to your parents (that's clearly blackmail btw) he is the farthest thing from deserving someone better than you.  In all honesty I can say it's best to rise above his level (which doesn't sound too hard).  Keep cool, getting angry makes you say unreasonable things which is ammo for him.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to wait a few days with no contact, then call him.  If he picks up, tell him you're coming by on the weekend or whatever to pick up your stuff.  If he doesn't, leave him a message.  Don't bring up anything else.  If he brings it up, just tell him you can talk about it later, but that you don't want to get into it over the phone.  No matter what keep cool and be mature.  I bet if you keep at it he'll cool down himself.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't allow you to retrieve your stuff, you'll have to make some choices.  Is your stuff worth all the aggravation?  If so, you may have to take him to court.  I'm not sure how young you are...but there are options no matter how old you are.<br>  <br>  As for the secrets from your parents: if you let him know it's important that they don't find out, he'll hold that over your head as a potential bombshell.  Don't give him that ammo.  I can't stress enough how childish it is for him to do that.  Consul yourself that it's possible your parents might learn this and make your peace with that, then tell him you don't care.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I'm sorry it didn't work out with him :(<br>  Now you can find someone better - shouldn't be hard ;)|`|TEE4sJscaa	The whole situation isn't about you. Its about the level of his maturity . There is nothing wrong with wanting your personal property back and moving on. He is the one that is being a kid about the whole thing. It's not about your posessions at all, its about him wanting to have control and power over you.
dYPffc13aa	This is simply my personal take on your question, it may be right and it could very possibly be wrong. Look at it this way, men and women are from Venus and Mars, we think differently, act differently, and so on. These differences are what compel us to look for a girlfriend/boyfriend. I don't mean to sound corny, but we complete parts of each other. It only makes sense that you would want to look for someone to be with, just to fulfill that little side that needs interaction from the opposite sex. As a girl, I just find the concept of someone being "there" at the end of a long day comforting. It doesn't have to be all about the hormones or the deep connections, it's just nice to have someone by your side. Perhaps that's why you're looking for a girlfriend. <br>  P.S, it's great that you're looking beyond hormones for someone, I wish you luck.|`|4HoVVCenaa	testosterone. social pressure. family expectations, loneliness.

To me this isn't a "godly issue" but a husband respecting his wife issue.  You both need to go to the priest (or minister if not Catholic) and ask for counseling.  Normally I would say to seek out a secular counselor but faith seems to be instrumental in your relationship and you might get further going through the church.  If he objects because he is embarrassed then tell him how embarrassed you are to be nude in front of him.  How this has lowered your self esteem.  If he loves you, he will go.  Good luck!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I don't care whether you want to hear it or not.  Men look at porn.  Period.  They are visual creatures by nature.  Period.  You can go on and on all day long about the bible and whatever other rhetoric and he will still look at porn.  Hopefully, he'll just get better at hiding it from you.  I guess in your house it will "what I don't know won't hurt me."  Good luck with that.|`|yGQgdYNwaa	He needs to step down from ministry immediately..He is blaspheming Christ's name in his behavior and i wouldn't tolerate that at all. I had sense enough to step down from ministry when spiritually i wasn't ready and he definitely isn't. It's disgusting and putrid and of course a sin against God. He needs to work on himself. Don't blame yourself for not being perfect. He chose to look at that crap...HE chooses to continue in it. Alot of women blame themselves..this isn't about you. Cause even if you thought you were a perfect 10, he would still look at porn. It's a sadistic, fantasy thing. so you need to get on your knees, pray hard and confront. and if he doesn't change his ways...that is grounds for divorce, it's called Adultery, whether there is sex involved on his end or not. If he's lusting after other women, according to the Bible, it's adultery..If it was me..i would do the same. I will not tolerate a hyprocrital husband and he has the audacity to play in church on Sunday, probably with a big Koolaid smile on his face. That is disgusting in God's sight and you need to demand him to change his ways and seek counseling, or lose you and your kids..(seeing them daily in the same household i mean) Blessings to you Sister..i believe you will do the right thing.<br>  <br>  Edit * im getting alot of emails so here's the thing...I am entitled to my opinion. IF you're going to email me..do not disrespect or demean me in any way and i'll be happy to respond. I didn't disrespect anyone..and if you are a true Christian, the Bible says you are not to judge..i never said i was without sin..when did i say that in my post. In fact i think i admitted that i did sin, if you read the first couple of lines in my answer. So don't come trying to bash me ,if you don't agree thumbs down me, i don't care..

Being a preacher or a believer doesn't change the fact that he's a human being with all the strengths, and weaknessess, that all humans have.<br>  <br>  If his faith alone can't change him, ask for help from another human being who works in this profession. Doesn't it say somewhere that the Lord works in mysterious ways?|`|VwnLufUAaa	A lot of men enjoy porn. That is a fact. Your christianity may tell you it's wrong, but the reality is that men enjoy porn. You and your husband are having what's called cognitive dissonance. You see reality but can't accept it, because you've been trained to believe that reality is evil and wrong.<br>  <br>  Your faith does not match reality. This is hard or even impossible to overcome. <br>  <br>  His wanting to look at porn has nothing to do with you; it has to do with his biology. Perhaps you're looking for a fairy-tale existence where your husband will be so totally smitten with you that he doesn't even notice other women. This is not reality.|`|kGbc0Y7kaa	I am a Christian as well. I like porn and my wife does not. I know its wrong. However, it is my sin that I have a hell of a time putting to rest. <br>  My wife was a freakshow when she found out and I was lying as well. <br>  <br>  The fact is we all sin and if his sin is hurting him alone its no big deal but since it hurts you he should try to stop. You degradiing him will only make him hide it better. Trust me, you have to be open to this and not judgmental or you will never see it disappear from his life.|`|p15pj8jnaa	Ok.  This just my opinion. But try not to think of this as your husband not wanting you anymore.  He has an addition to porn.  And when he says the girls that do that stuff are nasty, he means it.  However, he can't help but to be drawn to it like an alcoholic to beer (or whatever other drink).  He most probably despises his affliction, but is powerless to overcome it.  The main issue is when he had a "problem" with porn in the past.  It's not that he doesn't want to be with you.  Its the fact that he has most probably developed preferences for different things that he's seen on the internet that he can't do with you.  BDSM, or the other type of IC.  I won't go into great detail, but you get the idea.  The simple fact is that your husband loves you and you shouldn't feel any less pretty or that you mean less to him because of this.  He needs help.  Professional help.  This isn't something that can be easily overcome by himself.  Spiritual guidance is a must, but counseling is needed as well.  For starters, put the computer in an open area where there is no privacy, like the living room.  That will act as a deterrent.<br>  <br>  Once again, this is just my opinion.  Hope this helps.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  You go girl!  You're right.  You shouldn't have to settle for anything and it is NOT your place to "cover up" your husband's sin.|`|rFwMlyV9aa	Reading this makes me so sad, I have gone through exactly this, every single thing you said.  Not many people understand how this kind of thing really makes you feel.  My husband and I went through this over a year ago.  It does make you feel so horrible it is crazy.  You think your going to forgive and forget, but you cant.  It started to consume me, if he is looking at porn (and lying about it) what else is he doing?  You completely lose trust for that person.  My husband and I are still married, but have trust issues.  It is so ironic to think that this person is telling you one thing, and does things that are completely opposite of what they've said.  If you really do trust him, and think that he knows he has done wrong, then you can work it out.  And it isn't something that is going to take a couple weeks, it is going to take several months for you to ever be able to ever accept it. Don't think your going to forget about it, that's not going to happen.  One thing that I have learned through all of this is to NOT hold back anything you need to say.  Holding back is only going to make things worse, you'll end up exploding.  This sounds really stupid, but time and being open with each other is the only thing that will make this easier.  I hope that you can work everything out, good luck and God Bless.

Good luck!<br>  EDIT>> Why did you ask this question like six times?|`|ymK1hg2Raa	well, if you think about it, her father was a psychopath. killing her mother was a rotten thing to do. he was the closest thing she had to a father. <br>  <br>  she has to be taking this hard. harder than you. i was really sad when my best friend's grandma died because she had Alzheimer's and i thought of her as a sort of third grandmother.<br>  <br>  tell her that it's okay that she doesn't want to get married right now. let her get over this and she'll be ready. trust me.<br>  <br>  i'm so sorry for your loss. it's a hard thing. i hope your girlfriend does better. let jesus and god be with your father. god bless you.|`|dE2MG56Caa	Just wait until the time she is ready to get married then she would appreciate that alot and she will be ok after a couple more months and she is just upset because that was her father figure and is afraid everyone she will get close to will all of a sudden will die so give her lots of hugs and tell her you will wait forever and be there for her she will like that and then be comfortable.|`|Ndc1Pslfaa	Well, maybe she thought of him as a dad and is very hurt. Just let her know that you'll wait until she's ready to get married.|`|z36M42Zfaa	I hate to break it to you but...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your girlfriend was fuc*king ur dad.|`|1295e34d28d9ad8c7187f4e91aaa29b1aa	She is simply putting herself in your shoes. Comfort her the way she should be comforting you.|`|1dd3668b0491a4275cb04c48eb40d51daa	you already posted this~1~|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Because she is a drama queen|`|sh6h4Fmeaa	Shes upset.|`|AA10185559	give her time|`|vuPHfPtIaa	l|`|u1X72HZ4aa	awww I'm sorry.. just give her time|`|z5N0fQITaa	woman are over emotional people, its the way they are<br> <br> .|`|ukBX5OOsaa	She's emotionally not ready, considering how traumatic her past experiences have been with parents (her mom dying, and now your father passed away).<br>  <br>  Respect her decision to wait, and comfort her as much as possible, she has gone through so much throughout her life and now it's like her wound has opened again. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I'm sorry to hear that.
54GHFbTraa	You can. But depends on your age. If your 11-14 sure... If your older you should really talk to her and ask her in person. Its part of being the man you know what im saying?|`|z3lvdGF2aa	well here is the thing you have two options and asking by txt is not one of them!!! :) <br>  1- you can ask her for her number (in case you dont have it!) and call her and ask her out on a date on the phone <br>  2- you can arrange something casual like a dinner or movie or hanging out and then ask her out on an official date then and in PERSON!<br>  I would strongly suggest the second one but both will work. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped <br>  Best of Luck! <br>  ~S@m|`|jIyHOKeHaa	If you're in junior high, yes. Even a freshman in high school. But other than that, it's not exactly the cool thing to do. What you should do is ask her out, literally, on a date. But say something like "Do you want to go to the movies?" and ask her out there. Seriously, it's so much more meaningful when a girl can tell her friends about it rather than print it out and show it. Plus, you can score extra time with her.|`|wbvkvulNaa	ok this is wat i would say i got asked out that way with my boyfriend since he is really shy that way and now we r 10 months with out relationship but i gotta tell y something alot of girl don't like it when guys ask them out that way they hate it but i wasn't that type so i know there r some who wouldn't mind like me but others who just hate it i would say do it by person but if u think she wouldn't mind text msn is fine|`|f9d3e09260cf8bfa383abd907e1d50a0aa	ask her if she'd like to meet you somewhere to eat or hangout or something dont text her "will you go out with me?" cuz that's just pathetic and not attractive but ask her on a very casual "date" and if she says yes then take it from there. remember theres no substitute for talking in person|`|m0LkRBiEaa	u shouldnt do it by text/msn<br>  ask her for her # and call her|`|dd2bb1d19b7ad488f3f6c923786f3438aa	dude ask her out, however u can it doesnt matter how you communicate|`|37bc2448f8a416f89ef2fc28bd18e67eaa	i would actually perfer that but that might just be me|`|8177922025c2747f9d8227a83cbad870aa	I would much rather a guy ask me out in person. It shows me he has a pair. It's not as bad as breaking up with them via internet or text but still. It's just my preference. If you do it in front of her friends you might really score some extra points with them to. It's always important for friends to like the bf.|`|g5Ir41v9aa	maybe  you should text her and ask he to meet you somewhere so you all can talk<br>  but to text he and ask her out is just telling her straight up that you dont have the courage to assk her to her face<br>  and that is not a good sign<br>  ]trust me|`|qB66ryseaa	Just see if you can take her away from your friends and hers for even a minute and then ask it. It's way better in person.|`|X0ivl3Bqaa	yea but its better in PERSON!!!<br>  be confident and tell her and she would love that better|`|KCEKUpZ5aa	no not really|`|DGigWUXgaa	NO DONT DO IT!!!!!! SHE'LL THINK THAT YOU AREN'T MAN ENOUGH TO ASK HER IN PERSON!! TRUST ME...|`|OtU6z4OFaa	Yeah that's fine|`|ymkAVUfOaa	If you want her to think that you really mean it, and that she's special, try to make time to let her know that.<br>  <br>  Ask her to meet you somewhere where you can be alone. It can be like early before a class, or something of that sort. I'm sure you can figure something out. It sounds like you really like her, so don't be afraid to go out on a limb and let her know that. You've got to put your heart out there to get her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  <br>  Chris|`|Y1BElRm7aa	Meh, text? Don't do it. It's just an automatic turn off. It will make her think you have no confidence. <br>  <br>  The LEAST you can do is call her, which is much better than text!<br>  <br>  Or..just wait till you see her in person.|`|nC92yqx7aa	yeah. but the best thing to do is to call her. So u can listen to her tone of voice and determine things.|`|2c9b6b1ea7223077886584010a6e8eaaaa	better call her up or talk to her personally..<br>  text is lame
JGcGtm8waa	He realized that breakin up with u was a mistake and he's trin to back back with u..<br>  <br>  If it didnt work once- its not meant to be... <br>  <br>  <br>  I can tell u from experience, my ex and I broke up 6 times(in 2 yrs)... I finally learned and moved on- now he has 2 kids and is gettin a divorce(we're both 18)...Im glad I didnt go back the last time or my life would be really messed up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ur ex is jus messing with u- it probably didnt work out with the "other"<br>   girl- thats why he came crawlin back to u.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dont take him back though- if he did it once- he'll do it again.|`|U2w775zZaa	It has lol at the end of it which confuses me a little it could mean 1 of 2 things. <br>  <br>  1. He could really want you back but needs to know how you feel first before he goes out on a string and asks you to be his gf again. <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  2. Hes hinting that he misses the relationship you had and wants it back.|`|VgQkKd9Kaa	He's tryna get back wit u, maybe u should be friends first, n see where it takes u guys from there.|`|AA11130323	he's dying to get back into your panties
n195n9Avaa	He wanted you :)|`|4zKmOkI4aa	awesome,congrats! goodness comes from any place.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	If you are meant to see him you will again. If not then you know you are attractive and desirable.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Maybe he is Santa Clause desperate for dating.   or maybe he knows you , and you forgot.  try to squeeze your memories.  or maybe he is just drunk and trying to get a woman, but too scared or shy to reveal himself.<br>  <br>  I would be happy if a woman paid me anonymously.   and even if we get laid anonymously that would be better|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	he may have been interested in you but then got too shy to aproach you.<br>  or he could have been "paying it forward"<br>  some people are doing it, like paying for the persons behind yous meal in a drive through or something<br>  <333|`|3HhhHWd4aa	The first poster is not only right ... he is also a genius.<br>  <br>  10 points to him I hope.<br>  <br>  (The guy wants to **** you hard.)|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Wow, that is so cool! And a mystery ooh la la.|`|KICVcuDgaa	Sometimes a man will do things for attention and others will do them just cause.  More then likely he did it cause he really want to make an impression, and that he did.  Leave it to fate, if you run into him again, approach him and thank him for his spontaneous act of chilvary and repay him by having lunch with him.  Look at it this way, if you like him then you caught a good one, but if you don't consider your jester as a way of returning the favor.<br>  <br>                                       Norrell|`|At8D5Xu2aa	It's anonymous because he wanted it to be a romantic gesture.  If he had left a number, then it would have looked like an agenda.  This is an example of someone who just wanted to make you feel good--so enjoy it.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could check the restaurant to see if the guy is a regular, or if the waitress remembers his name.|`|s7UZZbVhaa	you should feel flattered. at first, don't think too much of it. haha free food! if he really does care than he'll make an effort to find out who you are. it might be stalker material, but a simple act like that should be taken as flattery, as a compliment. good job, girl!|`|udh1tUFZaa	All i can say is lock your doors, pull the shades, make sure this dude isn't already hidden in your place and pray you wake without a knife in your back.<br>  <br>  Scary.  Best.|`|B2HUARPCaa	Either he is really nice and has money or your hot|`|RFl5bfw9aa	some people just like doing a good deed.  just thankful and pass the blessing on.|`|AA11813187	he wants u to be on bed. Thats all|`|t3ka4G89aa	are you hot?<br>  <br>  or maybe he was just being nice and decided to pay for someone random, and he picked you because, being one person, your bill was probably cheapest|`|utoh3dAJaa	He wants to put it in.|`|mv5Vow6Haa	Hmm... strange. <br>  Too bad he didn't leave his number|`|1Qt0rDitaa	HE WANTS TO GET IN YOUR PANTS|`|AA11072103	did you get a look at the waiter...maybe it was the waiter ;)
g1CsXtupaa	I believe that if he says he loves you then he is after two things...you, or you know what, and if you know him correctly then you should know the answer to that.<br>  <br>  Also, if he is after 'you know what', you might have to learn to get over him, or it will tear you apart, knowing that you are in love with him and he is not in love with you.<br>  <br>  But I see only two reasons he would say that. And it's likely he means it, but being given the information you told me, I cannot be sure....|`|AA10214276	There's this girl that I like that when we're together, I really like her and she likes me and everything feels great, but when we're not, I always start to think about how she's not the best girl for me to have any kind of relationship with, because she's just so different and it's like she lives in a completely different dimension, but when we're together it's like our love prevails over rational thought and I forget about all that. <br>  And I think your boyfriend really loves you. I wouldn't say sweet things to a girl unless I really liked her. Even then I wouldn't say sweet things to her, unless it happens by accident, which it often does. Even if I'm just looking for sex I wouldn't say sweet things because I think girls respond better to more confident, I know you like me so let's get together kind of behavior.|`|966e591e0a8b096ea3291985162ce64eaa	Time will tell.|`|sSPVgO1Vaa	of course i don't know this for sure, but it sounds like he is in love with you.<br>  he probably acts the way he does when he is not with you because he misses you and he can't stand not being with you. first of all, i get in pissy moods when i'm not with my boyfriend soooo i'm just guessing he misses you?....|`|vWlJ9qLOaa	he probably is in love with you|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	altho u just been as a couple for 5 mths, do actually know him deep down.. follow your instincts (the 6th sense!)/... get yourself alone an think properly.. is he the one?? is he truthful or just want to go in bed with u?<br>  if he really loves u,wait for a few more mths(4-5mths more.. i know its so long.. but pls try!)b4 going to bed with him,to make this work, try avoiding going to his house in order to prevent yourself getting in bed with him.. go to the park, in public..<br>  but i have a hunch he wants ... sex..<br>  be careful bunny..|`|G0O1M5XZaa	I am going to try to answer you as simply as I can. If you haven't had sex with him he could be buttering you up to try to get to that point. See if in the next couple of days he brings it up or trys to go a bit further than what you usually do. When i was younger guys would say that to me. One even rang me and put on that song I'm so in love with you. We had just split up. He made out like he wanted to get back, then when I met him he wanted sex which we had before, but after that he said i have to go and made up some excuse. I then broke it off with him. Thats why I am asking you if you have has sex yet or not. The guy I am with now and have been with for 16 years didn't even bother to ask me for sex at the start. So just take notice of what he says and does in the next few days or week. Hope this helps.|`|QZYy7kaZaa	5 months is not too short, in fact you had better know by now but you sound a bit young and by that I mean that people change a lot in their teens and twenties and you are still learning what it means to be a couple and what it means to be yourself. So I'm sure he cares for you in his own way because he wouldn't hang around you if he didn't. But love is a funny thing. Some day you'll look at this and laugh!|`|3b3XPcdpaa	If he says he loves you, he most likely does. Guys don't really come out and say it, unless they want in your pants, lol. But just trust him, thats what a good relationship is based on isnt it?<br>  I have the same worries about my boyfriend. But when i ask him, and he gets all serious with me and looks me in the eyes i can tell he means it.|`|MgCoYUWhaa	You are the only one who can answer your own question. You are the only one who will know if your boyfriend really loves you. And if you want to make sure that he is true with his feelings for you, don't make love with him until you get married. If he can do that, then he is true with you.|`|RFl5bfw9aa	congratulations you have just been "sold a dream (icecream dream)".  it will be the first of many.  Love is told better with actions rather than words.  he probably cares for you but love is not something you can question, true love is not something you can miss.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	You need to accept what people say, but measure it by what they do.  And you need to stop looking for an absolute form of validation you'll never find, or you'll drive him away.|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	well if he didnt mean it then he wouldnt say these stuff to you|`|kEeUsdnYaa	You insecure. <br>  Insecurity's are the ACID to relationships.<br>  You are not in love.<br>  This is called Limerance.<br>  Limerance is a term coined a few years ago by someone in the attraction psychology field whom I cannot remember the name.<br>  Limerance lasts 2 years on average.<br>  <br>  Limerance is the reason why so many people get divorced- because THEY DO NOT DATE EACH OTHER FOR A LONG ENOUGH TIME IE: 3 years.<br>  <br>  If you are TRULY in love then your relationship should STILL be strong after an additional 2.5 years.<br>  <br>  5 months in relationship terms is NOTHING.|`|xeEVoHdUaa	Stop stressing over this and go to sleep.  If you continue to stress and press the issue, he will get tired of you asking and not want to be with you at all.  If you two are truly in love, then neither of you are not going anywhere.|`|kk6YNVbuaa	when you're in love, you can definitely tell if the other person feels the same way. so if you are unsure, im not too sure you are in love yet.|`|puDt4cYdaa	Believe him as you would want him to believe you.  Has he given you a reason to doubt him?<br>  <br>  Don't push him, and stop asking him if he means what he says; or you may find yourself alone.|`|rHWvI0Qkaa	how are strangers online supposed to be able to tell? it's something you personally should be able to tell. if you can't, you need to talk to him about it again or try it in a different way.|`|jOk6bfvRaa	i think he really cares about you and he loves you and would do enything for you.|`|9YwCx4dwaa	Ok...He is in love with you..You just gotta believe it. I mean if he didn't love you then he wouldn't be saying all those sweet things to you.|`|KCkzhUNIaa	u have to trust him that he is.<br>  or u could he wont stick around.<br>  no one likes being questioned 24/7.<br>  just trust him. and enjoy ur time with him.|`|u6Qwlf9daa	HE DA PIMP.<br>  <br>  i'm just kidding.<br>  seems like he really likes you.<br>  don't stress too much over it.|`|c6093b5bff61ae8ce46ae851abc297c1aa	Love can happen in 5 months, im not going to discredit that. But hey heres a book suggestion "datable" its great and helped me rethink dating relationship and put a few things into perspective.<br>  <br>  One thing different between him and you is that when boys say they love you forever, they mean it, but not the same way you or i mean Forever. <br>  <br>  Heres the thing. If he did love you. why would he act moody and irritated with you. With love comes a choice of action. If you love someone you want whats best for them and know that treating them like your irritated hurts feelings- which is not best for you. <br>  <br>  If he loved you he would choose to treat you like the most wonderful woman in the world, with the utmost respect and kindness.<br>  <br>  think about it a bit more before you marry him.. or let those awsome kisses turn into him using you. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|uaor1BTqaa	Babe.<br>  When you really love someone<br>  youll probably fight even more..<br>  its not always bad. It makes you stronger.<br>  <br>  Maybe theres something you dont know about thats going on with him and just making him really grumpy all the time.<br>  <br>  You cant worry about that<br>  boys are just known to give wrong impressions!<br>  if he says it<br>  and your still together.<br>  Dont worry.<br>  <br>  Im not saying 5 months is too short to be in love<br>  but  i really thought i was in love with someone <br>  for about that time.<br>  and he said<br>  he wuoldnt know what to do if he ever lost me<br>  and then basically i was thrown away..<br>  for another girl<br>  and i can honestly not express how much it hurt me<br>  <br>  just dont get so worked up about it<br>  itll be fine<br>  im sure he loves you<br>  dont get yourself hurt though.<br>  <br>  Dont be too clingy. When he wants to give attention to you he will.<br>  itll be fine darling.<br>  <br>  you can talk about it more to me if you like
GjwQWTpRaa	Okay. You really like her as a person. Okay. That's good. She abuses you during sex. That's bad. If you have a problem with her bedroom behavior and she won't change and can't admit to the problem STOP HAVING SEX WITH HER!! Just be her friend and realize she's abusing you during sex. If you were into this it would be another thing. If you even talked about it before hand that would be different. She burning you hurting you and overall abusing you. She has psychological issues and not a few of them. You can help her if you like or love her, but being... well intimate isn't the right word, I guess I'll go with abused by her, you can't do that. Period. She won't change without more help than you can give her. It sucks, but that's the way it is. Be her friend, be her whatever but don't be her lover. Give her as much love as you can, but don't love her physically. She'll just hurt you more, this could just be the start of what she'll do to you.|`|fcY0c8NJaa	That's really really strange, ive never heard of anything like this before. Try sitting your gf down again and tell her that you love her as a person but you can not take her sexual behaviour. Explain to her that it's not sexy, it's not hot, instead it's scary and doesn't mae you feel good. Tell her that she needs to accept her behavir and change it. Make sure she knows that you are really serious about this. If she doesn't stop this behaviour i would probably consider leaving... I mean that stuffs really crazy i feel sorry for you.|`|e1F55L7aaa	i am laughing so hard i think i might die!!!!!! sorry..anyway maybe you should do it to her and see how she likes it? but then again she probably would. and if you don't like it then get rid of her because a relationship has to be good outside AND inside the bedroom....|`|64tEOMOZaa	Wow o.o either say you don't want sex anymore for you don't enjoy it. Or just say u want soft sweet sex, saying i love u a lot and cuddling then moving into the bed.|`|0mcvCOfyaa	I think that you should just not have sex unless she admits to quit, or just not have sex at all. but it's really your choice.<br>  Wish you the best of luck! ?|`|RGCb2N2saa	WTF? If your serious this is the weirdest sh*t i have ever heard, i dont want anything to do with you or your crazy GF!|`|RFl5bfw9aa	be for real|`|AgPj9WH0aa	I will give you the answer I give to other question of this sort WTF?|`|E9OqvqVwaa	Get the hell out of there, shes a maniac whose into humiliation, especially to you.|`|Qky6LIpBaa	this is by far the strangest question ive seen on yahoo!!<br>  if she denies it again, show her the burn marks or bite marks or whatever.|`|ToZRfGOSaa	she sounds like she has a split personality.<br>  bipolar maybe?<br>  get out, she might turn into a psycho|`|utoh3dAJaa	Sounds like a party.<br>  And if theropy doesn't work, try therapy.|`|SVuHsUcfaa	run for your life!

She sounds a little dangerous..and like a weirdo..Maybe you two should stop having sex for a while..|`|LClV32Vvaa	This is VERY strange behaviour, and you need to be careful, what will she do next? Don't let her do this to you, maybe she has some issues that she needs to deal with, why don't you not have sex with her and get to know her a little better and see what is going on in her life that causes this kind of behaviour. You may also try calling Dr.Laura to get a little insight on what would cause her to do things like that.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	shes messed up and you do not need this mess shes really creeped out and therefore its time to move on and leae her be. you can find true love else where with better treatment also.|`|qoGov6Ewaa	sounds like a ricky martin music video.|`|7zMMXmfWaa	man that's ****** weird.<br>  you already tried therapy?<br>  check that ***** into the psych ward.
iP863XM6aa	first of, soaps are just tv. reality is way different and normally, in those cases, it ends up in court to fight off who gets what.<br>  2nd, when a man and woman get married, it doesnt matter who owned what anymore, things are shared and will be forever.<br>  3rd, i highly doubt that the guys earn all of the money thats coming in because lets face it, this isnt like the old days. Most women work just as much as men.<br>  4th, the women may control the money in alot of households for the simple fact that sometimes, men have a way to want to buy all the new electronic toys that come out, and they are not cheap! Not all women control the money, in alot of cases, they both do.. its called good communication and aggreing on things together!<br>  5th, " I mean it is only right for a man to control the husband's and wife", im not sure what you mean by this, but god i hope you are not suggesting that the man controls the wife? life doesnt work that way anymore sweety, and if thats your state of mind, you're in for a big surprise. No one controls anyone (at least they shouldnt). It should be equal between partners in the marriage, never one controling the other.<br>  <br>  Hope ive answered reasonably :p|`|QIMBpEhwaa	lol what? there's PLENTY of women that make more money than their husbands do. and besides, it probably depends on the situation. if the female is better at managing the money and house than the husband, then the obvious answer is to let the wife manage it. <br>  <br>  you sir, are living in the WRONG time period. and you say you're not "sexist" but from what i read, you sure do sound like one. <br>  <br>  random fact: in japan the wives handle and manage the money.|`|AA12196449	Allow me to let you in on a secret. If you make more dough them them,  they pay you in the divorce. So be creative and hide your income, or at least a healthy portion of it. Think of this way, if it all goes crashing down, you not only have some cash stashed away to buy a tiny island but ur missus has to pay you as well. Don't fight the system, let the system work for you.|`|AA11363680	You are sexist, and you're also stupid if you're basing your life view on soaps.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|WhsAV5hhaa	A womans place is in the kitchen.|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	You are sexist|`|YWdNTZU3aa	she should not control anything that belongs to you|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	So, is it fair for you men to call us sluts when we cheat? When you guys are doing it yourselves?|`|a82df4035357599e503c2c87ac02d52eaa	traditionally men make money and women spend it.  There is a good reason for this.  It goes right back to hunter gatherer societies where the men would hunt for meat and the women would gather plants and together they would have a good meal.  These days we don't do much hunting or gathering, but getting a job and making money requires a very similar attitude and behaviour to hunting.  In the same way shopping requires a similar attitude and behaviour to gathering.<br>  <br>  So women enjoy shopping, and they put a lot of thought into it, and are good at shopping wisely and using the money in the best possible way. Have you ever noticed how most men hate shopping?  I certainly do.  I am very happy that i don't have to do it.<br>  <br>  In the same way men get a lot more satisfaction out of having a good job, working hard and coming home and relaxing.  Women just don't get it.  They stress themselves out trying to keep up with the work, and then when they come home they can't stop.  They don't know how to work hard, and they don't know how to relax.<br>  <br>  I personally really like the system where the man makes the money and gives it all to the woman to spend it.<br>  <br>  Of course when it comes to divorce and what to do with the house and money when you split up - that is a much more difficult question.  I don't know the answer to that.<br>  <br>  This also is why the woman moves to where the man lives, and not the man moving to the woman's place because he needs to keep his good job, and if he gets a better one she needs to follow him.<br>  <br>  There is also a tradition that you might have come across that the man makes the big decisions and the woman the little ones.  So for example she can decide how they are spending all the money this week, but if they are going to get a loan to buy a house he decides how much they can afford.<br>  <br>  Generally i think there is some wisdom in the traditional set up.|`|7yrdcqY1aa	well don't base info off os soaps lol but in today's world equality of men and wemen is more and more common. some women control both and some men control both it depends on the individuals and the relationship.|`|jVIbzqYkaa	If you have kids it's different.<br>  Then the wife and kids SHOULD get the house.<br>  And if they are married you don't think of it as <br>  My house <br>  or<br>  My money<br>  you think of it as<br>  Our house <br>  and <br>  Our money
uDuwc7Yoaa	it's not likely that he will just want to be friends. His hopes are up again since you 2 went out, even though it wasn't a date-date, so i think you might have to let him go asap rather than keep his hopes up. I'm not sayin it's your fault, cuz it's not, it's just human nature. But this is something YOU can do for him so he can go ahead and move on.|`|uDdTgXu5aa	You have put a man in the "friend zone".<br>  <br>  He will hate you for this.<br>  <br>  Every night he will go home and cry into his pillow, wondering what he did wrong.<br>  <br>  You should at least lead him on so he doesn't give up on life and "off" himself.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Don|`|jnqc2BZGaa	yeah...but it can be a hard thing to do.<br>  eventually you might crack and give up and bee more than friends.<br>  but go for it<br>  :) it might actually strengthen u guys relationship.|`|AA11570236	Ya but it can be tough.

AA11899313	The scientific study of kissing is called ''Philematology''.<br>  <br>  Anthropologists have not reached a consensus as to whether kissing is a learned or an instinctive behavior. It may be related to grooming behavior also seen between other animals, or arising as a result of mothers premasticating food for their children.<br>  <br>  Kissing allows prospective mates to smell and taste each other's pheromones for biological compatibility. Women are subconsciously more attracted to men whose major histocompatibility complex portion of their genome is different from their own, leading to offspring with resistance to a greater number of diseases due to heterosis, and thus having a better chance of survival.<br>  <br>  Non-human primates also exhibit kissing behavior. Dogs, cats, birds and other animals display licking and grooming behavior among themselves, but also towards humans or other species. This is sometimes interpreted by observers as a type of kissing.<br>  <br>  The physiology of kissing<br>  Kissing is a complex behavior that requires significant muscular coordination; a total of thirty-four facial muscles and 112 postural muscles are used during a kiss. <br>  <br>  The most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips and informally known as the kissing muscle.[citation needed] In the case of the French kiss, the tongue is also an important part. Lips have many nerve endings so they are sensitive to touch and bite.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  Disease transmission<br>  Diseases which may be transmitted through kissing include mononucleosis and herpes, when the infectious virus is present in saliva. Research indicates that contraction of HIV via kissing is extremely unlikely, although a woman has been infected with HIV by kissing in 1997; both the woman and infected man had gum disease (so transmission was through the man's blood, not saliva).[8]<br>  <br>  In modern Western culture, kissing is most commonly an expression of affection.[9] Between people of close acquaintance, a reciprocal kiss often is offered as a greeting or farewell.[10] This kind of kiss is typically made by brief contact of puckered lips to the skin of the cheek or no contact at all, and merely performed in the air near the cheek with the cheeks touching.  People may kiss children on the forehead to comfort them or the cheek to show affection, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  As an expression of romantic affection or sexual desire in Western culture, kissing involves two people pressing their lips together with an intensity of sexual feeling. A couple may open their mouths, suck on each other's lips or move their tongues into each others' mouths (see French kiss).<br>  <br>  In Eastern European countries and Slavic cultures until recent times, kissing between two men on the lips as a greeting or a farewell was not uncommon and not considered sexual.[citation needed] Symbolic kissing is frequent in Western cultures. A kiss can be "blown" to another by kissing the fingertips and then blowing the fingertips, pointing them in the direction of the recipient. This is used to convey affection, usually when parting or when the partners are physically distant but can view each other. Blown kisses are also used when a person wishes to convey affection to a large crowd or audience. In written correspondence a kiss has been represented by the letter 'X' since at least 1763.  A stage or screen kiss may be performed by actually kissing, or faked by using the thumbs as a barrier for the lips and turning so the audience is unable to fully see the act.<br>  <br>  In some Western cultures it is considered good luck to kiss someone on Christmas or on New Year's Eve.|`|K2VjDCb0aa	practice makes perfect.... just go out there and kiss some guys, experience will help <br>  however- seriously 13 isnt old enough to be worrying about whether you have kissed a guy or not|`|q2H9jgDSaa	you won't miss. it really does just come naturally. i can't really explain how to kiss someone on the lips, but yah you really shouldn't miss.|`|leU4QY9iaa	Seriously it comes naturally!

Anyways... you need to talk to the girl you like, ask her yourself if she has a boyfriend.  Dont worry about her friend. more importantly, dont ever get a 3rd party involved when you are trying to ask someone out. it usually doesnt work out well.|`|vyNMVf5Paa	One possibility is that her friend likes YOU aswell, she might be trying to detour your feelings and might be jealous. On the other hand, ask a few people about the girl who told you. Is she known for lying or spreading rumours?|`|iZ3rCuQEaa	she probably is cause if she lied about the gurl havin a bf and she act like she dont that means her friend likes u u should as the gurl u wanted to ask out to go out w/ u.|`|tvvnCgnJaa	I'd put money on her friend  being jealous and that she likes you herself!

kn3FbivKaa	I feel for you, I've been married for 13 years and it's becomin a big problem in my life too. Your like me, you need the closeness, the compation, the love. I have no answer for you except to keep trying. If you love him, don't give up|`|874EAxkfaa	stop the drama! ignore him sexually for awhile, keep a good happy relationship going. he will come sniffing for some, because men are horny dogs that want what they can't get.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Ok, so nothing has changed! So what else is new? If you really think about it, we all think that we are close to perfect. It is always the other party that needs to change. But this is not the way things happen. For in most instances the other party thinks the way they think is just fine.<br>  <br>  So what needs to happen is that both of you explain what kind of relationship you want. And, I shouldn't have to warn you, that results in conflict. And, if you are smart enough and realize that conflict can destroy a marriage, you will hopefully decide that you might have to make some adjustment. Give in here or there and insist that your partner gives in on some of his points. You might even have to fight it out over some of your differences. But in the end, to keep the marriage going, you will have to compromise. That's the way things work. Check out my source for more into.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	You would have seen all this before you got married. Marriage doesn't make the bad parts of a relationship better it just makes it legal. I think you are stuck with what you got, this is who he is. All the nagging and griping in the world aren't going to change him. I think he may get worse on the sex issue as he gets older. This is just an outsider's opinion.|`|AA11596133	You spend FAR too much time "analyzing" your relationship, and not enough time WORKING on it. <br>  <br>  It could be, that HE is perfectly content with the way things are, and does not WANT to change anything.  Have you actually ASKED him that?  Yes, you have TOLD him how YOU feel, but have you ASKED him to tell you how HE feels?<br>  <br>  Sorry to say, but you two are still just getting to know each other.  Two years is NOT enough TIME to really tell if things will work or not - in fact, the first few years are always the hardest. <br>  <br>  As far as the counseling, if he will not go, then YOU go.  You could learn quite a bit from looking at the whole thing from a neutral viewpoint - and by doing so, it may spark an interest from him - it is worth a try!|`|fYv0dtUFaa	If he has always been unromantic and not that into sex what made you think marrying him would make it better?  You knew how he was, if this is such a problem for you then you shouldn't have married him in the first place.|`|sCCjAKllaa	I don't see how marriage can make things like that diminish. If anything, affection should increase with that. I think you need to talk to him even more then what you did, since it didn't help anything.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	No problem,<br>  <br>  You need to take your NEED out of the equation.<br>  <br>  You see, he can sense that you NEED physical attention. But this has all the appeal of fixing a leaky faucet. It also carries the double insult of feeling that he's not "doing his manly job" on you well enough to be satisfied. <br>  <br>  If you leave your NEED at the door, and have fun physically with him out of sheer joy and interest in HIM, he'll feel more inclined to meet your physical needs.<br>  <br>  Remember, a guy is an engine that uses EGO as gasoline. The more you threaten his ego; his source of pride; his confidence in him manhood; his importance in the marriage, the less you're going to get out of him.<br>  <br>  Also, I notice all your solutions are VERBALLY based: " have talked to him, discussed things, gave him time, helped him, gave hints about stuff, and etc"<br>  <br>  Guys do not respond well to VERBAL stimulus. Rather, try NON-VERBAL stimulus. Try touching him everyday. Touch his shoulders, his back, give hugs, give kisses, smile at him, wear attractive clothes, even on Sunday afternoons. <br>  <br>  Try feeding him. Good food and good sex go hand in hand. <br>  <br>  Whatever the case, he doesn't need another long, pointless, drawn out conversation about this. Men need emotional support from their wives much more than they need advice.<br>  <br>  So try non-verbal support. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jHWgdJMraa	If it is just about sex, let it go, having sex twice a week should be ok, it sounds like a good compromise if he is not that into sex, also he may need to see a medical doctor, maybe somethings wrong, but if he is as young as you said I doubt he would be comfortable talking about it to anyone, hang in there and just be glad you have someone able to provide and share life with.

9f113225dd79c6e22cfb5fe6ea9b4fceaa	I was bisexual at 13, too.  Or so I thought.  I may still be and I am 39 with 2 kids and married (to a man) for 13 years now.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, who cares?  Why does everyone have to be labeled to be this or that?  Why can't we all just be who we are if it isn't breaking any laws or hurting someone?<br>  <br>  Are you worried that you could be bisexual?  Do you think that would be bad?  Why do you need to know "what to do"?  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.<br>  <br>  One thing I do know, is I think 13 is too young for sexual experiences.  However, if you do decide to has a sexual experience with this girl, make sure you do so knowing it could damage your friendship........or it could make it stronger.  Either way, don't stress so much or feel obligated to categorize yourself............regardless of what 99% of the hypocritess on this planet think, there is no need to label yourself one way or the other.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	well your 13, don't listen to anyone who says your too young and blah blah blah. all you can do is wait, grow up a bit more and see how you feel then. it could be just that you feel confused about your sexuality and saying ur bisexual is the easiest option. just wait and let time tell you, you will find out for sure one day becuase you will just know, no one else can tell you whether ur gay or bisexual or straight, it's something that is in you and only you can tell.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	invite one of your girlfriends over and take a shower together. if it turns you on. them you're bi, if not then.........
cdQryr7paa	Good lord man, are you running a hotel?<br>  It's nice that you are willing to help out friends and family that need a place to stay for a while, but there has to be limits.<br>  Make sure your wife knows how you feel.<br>  I can understand letting someone stay with you for a while, but they need to be looking for other arrangements at the same time.<br>  Who is offering all these people a place to live?<br>  I can see your wife offering her sister.<br>  But what about the others?<br>  It is a tough economy, and it's good to help out, but you have to draw the line somewhere.<br>  Her parents can't take in her sister for a while?<br>  I know your trying to be a nice guy, but there is a difference between being nice and being a doormat.<br>  Set some limits, lay down some guidelines.<br>  Good luck.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	so I take it you say "no" on the polygamy question.<br>  <br>  You better figure out how to discuss this with her and fast.<br>  <br>  I have no problem helping out family and friends as long as you are clear from the get go on what their obligations and responsibilities are while they are staying with you.  They will not be guests, they will be roommates. You need to be specific about what is expected of them while they stay (chores, bills, rent, etc) and tell them exactly how long they can stay.  Also make time for you and your wife to be alone to preserve as much of your privacy as you can.<br>  <br>  If this is just intolerable to you then you need to speak up to your wife right away and make it clear to her that you married her, not her sister and her friend, and you want to experience life with her as a newlywed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|6q76Rgiqaa	wow, i would say no but if they are reaaaaally in need like as if you are their only option to find a shelter, then maybe, See if they have any other places to stay first.  With all those people under one house, things might get complicated and you will definitely have no privacy.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	GOOD LUCK! THIS WILL DRIVE YOU NUT! AND THIS IS GOING TO ADD ALOT OF STRESS ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP ALSO! FYI: STAY GONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!|`|dVlLahozaa	tell your wife that you didn't get married to live with so much people. Get tough with it and tell her this now because the whole situation will just put a lot of strain in your marriage.|`|SHARt1k3aa	That is going to be extremely hard!  You have every right to have these concerns.  But, more importantly, did your wife discuss these arrangements with you prior to committing to them?  I mean, I could understand one friend in need, but my god, sounds like she opened up a group home for unwed moms.  You are going to have a tough time buddy, I hate to say it.  Being alone with your wife is nice and now all those people and kids?  Oh god.  I don't even know what to say.  If it's temporary I recommend getting a calendar and just marking off the days (kinda like they do in jail in the movies LOL).  If you enjoy cooking, then cook... don't consider what they like or don't like, just cook, if it isn't to their liking, then they don't eat.  I have been through this.  I was living with my husband and son.. then his daughter came with her baby, then son came with his daughter and then his wife came with their 2 year old.  So... I had basically three families in one home, it's really hard, not easy, specially with the little kids.  It takes some getting use to.  Your only hope is trying to find these friends other places, otherwise it's going to eat at you and cause problems between you and your wife.  You're going to have complaints, she is going to be on their side and say you are mean, then all the fights will start.  Sorry, but it's true.
7NwfwWAbaa	oh wow, I've had the same problem.<br>  Well first tell her parents, and tell them your really concerned about her and that you're scaried she's going to do something.<br>  After that you need to explain to your friend that she's making you depressed, but tell her you care about her a lot.<br>  when she goes home tell her parents again that you're really worried and that she needs help before it's to late.<br>  My friend was the same way as your friend, another friend and I called her parents (my mom called her parents) and my friend finally got help. we're still friends, and shes not depressing all the time, only when somethings bothering her.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, I really do.<br>  good luck, I'll be praying for you and your friend for good luck.|`|lWolp5Csaa	You should tell her that i don`t want to be friends when you say that. it makes me feel uncomtorable or whatever you feel. <br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn`t say this to her because that would probably really make her kill herself. also if your THAT worried about her than you should tell your school counsler or get a mentor or something. something at least to help her.|`|bYo5UTa9aa	oh gosh... good luck with that.|`|cggkcAC5aa	easy, look her in the eyes and say i dont want to be friends. or tell her why and then say i dont want to be friends, let her talk to you about it and maybe yall can come up with a solution
