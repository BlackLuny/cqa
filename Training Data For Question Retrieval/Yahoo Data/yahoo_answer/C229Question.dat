20090128152645AAcayBs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Cry it out meathod..?	My son is ONE in 12 days time.    Ever since my son was born, i've fed him in my arms to sleep at night, so i've been his soother.    Well about 8 weeks ago he started to get into the habit of wanting me to soothe him about 4-6 times a night, and at around 3am every night he would come into my bed to sleep until 7.30am.    Well the last 4 nights hes been very bad at going to sleep, its getting a lot worse as even when i try and settle him in my arms he kicks and screams.. then i noticed when i put him in the cot he would go to sleep (which has happened twice in the last 2 nights) but tonight he wasn't having none of it. He wouldn't sleep in my arms, in the cot nothing, so i felt its time to try the CIO method.    Well im still sat here, listening to him cry, after 2 hours.    Everyone are telling me to persevere, i go in every now and again and put his soother (dummy) back in and tuck him in.    I feel so terrible doing this.    Is he too young?    Was it really called for?   Am i damaging him emotionally in anyway.   I feel terrible. :(

20090128153041AAJFjPu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mommies, is this bad?	My baby is a month old. I will hold her through out the day when she is crying and a little bit when she is calm, but I will also sit her in her swing, and she is calm there. I feel bad for not holding her all day or more but its like I have things to do or just want to rest. Am I being selfish? I always am there for her when she cries, but theres just times where I want to chill.    I guess I feel bad because it was like before I had my baby I could carry them all day long, but now that its my baby its not as fun. Do I need to change my attitude?

Please, someone, explain this to me.  It's not a judgemental call-my own teenager is on birth control because get this--she doesn't want to get pregnant when she's a teenager.

PLZ just had a baby too?   hi i already made a post earlier. i had sex the day of ovulation with hubby which i forgot that it was that day stupid me and the condom slipped off inside me. anyway we think we got it out without any sperm leaking in me. i know tmi sorry. anyway plan b was out of the question. my temperature during ovulation for 4 days was 98,3-98.6 than after ovulation it went down the base line and has been 97.3-97.8 not higher than that. and i kno i take it right before i even get out of bed i know the routine. anyway becauase my period is sometimes 21 days and sometimes 24 days and sometimes 28 days i dunno if im pregnant or not.but according to what i read once the bbt drops to 97 and stays in that area that means there is no pregnancy. i just took a pregnancy test and it said negative. but like i said i have a period between 21-28 days so i dunno if im ok or not.plz no silly answers. im verry worried i just had a baby 3 months ago and im not ready to go through all of that again. thnks also baby dust to all the women ttc good luck!!!

20090128153226AAP5EuQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Question about providing home child care....?	After being laid off from work my wife is thinking of providing an in home day care service to at least one, possibly two children in our home. We already have an 18mo son but to our understanding any more than 6 children requires a license. So at most she will have 3 children, 2 of them at $150/week which works out roughly abt $1200/month. So my question is since there is no license required for ahving less thn 6 children are there any other requirements she must meet? Shes already CPR and First Aid qualified, and has 13 years experience in daycare. Would this be considered a business? Would we need to file for a tax number? I see dozens of ads on Craigslist providing daycare as little as $80 a week, which kinda throws up a red flag in my opinion. Do all these people who babysit have licenses?!? Any help and/or direction deeply appreciated!

My son has normally been a pretty good sleeper, but he woke up last night crying and didn't want me to leave.  I patted his back and stayed until he fell back to sleep.  Today for his second nap, we woke, but didn't sit up.  He was crying as if he were awake.  I tried not to pick him up in case he would go back, but it was not helping.  It took 30 mins of rocking and holding him until he "snapped" out of it.        Is this the beginings of separation anxiety?  Did he have a bad dream?  It just seems strange.  Any thoughts?

20090128154714AA8Kmvt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4 yr old wont eat what I make. ?	My daughter just got over a pretty bad cold where she wasn't eating much. Now she will not eat anything I make. The only thing she will eat is peanut butter sandwiches. My husband and I have been fighting with her to eat and by the time we get her to eat it she gags on it. We have made chicken and rice, lasagna and pea soup. Obviously fighting with her doesn't work. I have tried asking her what she wants to eat and her answer is always "Peanut butter sandwiches". I really would love some advice on what to do. I hate making her go to bed hungry but i don't know what else to do. Giving in and letter her have peanut butter sandwiches doesn't seem like the right option either cause she seems to be in this phase where she thinks she can do whatever she wants so letting her have control in my opinion is a bad idea.       Any thoughts?

The other day, I asked a lady for the time and her daughter who couldn't be more then 9 years old, whipped a cell phone out of her front pocket and told the time to me. It's crazy.      When I was in high school, I remember pagers being the "cool" thing to have, no one had a cell phone, lol. But pagers were like $30. Some of these kids have $200 cell phones.       Am I the only one that thinks it is ridiculous??  And the funny thing is, is that kids and sometimes the parents think that a cell phone is a neccesity.

I'm 16, and this is what I eat now, but I'd really like to change it.      Breakfast: bowl of soup   Lunch: nothing   Snack after school(it differs each day)   Dinner: what my mom makes, or a salad when we go to a restaurant.   Snack before bed      Am I eating enough? My mom is always telling me to not eat, when it seems like I've barely eaten. She also calls me fat. but...      How Can I Change My Eating Pattern? and Am I Eating Enough?

At first I thought maybe she needed a bigger size, but even the bigger size leaks.  She is now 6 months old, and I'm tired of buying diapers that can't hold pee.  Does anyone have the same problem and if you do, have you found a brand of diapers that don't leak?  Thank in advance.
20090128155728AAYlxqr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I get my sister in law to stop comparing our babies?	I had my 3rd baby 6 months ago, and my sister in law had her 1st 3 1/2 months ago.  And it seems like she is in competition with me about our babies.  Everytime I see her she'll ask what new things my baby has done, then she will say "oh yea, well Bri does this, why can't Ella do it when she's older"  I have asked her if she thought it was a contest with who's baby does what first, she got mad, but she keeps doing it, whether its how much they eat, what kind of schedule they are on, how often they cry, if they can sleep thru the night, the last straw was when she told me everytime she goes out everyone tells her how beautiful her baby was and that when she went out with me nobody said anything about my baby, (she left her baby at home).  I understand that she is very proud of her baby, which she has every right to be, and of course I think her baby is cute, but I'm not about to play the "who's baby is better" game with her.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can get her to stop?

20090128155035AARb1gc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 14 and pregnant????	i went out with this guy, peter, for about three years. we broke up about six months ago, but were still having sex. we used condoms each time and they were used correctly, or so i thought. yesterday i found i was pregnant, i took three different pregnancy tests. i have no idea how to tell him. we don't talk anymore and i plan on having an abortion, but i feel like he has the right to know, accounting its his. he's the only guy i have ever had sex with so i know it's his for sure. im just really scared of what will happen. what if he wants to keep it, or if he get's mad at me, or if he wants to get back with me. i dont want any of that, but i know since i made an adult decision i have to act like one.      i sent him a message on myspace saying "peter, i need to talk to you about something.    i don't really want to say it over the computer cause i guess you could say its important, but im not making a big deal out of it and when you find out you shouldn't either. k? good."      and he hasn't read it yet, but im really worried about what he's going to do. and i know he doesn't want to chill with me and i don't want to chill with him either, but i think i should tell him in person, rather than over the computer.            what should i do?   should i just tell him on myspace?   should i text him?   what should i say?

20090128155733AAFGj6z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Big baby question (in more ways than one!) I need an answer ASAP--I have to make a decision by tomorrow!?	I have a big baby boy due on February 12.  They gave me an ultrasound to check him out and have estimated that when he is born, he will be around 8 1/2.    I went to my Dr. appointment today and the doctor said that, though the ultrasound said that he was 7 lbs 1 oz last week, he felt like a big baby.  My other doctor said that too and talked about inducing.  This doctor checked me out and said that my cervix has done nothing and the baby is still up high.  He said that I have three choices:  1)  Let it go and see what happens--the risk being that he could get even bigger 2)  induce next week at 39 weeks or anytime thereafter 3) c-section.       He mentioned that they don't typically like to induce 1st time moms because they don't know the pelvic capacity and how they will handle labor but he also said that inducing at 39 weeks would be his recommendation and that if my body didn't respond to the induction, they would move quickly to c-section.  What are your thoughts on all of this.  I don't really like the idea of being induced because I don't like drugs and I have heard that induced labor is harder on both mom and baby.  Waiting concerns me because he is already big and I wonder if I will be able to do it.  He is likely all shoulders like his dad!  C-section concerns me because it is surgery but if the choice is that or an episiotomy plus a really hard labor, it doesn't sound so bad.  Please give me your input--I'm new to all this and don't know what to do.  I thought i was so ready to be  done with this pregnancy thing but now that he says next week, I kinda want to puke!!
20090128160545AAz9NXw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My daughter is always lying? ?	She lies mostly about school work. Like for example when she is supposed to finish a book, she sais she has, and then when I ask her to tell me about it she doesn't know anything about it. It is really frustrating and breaks my heart everytime. And even though I call her out on her lies, she just keeps  pretending that she's telling the truth.       I have told her countless times that it is ok to the truth and i will not get mad but she still keeps it up.       Also lately she has been disobeying orders. For example when i asked her not to go outised and then I found her sneaking out of her window.       the worst part is that she doesn't even care! Iv cried so many times in front of her and she has such a nonchalant attitude.       What am I to do?          Would a therapist help?

Second question...if you have a NORMAL 28 day cycle is it a fact you will ovulate on the 14th day. is it possible to ovulate late???      I ask this because there is a big difference in my lmp and ultrasound dating. They are not even close. So im trying to figure out if I might have a "smaller baby" or if I ovulated late. I have asked my doctor and he doesnt seem to quite have the correct info for me. He beliefs are quite different....So just trying to get other peoples opinion...      **Oh and my due date is June 14th 09   My first ultrasound was when I was only 5 weeks. Had another when I was 6 weeks. Andother at 10 weeks. And this was at my docs office and the hosiptal. So it wasnt by 1 person or 1 machine      Thanks!

20090128162011AAgLnvN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How do you deal with the waiting period till you can test?	While you are waiting for time to pass for testing do you assume that you are pregnant and watch what you eat and ensure you don't do anything strenuous?  Or do you carry on with life as normal.      Its so hard to know what to do.  I am not sure if I am overreacting also its our first time at TTC.

Depending on the age of the child (maybe say under 16 even with the parent) I would consider that abusive on the part of the parent. Or at best ignorant. Great. I mean we really need more "parents" forsaking their parenting responsibilities in order to be a "buddy" or worse - to meet their own selfish needs.

Ive never really been someone who "spots" so it caught my attention..it lasted for like 2 days or so and it was over.. its been about a month since then and i never really got a "real" period.

Ive been feeling more tired lately just kind of BLAH i could sleep all day if i let myself....my stomach has felt upset like right after i eat im just like ughh! and ive been getting headaches but very mild ones.o0o and i feel like i live in the restroom..i have to pee like all the time...and my emotions have been all over the place...Ive never been pregnant or thought i was soo i dnt even know what it feels like or things to look for so maybe i really am just tired or getting sick lol Ive taken a home test a couple days ago but it came out neg.. I took another one and it was very faint +.. i took one last night and it was - and again this morning and it as -.... soo im assuming that if it was gunna be positive it would have shown up already with all those test right??      this really bummed me out.. i thought with the + it was right but now all the - makes me think otherwise

I got a cheap one (Walgreens One-Step HPT) and I got the First Response Early Result HPT. I took the Walgreens test and it turned out negative. I figured it would probably be negative due to the fact that my urine could be diluted from having sweet tea tonight.   My fiance told me to take the First Response HPT. I will later.      I started my period on 12/25/08 and was not due for 1/22/08. My breasts have been sore non-stop, little bit of cramping, almost a week late, and bloating.      Maybe the cheap HPT wasn't a good one? Will first response be better? Does anyone have any advice for me?

20090128163444AAq3QPK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Late period, two negative preg tests.. pregnant?	I had unprotected sex in December on the 17th. I got my period for that month on the 22nd and it was normal and it lasted six days. I took a pregnancy test at the doctor's on January 16th to make sure I wasn't pregnant and it was negative. I figured my period would come around the 22nd-24th of this month, but it didn't. I took another pregnancy test on the 25th and it came out negative, too. I'm kind of young, so it just might be my period being irregular, or from the recent exercising I've done, but I'm not sure. I've been having some cramps and bloating, but I've been getting some lotion-y discharge. At other times, I'm really dry. I don't know what's going on..      PS. rude people, please stfu and don't give me any rude comments.

My daughter is 14 months old and when we call my husband at night I'd like him to feel like she misses him. Usually when we go to my mom's for the weekend she is so busy she probably doesn't even realize he is gone... and its not that I want her to cry and feel pain that he isn't there... I just want him to feel needed/loved by her. He always seems so sad when we are away a few days.      (And yes, he knows he can come, but he doesn't like my parents much, nor does he like the long ride to get there, just to come home 2 days later)

How would little girl feel when she knows that her father fled to his native country, to avoid paying child support?  She was told that her father wants to visit her in the USA.      He is afraid that he will trigger a child support order, which could cost him, his US Passport and go to jail.  He has a passport of his native country.  He fled the country before paternity could legally be established; he can get away with not paying child support?  They could not take away his US passport for not paying child support along as he does not enter US soil before her 19 birthday.    This will make him out of reach of a US from officially serve him with legal papers for paternity.  If he enters US soil before she turns 18, he could be order to pay up to 17 years of back child support.      He is following his lawyers’ advice by doing so.

She has some trouble with geometry and certain types of math. Her boyfriend has some anxiety (he also is very meticulous and clean), and he has some learning issues, despite being very smart. (He goes to a special school for kids w/ learning issues). Neither of them are athletic at all, and they cannot really run. Neither of them have many friends and neither are particuarly "popular." My sister can look like one of the "hott girls" when she straightens her hair, puts on makeup and nice clothes, but her bf is totally a geek. My father has ADD and OCD, my granmother has anxiety/OCD, my great-grandmother had epilepsy. On my mother's side, my aunt has learning disablities and epilepsy. One of my cousins on my mother's side of the family had tics (which she outgrew). My sister's boyfriend's cousin has some kind of Aspergers or something. If they have kids in the future, will they have similar issues to their parents? Will they  have tics and learning problems?

20090128164518AAQbcVh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My mom gets mad that I'm going out with a friend she doesn't like...?	I asked her if I could go to the movies this weekend with my friend and she said yes. Then she heard me on the phone mentioning that my other friend would be able to come as well, and she started going on angrily "oh SHE's going too? maybe I'll change my mind, maybe you won't be going at all"... o_o      There's no reason for her to not like my friend. When she met her, my friend was very nice and polite to her, and came off very sweet. My mom told me she just doesn't like her, she doesn't get a good vibe from her. And my dad agrees with her because he says my mom "has a good judge of character". But she has no reason to not like my friend. The only possible reason I can think of is that she can tell my friend is gay, but if she did know that, she would tell my aunt (her best friend), who I know for a fact would tell me. But my aunt told me my mom doesn't know my friend is gay.       Talking with her doesn't seem to work, as the only "reason" she can give me is that "something about her rubs her the wrong way", and she just doesn't like her, and doesn't like me going out with her. Even if I can't get a real answer from my mom, how can I deal with her when it comes to me going out with my friend? I'm 19 btw

I asked the pharmacist at work and he suggested taking Fish Oil.  I did that for a couple months and still no baby.  I've tried laying with my hips elevated for 15-20 mins after and still no baby.  I have done a lot of research and pretty much anything i have seen worth trying we have tried.  We are desperate.  Please if you have any suggestions please help us
20090128164309AA2kRw2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Teacher sent my daughter down to the office?	My thirteen-year-old daughter got sent down to the office by her supply teacher today – she says it was because she didn’t want to play ball in gym and wanted to study some more for her math test instead. She says the supply teacher was rude to her and started yelling and saying, “Do you think you’re special?” and getting really upset (which I do believe since she and my son have had many difficulties with this particular supply teacher – my son, who has special needs, gets sent down to the office every single time this teacher subs for his class, and from what I’ve seen and heard, this supply teacher has anger issues and should not be a teacher). And my daughter told this supply teacher she didn’t like the way he was talking to her, and he said, “Are you deaf? I told you to play!” She shrugged and went back to her work and he sent her down to the office.      My daughter talked to the principal about this, and as my daughter is a good student and rarely gets into trouble, the principal believed her and told her she’d talk to this supply teacher and it isn’t right for him to talk to her that way and said that my daughter could stay in the vice-principal’s office and do her math if she wanted, which my daughter did. But what should I do about this? Should I punish my daughter for being rude to a teacher, even if it was just a little? What should I do, if anything, about this supply teacher?

20090128165301AAzgXSP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	3 weeks after weaning? stretched out breasts? (10 POINTS!)?	So i breastfed my son for exactly 2 years and 1 week.      During most of this time he favored the right side and as a result i noticed it was a lot bigger than the left so i started only feeding him on the left and my right got engorged. This was about three months ago. I let the engorgement ease down and when both my breasts looked symmetrical i started feeding him equally from both sides from october to January the 10th.      Anyway it has been 3 weeks since i completely stopped feeding him and io noticed that my left breast the skin in a lot more firm than my right breast. Both breasts look very empty and sagging although i can still express some milk when i press.      My question is will it get better at all from here or is this the way it will be forever? How long does it take for breasts to return their state while not breastfeeding? I'm 22 and i was a D before i got pregnant and went up to a DD while breastfeeding.      I heard that fat cells restore it self in the breasts over time is this true?

My 13-year old daughter went out to the movies a few nights ago with her boyfriend and some friends, and it was planned that I pick her up at the movies at 10:30.   Well, I showed up at the movies at 10:40 and I couldn't find her. I started to grow worried, so I called her cell phone.   One of her friends picked it up and these were his exact words:   "Leave us alone, you psycho *****!"   Around 11:00 I found them walking toward the theatre from the mall   about a half-mile away.   Her face dropped when she saw me and I didn't say anything besides,   "Get in the car, Mallory."   She kissed her boyfriend goodnight and slammed the door.   When I took her home, she told me that it wasn't her idea to go to the mall, but she was dragged into it. I don't believe in spankings/whoopings, so don't suggest that. What should I do?
20090128165337AADf7XE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Late period and two negative pregnancy tests.. pregnant or not?	I had unprotected sex in December on the 17th. I got my period for that month on the 22nd and it was normal and it lasted six days. I took a pregnancy test at the doctor's on January 16th to make sure I wasn't pregnant and it was negative. I figured my period would come around the 22nd-24th of this month, but it didn't. I took another pregnancy test on the 25th and it came out negative, too. I'm kind of young, so it just might be my period being irregular, or from the recent exercising I've done, but I'm not sure. I've been having some cramps and bloating, but I've been getting some lotion-y discharge. At other times, I'm really dry. I don't know what's going on..

Well here are the kids that are involved names       Kyle- cute but a major pot head   Lindsey- b*tch of the school also sort of a pot head   Natasha- I have been best friends with her since the beginning of the year but now im doubting that.      So heres what happened i get to school like I usually do. I'm sitting down just finishing some home work. Natasha walks in like she usually does Kyle is sitting at a table and is like 'don't talk about yesterday' In this jokey voice. Immediately i knew she got high with him.       She comes and is like i have to talk to you she tells me she got high with Kyle and Farleigh. So i just go okay whatever. I could have got high with Kyle too yesterday except i don't do drugs ( he asked me if i wanted to.) Well there isn't much i could say but whatever.       So we go back up and here comes Lindsey all smiles and goes up to Natasha they automatically walk off. I'm left there standing think wtf.       So it's now lunch time surprisingly Natasha goes to lunch with me. Were walking and she tells me that the only reason her and Lindsey are now friends is because the school had an art show last night and Lindsey was there so was Natasha. ( i didn't go.)       Obviously it being Natasha's first time she was high was laughing uncontrollably and Lindsey noticed they started talking. And now they are going to get high Friday after school together and well i feel sort of left out. I don't want to get high because my mom would find out.       I am also jealous because Mitchell who is good friends with Lindsey will be going with them, and i like him. Ughh i just feel so i don't know i guess depressed and thinking i should have gotten high and go to the art show then i could have all of that :(... What do i do i mean i think i am losing a friend to weed.      Oh and Natasha also thinks she is so cool for buying a lighter and doing weed. I just feel like loser. I know it's long but please please answer.

He will be 3 in March and just got his first pair of glasses today.  So far he seems to like them ok.  But they need to be worn daily at all times he is awake.  I was thinking a sticker chart would help.  For every day he wears his glasses all day, he gets a sticker and when he wears them all week then we will do something special.    Does that sound like a good idea?  Do you think it's ok to do that?

20090128173919AAywsIj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is Paris Hilton such a horrible role model?	I read a lot of comments on here about how little girls have such horrible role models in the media these days. I want to know, why does EVERYONE list Paris Hilton??    I'm assuming it's because of the various crotch shots, partying, and sex tape. But their were nude photos of Vanessa Hudgens online too, but parents seem to have no problem taking their children to see High School Musical.. so I don't get it?    Maybe Paris has had a few blunders in her day, but she's a very successful business woman with her clothing and perfume line, and is involved with some great charities. I don't think she's a bad girl. I'm more concerned with all the skanks on Rock of Love or Charm School... but anyway.    I wonder if Paris's name will ever be cleared? I'm sure there are plenty of moms out there who have made a sex tape or forgotten to wear panties at some point in their youth... does that mean they are bad role models for their kids? Unfortunently for Paris, the cameras catch every single thing she does so her private moments are put into the public eye. If I was snapped by the paparazzi 24\7, I'd probably look like a bad person too- who wouldn't??    I would never tell my kids to "be like this person" or "don't be like this person" because often celebrities are misportrayed. I feel bad for Paris taking all heat as the "bad girl". I think it's sweet how much she cares about animals... thats a good quality that all kids should have!
20090128174651AAPJInv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is "picking and choosing" your battles just a way for parents to be lazy?	It seems like rules and discipline can be fairly cut and dry. If a child is taught that they should not hit people, and they do, they should be disciplined, right? So if one day the parent isn't feeling well or is being lazy and their kid hits another kid (maybe not very hard), should they just let it slide?      When it comes to discipline and YOUR rules, shouldn't you fight every battle? If you don't, you're not being consistent and the kid will pick up on this. Rules will eventually become guidelines and then gradually nothing at all. No?

He also constantly insults his little sister by telling her she's fat and stupid. We've put up with it for years because he was under 18 but he got on my last nerve a week after he turned 18. Our problem - when we kicked him out, another family member took him in. He has turned everyone against us! He refuses to contribute anything to our household. He refuses chores, paying on car insurance or his phone bill. Everyone is telling me that we gave up on him. And yes, he has a father in the house. Should I feel guilty?

This is why paternity could not be legally established.  He diapered to avoid paying child support.  He shows up and says that he wants to see his daughter at least once.        Should she ask for back child support for the last 15 years?   Should she allow him to see her at least once?

20090128181611AA5zyMM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does your house always stay messy?	When my son was really little my house was always clean, now he's 1, so he drags EVERYTHING out all the time... I used to pick his toys up like twice a day, but now every time I pick them up as soon as I turn around it looks like a mini tornado just ran through my house again. I mean I have toys in MY bedroom, the kitchen, his room, the bathroom and the living room... there was even toys in the laundry hamper the other day. So I've just reached a point where I've pretty much given up on picking them up... I just pick them up before someone comes over, and if it's just us here they stay out until I vacuum... am I the only person who has given up on picking up toys and putting them back? My sons 1 so he can't really clean up after himself yet.

20090128174557AADe62E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What type of transport did you find useful with your baby?	We are trying to decide what to buy, maybe experience from actual moms will help.      My husband insists on a stroller.  They seem so big and inconvient to me though.  Do you use a stroller?  How old was your baby when you started using it?  Is it one of those "travel pack" kind where the carseat goes with the stroller?  Or is it one of the smaller types?      I want to use a sling/wrap.  Is this reasonable to expect to use when doing errands (ie grocery shopping?)  What type of sling did you get?  Do you ever use it around the house to keep baby close by while getting work done?      Obviously, we must buy a car seat.  Did any of you purchase an infant car seat and rely on that as your child carrier?  Was it inconvient to take it in and out of your car?  Are you happy with that purchase, or do you wish you had bought a convertable car seat for when the baby got older?      Sorry...lots of questions!  I'm really at a loss as to what to expect and what to buy.  Really appreciate any input.

20090128181726AA5hiNs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Overdosing on Antibiotics...?	My baby's 11 month old. He's been having a high fever for a few days now. Yesterday I took him to the doctor and she gave us the fever, flu, cough meds as well as antibiotics. I think it was augmentin if I'm not mistaken.       Thing is, my baby's caretaker has accidentally given my baby an overdose of the antibiotics. How much is too much and how much is actually an overdose? The doctor's prescription was 1.4ml, three times a day. The caretaker has given the baby about 4ml or something. Should I take the baby back to the doctor?      Thanks.
20090128173935AAD7m1O	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I'm not sure what to think of this - Opinions please?	I have become friendly with a woman at my sons nursery as her son and mine are friends. I had her son at my house today and she stayed for coffee when she came to pick him up. (The boys are 3)      She also brought her younger son with her who is almost 2 and while we were talking her 2yr old came over to her and patted her on the chest, she then proceeded to take out a breast and let him suckle.       I found this a bit uncomfortable, not because I have a problem with breast feeding but because of the age of the child, she also said something that made me think she also still breast feeds her 3yr old (my sons friend).       Is it just me or does anyone else think these kids are way to old for her still to be feeding them?

20090128173046AAFufbG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When's the right time?	I'm in the middle of a dilemma. My husband and I want to try to have a baby soon. He will be coming home from deployment in around a month. However, within the next few months we will be moving to a different duty station.    My debate is whether to wait until after the move, so that I avoid the stress and hassle of moving in my first trimester. This could lead to him being deployed again for the birth, or do we just get down to business and try our best as soon as possible to avoid .  I just know that it's crunch time and we may only have one chance for me to ovulate.    I know that the decision is mine in the end, but I would greatly appreciate any input to help me pick a direction.  Thank you so much in advance.

She will not sleep in bed with us and will not sleep in her pack n play.  She wont even sleep in the car!! She will only sleep in a crib!!I don't know if we should wait until after the baby is born or if we should do it before.

20090128174111AAw84W9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 1 year old fell out of the bed onto his back. Could it be broken or sprung?	He and his brother followed me into the bedroom as I was ironing and were playing on the floor. To prevent from tipping over the ironing board and getting burnt, I placed the in my bed. While in the bed they wrestled and played with each other. Unfortunately, the little one fell out of the bed onto the floor.      I held him and later he went to sleep. Then he woke up holding his arm funny. I didn't notice it before he went to sleep, but now he is holding his arm downward. I don't know if it is sprung or broken. It is not swollen or discolored...but when he bends it he cries. Could it be sprung or broken?      If it is broken, we will go to the hosptial. If it is sprung what are some at home tips. I have no experience in this type of problem...my first child NEVER got hurt...it is the second that is always getting hurt (even under watchful eye--he is a frisky rascal). Right now he is laughing and trying to talk...but only cries when I move his arm.

I used the bathroom maybe another time or two. then at 130 i threw up. I went back and laid down but was still restless and felt awful and barely slept.       All tuesday i lied around bc i felt so nauseous but never threw up again. The smells of my husbands food and snacks made me feel even sicker but no throw up or anything.

We've tried everything to make it better we sleep with a heater but I don't think it helps and it's making our son sick a lot.. He's been sick for over a month and it never seems to get better... Cough, runny nose, sneezing, fever..       This last couple of weeks the weather got warm and Isaac got completely fine but yesterday the temperature dropped again so he's sick AGAIN! I'm losing it, I hate seeing him like this, he's usually such a happy boy but he's congested so he wakes 1000 times per night and then he's cranky and everytime I use his nasal spray he cries like crazy and gets really clingy..       I just don't know what to do anymore, we've been to the Dr almost every week since the winter started, he's taking vitamins and he took all kinds of different meds, nothing gets rid of it! I'm a sahm and I've devoted myself to help him feel better but I can't!! I'm so frustrated with this.. Can you give me advice or something?? ANYTHING?? please.

20090128175036AAThPHU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How accurate is the due date at 20 weeks?	My wife and I just had her 20 week ultrasound last week (it's a boy!).  Her original due date was June 17, but after the appointment the doctor said it is now June 10.        My wife is not from the U.S., and so we are trying to find an airline ticket for her mom to come here and be with her for about 2 weeks (that's all the amount of time her mom can skip from work).        Right now, we're planning on buying her mom a plane ticket that arrives in the U.S. on June 6, and leaves on June 19 or June 20.      How accurate is the due date?      How big are the chances that my wife will not give birth sometime between June 6 and June 20?      Thanks!
20090128180917AAOJpVP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Just a cold?  Would you take your baby in to the doctor?	My 9-month old has had a cold for about 10 days.  Nothing horrible, but green snot galore.  She seems okay except she had problems eating if I do not suction her nose before each feeding (which she *hates*).  She is not running a fever and does not have a cough.        She has been a little fussy, but her first tooth cut through 4 days ago and the one right next to it is just about to cut through.  I know teething can cause a runny nose, but her snot is green (and both my husband and I and our two older children have had a cold, too).      I don't want to take her to the pediatrician and spend a ton of money for them to tell me she has a cold.  But... I also don't want to miss a secondary infection.      What would you do in this situation?

20090128180215AAnCDZG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My fiance has just been told he has a child?	My fiance dated a girl briefly when we broke up when we were 16.    Obviously, they had sex, blah blah blah.   We got back together shortly, and he never saw the girl again. (He was on holiday, she lived in a different state.)   We have been engaged, for just two days.   Anyway, We got a call this morning, and it was for him.   It was that girls mother. She told him that Rebecca. (The girl.) Had passed away, they believe an accidental overdose.    Then the mother told him that Rebecca has a 3y/o son, and that she was "sorry it had to be like this." But he was the father. Rebecca never planned on telling him.   He told me they were together for like 2 weeks, they had sex yes, but used a condom.. and then when he came back from vacation, he never saw her again, and we got back together. (I did already know this though.)    Apparently Rebecca then found out she was pregnant. (At just 16!) But really, they barely knew eachother, so she didn't call him. She made a will when Lukas was born, and it had that he was the father, and  he was the only person she has to take him.   Now, she is dead, and the mother says that he is the only one that can take her as she (the babys grandmother) has, a lot of problems. (I mean like physical, she can't look after a child.) & Rebecca has friends, all drug addicts supposedly and none of them want Luke.   This leaves him.   I am in utter shock.   He has asked for a paternity test first, but all the dates 100% match up, he just wants to make sure.   He basically asked me if it was ok if we have her because "he is mine... and you are great with kids!"       I don't know how to feel..   Help?      =( rory.

20090128181003AApnFCd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My husband thinks it's disgusting that I breastfeed our 18 month old daughter, should I continue?	Over the past couple months my daughter had only been nursing here and there when she remembered during the day, before naps and at night. Recently, she started nursing like a newborn again, every few hours, and multiple times during the night. I am guessing it could be due to the changes in my milk supply or taste or something along those lines because I am 32 weeks pregnant. Since my daughter has started nursing more often, my husband has made repeated comments that it is gross and disgusting that I breastfeed a toddler, and that breastfeeding is only for "little babies". I plan to tandem nurse (I've made it this far through pregnancy and I really don't want to give up now) and let my children self wean. I am just really hurt by my husbands comments and when I went to tell him that he said he's not willing to discuss it, that's just how he feels and it's not going to change. He has been arguing with me to wean our daughter since she was around 6 months old. I can't take it anymore, what should I do?

On the way back home, I started telling her she'd have to show more respect to keep the phone.   After a two-minute speech of mine, she threw the phone out the window and yelled, "You are such a B_ _ ch !"   It's not the cursing I'm concerned about, that doesn't bother me,   It's that she threw a perfectly-good cell phone out the window ten minutes after she got it just because I started talking.   My husband had to go buy a new one, (Another $350)   and we're debating on whether we should let her have it now or not,   and what disciplinary action we should take?

He was over at our house, and my daughter had to go outside to check something for me. I went upstairs to deliver her laundry, and I found him jacking off.

Okay, so my last period was Dec 16th,(hasnt shown up for january) since about Jan 12th Ive had some odd things happening, like my face that ive never had any problems other than one or two at the most pimples popping up once in a while...decided to go crazy and turn into acne hell lol. Then one morning a woke up and my boobs felt like someone had been punching them all nite, from then on theyve been awfully uncomfortable (cant lay on them). About 2 weeks ago I started having light not really cramping (more of an annoyance, than pain) but close to it in my lower abdomin and back and that hasnt gone away. Was in the kitchen baking a cake about a week and 1/2 ago and licked some of the chocolate cinnamon mix off and about 3 minutes later starting getting dizzy and nauseas at the same time and had to sit down (I know weird). and since then have a had a few spells (usally in the kitchen) where i feel light headed and have to sit down. Been having a few quick headaches. Yesterday when i went to the bathroom and wiped there was a veery very faint tinge of pink then it was gone. Then this morning when i woke up, went to the bathroom and wiped and there was a brown tinge only when i wiped off and on all day. Sorry for the looooong story. Im just really confused and any input would be greatly appreciated!

What should a mother do if the father of her child is in jail for not paying child support?  He says that he rather spend the rest of his live in jail for not paying child support.  Because he is well behaved in jail at least according to the jail staff, he gets many privileges like free cable TV and medical insurance.  He never wanted to be a father.  It cost the state more money to keep him in jail for one weak, than the amount he would have to pay in child support.

20090128181343AAjuqWm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Please help with any advice you may have......??!!?	ok, where to start. partner and i have been TTC since august, i have irregular cycles, always been between four and seven weeks. now is the confusing part, i have dates...   4th december - last AF   16th jan - slight spotting, not proper blood just two spots of old brown blood   23rd jan - took HPT, negative!!   29th jan - today, still no sign of AF.   Partner and i BD pretty much every day (sorry!!) so if i have ovulated then the chances of me missing my window would be slim. i have no symptoms of any kind which i would say are different from normal day to day for either AF or pregnancy!!   i feel like im going crazy here because i dont know what to expect, aaagh!! lol   any advice would be appreciated, just to put my mind at rest.   also visited docs about irregular periods and they said just to carry on trying until it had been around a year.   i think my heads gona explode before then though, haha.   thank you all in advance x

My son is 4 months....so I am well aware I shouldn't expect crawling to start happening for a while yet!    My question is , do you have to help your baby learn to crawl, or is it something that one day they'll decide they are able to do on there own?    Are there things that help them along?    I'm NOT gonna try force my boy to crawl if that's what crossed everyones mind!  I just wanted to know what are the signs he is wanting to crawl, for further down the track when he displays them!    Thank you!

20090128181814AAW0QdT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Would you let your 5 year old go to his friends after this incident?	Tonight, I took all my kids to the mall, because their mother is coming home tomorrow, so they were each getting a "welcome home" gift.    I brought my brother along to help me with the kids. (4) He took my 1 and 2 year old to the toy store. And Nicholas (5), and Brogan (4) wanted to help pick out gifts.    Well, as soon as my brother left, my 5 year old started rolling on the ground crying because he wanted to go to the toy store. Then, I got him up, and he ran up the escalator, and off to the disney store. I was CHASING HIM every where, and people kept staring. So, I caught him, and was so angry I pulled down his pants in front of everyone, spanked him, and put him in a stroller (i payed for it after he was caught.) The rest of the time, he cried. He kept saying he wanted to get out. So, I let him out of the stroller. Then, he went NUTS again. He ran for the exit, and I chased him with my 4 year old in the stroller. I chased him half way across the mall, then I caught up to him. I picked him up, put him in the bathroom, put him on the diaper change, and spanked him, HARD. but he looked at me, and laughed. Then, I took him home, with nothing for my wife, and he has no school tomorrow... You know what he asked me? "Can I go to my friends house tomorrow?" I am considering it, but what would you do?

20090128182445AACeSB8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Have I wasted my teenage years?	I am 17 and I'm in the 12th grade. I go to an all-boys school and I haven't talked to a girl in an indepth conversation since the end of 8th grade. Infact, all of my "friends" are boys.       The reason for this is that I don't know any girls outside of school. I don't go to any parties or anything that people in my school hold at their house. I haven't drank before. I haven't smoked anything before. The people at school always talk about their weekends and I'm always left out of it. I am sort of afraid to ask if I can be invited to this, because at this point it would be somewhat awkward and if I were to be at a party, I'd be out of place in terms of communication with girls and the drinks and weed.      Speaking of weed, a lot of people at school have tried weed, or smoke it on a regular basis, and I really want to try it but I don't know who to buy it from or where to go to get it. The people have been saying it is really awesome. The people I see who regularly smoke it seem like they are regular, functioning, and smart people. Contradictory to what I've heard about people who smoke weed.      I'm usually out of the loop and am not known as the cool guy. A lot of my "friends" are in relationships or these things they call "hookups". I'm often somewhat disenfranchised whenever I see a "friend" with a female because I know that I'll probably not be in a relationship anytime soon or at all.      My weekends end up being lonely, and summer's more of the same except that it's hotter, it's longer, and the thought of my "friends" having endless fun torments me.       I'll probably end up not going to prom because I know no girls, and I'll probably not end up going to Senior Week in Ocean City because it will be more of the same drinking and toking up that I'm not used to.       I've wasted 4 years of friendship, camaraderie, and weekend experimentation. Now, it's off to college, to a college where I'm pretty sure there's no drinking or any of that. Then when I look back on my years, I'm not going to say, "those were good times". I'm going to think they were so shitty...
20090128182011AALV8tW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Beginning of the story my thirteen-year-old daughter wrote - do you like it so far?	Daddy, I whispered, half asleep in the backseat of our Jeep. If you could have one wish in the world, what would it be?    Hmm, Angel, he said, stroking his chin. Thats a tough one. I dont know. We have a long drive ahead of us. Sleep now, and Ill have an answer for you when you wake up.    Okay, I murmured, then added, Daddy?    Yes?    I love you.    Love you too, sweetheart, my father said.    I drifted off to sleep clutching my teddy bear, Winky, in my arms.  *****  Next thing I knew, I was awoken to the sound of sirens. Lights flashed, and strong arms lifted me out of the car. Winky! I said, automatically panicking when I realized my bear had dropped onto the floor. Someone handed me the stuffed animal, and I hugged him tight. And then, in a smaller voice, I inquired, Daddy? Wheres my Daddy? What happened?    I looked up, and was staring into the face of a policeman. He had a kind face, but policemen scared me. They had guns and wore scary outfits and looked as if they could beat you up if they wanted to.     No one answered my questions, but I heard the policemen talking anyways. I caught snatches of their conversation. . . . car accident . . . father . . . died from the impact . . . other driver was drinking . . . the little girl is just fine . . .     I began to scream. I want my Daddy!     The policeman didnt say anything. He just buckled me into the backseat of the police car and took me down to the station.     It was then that I realized something. Daddy had never answered my question.    I began to sob, hysterical sobs that shook my whole body. Daddy, I whimpered, hugging Winky tight.     Then suddenly I was very angry. I had Winky, but I didnt want him. I wanted my father. I threw my teddy bear to the floor, mad at Winky for letting this happen. Then I stubbornly turned my face to the window and stared out. I watched the stars for a couple minutes, and then turned around and picked up my bear. After all, it wasnt his fault.  *****  When we got to the station, a policewoman took me aside. She gave me a lollipop and told me what had happened: my father had died, and now she needed to know what to do with me. She asked me how old I was, and I held up six fingers. She smiled and asked me if I had any other relatives. Mom, I told her.    Wheres Mom? she asked me, but I didnt know. Other girls had mothers; I had none. Of course, I knew I must have had one somewhere, but she didnt play an active role in my life. Daddy talked about her sometimes, but I didnt really care. I usually changed the subject, because she was unimportant to me. All I knew was that when she and Daddy separated when I was a baby, he took me and I never saw her again.  Then I remembered something. A tattered piece of paper with my mothers phone number and address on it, taped to our fridge at home. I dont know why it was there, but it was. Maybe Daddy called and talked to Mom sometimes, but I never took much notice.    I told this to the policewoman, and she asked me a bunch of other questions. Eyelids drooping, I answered as best as I could.    The next few hours were a blur to me. We went to my house and the policewoman saw Moms address and phone number, called her and made arrangements. I packed up my stuff, and the next thing I knew, I was on a flight from my home in Vancouver to Toronto, where Mom lived.  *****  I was travelling alone, and the flight attendants looked after me as best they could. They gave me chocolate milk and crayons to colour with and showed me how to select a Disney movie for myself. I watched Aladdin and then fell asleep with Winky in my arms. And when I woke up, the flight was over. One of the flight attendants helped me out of the plane where I was met by an escort, who took me to get my luggage and everything, and then to my mother.    I knew her the minute I laid eyes on her. Id never seen a picture, but it was like looking at an older version of myself. I had her face, the same colour hair, the same pale complexion, the same dark eyes.    I knew she recognized me too, because she walked towards me, and then stopped. Angelina, she whispered. My baby.    I didnt know what I was supposed to do, so we just stood there awkwardly for a moment, and then I went to her and hugged her. She hugged me back, and then, trusting child that I was, I took her hand. I immediately felt safe with my mother, and I knew that shed protect me above all else. As we walked to the taxi that would take us to my new home, no words passed between us. None were needed. We understood each other perfectly already. I knew how awkward my mother felt, and she realized how scared I was. But in that one minute, we made an unspoken agreement to do the best we could to put the other at ease.    I climbed into the backseat of the cab next to Mom, squeezing Winky tight.     Mom turned to look at me and noticed the bear. You still have Winky! she exclaimed, a delighted smile forming on

20090128181924AAykP6o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm wondering - is my wife pregnant?	I realise that most of the users in this part of these forums are women, but that's good because you are who I'm asking!       My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for about 4 months (we currently have no kids, so this is a first time for both of us). It's been a disappointment so far, especially last month when her period was about a week late, we thought it may have been it, but alas no. The past few times she hasn't fallen pregnant she's got quite upset.      So this month we tried again...she checked some fertility forums and stuff and we crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's, so to speak, in terms of getting our timing right and stuff.       A couple of days before her period was due (roughly 12 or so days after she said she was ovulating), she started getting some very minor spotting. I didn't think anything of it until she said that her body has never done that before. That night she got some slight aches, and she was convinced that her period was starting and that we'd missed out again, and got upset again. But the next day the aches had stopped (although the minor spotting continued). I asked her several times how she was feeling and she said "well...actually...I feel fine!". I found that a little odd too, as she's the type that gets beaten up pretty bad when her period kicks in.      Over the next couple of days she's mentioned off-hand that she's felt tired and headachy (again, not something I previously thought about because she hasn't slept all that well), as well as feeling a bit bloated. This past day she's commented that she's feeling a little nauseous. At this point, I got curious and started looking up some websites for early pregnancy signs, and was surprised to see that all of these things (spotting, tiredness, headaches, feeling bloated, nausea) were all commonly on the lists.      What I really want to know, particularly from the women who have already gone through all this, is...could my wife actually be pregnant? I'd hesitate to ask her to take another pregnancy test, at the risk she's not as it'll upset her again. Her period is due...well...today, and it hasn't started yet, but it's not unusual for her for it to arrive a few days late.      Is it worth me talking to her and asking if she wants to take another pregnancy test? She might already be convinced she's not - but I'm not so convinced. But if she does take another one and she's not pregnant, she'll get upset again and I don't want to do that to her.      Anyone have any ideas? As I mentioned, both my wife and I have never had kids before, so this is a first for us.

I had my first ultrasound at 7 weeks. at that appointment they told me that my due date would be august 8th. last wednesday i had my 12 and a half week ultra sound and they told me my baby was measuring almost 4 inches crown to rump. a normal fetus on average is only 3 inches. my doctor mentioned my baby being a little larger but only changed my due date to august 3rd. is that normal? have other people had their babies measure larger by almost an inch at almost 13 weeks? my husband was on a business trip around the time of conception so i am either 13 weeks or almost 17 or 18 weeks. if i was that much further along would it be noticeable in more than just length? someone please help me!!!!
