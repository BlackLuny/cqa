But most people keep guinnea pigs in a shed or out in the yard in their hutch of course. Thats a lie really as they dont have to be indoors. As long as you make sure they have plenty of - Hay-To knaw on (Keeps them really healthy and its part of their diet), Straw- Keep this in the bedding area with the hay mix it together will keep it very warm and will love to eat some aswell make sure that it has plenty of Hay and Straw everyday though. Also make sure it has clean sawdust in the bottom, food and water of course. I would also recommend getting 2 guinnea pigs as it will keep it more warm and calm they proffer to be kept in groups.

JfBzzXQ4aa	A friend of mine's Border Terrier ( I know Toto was really a Cairn) played Toto in a local Wizard of Oz. This dog was an Obedience titled dog. She had her CDX at the time. And was training Utility. So she knew a lot of usable skills. They had the dog make "best buds" with Dorothy by Dorothy carrying treats on her all the time during practice. This way the dog followed her everywhere. They used subtle hand signals with the dog during the play as needed. When they went into a dance scene or anytime they needed Toto out of the way, they put her in a sit stay or a down stay with a hand signal or someone off stage called the dog offstage. The dog knew to bark on command with a subtle hand signal. And the dog already carried things in it's mouth from it's obedience work. Hope this helps. Good Luck.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Enter him in as many shows as you can! That shows he's a great example of a dog.

Worms can be very dangerous and hard to get rid of (depending on what type) once a horse has them.<br>  Rotational wormers are usually on a 2-3 month rotation.  <br>  however, we've always wormed our horses (with like zimectrin or equipaste) about 3-4 times a year and never had any problems.  i know there are supplements(daily feeds) that are wormers, but I've never used them.

That is where you change around wormers every 2 months so that the worms don't become immune to the wormer.

Worms can also cause colic which can be fatal, and they make the horse lose weight. That article of definitely wrong.<br>  <br>  Edit: Horses should be wormed way more often than 2 times a year btw. However, unless they have an investation, they shouldn't be wormed more than every 2 months.|`|9AzUeF9saa	In my opinion, deworming horses is an important process for many reasons.  The first and foremost is because there are some types of worms that can begin to infest without the horse showing the symptoms.  This could cause them to become much worse before the owner notices.  Also, you should switch wormers every once in a while to prevent a worm from becoming immune to one type of wormer.  Horses with worms may require surgery or other expensive processes, and some can even cause death.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!  :}|`|TYyZwOtlaa	Jenny is right, if you are worried about pumping your horse full of chemicals , the best thing to do is take a dung sample into your vet every so often to do a worm count, this way you can keep an eye on it, and wont have to unnecessarily worm your horse if you don't need to. <br>  There are pros and cons to worming your horse regularly, yes it does mean more chemicals, but some worms can really cause harm to your horse and can even cause death.

In a large barn with many horses, it is a good idea to use preventative maintenance such as a worming rotation every sixty days. This way, by using different dewormers, you will avoid resistent strains of parasites. In any case like this, it is very important to have all the horses on the same schedule, otherwise a horse could be dewormed one day and sniff some manure from another horse the next day and get reinfected. However, if you are in a different situation, for example if you keep two horses in your back yard, I would definitely not have them on a 60 day schedule because it is unnecessary. It is true that horses contract worms by grazing and ingesting eggs on grass blades, but it's much more common for a horse to get them from sniffing an affected horse's manure. Hence, if neither of your two horses has worms, they are much less likely to get them. In that case I would definitely recommend periodic fecal samples. It costs less than $20, you don't need a farm call for it, you can just bring a sample to your vet or even do it yourself if you have access to a microscope and some sugar water. You should also consider the strength and safety of the different wormers. If you are in the backyard scenario, and you want to be on the safe side and worm every couple of months, you might rotate between some of the milder dewormers such as ivermectin and avoid dewormers with a low safety margin such as moxidectin (Quest), and use strategic timing to worm: after the first hard frost once the eggs have died off in the pasture or 10-14 days after heavy rain (eggs thrive in wet conditions). Another creative and drug free solution that I am quite fond of is pasture rotation with ruminant species such as goats. Goats are not affected by the same parasites as horses and they will remove parasite eggs by eating grass.
bnJLKQWMaa	My local farmers market allows dogs, but the one 15 miles away does not... you will have to try and find out.<br>  <br>  My local one was a great way to socialize a young pup, lots of people, kids and other dogs.  She has always been well behaved in public otherwise I would not have taken her there.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|bIaywrBCaa	I know the ones around here do. Best to check before taking them.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-I know the two here in the Houston, TX area does NOT allow pets- leashed or not.  Call the one you are considering going to.  Also, might just try it- the rules and security at those places is very lacking!|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Typically, yes. But if the flea market is at fairgrounds, you might want to double check because sometimes dogs aren't allowed within fenced fairgrounds.|`|9kTejB0uaa	To you mean to visit - or to sell?<br>  <br>  I've taken mine round a flea market, but I've most def. not tried to sell, or seen anybody trying to sell, puppies!!!|`|qXvFsnOcaa	I've never been to one where there has not been several dogs, both tall holder's dogs and customer's dogs.|`|k56mmj2eaa	Sure as long as you keep them on a leash and under control. There are some stores like home depot that are dog friendly.
59zYV36Eaa	There are certain things people have to buy for their pets.  They don't have as much to spend on the extras.  There aren't as many pets being bought lately, but they still need food and essentials.  Some people are cutting costs by getting rid of their pets all together.|`|AA10356572	there is no GLOBAL crisis.. I work in a tourism industry and we are not effected..

The majority of people who have pets (at least one hopes it's the majority!) keep their pets for better or worse, and the services industry provides at least some necessary services (as opposed to frills like the groomer - you can give your dog a bath yourself for the cost of a bottle of shampoo if you can't afford the groomer) that pets need even if you lose your job - veterinary services, training services, etc.  <br>  <br>  2. No matter how bad the economy gets, there's always going to be the wealthy housewives with their chihuahuas who need their weekly pampering sessions at the groomer.  Since those are probably a good percentage of the customers at a groomer's anyway, they'll continue to support the pet services industry.<br>  <br>  Of course, that is speaking of the industry as a whole.  Any time there is economic trouble, some individual pet services providers are going to go out of business (which can be assumed would occur in pretty much any industry that will suffer a downturn in a crisis), leaving more customers on average for those remaining, which will be enough for those companies to survive until things improve.

iVQULHqYaa	Your dog has issues because of her diet. Grain creates acid and that's why your dog is itchy<br>  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. .|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Could be allergies, dry skin?

The vet knows best|`|ax1FixI6aa	Well it just depends really. What type of dog do you have? What age is she? It could be that she is allergic to something, or that the winter weather makes her skin more dry. Do you bathe her often? If so it could be drying her skin out. I've found that putting fish oil (Come in capsules, just cut them and squirt it on) on my dogs food, keeps their coats more shiney and their skin dandruff free. The Omega 3's are really good for them. Check her coat where she's biting and see if it's dry or flakey.|`|07o55tYJaa	she might have an infection or rah. it might also be a cut and then you might want to get a "cone" from the basement or your vet. my advice is if it continues talk to a vet. or put a cone on her head so she can't scratch if you examine the area and theres nothing there.|`|EAcbKhmIaa	i know the answer this happend to my dog i took it the animal doctor they told me if i give it people food and i said yes and that was the prob<br>  if you give your dog people food thats whats wrong you have to give it dog food|`|SjFiTnmdaa	Maybe because that spot is really itchy take him to the vet idk really what else.

bnJLKQWMaa	Owning a dog has nothing to do with size.  It is to do with training, time and energy spent teaching the dog, and socializing the dog.  You could have an Irish Wolfhound (tallest dog there is) if you wanted one, it is just how you train the dog.<br>  <br>  Before you adopt a pit either with your parents now, or when you are on your own, check to see if it is allowed with either home owner insurance or as tenant.  You could compromise your situation with a pit, there are also several other breeds which Landlord's or Insurance companies will not allow.<br>  <br>  I am happy to know you are planning your future to include a dog, they will be very lucky to have you as an Owner.

I volunteer at a Humane Society for problem dogs.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  American Pit Bull Terriers are best suited to owners who can offer firm, fair training, and gentle consistent discipline.

I knew his background though, his mother was very protective of women and a great cubble buddy. So I think that is important when choose any dog with an agressive nature. Get the dog as a puppy and teach it the rules to beyour pet. Good doggy manners. Give it time to run and pay with other dog to be social with other people and do not allow the dog to jump on anyone ever. then it won't want to. I have a Lab, he's 96 to 100 lbs and I had no clue because he never jumps on me... I took him to the vet and was shocked cause if he wanted to he could trample me...

Also, since you already have dogs you might want to exhaust the pit bull before you introduce them, otherwise the pit may have enough energy to harm the other dog. <br>  <br>  P.S you should also exhaust the other dogs as well because even though they are small they can cause some damage when they think that they're place (wherever it may be) is being threatened.|`|wOft5K4Aaa	It's not really a matter of size. You have to make sure (if u do get 1) that the breeder did not abuse or neglect it in any way, that the pups or dogs parents are not aggressive, and that the dog or pup is not aggressive. If those qualities are met, and you don't train him to be aggressive, then you should be fine. <br>  <br>  P.S :  I have a friend who was scratched by a pit bull (on accident) when she was playing with him, so be sure to trim their nails.

You would need to have the dog in obedience classes at a young age to be able to handle the dog. Size of the owner doesn't matter, it's more making the dog know you are the alpha leader.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	It really just depends pit bulls come in different sizes from around 35 pounds to some that weight over 100.  Its all about what your cable of handling also each dog is different. I volunteer at a shelter and we have had pits that were very docile and would walk at a slower pace. Then we had some that ready to go and wanting to walk quickly.  Its not always about size if you make sure your dog is well trained and socialized and you are a calm assertive pack leader<br>  <br>  This is also a dog that needs daily daily exercise both physical and mentally.  Someone who owns a pit should be committed to walking their dog every day probably good to do at least two walks and one should be at least an hour long if not more depending on the dogs energy level.<br>  <br>  I hate to tell you this but the fact is very few apartments allow pit bulls so you may have to search for a long time to find an apartment who would allow you to have a pit.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	With a bone condition you need  a dog you are sure you can handle.  Even in play a Pitt can hurt you & may hurt you bad, they are very powerful dogs.<br>  <br>  Taking training classes will help you in handling him/her but you are still in danger.  The puppy stage (until 18 mo. of age) is a rough & rowdy time.  Some act like puppies for a couple to 3 years or more depending on the individual dog.<br>  <br>  Due to your bone issue I would think twice before getting one.
pC5GiAgsaa	The best way which I know of is a method that avoids the other dog (in your case the 4 year old) from becoming Territorial and aggressive:<br>  When you get the pup home, before even putting it in the house put it on a lead outside your driveway and then get someone else who you live with to bring you 12 year old and the 4 year old outside to the driveway where your pup is. Walk up and down the driveway telling the other dogs to leave the puppy alone. After several minutes of walking up and down the drive go into the garden and let the dogs off. <br>  <br>  This effectively mi micks going out on a walk and inviting the puppy home for "tea"! While out in the garden tell off the older dogs for any aggressive behaviour towards the puppy i.e growling, barking at it etc. Doing this in the garden will also give the pup a chance to empty it's bladder after the car journey. The dogs will probably be interested in the pup now they have the chance to play and interact.<br>  <br>  This method is more effective if you've been out with a dog which has had it's vaccinations already and you have been on a long walk with it in public places. However because your puppy won't have had it's vaccinations yet you won't be able to go on a walk in public places so the drive way will have to do!<br>  <br>  This method worked brilliantly when we had and american bulldog to stay and we did this with our labrador puppy outside in the lane. By the time they got home they were already best friends!! Let me know how it goes.... good luck!!|`|MdMejBS0aa	Hmm. Well that's queer that your dog wouldn't like other dogs' presence. Anyhow, what you could do is keep the puppy in your arms when you introduce the new dog to the old dog(s). If the old dog(s) take it as an offense, keep the new puppy around you, as protection against the old dog. Do this for, let's say, a weekend (when you're not away, leaving the pets to themselves), and if relationships don't improve, you'll have to look for expert advise. Or someone in Yahoo Answers could probably assist more than I can.|`|RyGkqWvCaa	The best way is to hold the puppy and show the other dogs that he is ok and part of the family.

However just on basic information.  neutral territory is best. Also don't under any circumstances leave them alone even for a minute for the first week or so. If you need to do something where you cannot give them your attention put the puppy in its crate do not move the 4 year old.   Make sure you and your family members pay a lot of attention to the older dogs or they might get jealous. Always feed older dogs first.  My beagle always get wound up whenever other dogs walk by but it seemed to get it that  when we brought  a puppy home it was to stay.  another good idea may be to ask the breeder or whoever your getting the puppy from if you can bring you 4 year old over to meet the puppy. this might give you an idea as too how much trouble you will have.  good luck.|`|iVQULHqYaa	You appear to understand dogs and you obviously care. Almost all of the Askers on Yahoo ask after a problem occurs. Thankfully you are anticipating problems and you want to  avoid them. <br>  <br>  Puppies are excitable, lovable hooligans. They have bursts of unbelievable energy, however in order to grow they need lots of sleep. New puppies need a room where they can rest and sleep and the other dogs in the house need respite. Older dogs don’t want puppies biting their ears and chewing their necks, if a puppy does this, the older dogs should be allowed to chastise the puppy. How would you cope if you were expected to cope with an unruly toddler twenty four hours a day? Would you be annoyed, if you had a toddler thrust upon you who pulled your hair and poked your eyes? I am sure that you would grumble.<br>  <br>  Please don’t expect your dog to cope with an unruly puppy and to baby-sit twenty four hours a day.  Supervise them for SHORT play sessions in the garden and if the puppy is over exuberant, allow your dog to chastise it, then put your puppy in its own room to rest. Don’t expect your dog to want to sleep with your puppy or to play with it constantly. <br>  <br>  Your puppy will possibly need about four meals a day. Divide your other dog’s rations into four and feed it (or them) when you feed your puppy.  Give your existing dog extra attention when the puppy is resting and make him feels special.<br>  <br>  There will be visitors, who want to see your puppy. When the doorbells rings, put your puppy into another room and tell your visitors to fuss your adult dog or dogs and give them treats BEFORE they make a fuss of the puppy.<br>  <br>  Older dogs love puppies, with the proviso that YOU stop the puppy from being a pain in the bum. They don’t want a puppy being thrust upon them all of the time. If you do this any dog will object and be confused.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new baby and your life with your managerie.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|CJMhtM7maa	99% of any breed of dog will recognize that it is a pup and will not hurt it.Your older dogs will teach the pup their rules of play,even the 12 yr old will try and play a little with the pup.I think that if your really concerned about the 4 yr.old,just put his leash on and if he gets too rough with the pup you have control.Your Newfie will soon learn it all.
JfBzzXQ4aa	Train the "Watch" command and pair it with a hand signal. I use a finger touch to my nose. Encouraging the dog to focus on my face. Teach it with treats & lots of positive reinforcemement & build up the time gradually. Always make sure the timing on your treat & positive marker (clicker or word like "Yes") is correct. Reward WHILE the dog is "Watching", before he has a chance to look away. When he has the Watch good still, then teach it with movement, like heeling.<br>  With this if Dorothy needs to get Toto focused again, she subtly taps her finger to her nose. Toto Watches!|`|bnJLKQWMaa	The best way to get a dog to focus on you (or the person in the play) is to focus on the dog.<br>  <br>  You can give the dog a treat each time he looks at you, I did this with a highly distractable dog for agility, I used the 'look' command and it works really well.<br>  <br>  I am thinking that this little dog is a Cairn terrier or other kind of terrier or mix, they can be tenacious little dogs, so a good long run, to burn off some extra energy will help before any training.<br>  <br>  Best of luck ~ sounds like fun!|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I would say you need to have had the dog for a long time to train to stay with you like that.

It would also get you more training and experience, let you make a name for yourself, and they would have a steady stream of customers.

If you can do it with yours, you can do it with others (often more easily!)|`|d3MhQzrIaa	Wow!  You are already a celebrity dog trainer and that could give you instant credentials.  I would network and start out with those closest to you and develop a business that way.  You may just have enough clientel to be able to charge a nice amount (well above what other pet training centers charge).  My advice: start with small steps but always have that vision!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/dog_obedience_training" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/dog_obedience_tra...</a>|`|wOft5K4Aaa	Yes defiantly go for it if it is something you love to do. The charging part all depends though. How serious is their problem with their dog?, How much are they willing to pay? Make sure it is reasonable though. If I were you i would charge 25 dollars an hour, but you are the professional. :)|`|pC5GiAgsaa	Yes! If this is what you want to do then I would say go with your heart! <br>  PS ￡10/$12 sounds reasonable for a one to one session with the dog depending on how good you are....... good luck. I really hope you do it!!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You need to at least apprentice under a trainer. You will get the experience you need with all breeds. <br>  You can't learn or get experience training from a TV show

ur5wDhkMaa	Time to take things to pieces. Switch it off to begin with. It's a simple design, a powerhead pushes water through the filter past the heater into the tank.<br>  <br>  Loud noise and no flow coming out. That sounds like the impeller in the powerhead is fouled. It's a magnet with blades on one end that has a metal spike in the middle holding it in place. I use an old toothbrush to clean mine. Do that, switch it on out of the water while you can see the impeller. If it spins that's it fixed, but you may need to give it a nudge, if you do use the toothbrush or some other finger saving object.<br>  <br>  When you come to reassemble, there's a rubber seal that connects the powerhead to the filter. That becomes brittle with old age, if it splits, then flow is diverted. A replacement is about ￡3-4.<br>  <br>  The actual filter is just a box of filter medium, but as we are in bits, you might as well clean that out and remove the carbon as you are using a chemical treatment.<br>  <br>  The heater doesn't make a noise, but it wouldn't be much use without water being pushed past it. This is a sacrifice of having it inbuilt, it relies on the powerhead. Actually the whole thing does, which means the problem is the impeller or seal :o)|`|k9gC23apaa	buy a new one, theres a chance it overheated. Make sure that there is water in there filter, and that its sitting enough in the water for it to pump.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	bring it to wherever you got it and they could try to fix it|`|EdxEF2Tcaa	try to take it to a fish store or some thing|`|YZowEwCoaa	It is probably jammed up with gravel, debris, etc. The white spots on the fish, I am sad to say... is a disease called "the Ick" Okay, Now I know that sounds like I'm making it up, But this has happened to me! The Ick will make your fish begin to lose there scales, and leave them vulnerable to die from the disease. there are cures that you can pick up from some pet stores, but right now, keep the filter running, to filter the water in any way whatsoever. ACT FAST! the disease spreads quickly! It has happened to me before. I had 6 different Goldfish and in 1 week, I only had one left. 2 weeks after that, I had no more fish. It's a deadly disease. Get some medicine, and make sure you give your Fish the EXACT dose of medicine it needs. It will take a few days to clear up.|`|nlRr07dRaa	first of all are you missing any fish? sounds like something is blocking the pump from working... there is a pump back there that should be cleaned periodically. if something got stuck in there, it will make it start working really hard causing the humming or vibrating sound..... see if you can take it apart and clean it. good luck I  hate casualties!|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Always unplug your filter before you do a water change.<br>  If it was running for a while without water in it you may have burned out the engine.<br>  Unplug it and take it off the tank (not sure if you can or not with that type filter.) Look inside at the turning mechanism to make sure nothing is twisted around it and that it can turn freely. Let the filter rest (cool down) for about 10 minutes and then put it back on the tank, fill it up to the top with tank water and try again. If it doesn't kick in you'll have to fork out the dough for a new filter, the sooner the better. It sounds like your fish are in dire straights, stressed with ich and an ammonia spike.

LOH6UVh7aa	Yes I love the country. I use to own 151 acres in WY. Had to sell... work.  Now live on the outskirts on Las Vegas NV.|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	I love the country and mountains soo much!<br>  I live in a town in California and I hate it<br>  My grandparents owned 4 acres of mountain land and it was like God's country. I loved it up there soooo much. They recently just lost it thogh due to financial problems. But anyways I'll tell you bout it.<br>  When they first moved there back in 1988 it was just land no houses or anything. They owned 4 acres and part of a creek. Everybody in the family pitched in to build the home. It was a beautiful home to there was a great big porch goin all the way around. Inside the house there were to great big windows and you could look out into the yard (we used to feed the animals) and you would sit on the couch in the morning and look out at all the animals eating. Then you'd go outside after a big breakfast grandpa cooked and ride ATV'S little Honda motorcycles, they had a horse for a few months. And right before fall came we would go blackberry picking and bring them home and we'd make blackberry pie and jam. Then in the evening we'd sit out on the front porch and drink and tell stories and just talk. The we'd go to bed and I always use to open the window in the summer and listen to the creek run and the crickets sing, it would put me to sleep. And I loved it when my family was there it made more things exciting.<br>  I can't explain how beautiful it was p there I just wish somehow I could be up there again.I had a beautiful 14 years there and I wouldn't trade anything for them.<br>  I miss that place sooo much!|`|cGRyDCpQaa	I used to, but we moved to this white-trash city and are surrounded by bars. I hate it. Nobody in my family has gotten hardly any sleep since we moved out here, and the air STINKS like smoke and something dead. We have nearly no yard and absolutely no privacy.<br>  <br>  Before we moved I could've cared less about the land, but now all I want to do is move back. We have farm land and it's so nice to even just go out there and walk around. We're trying to move but idk if that's going to happen. I love it because the air is clean, it's quiet, you get to see animals, and you don't see a billion ugly buildings clumped together everywhere you look. I love it too that you can put the land to good use without ruining it.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I live in town and have to board my horse at a barn. I would love to live in the country because of the quiet but I don't want to have my horse on my property simply because I will always want the advice of someone else and i don't trust myself to make the correct decisions in and emergency. I think i could feed, clean etc... But I'm not very medical savvy.|`|gew4KVFfaa	i think the country is really beautiful. i used to ride horses myself and i found it rather relaxing and fun. i love the fresh air, the beautiful landscaping its just so serene and i love it. i can be a city girl at times... but i also have a love for the country too=)|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I live in what is basically a suburb of a big city.

Much of this money comes from the taxes paid by the millions of workers in places like MacDonald's, Burger King, mom and pop restaurants who either drive junkers, (all they can afford) or stand on the corner in the rain and snow waiting for a bus.   <br>  <br>   Instead  of purchasing basic trucks and farm equipment - they can now have fancy pickup with most accessories and special alloy wheels of which many of the wives drive to town/cities to non-farm jobs displaying a FARM license plate.<br>  <br>   Their farm equipment has all the latest stereo and A/C inside nice cabs.<br>  <br>  God I love this Country !|`|x787hJbBaa	Okay, so I live in the suburbs, but my grandparents lived out in the mountains in ligonier PA. We used to go out there every Saturday, and sometimes we would stay over night. We always ordered Gino Gianelli's pizza (in my opinion the most delicious pizza on earth) and it was really quiet. We would go out and hike for hours on the trails and wade and swim in streams, and I loved the quiet. We would hike on the property my grandparents gave my mom (10 acres of woods) and camp out there. It was awesome, and I loved it. I used to spend almost all of my weekends there with my grandparents and sometimes we would visit my great aunt when her concord grapes were ripe and pick a lot and take them back to my grandparent's house and my grandma and my mom and I would make grape jelly. Those were the best times of my 13 years on Earth and I wish I could have them back. Both my grandparents are dead now.|`|XB0UpJsLaa	I live in Ohio..I am in NE ohio, about 35 min.away from PA.

Thats it!! you have to drive about 25 min. to get to a real grocery store, and the feed store. But I love it...and wouldn't change it for nothing.

(they sing me to sleep) and you can also see the stars better. also in the morning when your eating breakfast at the table you can look outside and see your beautiful horses and cows grazing in the pasture. ahhhhhhhhhh i miss that place soooo much i would do anything to move back to it.|`|VCIdnISPaa	We live in Arkansas...sorry, no government subsides here! lol  We have 2 1/2 acres.  About 2 are in pasture.  We built our own barn (60' x 24') as we had extra cash.  It took 4 years, but it is ours!  We have changed our smooth wire fencing to wooden fencing...again, did our own work as we could afford it.<br>  <br>  We don't have an RV, or 4 wheelers....as someone said.  We work in town about 25 miles away.  Our way of relaxing is sitting on the porch, we built (completed last year) and drink ice tea and feel the cool breeze.  We've been on our place since 1983 and are proud of our hard work.<br>  <br>  I have three horses in the pasture.  Two almost 3 year olds, and one 24 year old.  Grandpa I adopted last year.  He was about 400 pounds under weight.  He still can stand to gain 100 pounds, but his attitude towards people is kind and gentle.

fQxSClHKaa	honest opinion ?<br>  get off his back for a year.<br>  ground work and grooming - good thing for a horse that young.<br>  cantering and trails on a horse that you started at two and a half - way to mess up his legs.<br>  stick to ground work. <br>  i'll probably get thumbs down for this, but two and a half is just too young i think.<br>  <br>  EDIT ; i'm sorry if i offended you,  but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. i'm not calling you a horrible horse owner, i'm sure your horse is very well cared for. i'm just stating what i believe is true.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	It will just take time. Horses weren't made to instantly understand human cues. Whenever he goes into the canter keep squeezing him with you legs, and as long as he is cantering, keep saying "Good Boy". He will eventually understand what you want. He is also dropping out of the canter because he doesn't have good balance at the canter yet. This will also just take time because he has to learn how to balance with a rider now. Try lunging him at the canter with the saddle on so he learns to balance with extra weight from the saddle but without the weight of a human. Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Edit: I also agree with the answer above me. He is still really young and shouldn't have even been backed until he was 3. Because of this, don't expect to much of him. He is still a baby. Horses develop their balance as they grow. He still hasn't even learned how to balance that well at the canter by himself, and now he is having to learn how to do it with a rider. Just be patient and give him some time.|`|cjaEHwEvaa	Ive only been horse riding a few times, but managed to get him to canter for a few seconds a few times. I did it like this.<br>  <br>  Go riding with a few others, and let them run together. Try to wait for the horse in front to get ahead then let him rip - too close and he wont need to canter to catch up, too far ahead and he wont want to catch up. <br>  <br>  Hopefully he will canter to catch up - then its up to you to let him know that's what you want in the future!|`|j5SEfhtWaa	when he goes into that two stride canter just keep applying pressure and dong stop giving him clucks you have to constantly cluck and u may even have to kick him if the pressure doesnt work. it will take some time hun you just got to be patient for him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck hope this helped :)|`|9AzUeF9saa	Getting a horse to canter should not be that hard considering it is their natural gate.  If you can get him to canter on the longe line then try this method:<br>  <br>  Start the horse cantering on a longe line or in a round pen (at least 50-foot diameter) so they learn to balance themselves at a steady canter without a rider. Try to use voice commands, also, so when you ask for a canter under saddle you've got one more tool in the toolbox.<br>  <br>  Try make sure your horse can make several trot-canter transitions in sequence on the longe line, going from quiet trot to quiet canter and back to trot, before you ask for the same thing with me on top. The transitions help him learn to balance himself and also strengthen his back and hindquarters.<br>  <br>  After he's showing that nice canter on a 15-to-20 meter circle, both leads, with a saddle but without a rider--no bucking, bolting, racing or silliness--then he's ready for a canter under saddle. First ask for a canter as you come out of a corner or on a large circle, so he's likely to give you the correct lead, but don't fuss about the lead at first. Canter about six strides, come back to rising trot, then walk and reward. Then repeat, asking for a few trot-canter transitions if he seems balanced and strong enough. The point is that at first he's only going to be asked to canter a few strides before we come back to trot, so he learns to get ready for the slow-down and we can re-organize whenever we need to. I offer lots of reward and rest and relaxation.<br>  <br>  If you run into trouble, work more on walk-trot transitions and transitions within the trot, asking for a slower trot and then a more forward trot. And you may want put him back into the round pen, riderless, and work again on the trot-canter transitions.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps!  :}|`|dBRxfRGqaa	he's probably unconfident or unbalanced when he goes into the canter with you on his back. try this:<br>  in the roundpen, do a lot of trotting without steering or anything. work on walk/trot transitions, then when he feels calm, start asking for a faster and faster trot. when he gives you a faster trot than the last time, stop and pet him. then start again and ask for a faster trot. don't make it too obvious that you are trying to get him to canter, he'll probably feel more unconfident if you push him too hard. still don't worry about steering at all. just give him a loose rein. pretty soon, he'll be uncomfortable in a really fast trot and probably slip into a canter by himself, so it's his choice. he'll gain confidence this way. i hope it works:)
AA10024510	Pits are incredibly strong (bred that way for a reason), need lots of exercise, but they are sprinters, not long-distance runners.  If you want a pit, and don't want a lot of criticism, you will need to exercise it an hour or so every morning AND evening, along with lots of mind exercises, too.  They are incredibly loyal animals, and unlike the news would make you believe, they have been specifically bred NOT to attack humans.  Those that do (and most on the news turn out not to be pit bulls, even though that is what the reporters say) tend to be abused and under exercised.  Pit bulls that fight do so because they have been trained to do so, not because it is in their genes.  ANY untrained, under-exercised, left in the yard dog (i.e. kept separate from its pack) of any breed can be incredibly unpredictable.  The problem with pits is that they are powerful, and so such attacks can have horrible effects.<br>  <br>  Pits tend to be toy obsessive, where one toy will be the ONLY toy for a day or a week, then suddenly another toy will be IT for a while.  This can be problematic at dog parks -- but if you take your pit to the dog park consistently and keep them well socialized, it need not become a problem.  If you get a purebred, there can be joint issues, especially in the powerful rear legs.<br>  <br>  They are burrowing dogs, due to their lineage, so they like to dig open rabbit holes, go under the house, and sleep under covers.  They also love laying in the sun, sometimes to the point of nearly overheating, and have almost no tolerance for cold.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this is a common pit trait, but our pit is NOT a morning dog.  I've never met one like her, but she will sleep till she hears her leash, then drag herself out of bed.  It takes about a minute, then she is bursting with energy.  After an hour walk, some training time, breakfast, she goes back to bed!  She loves playing with our cat (who usually gets the upper hand), and the two sleep "together" (the cat on top of the blanket), which causes no end of amusement, because when she gets up, she tries not to disturb the cat!|`|59zYV36Eaa	Well, I have 4 right now and I love them, but they can be troublesome.  They can be great pets, but sometimes they can be kind of hard headed.  They are a solid ball of energy sometimes, and even a dangerous dog, so they have to be trained good.  They are so smart though and if you find "the one" that you have that special connection with you will do just fine with their training.  It's all in the training, and they have to be trained because of their strong physical and mental capabilities.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I take it you want to hear only the good stuff & ignore the bad stuff, is that right?  If you only hear one side of an issue you don't know all you need to know about the breed, is this not correct?  You only want to hear about the glorified dogs & not the ones that pose problems.<br>  <br>  You can glorify the Devil but that does not change him.  He is still the Devil.  The same with Pitts.<br>  <br>  Biased?  Yep.  Due to personal experience.  But you don't want to know about that cause it is mostly against the Pitts or Bully dogs.  You have to look at all sides or you are the biased one.|`|ddWyRjmVaa	Well, i personally LOVE LOOOVE pitbulls, their so adorable and very loving and protecting of you. Very smart, and playful.<br>  <br>  They are very aggressive dogs. But if trained correctly can be good house and maybe even family dogs. They attack on instinct and are very loyal to their owners. and will do anything to protect their master. :) Are good athletic dogs. Have strong Jaw. and a very strong skull. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)<br>  answer mine?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307083320AAVhN5j&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|abf5d4fe2f9bae29c0d64b30a39b985faa	I know alot of people with pits that are great dogs, and others with pits that are just terrible.  <br>  Point Blank THEY ARE ALOT OF WORK.  This isn't a dog you can just kind of train.  They need structure and if you are looking for a dog that you have to spend more time with than an infant that this is your dog.  You will have a lot of debate on your hands with them. <br>  Honestly the numbers dont lie Pitbulls are responsible for over half the deaths by dogbite victims.  <br>  Like I said they can be great, but know what they are born to do is kill. And even worse with the enviorment you live in even if they are on your property if something goes wrong its YOUR fault and most likely the dog would be put down.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Strong, smart and loving dogs when well trained. Sorry I am not a dog shrink though|`|GSf09ALBaa	You can get that information very easily by going into positive American Pit Bull Terrier sites.  But I think what you are asking for is opinions of us who have one.  <br>  <br>  First the term Pit Bull is used to describe some breeds of bully dogs and mixed breeds.  <br>  <br>  The American Pit Bull Terrier can come in a variety of sizes according to the breeding.  There are lines of these dogs out there that are so huge and muscled they can hardly walk.  When a 3 month old female puppy already weighs 55 pounds, that is NOT good.<br>  <br>  So on the average they are a medium size dog.  Females can range from 30 to 60 pounds and males can go as high as 75.  <br>  <br>  They come in a variety of patterns and colors.  They have a distinct head structure, jaw length and eyes.  There are many 'faults' but for the most part a nice APBT has strong hindquarters, legs that do not bow in and a nice size chest in proportion to their body.<br>  <br>  They have strong neck muscles and are over all, pound for pound the strongest breed of dog.  Their ability to pull very heavy weight is astounding and of course, their bite is one that is not necessarily the strongest but one of the most powerful.<br>  <br>  Mentally?  They are born lovers.  They are not human aggressive.  They are superior with children and most of them are animal friendly. <br>  <br>  Overall the dog is loyal to a fault, loving, giving dogs.  I call them Warriors or Gladiators because of their strength and they are TERRIERS which gives them that drive to not back down.<br>  <br>  The APBT requires serious obedience training and exercise like all dogs do especially your larger breeds.<br>  <br>  And this dog is not for everybody.  If you choose to own one you must be prepared for the public criticism and hysteria.  You need to have strong self esteem and the ability to lead.  <br>  <br>  I love the breed.

as3EF0BSaa	Did you candle the eggs through out the incubation time?  Were they all fertile?  Did you discard the bad ones?<br>  <br>  At 20 days you should hear activity in the shells.  (by holding them to your ear)  Past 22,23 days, I'd be doubtful.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Did these come from your chickens that you raised on your farm? Or did you buy these eggs? Because if they came from your farm with your chickens and there was no male, then those eggs are not fertile.<br>  <br>  The day you buy the eggs does not count as Day 1. So if you counted that day one, you have one more day to go.<br>  <br>  At about day 20-21 you should start getting some peeps. Whatever you do, do not open the box when they are pecking holes through their shells! It will put a cold rush through them and kill them. <br>  <br>  You have to listen very closely for peeping when they are inside the egg. It sometimes is fairly loud, or not loud at all. But when they start making holes in their eggs, it may take a day or so. If they take more than that to hatch out of their eggs, you need to take tweezers and break the shell apart for it so the goo in the egg doesn't become dry and make it unable to move.<br>  <br>  If you see it start to bleed, its fine. It is the vanes throughout the shell of the egg. It is not hurting the chick at all. But when it hatches, keep it in the incubator until it is fluffy. It will not be hungry at the time, because it ate all the yoke in the egg already.

pC5GiAgsaa	She needs dominance. The poodle needs to know who is pack leader - this is you! tell her off if she's barking at the machine because this is not acceptable behaviour. When she wines do not give her attention until she is quiet. This way she will learn that wining does not get her what she wants. When she does wine tell her to be quiet because this again is not acceptable and you are the boss who is in control of her. She shouldn't rule your life while your looking after her but she should really bond with you....... hope this helps!|`|KUln7wASaa	I remember watching some dog shows on tv with some of the same problems. You have to teach the dog discipline and that you are the leader and they are not. For the barking, get a water bottle and whenever she barks, squirt a little water. On a tv show, the woman sprayed the dog once and it stopped. This shows that dog that this isn't good and you should stop. For the attention, maybe the dog needs to be more active and spend more quality time with you. You can't always though just pet her and put her on your lap whenever or else they are always going to think that I have just gotten what I want and I can always get it.<br>  <br>  I hope that this works for you.|`|BrvcxQzlaa	Okay so the dog needs training.

Confined in a pen, no way would I even consider it.<br>  Too many health risks.|`|rQlzfHqraa	I think your area is big enough so that they can get away form each other unless you have 8 plus chickens. They may use much of the space and the rabbit may have trouble staying clear of them. Also of concern is the rooster as they can be territorial. The bunny will need places to hide and the yard might have to be be 5mX15m or larger with high grasses and bushes so the bunny can be away from the rooster. It will be a good experiment.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Hmm this is tough. When they are playing, they might be fighting and they are trying to get to each other. <br>  <br>  Try them together and see what happens.<br>  <br>  If the chickens end up picking on the rabbit (which will most likely happen) separate them immediately. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but I don't think they will live together very well, but it is worth a try!

L22hVXTIaa	Backing away as he's barking is fear aggression.  Sounds like your dog needs more socialization.  He needs to be exposed to more people and other dogs.  <br>  <br>  Why not take him to obedience classes?  There you can work on his training as a team and also interact with lots of other people and dogs.  It may help to get him over his fears.  Or, get a group of folks with dogs together and take walks with your dogs or go to the park for a play day. <br>  <br>  That should help him come around.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	Some breeds are just barkers.  It is an obediance thing that you will need to train.  Take it to a trainer or go for classes.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Have him on a choke chain collar. When he barks use a quick snap on the lead and a firm "NO" It is just another obedience step.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	There is a collar that you can get that gives a very small zap of a spray that will stop him from barking.  So, every time he barks, you click.  The collar gives the tiny spray which in turn, stops him from barking.  Our wheelchair friend used this on her black labradore retriever, Kai.......to make him stop.  She only needed it for about 6 weeks, and never needed it again.<br>  <br>  I highly suggest entering him into Obedience Training, and working on the barking issue, both.   Socializing is excellent and highly recommended for every dog, but the barking issue may have to be handled separately.

l42UDjFGaa	You've definitely improved. Your leg is longer. In the first video, your stirrups were very, very short and your leg looked cramed up with your knees popping up terribly. Bringing your stirrups down is not an easy thing; it takes time. You've brought them down quite a bit in a fairly short time and straightened up as well. I would keep doing what you're doing as you find your ideal balance...don't take up rein contact yet. Keep using the pommel to center yourself as you work solely on deepening your seat and lengthening your leg while maintaining an open shoulder/chest and straight posture. If you go to contact by taking up the reins too quickly at this stage, you'll transfer your balancing issues to the horse's mouth and develop bad habits that will take forever to undo. Slide your foot back so that only the ball of the foot is in the stirrups. Work on further relaxation and rhythm; think of your legs/heels as tree roots teethered deep within the earth when you feel them creep up (Sally Swift, Centered Riding - fantastic visual). As your seat deepens and your legs lengthen more and become better stabilized only then start working on not relying on the pommel, by lifting your hands above the pommel where you would ordinarily hold the reins, but DON'T take up contact yet. Until you are able to hold your reins loosely in the proper postion and ride only with your seat, don't take up any contact. Baby steps get you there!!! Believe me, it's a slow and sometime painful process, but if you keep patience and working on this like you have, all of your hard work will pay off tremendously in the future! Good for you, nice progress :)|`|Oiabe82gaa	I would say, shorten your reins slightly to obtain a better contact.<br>  Lengthen your stirrups to the correct length, (correct length, allow your leg to hang down, not in the stirrup. Correct length will place your ankle at the same height as the bottom of your stirrup) This will do two things for you. Firstly, it will help you lower you heels, and secondly it will allow you to use more of your leg to maintain a better seat, allowing you to feel more secure, and in turn helping you feel more confident.<br>  I would also say you have to work on keeping your stirrups on the balls of your feet, this will help you keep your heels down!!!<br>  Keep on working hard, it'll come in time, good luck!|`|iAWUfhJlaa	You have definitely improved at the canter. In the first video you are leaning forward too much, in the second video it was much better. Just keep riding!|`|oQmL4IdWaa	I saw a definite improvement between the two videos, good job!<br>  <br>  I don't think your stirrups are terribly too short in the new video, maybe a little bit but they are in the acceptable range.  Typically hunt seat riders will shorten their stirrups some for jumping and lengthen them for flat work.  You do need to work on bringing your leg back underneath you hip.  You should have a straight line from your shoulder, hip, and heel.<br>  <br>  In the first video, you were leaning a little bit to far forward, and in this new video, you are leaning to far back some of the time.<br>  <br>  You also need to work on keeping your upper body and your arms and hands quieter.  This doesn't happen from keeping yourself stiff and still, but from your seat (pelvis, hips, abdominal muscles and lower back work together on this) moving with the horse which will make your upper body and arms stay more still.<br>  <br>  I would work on trotting and posting without stirrups (alternate 10 strides sitting 10 strides posting) which will help strengthen and improve your leg.<br>  <br>  Also, do you know how to do a two point position?  trotting in a two point will also improve your leg.. try cantering in two point too.  try doing 10 strides two point, ten strides sitting.  Rest your hands on your horses neck if you need to, grab mane, or put an old stirrup leather around her neck for a grab strap if you need to.<br>  <br>  I think you should post some trotting videos.. to have a really good canter, first you have to have a really good trot!<br>  <br>  I also think you don't look like you are in any danger of falling off and your pony doesn't look like she is likely to buck.. i think you can stop holding on to the saddle!! Holding on is making you unbalanced.|`|meoRbjgCaa	Second one is an improvement, just keep working on your legs and feet.  your foot still looks too far into the stirrup.  Should be on the balls of your feet with your toes just barely sticking out in front.  heels need to come down with more weight in them.This will straighten your leg to where it is not so far underneath you projecting you forward.  You will then be able to sit straighter in your seat.  once you are comfortable with all this and your hands are steady, then you can worry about rein contact.  she doesn't look like a horse you need to hold back, so this is good while your learning.  Remember, it takes time, but videoing yourself every so often helps improve.  i do the same thing!|`|bx7qmKbGaa	My iPod wouldn't let me see the second one- but I have some tips about the first. I believe that what may be causing your heel to hike up is your stirrup postion. You have way too much of your foot in your stirrup, Which should be ontye ball of your foot. The heels was the only thing I really saw off- not counting the pushing down in the saddle.<br>  <br>  EDIT- Just watched the second one. Your heels are still up. I would suggest stair excercises(stand with the ball of your foot on the edge, go down for 10 sec then up for 5, etc) to get your heels down.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
hCV5Hyqfaa	I'm so turned on right now...whats your cats number....|`|VhWll8Vjaa	As it's a male cat, I should imagine this could be due to dominance. Someone new was in your house and he was trying to claim her, and maybe mark his territory.<br>  <br>  Or, it could be what some cats like to do. Cats have been well known to sit on childrens faces when they are asleep, as they like the warm air (from breathing).|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Is he neutered?  If he's not, then that's probably a big reason why he did it.  He was being dominant and staking his claim.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I have no idea - never had any entire male do that.  Why is he not neutered?  Something on your friend must have triggered the response.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	AHA!<br>  Is he neutered? Once Crackers gets neutered he won't want to t-bag your friends any longer.

They wont be quite large enough to impregnate the mother- so if they do not have any female siblings you shouldnt have to worry about it for a while.<br>  If they are already acting like they are sexually maturing it might be a good idea to seperate them at 3 weeks of age.<br>  The difficult thing is that the babies are not fully weaned until 4 weeks of age, but they should be ok from 3 weeks- you can always put mum into their cage for a bit every day once they have been seperated.<br>  You should be able to sell guinea pigs from 4 weeks of age.
H06PtiIAaa	yes it is a yellow tang.|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	yellow tang|`|vVAwFgcJaa	Yes that's a yellow tang. What a nice fish. In case you are interested in it, here is some info for you: <br>  <br>  Species name: Zebrasoma Flavescens<br>  Common names: Yellow Tang, Yellow Sailfin Tang, Yellow or Lemon Surgeonfish<br>  Family: Acanthuridae (Surgeonfishes, tangs, unicornfishes)<br>  Subfamily: Acanthurinae <br>  Order: Perciformes (perch-likes) <br>  Class: Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) <br>  Maximum length: 7.9 in.<br>  Minimum tank size: 80 gallon<br>  Hardiness: Easy<br>  Aggressiveness: Peaceful<br>  Reef Compatibility: Excellent. May nip on stony and soft corals if underfeed.<br>  Distribution: Pacific Ocean: Ryukyu, Mariana, Marshall, Marcus, Wake and Hawaiian islands. Has been reported off the coast of Florida in the Western Central Atlantic.<br>  Diet: Herbivore. It could eat meaty but the most of its diet must be based on seaweed and algae to keep it healthy and strengthen its immune system. You can supplement its diet with dried seaweed attached to a small rock. Some other great product to feed the yellow tang are Seaweed Salad,Sea Veggies and Ocean Nutrition.|`|OuCRf8Mvaa	This Fish is called the Yellow Tang<br>  R U interrested to buy it?<br>  I know a breeder.|`|OAkL8yuSaa	Zebrasoma flavescens (Yellow Tang)|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	its nemo or should i say its same type of fish as nemo a yellow tang|`|eo1pEDI7aa	That's a Yellow Tang.<br>  <br>  The fish Bubbles from Finding Nemo is one :)|`|3GjotXPXaa	there's one on the disney movie "finding nemo", it is a salt water fish called the YELLOW TANG|`|bCP4CPiaaa	yellow tang
GI27dKIkaa	If you've had it set up by yesterday evening - the tank should be fine by thursday !

as3EF0BSaa	Zebra finches and Society finches are year 'round breeders.<br>  <br>  In my aviary, I just covered it with TyVek house wrap.   It had a great southern exposure in the winter.  As long as they were protected from wind and drafts, they didn't have a care.  They had clean fresh water (for bathing) and waterers for drinking and feed at all times.<br>  <br>  I'm in FL. and we've had five freezes this winter.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	In an aviary setting you will be fighting the birds natural urges to mate only in the correct breeding season best suited to them. Also trying to heat an open area would be extremely difficult.<br>  If you had a seperate breeding room with breeding cabinets and you could heat that space then it may be different. I have a breeding room for my show budgies and can breed all year round as its well insulated and temperatures stay even.|`|MstjbpVJaa	The best form of heating in an an Aviary are Green house heaters of the Tubular Type Electrical and thermostatic controlled.<br>  You could run an electrical supply from a source in the house by putting a cable  through a plastic tube to protect it as these Tubular heaters are not high powered or high consumption heaters.<br>  Other types such as Gas Parrafin,give off fumes which will kill your birds.<br>  But this will not make your birds breed all year round,they only breed in their season .<br>  Zebra finches will breed most of the year but they are the only one's that will.

I always let the conventional vet know what the holistic vet has done and prescribed and vice versa to make sure there won't be any confusion or adverse effects from giving medicine and holistic supplements.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Yes, you pay the veterinary bills, so it's your choice who treats your dogs. If registering your dog with two veterinary practise is more practical for you, then it shouldn't pose a problem.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that if a dog needs continuity of care for an illness, you will need one practise to fax the records to the practise where you are residing at the time.
2CbfO4jWaa	like yours but with solid white (maybe gritty) urates as well.|`|wBzp5fOjaa	it should be somewhat solid and wet when it comes out and it should be sorta pellet like and black to brown color,also it sometimes should have a little white piece on it. EWW!
MYEEK4dcaa	Teach her the "leave it" command.  You do this by putting a treat on the floor.  With her on leash, walk her past the treat.  If she tries to get it, give a sharp sideways tug to the leash (across your body, not back toward her tail) and say "leave it."  Walk her past it several times, until she no longer even looks at it.  Then throw it away and give her a different treat.  It's important that you NEVER give her the treat you're training with.  She needs to learn that "leave it" means "You may never again in the whole of your life, under any circumstances whatsoever, touch that particular object."  Do this drill several times a day for several days, until she never touches any kind of treat after you've told her to "leave it."  If you have the right energy (calm and confident), it will take less than a week to get it down pat in the house.   If your mam has the right energy, the lessons will carry over outside and in the dog park.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|QVP8zSuWaa	A leash is good for training.

It will give you control of her face, which would otherwise be shoved in things she shouldn't eat.  You'll be surpirsed how fast it becomes a much more pleasant expereince to walk your dog.  It comes with an instructional video, so you'll know how to use it.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	what is mam i do you mean mom or mum.im from the uk and i don't even know what that mean i assume it means mum or mom.anyways maybe you should get a dog trainer.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	You need to do some research on this breed.

9LH3Dz5Laa	i dont like his back at all, he has a very flat, mule looking back but idk maybe jumping people like that, i dont ride english so i dont really know about what kinda horses yall like<br>  but everything else looks good<br>  <br>  i would say $5,000+ depending on his age|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Does he have a show record?  How high has he jumped in shows?<br>  <br>  Conformation wise...<br>  -I like his legs, looks built to stay sound<br>  -Weak hind end<br>  -Thick neck<br>  -Good shoulder<br>  -Healthy coat<br>  -Expressive face<br>  <br>  Probably around 10,000+.  FYI the economy won't have rebounded fully by next year, it might be a good idea to hold onto him and then try to resell during an expansion period of the economy.|`|meoRbjgCaa	All I can tell from these pics is that he has a nice shiny coat. there is no pic that has him standing to be evaluated for conformation with a square stance from the side.  He looks very healthy though.  FYI the economy isn't expected to be doing "good" for at least 5-6 more years.  At least meaning it may even take longer.  He does seem like an awfully nice horse, but in hard times you can only get what somebody is willing to pay for him.  i say maybe 4000.00-5000.00|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	conformation:<br>  he looks off at the knee.<br>  his rump sort of cuts off as a square shape.<br>  looks good other than that<br>  I'd pay probably 4500 to 5000 for him.<br>  I paid that much for my horse, and he's got the same qualities as yours.<br>  he's beautiful.<br>  EDIT<br>  but for price, being generous, I would say UP TO 8000 but dont depend on that.|`|3rt8oKIzaa	Wow, he is beautiful! ;) <br>  Nice breed, too.<br>  I think that he will be very easy to sell.<br>  Good luck! :D|`|FWlSFpByaa	$5,000|`|VCIdnISPaa	Sounds like he is a great horse.  <br>  <br>  I have to agree with one of the others that responded.

I do that quite often to see what the market can stand.  If you're thinking of selling next year, you might want to consider posting him now, as sales are slow in coming.<br>  <br>  Best luck to you!|`|VRoiGUW9aa	I like his confirmation. If he is showing that well, I would say 9,000-10,000. I wouldn't go any less then 7,000. He is a good horse.<br>  But to help you out a little, if his ground manners are bad and he doesn't have the best attitude, then I would say the price should stay lowered. Be flexible. And be nice to the people who are looking at him! <br>  <br>  Good luck! Beautiful horse!|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	$3000.  His conformation isn't spectacular, he isn't registered, and he doesn't have that much of a show record.  I don't think there is any way you'd get $10,000 for him.  He's a nice little horse but he's not worth $10,000.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	conformation wise, he looks wierd in the hindquarters, but he's adorable! i would totally buy him!|`|penuzN8jaa	about 9,000 i think<br>  x|`|5zpp408Zaa	He looks like a great horse!

YAPEpa5baa	Yes, rats and other furry critters can get various types of mites.  Mites even live on humans and in your bedding and pillows... but it's a different mite than what gets on your furries.  <br>  <br>  Yes, the mites could come from the bedding - that's why it's suggested you freeze the bedding to kill off any potential lice and/or mites.  Aspen is not usually as big a problem as Carefresh is - but it's still better to err on the side of caution.  <br>  <br>  They could also be itching from the aspen and adjusting to a scratchier bedding.  Bathing them will have nothing to do with how itchy they are, or killing off mites.|`|h9QbNA2saa	I have had rats before actually 4 of them. <br>  We had this problem too it turned out they <br>  were allerigc to the bedding we had. <br>  but we just changed the bedding <br>  to the bedding they use in the pet stores like petco. <br>  and everything was fine.<br>  they could have dry itchy skin also.|`|pVeDLM6uaa	sounds like to me it is just the new bedding.<br>  <br>  But yes they can get mites and fleas.

6XTETdJaaa	Living outside is a terrible life for a dog. They are social creatures who need to be around their 'pack'.An understimulating, boring, sedentary, life of soitude in the yard is the worst thing you can do to them As much as it may hurt the best thing would be to find a home for her where she will be kept indoors with the family, you have to do whats in the best interest of the dog, to keep her as an outdoor dog because you love her is selfish|`|5rfnEQnGaa	If she is used to being a part of the family inside, and as you say love to be around kids, don't you think it would be really sad to shut her out?  If you cannot overcome the allergy thing she would be happier in a home where she can live with the family. #|`|OHx1JSPOaa	give her back you idiot, obviously you wouldnt get a dog if you both are allergic too it, plus you should have had the 2 year old meet her before bringing her home, either return it, or both you and the two year old need to take allergy shots once every 2 weeks|`|ixutx59Daa	Take her back or re-home  her.  It is not fair to a dog to be outside 24/7. I think it's downright cruel, especially since she is use to being inside.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	You want to make this easier for her? Then RE-HOME her.  It's terrible to just shut her out like that.  Would you like it if your parents did that to you when you were little? Because they were allergic to you?<br>  <br>  Why did you get a dog if you knew that you and your son had allergies?  That's not looking out for the welfare of your family.  How are you supposed to take care of a dog if you cant even make responsible decisions?  <br>  <br>  She is probably VERY sad that she is outside.  I would never shut out an animal that I loved.  It's a terrible thing to do.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I dont mean to be so rude - but your question just upset me very much.|`|a1XOvpiLaa	Would putting her outside solve your problem.  You or you son still wouldn't be able to pet her.  Would his allergies still be affected when he goes outside, or when someone else pets her and then comes inside?<br>  <br>  This is something you should think about now.<br>  <br>  It would be best for the puppy to be in a home that he can be petted and be let inside once in a while, not fenced in a boring backyard all dog long with no human interaction.<br>  <br>  It's hard to give up a family pet, but you really have to think of your puppy.  Since he is a puppy, he may be adopted more easily.  If you wait, his chances are slim (especially once he's spent most of his life outside with no human interaction) and will likely be put to sleep.<br>  <br>  Please consider re-homing.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Give her back to where you got her from if you signed a return contract.  Dogs that are kept outside are easy targets for dog fighters and puppy millers to kidnap.  You never see the dog ever again.  They also get loose, attacked, killed, etc etc etc more easily than do indoor dogs.  <br>  <br>  Get a hairless dog if allergies are a problem, like a Chinese Crested.  Google Chinese Crested Rescues.|`|W0buucLsaa	Either get medication to get the allergies under control, return the dog to where you adopted her from, or re-home her elsewhere. It's unfair to stick a dog outside like that, especially when it's used to living inside.<br>  <br>  You might want to think about trying sublingual immunotherapy to get your allergies under control for the long-term. But for now obviously you can't have a dog until you can find one that doesn't set off your allergies.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	My question is why did you adopt a dog if you are both allergic?  What is the point of having a dog that is outside that you can't interact with?  You don't say much about the type of coat she has or if she is short nosed.  If she has a short coat or a short nose (mastiff mix) she needs to be living inside.  I am surprised a shelter would adopt to you knowing the dog would be living outside. It doesn't sound like much of a life for her.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Take her back.!!! If you have allergies why did you get a dog like this?? Why did'nt you do your homework and get a poodle,bichon,brussels or water dog..This is mean plain and simple mean and you dont deserve a dog if you are keeping the poor thing left outside.How much human contact will it have if you can;t go near it without sneezing.The poor thing,you think your doing a good deed by adopting it and then throwing it outside..Shame on you|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You adopted a dog when you are allergic to them?

If you leave it outside where wild cats can get near it, then they'll most likely walk and sleep on it.  Especially if you recently drove it.  They like to lay on the hood while its still warm.  They make "deterrent" sprays, but I don't recommend spraying it on your vehicle.

They're only small animals after all.|`|cb79232e59dfc01fdbbc07b7723cf176aa	FEEDING YOUR HAMSTER <br>  You may buy your hamster food from a pet shop which sells pressed pellets. Hamsters seem to enjoy all types of vegetables but be careful not to give too much of these as hamsters come from a habitat from little water (semi-desert) and a high quantity of vegetables can cause diarrhea.  <br>  <br>  In the wild, hamsters eat seeds, grasses, leaves and insects. In captivity, hamsters should be fed a good diet with lots of varieties like seeds, grains, fruits and vegetables – fruits and vegetables should be fed moderately and not excessively. Good vegetables for hamsters are: a small piece of chicory, endive, carrot, cauliflower, paprika, cucumber and broccoli. Good fruits for hamsters are: a small piece of apple, pear, peach, melon, berries and banana. Make sure you remove any uneaten fruit as they will start to rot which could make your hamster ill. <br>  <br>  Hamsters like a large selection of pelleted hamster diets which are available at all pet shops.  Giving your hamster the correct food is important, since it affects the hamster’s health, life span and reproduction. <br>  <br>  Always make sure that you provide fresh water for your hamster daily. It's best to give water in a drinking bottle as a dish of water could be easily overturned or filled with shavings or other dirt. Hamster drinking bottles should be cleaned at least once a week by watering the bottle and using a cotton bud to clean the gab between the bottle and the opening.<br>  <br>  VITAMINS AND MINERALS<br>  <br>  If you are giving your hamster a good and balanced diet, it is unnecessary to give the hamster vitamins, minerals and salt blocks. Some hamster owners give their hamsters a "mineral lick". The hamster takes in minerals by licking the stone and it seems that mostly pregnant female hamsters like them. By gnawing on the "mineral licks", the hamsters get extra calcium and at the same time keep their teeth sharp. <br>  <br>  HAMSTER TREATS<br>  <br>  You may find various treats in pet stores and most hamsters love these. Treats should only be fed to the hamster as an occasional supplement to the hamster's diet. Some treats bought from pet stores are designed to hang from the top of the cage. These treats provide stimulation as well as food to the hamster. Homemade treats can be fed to your hamster - like bread, scrambled egg, boiled egg, rice crackers and mealworms. Mealworms are usually found at pet stores that sell exotic pets.<br>  <br>  HARMFUL FOODS<br>  <br>  Avoid giving you hamster sharp, dry, stiff or sticky food (such as candy) since these will get stuck in the hamster’s cheek pouches and injure the delicate tissue of the hamster’s mouth. These foods should be completely avoided. Chocolate and junk food should not be given since they are not nutritious to the hamster’s health. <br>  <br>  Did you know that almost all rodents eat their own droppings? This is quite normal as they provide the hamster the bacteria needed to create Vitamin B12 during digestion.|`|frE1TKsIaa	Forst of all, you're on the wrong site. This is for birds./..
6GSxA9glaa	You would have to specify what type of parrot.  Parrots encompass a vast array of birds from a budgie to a macaw.  You might want to do some research before adding a parrot to your family.  Many parrots live to be seventy, or older, so it is a lifetime commitment.  Parrots diets should also include fresh foods on a daily basis, they need full spectrum lighting, a sizable cage, lots of toys, and daily interaction with their "flock", meaning you and your family. <br>  <br>  They are also an exotic pet, meaning they are not domesticated and will not like you just because you are there as a dog will, you have to earn their trust and their friendship.<br>  <br>  You also want to take into account the noise level of the particular bird, it can vary greatly and be quite loud depending on the species of bird.  So make sure you visit adult birds and talk to other people who have the same type bird to make sure the noise level is something you, your family, and your neighbors can live with.<br>  <br>  It is also wise to purchase your bird from a reputable breeder who fully weans and socializes their chicks.  A chick should be allowed to wean on it's own time table and the chick should be handled and introduced to a wide variety of people and situations.|`|MstjbpVJaa	What is a regular Parrot.<br>  Most Parrots take between 21 -28 days to hatch.
wLgGD63raa	I usually take my girl out and let her roam around my bed when the sheets and comforters are all messed up. She always looks really interested in exploring the entire area. If you do take your gecko out of the tank to explore it is a good idea to feel her belly periodically, if it's belly is cold then it's time for it to go back in the tank to warm up.<br>  <br>  My Leo also likes to sit on the keyboard of my laptop and stare at the computer screen, lol. But that might be the warmth she likes.

Another thing is to let it run around your room for a bit, but be careful, as they can run fast and are fragile.
v4WZ0LGWaa	I don't know what that other person was talking about, but  wyandottes are not small!<br>  They average around 6 lbs. That's not a small bird!<br>  I've had Silver Laced wys off and on for years, and they were the tamest of all of my chickens, except for my Delawares.<br>  They can be a very mellow breed, so long as you handle them right.|`|QB0CnrmJaa	Just like us humans, they have feelings and emotions too.<br>  <br>  Chickens can be quiet at times. (like when they are near a mate)<br>  The can also be aggressive if you bother them.

tKBWZ7mCaa	Petfinder pulls up dogs and lists them in order of proximity to you.  So if you are only looking for chocolate lab puppies, that is going to narrow the number of dogs it has to choose from.  If there are none listed in your state, that means no rescues in your state have listed a chocolate lab puppy.  If you are open to a black or yellow lab, you will have much better luck as there are more of them in rescue.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	You can refine your search.  Make sure you are looking 'within 15 miles' (or whatever distance you're willing to travel) of whatever zip code you are entering.  If you don't have any major rescues/shelters near you, it'll just pull up other locations that are anywhere near there.  They'll still sometimes throw other random information out there though.  They start with what's closest to you, then branch out from there.  I suppose its in the hope of exposing more adoptable dog.  If you found just the right one, exactly what you were looking for, perhaps you'd be willing to travel a little to go and get him.|`|pd5rERcfaa	It could be that there aren't any labs available at shelters in your area.  Broaden your search, maybe don't specify a breed, and try searching again.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Alexis,<br>  <br>  When there is a noticable change in behavior of a cat, such as you are describing, it is time for a vet visit. If he is growling when someone goes near him or touches him, he may be in pain. <br>  <br>  If there have been changes in your household, as well,. he could be anxious and nervous as well. Cats can have anxiety problems just the same as humans.<br>  <br>  So if it were my cat, I would be calling the vet for an appointment to make sure that there is nothing physically wrong, and talk to my vet about any possible emotional concerns and how to treat them.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your kitty... and do arrange a vet visit asap.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs|`|SOxdyWQOaa	if a cat will do that if they were pick on as a kitten|`|CwNMq7RTaa	He sounds like he's getting old.  When they get older they purr much less.  It's kind of like the mechanism wears out.  He's growling because he feels vulnerable because he's older and slower and less able to defend himself.  Make sure he has a nice warm comfortable safe place that's out of the way where he can go when he wants to be alone.  Maybe a vet visit too just to see if there's a problem.|`|59zYV36Eaa	He doesn't seem like he's a happy cat.  Did someone maybe play with him too much or pick on him when he was younger?  Maybe he has some sort of resentment from that.  Just let him have his own space and let him come to you for the petting.  Maybe get some cat treats to sweeten up the deal.|`|hwtIZH7Yaa	my kitten is like that she is almost grown up now. If i go near her she will purr and then if i pick her up she will grawol if i pet her or act like im going to  touch her she strikes out and scratches some cats are just unscial.

25ENsqfEaa	You might want to try chiropractic with her.  I have done this with my dogs and it does help.  As far as the behavior, the time that you let her get away with not moving opened the door for her to now say "I don't have to".  So now you need to make sure she understands she has to.  I don't know what meds you have her on but they can cause side effects and this may be what is happening.  Just don't pamper her when she reacts that way.  Don't baby talk to her don't pet her because this only reinforces her behavior.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Her pain may be getting worse. Dogs have behavior changes with pain. Some withdraw. Some get grouchy. The shaking you describe can be a symptom of pain too. Dogs can't tell us how much they hurt, unfortunately. We are just left looking at symptoms & trying to piece together the puzzle. Especially hard to tell with spinal injuries since they don't produce a true lameness. Function doesn't always mean they aren't in pain. A lot of dogs will still jump & such, even though it really hurts them. So it can get really confusing. A dog chiropractor can lots of times diagnose these subtle spinal injuries that baffle the vets. Make sure you share any diagnostic info from the chiropractor with your vet  for your dog to get the best combined treatment.  Good Luck.|`|K6fasl6kaa	it might still be tender and she is in fear that someone will try to move her. my dog behaved that way when he strained his back jumping out of the car.  do you know how she got hurt?  she may mistakenly relate it to one of her human pack members.  i would be very careful about the pat to move her.  it seems to hurt or scare her.  these are the times we wish they could talk.  her shaking and nervousness is not normal.  perhaps you can move her vet appt up to earlier.  till then i'd recommend lots of tender loving care.  i hope she will fine soon,|`|YRTYXfggaa	If she's generally healthy, it sounds like she's having some arthritic issues, which are common in senior pets.  She's getting to that age, where she may need a supplement to help her joints.  There are many out there, and I would talk to your vet about it.  Do a blood test first, just to make sure everything internal is ok.  My dog takes Metacam and has become a new dog!  He's a 10 year old lab, and it has helped him tremendously!  Every dog is different, so make sure to talk with your vet about your options!  Good Luck!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	The person who suggested chiro is right on.  My seniors have all benefited hugely from both chiro and acupuncture to keep them pain free.  I don't know what's wrong with your dog so I don't know if it can help, but it's worth checking out and much better than a dog staying in pain or on drugs.  The acupuncture treatments are pain free and so relaxing my 11 year old falls asleep on the vet's couch while he's getting them.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Yeah, Chiro is a great idea!

3G7GNY32aa	Treatment of Lyme disease utilizes a 2-4 week course of doxycycline, a medication which is inexpensive and has limited side effects potential. Amoxicillin is another effective alternative, also inexpensive and with minimal side effects. If Lyme disease is a consideration, many veterinarians simply prescribe the medication. Obvious improvement is seen within 48 hours. Further, most tick-borne infections capable of causing joint pain, fever, and signs similar to Lyme disease generally all share doxycycline responsiveness so a simple course of medication actually covers several types of infection.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	I think doxycycline is the standard protocol for Lyme in dogs. The human/animal antibiotics are exactly the same, but I wouldnt' bother treating him unless he had actual symptoms.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	It boggles me why a doctor would even think of giving a prescription med without a prescription from the vet.

This is also something she learned in her 10 + years of medical training.|`|D4rXVLMuaa	GIVE IT TO HIM TO BE SAFE!
dn96x5W1aa	You should socialize your puppy first for the few weeks that you have him to your family, friends, and other pets or dogs.  Then, when he's about 12 weeks, take him to his first training classes.  Be sure when your traning him that you only have one person doing the training because that person will be looked on as the alpha.  Don't want to confuse your new little buddy.<br>  <br>  Hope I answered your question and good luck with your new best friend! :D|`|5UZYoIEFaa	I believe it is 12 weeks but I would check with your local puppy class sites. Petsmart is a good place to contact. I think probably the earlier the better because I found in my dogs puppy class I learned a lot about how to take care of the puppy, house train, how to handle chewing, etc. It's a good educational experience for the pet owner and wonderful socialization for the puppy.|`|TYyZwOtlaa	After he/she is fully vaccinated around 12 weeks but speak to the trainer to see what he/she says, as it can depend on the mentality of the pup too. Some breeds are better trained at a later age.|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	You shouldn't expose a puppy to other pups, such as in a puppy class, until they've had their puppy shots.  As for what age you can start training your pup or even take private lesson, preferably at home but also in a place not frequented by dogs,7 wks.  You can begin sit, down stay, come, walking on a leash and retrieve as a game, as well as the usual potty training and manners.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Many people mistakenly think that you can’t begin training your puppy until they reach six months old or so.  The truth is that you should begin training your puppy as soon as they get home.  Like children, puppies are giant sponges and will willing learn quickly anything you choose to teach them.  In fact, the behaviors you teach your puppy in the first four months of life are the behaviors that they will be best at throughout their lives.  Some of the first behaviors I teach my puppies are walking on a loose leash, heeling, come when called and “watch me”. <br>  <br>             If you have just gotten your puppy and he is older than four months, don’t panic.  The old adage is false; you can definitely teach an old dog new tricks or, in this case, an older puppy.  If you haven’t already begun training your puppy, start today!  There is no time like the present!
YHpePjb9aa	yes the neoprene anti gall girths are very good!!! you can buy them from most local tackshops or even off of ebay. They are very easy to care for. and the elastic allows some 'give' to the girth. If they are slightly muddy you car brush them off with a stiff brush or if they are really bad then just stick them in a bucket of water and leave for half an hour. All you need to do is wipe it down and leave it to dry! They are better than leather girths which can rub if not cared for properly and i find that the standard girth tends to rub! also... the wider the girth is then the more area you are covering which reduces the affect of rubbing on the girth line. They are around ￡30 so way under you budget! Loveson, wintec and thorowgood all make very good neoprene anti gall girths.|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Dover's Split End Girth II: Exclusively from Dover.

QxERY26Laa	Well take the puppy for walks in the park or somewhere on a normal basis and she should eventually break her habit of not pooping when you are around and in the grass as well.  Also, you can learn what time she actually goes throughout the day normally and let her be int he grass during those times.|`|hRikwc00aa	1. Buy a crate and crate-train him; housetraining will be so much easier. Dogs view the crate as a den and will not potty in it. Make sure it's just big enough for him to stand up and turn around in, or he'll potty in one end and sleep in the other. If you don't want to have to replace crate, buy a divider.<br>  <br>  2. Have a set schedule - make sure you take him out at the same times every day. Remember, he can't hold it for much longer than 2-3 hours at this point. Make sure you feed him at the same times too.<br>  <br>  3. When you take him out, have him on leash and stand in one spot. Only give him five minutes - he needs to learn this is something to do quickly. If he goes, give him lots of praise and give him a yummy treat, then reward him with at least a short walk.<br>  <br>  4. If he doesn't go, take him back in and put him immediately in his crate, so he doesn't get a chance to potty on the floor. Try again in twenty minutes and repeat until he goes.<br>  <br>  5.

2Zb0eNfeaa	No they don't need "bubblers" but they need to be filtered. Filters are generally strong enough to circulate the water sufficiently enough to allow proper gas exchange and therefore provide enough dissolved oxygen in the water.|`|urIm4YaBaa	All tanks need filters. They clean debris in the water and, by agitating the surface, increase gaseous exchange.<br>  <br>  No tank requires a bubbler. They don't directly add oxygen to the water like people think...although it does increase gaseous exchange when the bubbles reach the surface. However, this surface agitation is so minor that they're really more for decoration than anything else.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Bubblers=no.  Those are just for decoration.<br>  <br>  Filters=yes.  Ideally even bettas should have a filter in their tank.  Yes, bettas, gouramis, paradise fish will usually take in their air from the surface, but they do also breathe like regular fish do from the water.  Watch one of those fish when it "sleeps", they don't surface to breathe in their sleep.<br>  <br>  The filter helps to oxygenate the water through surface agitation, and it also helps to clean the water through mechanical and biological filtration. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|AA11901352	No and no.  Some fish known as labyrinth fish do not need bubblers or filters.  They have the ability to pull oxygen from the air in the event their water becomes depleted of oxygen or toxic <br>  <br>  Paradise fish and gourami are the two most common other than the betta.<br>  <br>  Air stones, bubblers etc are for decoration purposes only and do nothing to add dissolved oxygen to  the tank.|`|lsO714NQaa	no wander your betta died...living in all that bad water and filth.<br>  <br>  as for what fish you can just drop in to a tank full of water...yeah plastic fake fish.<br>  <br>  If you want live fish...Go to the fish store (leave ALL your money at home) with pen and paper look at all the fish...write down  the names of the fish you like...Go home a do ALOT of research on the needs, live span and care of each fish on your list.|`|QMhl2DGQaa	no doubt it|`|BMri9tITaa	All fish tanks need filters.  If you don't, you'll have to change the water more often, which stresses your fish, and all that stagnant water will smell after a while.<br>  <br>  If your tank is taller than it is long (or just generally marked "tall"), it might be good to have a bubbler, to make sure oxygen gets down to the very bottom.  Most tanks aren't like that.|`|XE1n7gRwaa	well, filters are not needed. same with air pumps, their kinda optional. but also bubblers help keep your fish healthy because they oxygenate the water.
utAKfPYZaa	Since everybody gave you advice on the cages im going to give you some on the actual guinea pigs. <br>  i've had three guinea pigs in the past and one lived for 5 years. the one that i had for five years was alone in his cage for four years before i got another. i found out that they are definately more affectionate when you have them alone. Even though they say to get two as long as you give it lots of attention its fine by itself.<br>  None of mine ever bit me, but my friend did get bit because she tried to pick mine up and scared him. they only really try to bit you when you scare them or if you hurt them. But be aware that guinea pigs do nibble on your fingers as a sign of affection, mine used to do that to me. <br>  You can buy guinea pigs as young as 4 weeks old and be aware that they should not be sold any younger than that because then need to be with their mother to get proper nutrients. <br>  For how much they cost it really depends on where you are. They range usually from 10-40 dollars. One pet store near me, (whitby, ontario) sold them for 10 and i got all three of mine from there. You really just have to look around. There might even be some guinea pig breeders around you that you could go look at. <br>  By the way the younger you get the guinea pig the more you can shape its personality to how you want it. They are always going to have some sort of personality but if you get one at an older age that has been sitting in a pet store by itself, it is not going to be as sociable and affectionate than if you got a baby that was in a cage with other guinea pigs, even better get one from a breeder that has been hand raised. <br>  There are also different kinds of guinea pigs that you can get, for example some have long hair and some have short hair, some have hair that sticks up in spikes and some even have curly hair. if you do get a guinea pig with long hair you are going to have brush it and cut it because of its lenght it drags around on the bottom of their cage and it gets really dirty and matted.<br>  Also never put your guinea pig's cage in direct sunlight for long periods of time because they can get heatstroke. its a very common problem that first time owners make. <br>  You should also give them lots of toys to play with because it keeps them entertained. i used to have a bird mirror with a bell on the bottom and they would always look in it and ring the bell. Also i had one that they could pick up. You should also give them lots of wood to chew on because they love to chew.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it's a little much. You can find out much more by purchasing a guinea pig book, which i highly suggest you do even before you buy a guinea pig so you can get all the details.<br>  <br>  Good luck:)<br>  <br>  P.S. guinea pigs love strawberries and carrots :)|`|iZyA4hh8aa	1) The cage I have was about 60-70 dollars<br>  2) Lol they are very frisky when they are young! I got my girls when they were 6 weeks old from my local pet store and it was so entertaining to see them popcorning around their cage. lol<br>  3) Yes, occasionally I get nipped, and I've owned mine for about a year. However, it's usually just when you are holding them wrong. They also give what I call "love nibbles" its where they are barely nibbling on your finger/hand and it doesn't hurt, just feels funny! lol<br>  4) Depends on how many piggies you get, more piggies = bigger cage<br>  5) I got my girls when they were about 6 weeks old, and I believe that's usually the age that pet stores sell them at, so yes. :)<br>  6) Guinea pigs are great pets! They do however need Vitamin C. I give my girls an orange slice every other day. They also need plenty of hay, guinea pig pellets, water, and veggies! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck getting a piggie! They are wonderful pets! =)|`|bdn68hATaa	Well i had a guinea for 1 year now so i no that they definatley don't bite. Also, if you want a really fancy cage, it cost about 100 but if you buy a regular one its like 40 to 60 dollars. The cage size depends on the size of the guinea but you should by a bigger one because they tend to grow pretty big. You could definately buy them as babies but its kinda hard to find. I got my guinea pig for $30, but prices vary. <br>  Good Luck with your guinea pig!!!|`|wsLngQ8oaa	Okay well for starters there is a big difference between Hamsters and guinea pigs. I' have pigs and have had hamsters.you'll need at least 2 or they get very depressed and lonely. There are several different kinds of cages, you can build your own or get store bought ones. The first purchase with everything that goes with in can cost up to 300 bucks. I was lucky I got mine of Kijiji and got a cage and everything for like 80. As for the frisky part, I guess you could call it that. In the wild they are prey and nothing else so it's in their nature to be very timid. Guinea pigs rarely bite, that being said I was bit by one when I was little, but never have been by mine. I got mine at 5 weeks old, so yes you can get them young.  be careful where you get them though. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask, if I can answer I will. I also included two links for you one will answer you question about piggy cage sizes and types. The second is the guide I used to learn all I could and still refer back to. Good luck they're a great experience|`|lZevLfjhaa	cages should be at least 3ft. long by 1ft wide. and can cost any where from $30 to nearly $100. as long as there the right size it doesn't need to be super fancy because you can add toys and things like that your self. make sure they DO NOT have wire bottoms, larders, shelves, or anything the guinea would be walking on.<br>  <br>  no, guinea pigs almost never bite. if they do bite you then you are definitely doing something wrong or just smell like food. however they will lick you sometimes which is normal.<br>  <br>  yes, when they are happy and comfortable with their surroundings they are very frisky; especially if they have another guinea to play with. but they may not be at first so just give them time.<br>  <br>  You can buy them as babies, and this is usually the best thing to do. if you get them when their young and hold them a lot they will be more comfortable around you.<br>  good luck!|`|yaC7JPt4aa	If I we're you, I would make a cage. They are pretty pricey to buy at a store, but making C&C cages are much less expensive. Guinea pigs are VERY gentle creatures, which is one reason why they are so popular. They do not bite unless they are very scared mostly. The cage needs to be around three square feet (you need to get two guinea pigs because they are very social) And you should buy them as a baby.|`|RDzpcgPJaa	Cages cost anywhere from 30 - 200 dolars. Guinea pigs are very nice and are very gentle. Young ones "popcorn" a lot. This is when they get very excited and jump (literally) and squeal and run around. It is verrryy cute to watch! The cage should be pretty big! they need to be able to get a lot of excersise. I'm not sure if you can by them as babies. I bought mine when it was 11 months old from petco. And guinea pigs tend to cost around 20 -30 dollars. Hope this helped! =)|`|pWsbbQ7eaa	Ok theres this starter kit and it's really awesome and it's metal and has an orange plastic bottom. I bought that it comes with like some food and the water bottle and some bedding etc. it costs about $90but like $20 of that is mostly what it comes with so ya.<br>  <br>  yes they bite all rodents bite but g-pigs only bite when they are scared<br>  <br>  the cage could be as big as you want it to be. it has to hold them and they have to have space to walk around<br>  <br>  um...i think u can buy them as a baby<br>  <br>  g-pigs cost about...$20? well i live in canada so if u live in america sry but the prices are different there!!!|`|PN7XMglOaa	They  are furry little animals . My son has two . The cage  should be about the size of a 10 gallon fish tank . Oh , yes , they do bite . Yes , you can buy them as a baby . They are frisky and fun to nuzzle their fur . A cage can cost as much as $ 50 . , but don't pay that much . Look in the Pennysaver , they always are selling cages , and guinea pigs . They live around 3 - 5 years|`|juyA6HUJaa	Ok 1, how much do the cages cost? ... guinea pigs need a lot of room to run around so should NOT have cages from pet stores, even though they say guinea pig cages.. they are way to small and you wont have a happy piggie, guinea pigs are meant to be kept in pairs also as they are herd animals so one pet store cage will be WAY too small. look on the internet for C&C cages :)<br>  2, are they frisky? they look "frisky" because they're scared in pet stores, they run away from you when you pass the cage, when you own one at first they do run away from you in the cage but after a while they calm down and are very calm animals.<br>  3, do they bite? simple answer, no. I've never been bitten by one or heard of one biting.<br>  4, how big does the cage need to be? again... big, look on google for C&C cages, do not buy a pet shop cage.<br>  5, can you buy them as a baby? yes you can they're sold from around 8 weeks + and are easier to tame, they should be bought in pairs, from the same litter.<br>  9,  how much do the guinea pigs cost themselves? around ￡15/$30... but you should 100% rescue guinea pigs from shelters, they need a home and it helps stop horrible breeding.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's called submissive urination and is common in young dogs and especially females who feel dominated by you and urinate to show their submission to you.  Keep greetings and excitement low key and quiet.  Try not to punish - just quiet handling of the situation whatever it is.  Picking up a dog feels dominating to them so that's part of the challenge.  So is petting on the head - try petting her chest instead.  Most outgrow it in time.|`|xqDCs0qJaa	my puppy used to do that but when she got older she started to understand!!|`|VQlkO7lqaa	I'm wondering how early she was taken from her litter?  Also isnt that breeder prone to such behavior?  The reason I ask about her age away from her litter mates is the earlier they are taken the more likely they have fear issues.  Instead of saying "NO" just pick her up gently and take her outside.  Make not comment on way of the other.  Also it is good to "pretend" to ignore your pup for a few minutes when you come home.  That changes they excitement level completely.

d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	The gestation period for rabbits is anywhere between 28 and 35 days, with 31 being the vast norm. You should still have a proper nest box in with the doe by 28 days and plenty of hay that she can use to build a nest with.<br>  <br>  In my experience, most first time does will wait until right before they give birth (3 or so hours) to start making a nest and pulling fur. While older, more experienced does will start making one as soon as you put a box in with them. I've even had some older does to start pulling fur and building a nest when I put the box in even if they aren't pregnant, just out of habit.|`|meMF69tXaa	Do you know when she mated? If so, it should be about 31-32 days afterward before she gives birth.<br>  <br>  There is the possibility of this being a false pregnancy. Rabbits can actually go through the whole process of building a nest and never give birth.|`|59zYV36Eaa	When did she get pregnant?   You got about 30 days.  If she's making a nest it should be soon.  Just give her some privacy and time.
3zv2bbolaa	What an interesting program! My only issue is that AKC judges are evaluators. I would prefer that all the judges be breeders and breeder judges. <br>  <br>  A breeder judge has a much better insight into the standard, function and purpose of the breed than an AKC judge who is left with an opinion formed by what dogs are shown to them in that ring and whose conformation often is far different than that of a good hunting dog. <br>  <br>  The Australian Shepherd has a vaguely similar program in our parent club called the MVA competition. Part of the competition is that the dog is evaluated in a similar manner as the CCA, as individuals compared to the standard and not to each other. A score sheet is filled out and then the dogs stock trial scores are added to the mix to determine who gets the award of Most Versatile Aussie for that competition. <br>  <br>  I like the CCA idea and think it is a good one. I may ask that ASCA look into the idea and come up with a similar one.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Beardies don't have anything like that. They do give out a versatility trophy once a year at the Nationals for dogs who excelled in conformation, agility, herding and obedience. <br>  <br>  We only have our national specialty and then some regional specialties, but the CCA is a cool idea and I'll definitely mention it at a meeting.

HvbIE03saa	You shouldn't declaw your cats. Do a search for it on wiki and see how inhumane it is.<br>  <br>  Declawing your cat involves (in very basic terms) actually surgically removing the cats first joint in which the claw grows. It's the equivalent of cutting off your finger at the first joint.<br>  <br>  It's really uncommon around the world because it's seen as inhumane and only practiced with any regularity in North America (which is sad).|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Yes, they now can use a laser to burn through the bones, tendons, and flesh to de-toe your cat.  So they use a laser instead of a knife?  It's still the same horrid process, with the same terrible side effects.  Many cats never totally recover from this "procedure" and spend the rest of their lives with phantom or real pain in their mutilated feet.  Some refuse to use the litter box ever again.  Some suffer severe behavior changes, like biting, aggression, or becoming reclusive.  Since they have the first joints of their toes chopped off, they can now no longer stretch and can sufferer from early arthritis.<br>  <br>  When there are so many ways to keep your cat from scratching your furniture, why would you mutilate your cat in this way?  Do you realize that the US and Canada are the only "civilized" countries in the world that allow this procedure?  In other countries it's considered animal cruelty, and banned by law.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Although the technique of laser declawing is made to seem more humane, the long term effects of having the toes partially amputated is the same.  Many declawed cats develop arthritis because declawing causes them to walk in an unnatural way. Frequently, declawed cats resort to other means of defense such as biting. Many a declawed cat finds itself turned over to a shelter because it quit using the litter box. Your best bet would be to train the cat to a scratching post and leave it's claws alone.  They were put there for a reason.|`|uB4ZQOEDaa	that's illegal in uk - doesn't that show u how inhumane it is !!!!!  and for what purpose does it serve.
pw8u5WQ9aa	I am allergic to cats as well & even as a child had asthmah attacks due to them. Now that I am older I did some research on how I could keep a cat & not have my allergies be trigger by them. So what I learn is keep the cat clean (of course if the cat is an outdoor cat that is going to be kinda hard) brush it regurly & bathe it. And last but not least if your sister plays with the cat make sure she washes her immediately afterwards. And you have to vacuum constantly & of course a heppa air filter also helps. Good luck I hope you can manage this. I love my kitty dearly so I know how you feel.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You can't really get RID of cat dander.  Humans and animals shed skin cells every day and it's a healthy thing for them to do.|`|QrLOZSFOaa	1.  Keep your pet cat out of your bedroom. Since you spend a lot of time in your bedroom, you are more likely to be exposed to the allergens that your cat releases if it choses to stay there. At first, your cat may meow all night and scratch at your bedroom door. When this happens, don't give in. Eventually, kitty will find a new comfy spot in your home to spend the rest of the night.<br>     2. Bathe and brush your cat regularly. Cats surely hate water but once they get used to it, they wouldn't react as much. Just make sure you have their claws clipped so that when they struggle, you won't have deep and painful scratches on your hands and arms.<br>     3. Get rid of your carpets. Carpets are breeding grounds of bacteria and allergens, not to mention cat dander. Replace your carpets with hardwood or vinyl so that you can easily clean it. If you also use carpets on your walls, get rid of them too. A simple paint job or wallpaper will do.<br>     4. Vacuum your place regularly. Cat dander is virtually everywhere so make sure you get rid of them in your home by using a vacuum cleaner. Make sure your vacuum has a HEPA filter. Pay close attention to the areas your cat hangs out most of the time.<br>     5. Heavy drapes and curtains must go. Just like carpets, your thick and heavy drapes and curtains have the ability to trap cat dander. Replace them with easy-to-clean blinds or washable curtains. If you will be using curtains, make sure you wash them at least once a week.<br>     6. Wash your hands well after handling or playing with your cat. Also, do not allow your cat to go near your face. Do not rub your eyes or any part of your face before washing your hands.<br>     7. Take allergy shots as these can completely get rid of your allergic reactions to cat dander. You will only do this if nothing seems to work or improve. Consult with your doctor. You will only need monthly shots and afer a few years, you'll completely rid yourself of allergies.<br>  <br>  Cat dander may persist for months or even years, even if your cat is gone. To make sure you completely rid your home of cat dander, you will have to clean your home thoroughly. Wash all your beddings, rugs, carpets, and even pillows. Having your cushion, couches and chairs vacuumed will also help. As long as you clean your home and pet regularly, you will have no allergy attacks. Now you can enjoy the company of your cat without having to sneeze every now and then.|`|tLzKEDMlaa	There is a shampoo you can use that makes the dander less irritable
EZzHjm8Vaa	1) they may or may not get along. just like people all birds have different personalities, but i think male male is an okay match (better then f+f) <br>  2)it depends. my current bird was hand raised and naturally wanted to be out of the cage the first day we got him and struggled when we tried to put him back so we let him stay out. But some birds might be shy, and want to keep to themselves for a few days. I would put the birds in the cage, and if he seems to be content, let him stay there, but if he is chirping for you to give attention, then hold him for a bit at your discretion.<br>  3)feed seeds and pellets. i will put a link at the bottom for both. In my cage, i have 2 seperate food dishes because my birds won't eat the pellets mixed with the seeds, and prefers the seeds to pellets, but occasionally will eat pellets. Make both available, and your bird will eat at his own pace.<br>  4)whenever i have a veggie i will give a piece to my bird (same goes for crackers) My birds prefers carrots,(its beak turns orange!) but a bird in the past like peas a lot. Feed them vegetables often and if it seems your bird is having trouble pooping give them vegetables because your probably aren't giving enough! <br>  5) BIrds have a preference what veggies they like and fruits are high in sugar so they probably won't enjoy them as much. Birds will eat anything you eat, so if it sees you eating a carrot it will try the carrot. If you just put the vegetable in its cage it might be frightened and not eat it. Show it that it is okay to eat it and it will follow. (NO AVOCADOES! they are poisonous!)<br>  6) it is true, my male bird talks more then my female bird ever did and it is only 6months old. Just say the word you want it to say over and over again and it will repeat (cockatiel words are not as clear as a parrots would be, it might just sound like a wistle, but it will be the same tone!)<br>  7) If you have 2 birds it is almost impossible, but teaching it whistles is easier, like a cat call<br>  8)take one out of the cage for a while to cool down. then put it back in the cage, but if it persists i would get 2 different cages<br>  9)they molt between season. if its feathers come out don't worry, unless you notice them pulling them out take it to a vet because they are self mutilating. They molt a few times a year.<br>  10) you don't have to clip the wings, but there is less of a chance of it flying out of you house. The wings grow back and you have to clip them about twice a year (except i had a bird that just go stronger and flew around with clipped wings) you clip nails  when ever they get long (getting stuck in clothing) or sharp<br>  11) you can't spray anything or burn candles. but i have done it without realizing it and nothing happened, but i would keep it to a minimum. (i had a bird who died from teflon poisoning)|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Yeah...the other people pretty much asnwered your questions but you can bring them to the cottage...just bring them in the cage. Don't have two different ones up there, if they are in a new place and in a new cage that might stress them out. But after a while they will get use to it.|`|6GSxA9glaa	I will try to answer all your questions:<br>  <br>  1) Initially the birds will probably get along with one another but as they age and become hormonal they may start to fight with one another and even injure or kill the other one.  Also, when two birds are housed in the same cage they will more than likely bond with one another and not become bonded to you.  I would get them each their own cage, it is better for the birds and if you want a bird to be your companion you will have an easier time with separate cages.<br>  <br>  2) The first day your main priority will be making sure your bird is comfortable in it's new surrondings and is eating and drinking.  You will want to make sure their is spray millet in the cage, next to the highest perch as this will be a safe place in the bird's mind.  As far as when you handle them, you will have to take cues from the bird, if it is well socialized it may want to interact with you immeadiatly.<br>  <br>  3) Feeding them is still a controvery in the bird community, personally, I like a natural diet that consists of cooked brown rice, grains, beans, fresh chopped veggies, sprouts, birdie breads, and a good cockatiel seed mix.<br>  <br>  4)  You should never leave fresh foods in the cage for more than a few hours so it would depend on schedule as to when you feed these.  Seeds and breads can be left in the cage all the time.  You will have to watch the seed dish to make sure it contains seeds and not just hulls.<br>  <br>  5)  Birds will not readily accept a new food.  You will have to "teach" them to eat it, you can do this by eating the food in front of them to encourage them to try it.  Don't give up, it may take you trying to feed the item several times before they learn that it is safe to eat.  You may also have to try chopping it, feeding it whole, slicing it, etc...<br>  <br>  6) Male cockatiels are the more vocal and will whistle and sing just because they are males, the females are generally quieter than the males but can sing and whistle, too.<br>  <br>  7) If two birds are housed together it will make it more difficult to teach them human words.<br>  <br>  8) You may have to towel one of them, there are plenty of sights on the internet to teach you this method of calming down a bird.<br>  <br>  9)  Birds will molt about twice a year, but indoor birds constantly shed feathers to some degree and cocktiels are very dusty birds due to their down feathers which disentigrate constantly.<br>  <br>  10)  Wing clipping should be done by your vet, pet shop, or breeder.  Birds have blood feathers, young feathers that have a blood supply going through the shaft, if you cut into one the bird can bleed to death in just a few moments.<br>  <br>  11)  Febreeze is deadly to birds, you should not spray it anywhere in your home.  There is a long list of dangers, non-stick pans, aerosols of any type, chocolate, avacado, etc...<br>  <br>  Traveling with your birds can be fun for the both of you, you just have to bird proof the area where you are staying and take some precautions like not leaving your birds in the car unnattended.|`|RGQJfaCKaa	1. They may get along or they may fight. You should watch them for a while and make sure they get along. If they do not get along, you will need a cage for both of them. However if you have a big cage, they should be fine.<br>  <br>  2. Don't hold your birds for the first few days because they need some time to adjust to their new home.<br>  <br>  3. A pelleted diet is recommended but seeds should make up about 20%  of their diet. Fresh vegetables like romaine lettuce, carrots, beats, etc. Do not feed them ice berg lettuce, chocolate, avocado, onions, rhubarb, tomato, leaves and stems from potato, bean plants, coffee, eggplant, and tea.<br>  <br>  4. It is good to feed them fresh vegetables daily. Vegetables are better than fruits because they have way less sugar.<br>  <br>  5. Most birds if not all love fruits and veggies so that will not be a problem. They may not like certain kinds of vegetables so experiment with safe vegetables and find their favorite. <br>  <br>  6. What you heard is somewhat true. Males are normally quite vocal but they can sometimes be very quiet. Females can also be very noisy.<br>  <br>  7. Birds will remember words that they like or hear often, but cockatiels are not gifted talkers.<br>  <br>  8.If they start fighting, you put them in different cages. <br>  <br>  9. No they molt about twice a year. <br>  <br>  10. Yes you should clip their wings about every three months. Or after each molt. However, my birds have their wings clipped, but because they are so strong, they can fly like normal. So clipping the wings may have little effect. You should clip their nails about every three months.<br>  <br>  11. I would not suggest that you spray febreeze in your room  because they could react to it. <br>  <br>  Good for you and get as much research done as you can. I have 2 cockatiels, an umbrella cockatoo, and an african grey. Hope this helped.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	1. No way to know for sure, unless they've already been caged together for a while. Be aware that birds can get hormonal when they go through puberty and at that time, they may not get along any more and it may become necessary to separate them. <br>  <br>  2.Unless they're already completely tame, let them settle in for a few days before you try to play with them. If they're not completely tame, give them a couple of days before you start teaching them to step up.<br>  <br>  3. Find out what they ate at the place they came from--that's where you have to start. Seeds are high in fat and it's not good for them to be on an all seed diet, but seeds can be part of a balanced diet for them. There a several different kinds of pelleted diets that are very healthful--Harrison's, ZuPreem, Roudy Bush and Lafebert's just to start with.If they're already eating one of those or something similar, you're in good shape. Seeds are fine as a treat or as a part of their diet--they just shouldn't be eating only seeds.<br>  <br>  9. My cockatiel only really moults once or twice a year and it only lasts for about 2 or 3 weeks. She sheds feathers the rest of the year, too, but not so much.<br>  <br>  10. The wing clipping is a whole separate debate and is ultimately a decision you'll have to make based on what is best for you and your birds. For a beginning bird keeper, it's easier to have their wings trimmed. Best to have the vet do it for you at first. <br>  <br>  11. You may have to give up the febreeze--most perfumes and scents are not really bird-friendly. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on your new babies.|`|yMgIoYmhaa	1 yes<br>  2 no leave them alone for a week or a few days<br>  3 kaytee forti diet with some fruits and veggies<br>  4 once a day no tomatoes <br>  5 give them vitamins every bird likes some kind of fruits or veggies<br>  6 just talk to them<br>  7 no but take them out of the cage and talk to them separately<br>  8 put them in different cages<br>  9 yes they moult every year in the spring and fall<br>  10 you should only if you want to take them out yes trim their nails too<br>  but try too bring them to a pet store or vet to do it its safer<br>  11 not in the same room as the birds it can kill them use it in a different room and close the door
g4KHXYFPaa	Depends.  You can get the little green things which are about like eating a biscuit, or you can get those nylabones that are about like eating a rawhide.  Those USUALLY take a couple days or more to eat.  <br>  <br>  I use the little green ones every so often, as well as rawhides, pigs ears, real bones, etc.  I haven't actually ever used nylabones, as a bag of rawhides, pigs ears, etc, are more economical.<br>  <br>  Edit: I have had five dogs(2 large, 3 small), and used pigs ears and rawhides on all of them, and never had a problem.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Get him a toy that he has to toss up and down to get the treat out.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  First it is important to learn about the estrus cycle in cats, which is totally different than the heat cycle in dogs, felines only ovulate when they are bred. This is an amazing reproductive strategy. Human females on the other hand bleed when they have their periods because they are shedding the lining of their uterus and the unfertilized egg.<br>  <br>  Since cats don't ovulate until they are bred, there is no lining or egg to be shed, so they do not bleed.  Cats however can lubricate excessively when in heat because they are looking for a mate, so are often observed cleaning their genital area frequently.<br>  <br>  If you do see any bleeding from the vaginal area of your cat, she may indeed have a uterine infection, (pyometria) which should be treated by a veterinarian immediately, as it can be life-threatening.<br>  <br>  To summarize, cats do not have "menstrual" periods. They have estrus cycles when they seek a mate. Behavior in a cat changes sometimes, radically, when in heat. <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Do_female_cats_bleed_while_in_heat_like_dogs" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Do_female_cats...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8GxM2omLXaQC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=why+cats+dont+bleed+when+in+estrus%3F&source=bl&ots=TwCDx0K6-P&sig=b8QbGwNg1RHMb4nRzLawYPiH2lo&hl=en&ei=YGKoSdWWEYH8tgeD78nXDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=8GxM2om...</a><br>  See page 14 for the article about  estrus behavior and cycles if the page doesn't load properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It is wise to have your female kitten spayed as soon as possible. This will prevent ovarian cancer and uterine infections, should she be allowed to go into estrus repeatedly. It is far better for her health and for a more contented kitty. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	cats do not have periods. they have heats or estrus cycles. they are fertile during their estrus cycles and are ready to mate.<br>  <br>  If you are referring to the appearance of blood then she has had a little. Cats do not bleed as much as dogs and they are fastidiously clean so she is cleaning it before it makes a mess.<br>  <br>  Have your cat spayed. Intact cats are at risk of deadly uterine infections and much, much, more prone to developing mammary cancer. Besides, there are more than enough cats and kittens in the world without homes. I just got done at the shelter today and would love to be able to go shake some sense into people that let their cats breed. Cats can be altered as young as 8 weeks as long as they are healthy and weigh at least 2 pounds for males and 3 pounds for females. Cats can start going into heat as young as 4 months old. They will cycle into heat every 3 weeks until they are spayed, bred, or die. Please have her spayed as soon as possible.|`|BVuMCED7aa	if your cat is in heat you would know usually. they meow like you are giving them a bath, to atrackt male cats, and all they wanna do is rub their but up against everything. so thats probably how you would know|`|FCY3lwnoaa	Yes.  And female kittens can get pregnant as early as 5-6 months.  <br>  <br>  Please, have her spayed.  : )|`|bhx9XIn8aa	cats dont bleed when they are on heat, they just call other cats (males)|`|DN6XtoViaa	cats are clean, so you won't notice any blood.<br>  (unless you REALLY look) haha.<br>  <br>  its compleatly normal, don't worry :)
DCdxrKy9aa	The puppies, if your aunt's dog is pregnant, should be fine. The reason why you don't want to inbreed anything is because it makes the offspring more likely to have defects/health problems. Please consider having your dog neutered - you won't have to worry about unwanted puppies in the future.|`|PM23RDycaa	On purpose or not it shouldn't have happened. Have the male fixed and the female spayed. They are brother and sister meaning that she share over90% of the same genetic makeup. That puts the pups are at risk for all sorts of problems both genetic and physical.|`|hRikwc00aa	There's a chance they could be born with defects and other health problems due to inbreeding - the safest and probably best option would be to make sure both dogs are fixed.|`|tY14vbrKaa	On purpose or not, it's incredibly ignorant and irresponsible.<br>  <br>  They will likely be healthy, but they can have serious intesifications of their personality traits.<br>  <br>  Many very experience breeders inbreed on purpose "line breeding"... but it's like playing with fire...|`|8khZ0fJZaa	No, that is incest. It would make the puppies retarded or sickly.|`|Njm7RF4zaa	Sure, but don't force them to mate. They're brother and sister!|`|JRRsjByCaa	err, lots of problems occur when inbreeding occurs. never do this again lol.|`|sHTpXUScaa	Well, they could produce puppies with health issues. I have a friend who accidentally lets her two sibling cats bred together. They had one kitten and the mother rejected the kitten. She had to bottle feed the kitten until it is older enough to eat on it's own. When the kitten was able to eat on her own, she has crossed blue eyes. It is probably due to inbreeding.|`|FPGgaI3Yaa	no this is called inbreeding.<br>  too much inreeding causes genetic depression<br>  genetic depression causes pain<br>  pain leads to suffering<br>  suffering to anger<br>  anger to agony<br>  agony to torment<br>  torment to darkside of life<br>  yeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaa|`|i8XR3Mfnaa	Most likely they will be fine. Genetic mutations usually skip a generation or two. Just make sure you get the pups neutered as soon as possible. You don't want this to happen again!|`|lpd6Zm1faa	Most animals that are inbred have health problems and sometimes a lot of other problems too. All you can do it wait and see.|`|AA11506593	Highly unlikely.|`|WMIAv1N4aa	Unfortunately probably not,|`|VkFDAQ46aa	NO|`|2eJcaeOPaa	get your ****** spayed asap
L7sgufRQaa	Most kittens that young are quite active!  Have you had him fixed yet?  From my research most places reccomend having boys done around 3 months, just before they go through "puberty" to keep the testosterone from coming full force so they don't get aggressive and start spraying.  We had our baby boy Carl done at 3 months and he is now 6 and has never sprayed and is very well behaved.  <br>  <br>  His sister on the other hand came back after her adopted family changed their mind and they hadn't had her spayed and she's a hellion now-but a fun one- but  she was the quitest when she was a baby.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you get him fixed if you haven't already, not just for your sanity but for keeping the kitty population under control.<br>  <br>  He sounds adorable though!|`|7GM69W8Taa	It depends.  Do you have a male or female?  Is he/she a kitten?  In what way is the cat hyperactive?  Jumping, clawing, general playing?  There could be many reasons.  A little more information would be useful, please.
8i90ov0Gaa	Listen to Herp-Dude. They primarily eat rodents. I saw your last question saying that your corn snake won't eat, but if it won't eat rodents, it won't eat a frog. Check your temperatures. They won't eat if they aren't warm enough. And I don't know where you bought your three week old corn snake, but reputable breeders won't sell them unless they're eating well. I don't sell mine until they've had three consecutive meals, which occurs at no less than a month of age.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	stick to mice if its eating well.it gives them all the nusishment they need|`|XGsuxRR2aa	It may be alright, if it wants to eat it, and if the frog isn't a poisonous frog.<br>  <br>  In nature they sometimes eat lizards, but of course primarily eat rodents.<br>  <br>  If you're doing it to see, there isn't much that's going to stop you, but I don't see the harm in it, but I don't know that much about snakes.<br>  <br>  But I'd always err on the side of caution, especially if you don't know much about the frog. Also it could be possible it could carry some diseases.<br>  <br>  Also, as another answer pointed out... some snakes... once they eat a tastier meal, may avoid eating their normal again... So if you feed it frozen mice or something already, I'd not change that, because it may not go back to dead food.|`|oUTb1zNkaa	There's really no need. They eat rodents in captivity. Stick with that. If it's a frog you found outside ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!<br>  Wild caught animals can spread disease and kill a captive snake. Please don't experiment on your snake just to see how "cool" it would be to feed it a frog.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	Why are you doing that. I'm not sure. If it is your snake may not eat mice anymore.
qGpiWuATaa	Put them in the breeding net 1st. Then you get to plan out parenthood! (just kidding) But, you really need to figure out what to do with the little guys! You have to keep em in the breeding net for a while, and feed them either: crushed up flakes (they have to be REALLY crushed up), or this Hibachi baby food. That should work. Now keep feeding them, and don't be disappointed of some of them die. That will happen, I had 4 mollies, and just 1 of them gave birth to around 60 or 65 babies. I was overwhelmed, but they died off. The stronger ones survived. It's better them die now than you get attached to them, then they die. Ok, so after a couple weeks, maybe even a month or two in the breeding tank maximum, you must estimate. You have to look at all the fish in your aquarium and look at their mouths. You must see if the baby guppies can be let free. If it looks like the mouthes of the fish are ok, then go head let em free. Of course you have to keep an eye on them for a while, to make sure the filter is ok. Now, here's the other case: if the babies do fit in the other fishes' mouthes or if the filter is sucking them up, you can't put them back in your breeding net. Well, of course you can, but after 2 months in there, the babies could stop growing, and if they do that, they will die. So, you have 2 choices: put them in a bigger space, or give them to the pet store. I would choose bigger space, but if you don't have one... well, pet store is your best bet. Or you can keep em in the breeding net again. Whatever, doesn't matter. You can put them in a fishbowl, or a big vase, or something. But the only problem is the water, but you can pour them into a cup, then catch them and put them back into the clean water, that's when you do water changes. If you have an actuall tank, tank, that has a small filter, great! Now, finally, if they all survive, you get to choose where they go. If you have a big enough tank to fit a couple more guppies in, awesome! You can give em to your friends, sell em, whatever. Just make sure you inform the person. And then, your best bet, if you have nowhere else to turn.. THE PETSTORE! They should take em in, but don't expect any money. I hope that helped, and remember, I'm here all weekend if you have any more Q's! Good luck!|`|jnzSz3tRaa	if you want them to live in one tank with the other fish, get java moss.  they hide in there and usually don't get eaten.|`|OqsLPqKiaa	You would probably need three tanks for this purpose. One 15 gallon long tank for your breeding guppies with a good filter, florescent lights on a timer and a submersible heater. A second tank of similar size and equipment as a grow-out tank and a third 5.5 gallon tank with lights, heater and a sponge filter as a fry tank. For fast growing vibrant guppies with large batches of fry you should feed a variety of feeds. Flakes being the staple, but earthworm flakes and pureed beef heart every couple of days will increase the number of fry and frozen brine shrimp is a good idea. Fry will eat finely ground flakes and frozen baby brine shrimp. Each tank will need at least three inches of gravel (for plants to root in) and lots of plants. You may need to supplement with the occasional CO2 for the health of the plants. Most pet stores will take semi-mature guppies from you but they will not buy them from you (you may be able to get some store credit). You should keep some salt for freshwater aquariums on hand as well. Do some research on cycling new tanks before you buy any fish, and check out these sites.<br>  <a href="http://www.guppies.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guppies.com/forums/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.guppylabs.info/january2004/de..." rel="nofollow">http://www.guppylabs.info/january2004/de...</a><br>  A|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Unless you want to set up another tank to grow the fry, you would be better off buying some bushy artificial plants (lots of them) for the fry to hide in until they're big enough to fend for themselves. Just crush up a bit of food for them each day and they'll find it. All of them may not survive but some will and they'll be already in the original tank and you won't have to acclimate them to a new tank . BTW, both mothers and fathers eat baby fish. Good luck.|`|xqDCs0qJaa	that happened to my guppies to!! we just gave them some of the guppie food but we crush it so that they were really tiny!! good luck!!

q7TxQOqKaa	It depends, how long does you groomer spend on grooming your puppy? I use the general rule of 10% or five dollars, When you take your puppy to the groomer for the first time I would asked to stay and watch, So that you can get an idea of the whole process and what the groomer will be doing, Also feel free to ask questions while your there, Most groomers are more than happy to answer any questions you might have, If not then I would take my dog else where!|`|27KsZtdmaa	If the groomer did a fantastic job on your dog, then give the groomer $20. If the groomer did a good job, then give him $15. If they did okay, then give him $10. If he did bad, then give him $5. If they did absolutly horrible, then give him like 50 cents. Thats what I do when I take my dog to get groomed.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	my shih tzu goes every two weeks for a bath and he is kept in a kennel cut so it's pretty straightforward and simple  I don't tip for the bath but when he needs a clip I tip generously as in the clip is 40 and I pay her 50<br>  <br>  if a dog is large, matted and flea infested please tip very generously as this is a huge amount of physical labor and products and time<br>  <br>  for a puppy first visit my groomer doesn't charge but I would pay at least 20<br>  <br>  depends on what your puppy is having done, bath only, bath and haircut, nails <br>  <br>  if you are satisfied with the final results then tip generously as puppies are a handful
B6zl0AJDaa	You didn't say what style of riding you are wanting to do.<br>  <br>  ENGLISH: You need to measure from your knee to your hip and that will give you your seat size. To measure the seat size on a saddle you start from the button to the side of the pommel, then take the measuring tape and go to the center of the cantle (back of the saddle.).<br>  <br>  As for your horse's size, depends a lot on the breed, most TBs, QHs, Arabs take a wide to extra wide tree.<br>  <br>  WESTERN: You can measure yourself the same way for a seat, then deduct 2" from that measurement and "should" give you your seat size. When measuring the saddle, you take a measuring tape starting at the base of the saddle horn and measure to the center of the cantle.<br>  <br>  Western saddle trees come in three standard sizes, Full Quarter Horse bars, Semi Quarter Horse Bars and Arab (I understand that they now have draft horse saddle trees but haven't seen one yet.). Most horses get along fine with semi QH bars on their western saddles.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	For sizing the tree size (withers) you can take a metal wire coat hanger, and bend it across his withers to "mold" his shape, and that will be his tree shape that he needs.
xp6UVyj2aa	It depends on what kind of care you can provide, a red eared slider can get up to 8-12 inches long (shell) for every inch of shell you should add 10 gallons to the tank size (ex- a 5 inch shell turtle should be in a 50 gallon tank) Big tanks can get spendy. Honestly a cornsnake is a good start for owning reptiles their care is fairly easy.|`|q0vKbocHaa	Turtles generaly have a longer lifespan. Some turtles can live off of crickets and goldfish and a snake needs like frozen mice and stuff-which can be really expensive. As far as the more fun aspect, that is all up to you and your lifestyle|`|HWijr6uxaa	I think a turtle is less to take care of. <br>  it doesn't nessicarily need live food, it could have the turtle food, its like little pellets, my grandma used to have turtles and she fed them that. i think turtles are cuter. :)|`|stMcVPCMaa	Turtles can be fun to watch but I would prefer the snake.  Turtles are probably easier since there's no point to handling them, they don't take much time.  Time spent in actual care (feeding, cleaning their enclosure, etc) is probably about the same for both.  <br>  I think corn snakes have a lot more personality.  Plus, as answered earlier, red eared sliders get pretty big so their space requirements can be tough to manage.  If you handle the snake often then it can become pretty friendly, and personally I always enjoyed handling my snakes if they like it too.  A tame snake even enjoys a (very) gentle massage!  If it were me, after having had both as pets, I'd definitely go for the corn snake.<br>  <br>  As for your mom - I guess it all depends on how she feels about both animals?  Some people get pretty freaked out by snakes.  Or maybe they don't bother her at all so she wouldn't care which you get?  You'll probably have to ask her to find out!
IRaIxWJKaa	It would not be FIV, a cat lives over 15 years with that and dies from causes other than those FIV related.  <br>  <br>  FeLV, which is feline leukemia, gives warnings in advance, you know the cat isn't well.  It does not kill that quickly either.<br>  <br>  However Feline distemper can kill a cat in under 10 days if they were not vaccinated, it's deadly.  I would suspect that.  Your vet can do an autopsy and see.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I'd check for chemical poisoning--if you're on a farm you do have chemicals and pesticides around.  Cats eating that if they get it on their fur would be exposed to toxic substances.|`|1wHuhyPFaa	FIV or FeLV. Both contagious & both don't have many outward symptoms. If they aren't in your sight as often as an indoor cat would be, then it might be possible that the symptoms went unnoticed.<br>  <br>  Are you laying out any rat poison? They could be catching rodents who have toxins in them.<br>  <br>  There can be a multitude of different reasons. The remaining cats should see a vet, no matter what it is, it seems very odd.

It doesn't matter where the cat was sleeping though, if they weren't fighting then they'll be ok. I don't believe it was rabies because of lack of signs, and i don't really think it was distemper though either.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Someone (a neighbor?) could be using rat poison.  If a cat eats a poisoned mouse, it will die.  If the "enemy" is another cat, that cat could be infected with FIV or FeLV. He needs to be caught and treated.  If there is any antifreeze around, the cats may have drank it.  One last thing, my dad once bought hay that had been stored (he didn't know it) in a barn where insecticide had been sprayed.  He lost 3 cows before he figured it out.  If that's the case where you are, if the cats groomed themselves after lying on the hay it could have poisoned them.  A vet can do a necropsy exam to tell you what happened.
4yt4D3vMaa	You can wipe the area with cotton wool dipped in boiled water that has cooled until monday but make sure you get him to the vet as soon as possible. It could be blocked tear ducts or an infection, which if caused by Pasteurella can become chronic and impossible to get rid of-that's how my rabbit's started and she eventually had to be put to sleep as it had spread through her body. if it's caught early it's much easier to treat-if it's the tear ducts they may need flushed and your rabbit would need sedated for this.|`|59zYV36Eaa	Sounds like he probably has a cold.  Are his front feet kind of matted or wet like? He could also have blocked ducts between his lids and nasal area.  He probably should go to the vet when they open.  Just make sure he's kept warm for now and that he's drinking plenty of water and eating too.|`|qjjY07Lsaa	Put one of those funny cone looking things on his head so he can't scratch it.
dhljEfddaa	Horses that have already died will be turned into a number of things. Glue is one of them. Many years ago they would kill them for glue, but now it is just if they are already dead. However, it is VERY rare that they use them for glue. They typically use them for food for other animals such as pigs, cats, dogs, etc. They had an episode of Dirty Jobs about turning dead cows, horses, and other animals to feed for other animals, and it was very interesting.|`|eK2Rritoaa	Lmao, Yee, and dog food<br>  <br>  and seal fat is in yur lip stick, theres a bunch of gross stuff out there Lol|`|KxNdCO4Vaa	no horses are not made into glue anymore, but they are made into dog food.|`|wcZYjX9Faa	Im afraid so<br>  <br>  We saved a horse from being turned into dog food once|`|QGecNxmgaa	Not anymore...now their just turned into dog food...like they can't find anything better.......... :(|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Yep, they use the hooves for glue
YRTYXfggaa	Depends on your location.  I ran a pet sitting business for 10 years in a small city in Idaho, and charged $25 a day for 2 visits, overnights were $35.  My prices were low, and I had a lot of clients.  I moved to Seattle, WA, and did my research, and the prices were around $50 a day and up to $100 for overnights!  I really thought it was a bit high, but with gas prices now and all the travel time, I could see why!  You could charge less for your home, for the convenience and no travel costs.|`|UmhWxs1laa	I do pet sitting in my home for extra $$.<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep a log of your clients and a good calender for drop offs and pick ups.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a 1) medical release form on each dog to ensure you can take them to the vet if needed.  Specify the owners take full finanical responsiblity for the vet visit.  Also have on there the pet's current vet name, address, & phone  2) have a financial release -- that states no home can be completely free of accidents, they agree they will not hold you finanically responsible for any accidents/injuries/loss of pet 3) a form that has all their info on it (name, address, emergency phone numbers, instructions for feeding and the like 4) an agreement that you agree to care for their pet from x to y dates, for x amount of money to be paid (in advance, at pick up, half and half, in cash?  you choose) as well as if they do not pick up their dog nor contact you in any way the dog becomes your property (to protect you from those folks who leave their dog at a boarding kennel and never pick them up.  Without this, you can't declare the dog abandoned and get him a new home)<br>  <br>  I make sure they give me a copy of current shots & worming.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, we've had a lot of fun doing this and it pays for my dogs' kibble!|`|jpTl3o5naa	My daughter is a vet tech and has also sidelined as going to homes to take care of pets, bringing mail and newspapers in, etc. I don't remember what she got paid, but it wasn't much. I hate kennels because the pet can be mistreated and catch parvovirus and kennel cough, which can be deadly to the pet.<br>  I would worry though if anything happened to the pet or the home, would you be held responsible? I think I would find this out first. Hope this helps. It is a good idea, but not without flaws. Also, if the animal bit, would the owner have the right to sue if they hired you?|`|yXUS7jz5aa	If you have the room go for it.My sister has a friend who dose the same thing in Sydney she charges $50 a day for home visits $39 a day for boarding.|`|blItrnvXaa	this is the money I would charge.....<br>  <br>  dogs staying at Ur house : about $20 per night<br>  <br>  visits to their house : $5-10 <br>  <br>  dog walking: $5 per dog......|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Around my area in the central state your finding more and more people doing in home dog boarding, they are cheaper then your big business kennels are and a lot of dog owners like that. Every single kennel here weather its in home or your normal kennel ask that your dog/dogs have their kennel cough shots its a must.<br>   I own three small breed dogs and i was calling around town seeing where would be the cheapest for me to kennel my dogs if i had to go out of town for something and could not take them with me, one business would charge $130. for all three for two days including exercising them. another business charged $30 for one dog and 1/2 price for extra dogs per day and that was just for one kennel with an outdoor potty area no exercising area. So i called on a couple home boarding places one lady would charge $60. for two days for all three dogs. Another lady charged $30. for two days for all three. they both had the home environment and fenced back yard which i would prefer for my dogs.<br>   As for someone coming into my home to walk my dogs or take them out to go potty or feed them it would have to be pretty cheap  cause they would have to make several visits a day and that could add up to what it would cost for them to be in a kennel.<br>   A lady i know who has two dogs pay her neighbor $10. a day to come over twice a day to feed and let her dogs outside for potty break, i think thats to much and not healthy for the dogs, but thats only my personal opionon.<br>     What you should do is call around your area and see what kennel costs are and go below those prices, ask what information they need to board dogs so you know what information you will need starting yours, then from there add on anything else you would like to have in your agreement papers.<br>   In the buisness kennels i had called they do have an on call vet or an on site vet there during buisness hours. I think its a really good idea to have an emergency number from the owners and what vet they take their dogs too incase something would happen to their dog/dogs.<br>   Good luck to you
2z69twcpaa	an alternative to a tortoise table is a large rubbermaid tub, your tortoise needs a space area of 2ft by 4ft and should have <br>  a heat lamp<br>  a uv lamp<br>  a substrate 50/50 mix of top soil and play sand<br>  a hide<br>  this is just a basic list, you can make things more interesting by putting in small rocks <br>  small branches these are to climb over as tortoises love to climb, you can also grow grass on trays, they are easy to water and maintain and if they look a bit trampled you put them on a window sill and they recover quite well, <br>  we made a hide out of small branches rather than the ones you buy the tortoise loves it and it is something different, we also change the enclosure around about once a month so our tortoises have to explore for food, and the enclosure change seems to keep them entertained for a while.<br>  feeding should consist of 90% weeds and grasses and other things like salad should only be used as a supplement here is a booklet you can download to see what weeds to feed  <a href="http://www.tlady.clara.net/id16.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tlady.clara.net/id16.htm</a> here is another site which you will find useful <a href="http://www.russiantortoise.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.russiantortoise.org/</a> it will show you how to care for your russian tortoise  the last site i am giving you has lots of really good article on tortoise keeping so is worth a look   <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/</a>  hope you find these useful best of luck honey|`|TCwf6HXNaa	i would go to petsmart or petco or any where thaat would cell cages. you can feed him greens and small rodents|`|CgRGmzxZaa	I don't understand why you don't want a tortoise table set up. The only alternative you have is to use an indoor cage designed for rabbits, but in my opinion they are very expensive. You could build a tortoise table of any size you wish for very little money.<br>  You can make your tortoises environment more interesting by using a nice deep substrate of play sand and soil, try to make it a few inches in depth. You can also put slate and pebbles in the enclosure for your tortoise to climb over. They also need sheltered hidey places such as plant pots on their side. Don't put the substrate flat, create lumps and bumps to break it all up a bit.<br>  Your russian tortoise should be fed 100% weeds therefore no fruit or vegetables. You can buy weed seed mixes on the internet for your tortoise, alternatively you can look for weeds yourself in your garden. Your tortoise also needs a good calcium and vitamin powder. I suggest you use nutrabol every 3 days. On other days you can use limestone/calcium carbonate powder sprinkled on his weeds. You can also leave a small dish of it in his enclosure so he can eat it when he needs it. Cuttlefish bone is another good source of calcium for your tortoise, though some will not eat it but its worth a try.<br>  For all these things to benefit your tortoise you need to make sure he is getting a good supply of uv light. If you use tubes make sure you change them every 6 months or so. Alternatively you can use a combined heat and uv bulb. Though they appear expensive they do last twice as long as tubes and offer your tortoise the very best uv available. I use a 100W megaray for mine and they love it and are 200% more active because of it. Also check your basking temperature it should be in the low 30's (degrees celcius) and remember that the temperature of his enclosure shouldn't be the same throughout. Tortoise need cooler areas to allow them to adjust their own body temperature when needed.<br>  Here are a few useful links.<br>  <a href="http://www.shelledwarriors.co.uk/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shelledwarriors.co.uk/forum/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/backidx.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/backidx.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.herpvetconnection.com/uk.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpvetconnection.com/uk.shtm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kimbosreptileworld.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kimbosreptileworld.co.uk/</a>|`|l0ktQUnWaa	You can use almost anything as long as there is nothing toxic in it. It is difficult to find anything ready made that will be large enough. Since you have him in a plastic enclosure, can't you make an addition to this?<br>  Here is a list of edible plants that you can put in with him. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/resources/edible.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/resources/edible....</a><br>  <br>  Good foods are dandelion greens, escarole lettuce, mustard greens, squash, mushrooms, endive. Kale and bok choy can be fed once a week or so. Alfalfa leaves (not sprouts) and timothy hay can be fed as well. No rodents or insects. A Russian tortoise is an herbivore!<br>  Good luck!|`|DHCXeLvvaa	Well i think the best way for you to go is to go out and try to find a large rubber maid like tub to keep your tortoise in. And to make it more interesting try to find some plants that you can put in there. And feed him a lot of greens such as lettuce and spring mix which i found works well|`|JDsgCDGUaa	Get a rabbit cage ... unless your tortoise is to big ... you can get "play stix" from pets at home ... bend it into a fun shape and the crawl under and over it.<br>  All tortoises are herbivores and NEVER eat meat. It can seriously damage them.<br>  Good Luck|`|3TM4TLdfaa	i have 2 russian tortoses. they live in a large wooden enclosure in my room.  they have a heat lamp and a heater and they are very happy. so what i did is i went to home depot and bought some sturdy pine (or some other kind of cheap wood) and just built a pretty large pen. it was fairly inexpensive; about 40-70 thats about the cheapest enclosure your going to get. it's also the best enclosure you could provide and you can make it as big as you want so i would suggest you should build em' a home instead of just buying him an expenisive aquarium that will shorten his life span. good luck!
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You are a dog owners nightmare.  You don't deserve any animal.<br>  What did you expect if you don't house train a dog?  FFS this is a baby puppy. <br>  I hope you never have children, they take 2-3 years to toilet train. A person like you couldn't cope with that.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be too smart to house train a dog  but evidently it's beyond your capabilities.  How do you manage to dress yourself?<br>  <br>  Stop telling lies because you want to abandon your dog.  Take him to a shelter and stop futzing around and whining.  As if any shelter would refuse to take a 9 week old puppy 'because of his cage problem'. Not everybody is stupid.<br>  Don't ever get another animal, you are not worthy of them.<br>  <br>  Just in case you don't know, it's an offence to dump an animal. I hope someone nails you if you dump this puppy. A session in court might make you wise up.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Call the breeder you got the dog from & tell them you are in no way equipped to care for yourself d/t your mental health issues, let alone this poor puppy. A responsible breeder will take the puppy back & rehome the dog.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	why did you get a dog in the first place?<br>  i wouldn't suggest ever taking another living creature's life into your hands, if you can't handle a simple problem as this.<br>  <br>  have patience with the puppy. it's only 9 weeks old.|`|t3BuTYB7aa	No don't just release him. He is ur responsibility. God people really should be vetted before they should be allowed to have animals. By the way all dogs crap especially babies. So I'd advise u never to get another animal as u can't cope. So unfair. Call more dogs homes, make a proper effort, it's ur fault not the dogs, what about returning to the breeder?|`|JZRPuhspaa	Are you frickin kidding?  You have a 9 week old puppy and you don't think he's going to have accidents!  There are procedures for how to crate train.  I have a 9 week old at home now that I'm still trying to help him get used to his crate and potty train.  Dogs don't usually finish potty training until they are about 4-6 months, but by then should have less accidents.  <br>  <br>  I don't think your crate is big enough.  You should have bedding near the door and a puppy potty pad in the back so the poor dog has somewhere to relieve himself.  Could you hold your bladder for 9-10 hours?  <br>  <br>  You have to train your dog to potty on command.  Which translates to standing outside and repeating the potty (words) command until he pottys and then praising him and rewarding with a treat.  Did you do any friggin research before you got a dog?|`|TWfDAYK4aa	You are complaining about a 9 week old puppy?!!!??  What kind of idiot are you?  This puppy needs to be trained!!  It does not know any better, and you are only making the situation worse.  Puppies are blank pages for us to teach, to guide and direct.  You clearly should never have gotten this pup.   NO YOU DO NOT JUST RELEASE HIM!!!!  If you really need to rehome him, check with a neighbor, or a friend, or something like that, someone who is willing to put more time into him, and teach him what he needs to know, not expect him to just know it.    If the shelters are not willing to take him, what about his breeder??  Maybe they will take him back.  Anywhere sounds better than you.  Maybe it is a medical condition....did you think about taking him to the vet.  You yelling and screaming at him only makes it worse.  If he is a purebred dog, there are breed specific rescues that may be willing to take him in.  Clearly this is a training issue and you do not have the time or patience to deal with it.  Rehome the pup, before you destroy him, personality wise.  Please do something right and good for this baby.|`|BeKUypOraa	Okay, first of all, you cant just release a 9 week old puppy. Not only is that inhumane, but its like asking for that puppy to be killed. It cannot survive out in the world without the proper care. <br>  Most puppies do tend to use the bathroom in the house. What you need to do is have patience and attempt to potty train the dog. <br>  Plus, I really don't blame for the pound not wanting him. They are already severely overpopulated. They don't need any more dogs in there. They need people to take them out and adopt them.|`|g4KHXYFPaa	Yup, you should have never gotten a dog.  Give him to a shelter, and don't get another one.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that you even bothered calling a shelter.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you are full of Sh*t.|`|5a3708261598f993c0978607e5b0ce22aa	Go to your local shelter! Do not put it to sleep. Look at petfinder.com, there are probably tons of rescue groups that could take the pup. Call the Humane Society, they can help give you reputable sources to give the dog up for adoption. <br>  <br>  The reason why the dog poops when u leave is a sign of separation anxiety. He is only 9 weeks old, what did you expect??? It to be born potty trained? Would you put a toddler to sleep because it cant figure out a toilet on its own? Do not just release it into the streets....that's equally as bad as putting it down.|`|LjEv7Bdqaa	Gosh don't just release him that is cruel and inhuman.  It sounds like he has seperation anxiety.  He is still young and trainable.  It sounds like you don't want this dog and are not willing to work with him.  Do you have a no kill shelter.  Or post signs around town free to a good home who is willing to work with this dog.  I got my dog at 8 weeks old do you think he was house trained ah no...I had to spend time with him for a couple of weeks to stop him from going in the house.  It was work but at the end he is a great dog and very well behaved.  Now he is 8yrs old and 5 mths and I can leave him in the house with out a worry.  He also knows I love him.  Dogs can sense how you feel about them.<br>  <br>  There are too many dogs and cats that are just realeased because the owners don't want to take the time to train and care for them.|`|oK5kVlrnaa	Your complaining about a poor little 9 week old puppy? My dog is 4 months old and she still does this. Man, your really stupid. You have to POTTY TRAIN this puppy who clearly doesn't know where to use the restroom. He is probably terrified of you! Do you yell at him or hit him? Your really an animal abuser to even think of just letting him go out in the wild. Everyone who knows how to breathe knows that a 9 week old puppy could never fend for himself out in the wild and will die within a day or two! So listen call up some friends or talk to your local ASPCA, and ask if they will adopt this abused puppy. Btw, 2 hours is alot for a puppy. Their bladder is pretty much the size of a pea! So just get a life and care for this helpless animal!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  WHY DID YOU GET IT IN THE FIRST PLACE???

I'm asking this because you seem to want to know the specific breed standard. Research on the standard for the breed will give you the answers.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting a Boxer as a pet then I suggest you rescue one from a pound.  That way you will save the live of a dog who may otherwise be put to sleep.  There are nice Boxers in the pounds and shelters.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	First of all, it matters why you are getting this dog - do you want to show it, or will it be a pet?<br>  <br>   You should always study up on the breed in which you are interested - look up the Boxer club, and read their breed standard.  That will tell you all you need to know about what they consider the desirable conformation.  You can also find the reputable breeder listing - call a few, and see who they recommend.  Breeders will refer you to each other, if they are good, and you will soon get a good picture of whom they all respect.  Beware of anyone just wanting to hook you into buying their puppy.<br>  <br>    That having been said, also look at what their dogs are like, no matter how they're built - temperament and health are everything.  There's no sense in having a pretty dog you cannot live with.<br>  <br>    Look at their contract, and make sure they not only want their odgs back should it not work out, but they DEMAND that their dogs come back to them - for life.  Anything less is cause to walk away.<br>  <br>    And if you are looking for a pet, please speak to Boxer Rescue.  There are many wonderful dogs in rescue by no fault of their own - and you can help a dog in trouble while getting a dog just as great as any other.<br>  <br>   Make sure you know everything about the dog you are about to get - Boxers are very sensitive and need a lot of attention.  They are sweet, gentle, sometimes very timid - not tough dogs at all.  Just keep that in mind, and make sure it's what you want - and what you can care for properly.|`|7tDDXKEOaa	Whether you were buying a poodle or a boxer you need to know about the breed - and the proportion from head to something? ground, hithers, back, shoulders?

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Private,<br>  <br>  Not all petting results in "butt" raising. It depends on just where you pet your cat. If you scratch a cat fairly near the base of the tail,( the lumbar region) it is an automatic reaction, probably due to nerve stimulation, for a cat to raise the hind end.<br>  <br>  Female cats in estrus generally respond to petting in this manner as a sign of sexual stimulation and readiness to mate.<br>  <br>  While I cannot actually ask my two neutered cats why they respond in this manner, I assume it is a pleasure reaction and their demonstration of enjoyment.<br>  <br>  It is interesting, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association.|`|qqgXDogYaa	actually the don't just put up their butts they tend to curve to your hand. if you start at the head they go up and then when you hand goes to their back their head goes down and back hunches adn then I guess when you hand goes to their tail their rest of the body goes down adn their buts go up....I guess they just do it because they like the feeling they get. they know its a whole head to tail rub.<br>  <br>  idk does this help?|`|UgFntgI9aa	I think it's mostly girl cats that do that.  It's probably sex related.|`|cU5tON0Raa	it could be just a reaction to your touhing them in that  area.|`|1wHuhyPFaa	The Butt Button :D.|`|sPWzvWehaa	A cat's butt is very sensitive. There are a lot of nerve endings in the anal-genital area of your cat. Scratching the cat at the base of the tail is very stimulating and your cat "leans into it" by raising his rump. For a few cats, it may be so stimulating that your cat may bite or take a few swats at you. Don't worry, it is nothing personal. Your cat is just so excited, he must do something.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	I think that if you had enough cats and got them into butt up mode, you could jack up a car!  :-)<br>  <br>  I have one cat that when you rub her back right where her tail begins, she goes into a licking frenzy. She will lick her paws, your hand, feet, until you quit rubbing her.<br>  <br>  I think it's just a sensitivity thing. It feels good to them.
vDINRJAfaa	From the exact day of mating it takes about 60 - 70 days but the average is 65 days for her to have them (around 2 months or 9 -10 weeks). But seriously go to the vet.|`|uFk8ohenaa	go 2 vet.|`|USFXA2juaa	5-7 weeks depending on what type of guinea pig, go to vet immediately though.|`|MMIrGwDAaa	i dont know! hmmmmmm just guess itll bv obvious when u wake up and c more tam 1 in the cage|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Consult a vet.|`|0fygxRHLaa	in seconds!|`|Em2TJrILaa	Guinea pigs are usually pregnant between 50-70 days. If the female guinea pig looks noticeably pregnant than she doesn't have a great amount of time to go. They don't start showing in pregnancy until about five weeks into the pregnancy. So it shouldn't be long. A vet probably wouldn't be able to tell you how for on your guinea pig is as there is no knowing when the babies were conceived and the length of pregnancy differs from each pregnancy. My old guinea pig was pregnant for different amount of times in each of her two pregnancies. A few days before the babies are born the mother will not move around much and she may stay in one place for most of the time. She will also move newspaper (if you have it in her cage) and hay to make a nest for her newborns. She will probably have her babies at night because they like to have them when its quiet around the house so she is not disturbed and the babies will probably be born when you wake up one morning. If its her first pregnancy there shouldnt be any complications in the birth however sometimes complication can arise. I wouldnt reccomend letting your guinea pig having a second lot of babies because there can be complications as her pelvis isnt in the perfect condtion after giving birth. Please go onto this link to find out more information on guinea pig birth and what you need to know just in case something goes wrong: <a href="http://www.oginet.com/pgurney/pregnancy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.oginet.com/pgurney/pregnancy....</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps im sure the birth will be fine.
V4OpQF0caa	The nature of cichlids are to be very aggressive, they won't stop until the other one is dead (which it would die due to stress). Try to go to the pet store and ask which fish are compatible with Oscars this way you don't have to waste your money purchasing fish that would be killed.|`|WXduJP08aa	you dumb @$$ that tank is WAY to small !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so unless you want your damn fish  to die get a bigger tank|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Your fish wont get bullied forever, because it will die first.

I would not sell these pups....|`|Bw18seFqaa	There is a high chance that there will be problems.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to get her spayed to abort this litter.  Not only can there be problems with the pups because of the inbreeding, but because she is so young, a pregnancy and whelping would be risky for her.|`|JZRPuhspaa	You should consider getting them fixed.  Lines of dogs, just like people, run higher risks of developing hosts of issues from inbreeding.  I'd say call your vet and ask about abortion options.  It isn't fair to a small puppy if it is born with birth defects and can't live a normal healthy life because it's humans weren't responsible enough to spay/neuter their dogs.|`|KGppArcfaa	Dont you think theres enough dogs being bred in this world?<br>  So many go unwanted and killed because people dont breed responsibly. <br>  Now you're "accidentally" breeding a brother and sister ugh...spay/neuter your pets!|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Ugh.<br>  Obviously, random inbreeding very easily ends in deformities!<br>  Get your poor dogs spayed and neutered.|`|KGUCstGzaa	there might me deformity or problems with the puppies... you might want to go to your vet and see if he/she can do anything about it.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	In this situation..........it makes more CRAP! & that's pretty freaking "serious"!<br>  <br>  Spay IMMEDIATELY!<br>  SPAY NOW !!!<br>  WHY wasn't done before?<br>  WHY wasn't the dog castrated?

How are you going to keep stray dogs out of your yard and away from your dog?  When you dog gets past the fence and learns it is not getting shocked anymore how are you going to get it back?  Once your dog gets beyond the boundaries why would he want to come back to get shocked?<br>  Take some obedience classes and learn how to train your dog.  This builds a great relationship between you and your dog.

nlRr07dRaa	depends really on how much you feed them, and how healthy they are.. if you're talking about saltwater Angel fish, they ussually change their color paterns when they make the transition into adulthood. which  is pretty cool, then it's about a year after that that they'd be starting to have babies, when the mood is right, some night lighting helps believe it or not, to set the  mood. lol<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|WXduJP08aa	ok the baby thinger they have to be at least 2 years and they take a year to grow full size mine did anyways
lZiBRhGyaa	you could try hand feeding it, the bird thinks you want to hurt it or eat it. so put a big glove on and pick the bird up then set it back down. be gentle and slow!<br>  <br>  or you could put a towel over it and pick it up. hold it until she calms down and then put her back in and say good bird and give her a treat or some more food. *hand feed it* <br>  <br>  put your hand in the cage just let it sit there for awhile , until she gets used to the scent. wash your hands before so it doesnt smell like dogs or something else.<br>  <br>  good luck! <br>  <br>  *ps if it bites like the person above me tap it on the beak or say no and pull your hand away slowly*|`|EZzHjm8Vaa	I had the exact same experience with my first bird.<br>  clip its wings, it will be more dependent on you and be a little less nippy. <br>  everyday take it to a small room (closet, bathroom, etc.) and talk to it, sit with it, train it to step up onto a dowel. <br>  the more you work with it the more familiar it will be with you.<br>  <br>  my bird died before it was completely trained but i did notice improvement.<br>  <br>  be patient because this is normally from mistreatment earlier in life like being left in a cage and being ignored, so it has trust issues. the key is to earn its trust. <br>  <br>  also next time you take it to the vet, ask them for some tips!<br>  <br>  EDIT: From experience i find that birds are more afraid of gloves then most things. use a small towel to grab it out of the cage it if won't come out on its own. and when it tries to bite you, let it, if it knows you are afraid of it, your bird will never make any progress!|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Are her wings clipped...that will help you 100 times better, this way she can't flap and fly away.

nlMfJtxcaa	That is a harness for walking. You'll need to get an actual pulling harness. They don't sell those at Petsmart/Petco. You have to order them online. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pulldoggies.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pulldoggies.com/</a>|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	I've never seen one,but i don't use that chain-store ,unless it's a near emergency.<br>  Check w/those clubs/groups & breed parent clubs who do carting,sled or pulling.
jnzSz3tRaa	6.5-8.0|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Do a 50% water change and another 50% in a day or two. 9.5 pH is too high. You'll need to bring it down to under 8.0. The partial water changes should do the trick.<br>  As far as feeding goes, you can feed sinking pellets or pre-soak the flakes you have in a paper cup and pour it into the tank. Sometimes the globoid (spherical body shape) goldfish will gulp too much air as the try to eat floating foods and their swim bladders cannot compensate. Good luck.|`|XE1n7gRwaa	well, im not exactly sure. to make ANY type of water safe, you could put water purification treatment in it. they sell it at pet stores. this water treatment removes all types of bad chemicals that are in regular water. if you use that, i think you'll be good to go.<br>  i'm not sure about your fish tho....
2Zb0eNfeaa	Goldfish don't get pregnant, they are egg layers. If your fish is a female, she could be egg bound. It's more likely that she is bloated and in bad health. Change 50% of the water, making sure to replace it with dechlorinated water. Do this every couple of days. Your fish may not survive but, the fresher you keep the water, the less problems you'll experience in the future. Remember this rule of thumb, "Freshwater fish love fresh water".|`|IJduG1Nyaa	Well either the fish is dead or has air bladder disease and untreated will be dead with in 24 hours. If the fish still moves when touched with a net then go to a fish store and tell them what is wrong with your fish and they can suggest an antibotic to treat you fish.|`|AA11901352	Your goldie could be suffering from either bloat or from a swim bladder problem and no generally they do not die from swim bladder disease.  A simple remedy for swim bladder is to feed your goldie nothing but raw green veggies.  To keep this from happening in the first place your goldies should be on a diet high in proteins and fiber and low in fats and fillers.  lettuce, spinach dandilion leaves peas green beans zucchini etc are all great to add to their diet once a day or every other day.  Goldfish do not have stomachs like other fish.  sometimes when they do not get enough fiber to pass the food thru the loop in their intestines it will press on the walls of their swim bladder not allowing it to inflate and deflate properly.  Salt will sometimes to this and is also the cause of most bloat cases.  goldies need no salt in their tanks for this reason.<br>  <br>  SImply cut out all food but raw green veggies.  she should right herself in a day or two.  if you see this is going on longer than 4 days, the swimbladder could be caused by a bacterial infection in which case you will need to seek treatment from an antibacterial.  try the greens swimbladder will usually right itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  yes goldfish and other fish can be pregnant.  Gravid simply means great with child or young same thing.|`|XW3oh2ksaa	She is about to die. Fish often die from child birth, because of their lack of energy. When my fish was pregnant he died. Very few fish survive this.|`|EgA87yR0aa	I'm not sure, but I have heard that goldfish have been bred to be exotic and that can make them poor swimmers and that they might swim upside down (even if not pregnant) just because of this.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Uh.... she's probably dead.  Fish don't generally float belly up unless they are dead.|`|Oyb49z7Waa	I agree with Papa and others. It sounds like your fish is nearing it's end but you can make sure you don't have future probs by keeping everything as clean and fresh as you can.<br>  Oh and Willy, no offense but saying fish go through "child birth" doesn't make you look like an expert at anything, sorry dude! Fish spawn whether they lay eggs or have live fry and lots of fish survive to spawn many many times. Besides, if you were an expert, why would you have to work at a pet store chain? You should be at a public aquarium or Seaworld ro some such place.|`|eZGchxfHaa	If Willy is really a fish expert, then why does he say "he"? A goldfish male can't be pregnant...|`|6kIEYQSFaa	i don't think she is pregnant, i think she is bloated and is knocking on death's door. sorry.

Their dog food is enough.  A lot of problems can come from injesting too many vitamins.<br>  <br>  This is a good reason why dogs should only be outside when someone can be out there to watch them.  One of many.<br>  <br>  Here's my story.<br>  <br>  We used to leave our first two dogs out all day while we were at work and school.  One day our neighbor told us of a couple guys who scouted the neighborhood looking for dogs to take.  They went up and looked at one of our dogs.  Thank GOD our neighbor caught them.  She told us puppy mills and dog fighters look for such dogs.  So we quit doing that, and had them outside only when we were home.  We started finding strange rocks in our yard.  Come to find out kids were throwing rocks at our dogs.  So from then on, we only had them outside when we could be out there with them.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad.  Everyone has to learn.  We had to learn as well.  How lucky we were that our dogs didn't get into something poisonous when we would leave them out all day.<br>  <br>  Edit:"It's not like she was unsupervised, my brother and his gf had a little get together out on the deck and she was in the backyard"<br>  <br>  Yes, but were people actually watching her at all times?  Or were they gabbing and not really paying much attention to the dog at all times?  Just something to mull over.|`|yjyd3sQdaa	I'm so sorry.  My trainer has a saying for puppies, if they're out of their create, eyes on puppy at all times, (mine ate everything) from plastic to shoes.  I know this doesn't help now, but when you're ready to get another puppy, and I hope you do, just keep you're eyes on it until does stop that eat everything stag.<br>  It takes time, so be easy on yourself.
NZ68zuq3aa	We are currently taking a Beginners Class at our local Petsmart and last week our Trainer was talking about nutrition. He said that if your Food is not providing the adequate nutrition your dog can develop some really unusual ticks like the ones you mentioned. Maybe it has something to do with your food. Now i don;t know what your feeding him but if it is a brand that you buy at your local grocery store i'd switch him over to a better quality premium food available at pet stores. It really makes a difference.|`|hRikwc00aa	All dogs lick their rear end. They don't use toilet paper, so they use their tongues. Don't discourage him from doing it - he needs to keep it clean back there.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't need his glands expressed, the scooting is probably due to worms. The licking of his feet is probably due to allergies - your vet can prescribe medication. He'll be much happier and more comfortable if you take him to the vet's. If you can't afford to take him, you shouldn't really be owning him - what if there was an emergency?|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Those can be symptoms of food allergies.<br>  Try changing him over to a good, meat based dog food, that does not have common allergens like corn, soy or wheat.<br>  <br>  I would also check to be sure there is nothing on the areas where he walks that could be irritating his skin - like, say, insecticide on the grass.|`|MU4EOe3oaa	Awww, there is nothing wrong! :)<br>  <br>  I have a black lab mix and he does the exact same things! Your dog scoots to release the anal glans. Most likely, the reason your vet did not find anything is because your dog already expressed the fluid himself by scooting. The reason he keeps doing it is because they re-fill, it is uncomfortable, so he does something about it. (I mean, if you have an itch, you scratch it, right?)<br>  <br>  Some dogs do it, some dogs don't because they don't feel the need. I have two dogs, one does it constantly, the other has never done it.<br>  <br>  I find that they both chew between their paws, but the one that "scoots" does it more often and much more. He can work on those paws for 45 minutes at a time. It has never caused any issues though. If your dog is doing it so much that it is causing adverse effects, I would suggest asking the vet what would be safe to put on his paws to keep him from wanting to chew them. (For example, something spicy or sour).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	My dog occasionally does the scooting but I've always been told that its because her butt just itches, lol. As for the licking I'm not really sure why some dogs do that. My parent's maltipoo licks her self alll the time! Its like she can't stop it. The vet gave her some kind of vinegar spray to put on her and it seems its helped a lot.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Allergies, worms, or any other things that might need to be handled by a vet.|`|SmlzU8O1aa	My dog has the same thing, also in her vaginal cavity and ears. It is caused by an irritation to her skin, although yours might be different.<br>  <br>  We got some pills from the vet she takes to lessen the itching, and also she had an operation to open the ear cavities to dry them easier, lessening irritation in there too. Once she scratched her itchy lip so much it swelled and puffed up, lol.<br>  <br>  It is a doggie form of Eczema (or however it is spelled). Once you get the pills and an op if necessary, your poochy pal will be right as rain!|`|lWJ3GafJaa	Your dog may have parasites like worms, or even allergies.

Then just follow the directions on the bag, they usually go by weight.

Its pretty gross, but if you take him to your vet or a groomer who does that, its pretty cheap and will make him feel better.|`|RgYuXggfaa	Could be a few things.  Anal gland irritation, pimples around the anus, worms.  Could be he just feels dirty and can't feel clean otherwise|`|KuUx34hCaa	it could be worms & I've seen dogs with grass strings hanging out if this is the case take tp or paper towel and pull in out|`|hoAeWwJDaa	His rectum/hind area is itchy. Why? Rule out parasitic worms, fleas, full anal glands, skin infection/allergy, etc. Usually, in clinic, it's due to anal gland impaction. The anal glands are now "extra" anatomy a dog no longer utilizes, similar to the useless appendix we have. Once they expressed them to mark territory, in flight (fear), and when they defecated. Some still do. The rest of the canine population does not. It's a common service to "help" the glands release the secretion that builds by stimulating internally or externally to force the debris down the duct and out the rectum. The glands are located at approx 4 and 7 o'clock, sometimes 5 and 8 when looking at the rectum, and their ducts, tiny pin sized holes, are just barely within the rectum, and are visible on cats' rectums.<br>  Pressure builds, discomfort increases, and your dog attempts to express them by scooting, licking, rubbing against furniture or, worse, your leg/arm, and may chew if none of these measures alleviate their discomfort. The actual process of expression is not comfortable, but the relief afterward is IMMEDIATE. Regular expressions and increasing dietary fiber help the glands immensely. Ask your vet how to increase your particular dog's fiber, as this isn't an option for some depending on their health history.|`|tLzKEDMlaa	Anal glands need to be emptied... if you bring him to the vet a tech can just do this and its not expensive. Its a popular MYTH that its because of worms.|`|m7hnnEW5aa	stomach worms. PERIOD.

My puppy will whack my Basset (and I'm having to watch his eyes - it's like having a cat around).  This puppy is extremely tactile, unlike anything I've ever seen with my Bassets and will use her paws/long legs to pull things into her crate through the bars.  So I guess it is possible  lol!|`|HP1pToMOaa	Yes, when my 2 labs were puppies they stood on their back legs and started belting each other with their paws. They were both really angry and had to be separated.|`|6qsocyK3aa	She was probably just playing. Dogs don't punch when they're being aggressive, they bite.|`|kVcRIHglaa	take her to the vet|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No, but I've seen one launch a kung-fu style kick at a human before.

6xf1GfbUaa	Well, in your case I think it would be wise to have him wear a collar. I have two Ragdolls that are strictly indoors and don't try to escape ever, so No, I don't have them wear a collar. It's better to be safe than sorry. Just make sure the collar is VERY comfortable and breakaway in case it gets caught on something that can be dangerous. As far as microchip, that's also a great idea. But it's easier and FASTER for whoever finds Sylvester, to just look at his tag and call you, instead of having to take him to the shelter to get the microchip read, etc. Maybe get him microchipped and also have him wear a breakaway collar, to be 100% sure you get contacted in case he escapes again.|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	yes it should wear a collar with it's address on it's tag, make sure it is a breakaway color so if he snags it on something the collar will come apart and the cat won't be stuck. It is safer for the cat.|`|hgEHJhAqaa	I would say yes on that because if he does escape then if someone finds him they will know that he is owned by someone, because if he doesnt have a collar they might think hes a stray and keep him.<br>  Hope i helped!<br>  Coco Malloy|`|59zYV36Eaa	I had a cat kill herself in a tree with a collar on.  I wouldn't suggest it.  You can get them microchiped at the vet though.|`|YZowEwCoaa	Maybe get it chipped. It's safer than a collar, because collars can choke animals.

Pm8nsCGZaa	I have had it take the same mare anywhere from 20-40 minutes to completely deliver.  A mare can push out up to the shoulders and walk around and lay down and get up several times, to position the foal.<br>  It should never take more than 1 hour (normally), after the water breaks, to at least see the head and make sure the  mouth is uncovered. <br>  On occasion, as my mare did, she gets the foal up to the shoulder and we had had to help her as she was extremely tired.  If you must pull the foal, pull only during contractions.<br>  It is rare that the mare needs help.<br>  Couple good articles with pics:<br>  <a href="http://www.twhbea.com/voice/HowTo/guideToFoaling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.twhbea.com/voice/HowTo/guideT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/breeding/as-foaling.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/breeding/as-f...</a><br>  ....<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2545_deliver-foal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2545_deliver-foa...</a>|`|InxxEQvYaa	all mother horses will show signs of distress when in labor.

No need for a vet!<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  You're welcome, honey.  Feel better soon!|`|zeTGmB3faa	I doubt that your dog caught anything from you. If her nose continues to run, if she acts disinterested in food or water and is lethargic, or has a temperature she needs to go to the vet. No other options.

Keep an eye on her eating and drinking and as long as that is fine she will be ok. If she is not wanting to eat her dog food you can make her some chicken and rice. just plain white rice and boiled chicken with no seasoning.

We all have our own germs.<br>  <br>   If your dog is sick now, he needs to go to the vet for an exam.  Be very careful not to change your dog's diet, or you could have a dog with not only a runny nose but diarrhea or worse, as well - and you certainly don't feel well enough to be dealing with that. <br>  <br>    Don't give her anything but what she normally gets - hopefully, just good quality kibble. No medicine unless you are instructed by a vet that has actually seen your dog in person.<br>  <br>    If all she has is a runny nose, and the mucus is clear, it could just be an allergy to dust or something inside - or it could be nothing.  I would say unless she really looks sick or acts sick, you should keep the chicken soup for yourself, and just see how she does.<br>  <br>    My guess is that she is fine.

1WmDOPGtaa	There are a few ways you can slow him down.  They do make special bowls for this purpose (Brake Fast Dog Bowl is one of the more popular ones).  I've also heard it suggested that feeding the dog out of a cupcake tin (with a bit of food in each pocket) or on a cookie sheet can do the trick.  It is important that you get him to slow down as that kind of gulping can lead to bloat.  2 meals a day is sufficient, but you can always break it into 3 if it makes you more comfortable.  Due to upset stomach issues with my dog he gets 1.5 cups in the morning and 2 evening meals of 3/4 cups (for a total of 3 cups in our case.  As long as your dog is lean, there's no reason you shouldn't stick with 4.).  But splitting the meal alone will not encourage him to slow down.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that free feeding is not the solution, especially with a lab!|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	dogs are the closest thing related to pigs, FACT<br>  but they are cutre =P|`|ddWyRjmVaa	Don't feed him 3 times! They eat as much as they can, even if they over eat! and they will puke. Just when you feed him, if you feed him 2 scoops of doggy food each time, then give him one scoop first and after he eats that give him the other scoop in like 2 minutes.  that will slow him down. and give his body time to digest.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you DONT feed him 3 times a day, or he will get fat! Its kindof a natural instinct, he automatically thinks that that meal is his only one, so hes going to eat it all! If you open a whole bag of dog food he will try to eat it ALL. :/<br>  <br>  <br>  lol. Hope this helps. :)<br>  Answer mine?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307083320AAVhN5j&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|enC9TvxUaa	-I think your idea of 3 times per day is a good one.  Also, does he need a little more food.  Try giving him the same 2 cups, but 3 times daily.  Dogs will eat fast sometimes as they are afraid the other pack members would get their share- that's just in their nature.|`|8GeNdCsIaa	you can get special bowls that forces ur dog to slow down in eating. its got dividers in the bowl that gives 3 spots for the food to be in so it really makes them slow down. we have suggested it to several labs that are like that and it really helps.  feeding him 2 times a day is good. i wouldnt go 3 times a day and i wouldnt feed once a day. wat type of food are u feeding him? sometimes they are SOO hungry because they are lacking the essential diet needs that some foods dont provide.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	If you keep the food from him all day except 2 times what do you think will happen?  I would give him free access to food however, in the beginning just add a bit to his bowl during the day.  It will take him some time to realize that food will always be around when he is hungry.  Then, he will slow down.|`|09d20450f0f0079c750b91125f312a2aaa	you shouldn't free feed labs!!! They are pigs, and some will overeat( most will).|`|9ANfcQKCaa	IS he fat? Can you feel his ribs? or do you have to push in a little to feel them. I don't think you have to worry about how fast hes eating but more about how much exercise does he get,and is he at the right weight. Just because that's what the bag says doesn't mean that's the same for every dog. If he get Alot of exercise then he may need a qtr cup more at meal time.. and visa versa. The burping is normal mine does it too. Does he get all the water he wants this also may play a role in what your seeing... You might want to ask the vet when you see them next... or just call if your really worried.|`|pC5GiAgsaa	This is exactly the same with our labrador lump! She's very slim (at first we were worrying that we were overfeeding her) but the vet said she's a healthy size. She will gobble up the food in 37 seconds (she has been timed) and she then goes on to lick out the bowl. There's nothing you can do to slow down labs from eating. Keep giving him the right amount of food (we feed our lab twice a day as well) and don't give him access to food all day at all or else, like you said he'd be really fat. You can't slow them down from eating because it's just one of their characteristics. Keep doing what you are it's sounds like you are doing a good job!|`|pCEaLSmNaa	Maybe try giving him small portions. It'll still be the same amount of food but the time will be more spread out.|`|iVQULHqYaa	You are right to be concerned about your Lab gulping his food. Try feeding him at shoulder height and put a ball into his feeding dish. You may need to get a larger dish and the ball must be too big for him to get into his mouth. Or get a "Buster Cube". You can fill this with his food and there is no way that he can gulp, it will amuse him and keep him occupied. Google "Buster Cube" they are not expensive.
pMbvyHMTaa	NO her pelvis bones would have fussed by now which would stop her from giving birth is she is pregnant you should realy of bred her when she was 6 months if you were planning on doing so as at this time they are fully matured and there pelvis bones have not fused yet but would be if not given birth by between 9 months to a year|`|vDINRJAfaa	I wouldn't if i were you. She is too old to give birth. You could risk losing both the babies and the mother. But if you really want too... Swap the cages first. Put the male in the females and the female in the males so they can get each others scent. Introduce them in a neutral territory with something separating them but so they can still see and smell each other. <br>  When you think they are ready to be introduced, and they seemed comfortable with each other when you put the barrier in between them, put the female in the males cage (never the other way round) and let the deed be done.<br>  If there is fighting separate them and keep trying to introduce them at a late date.<br>  <br>  P.S. A little fighting is normal.|`|59zYV36Eaa	I wouldn't recommend breeding them but if you're gonna do it I wouldn't put the male in the females cage.  Hamsters don't like each other usually and you may have some unfortunate events.|`|I0qkCacKaa	it can be difficult not to split them use sellotape first|`|B1OUPWxXaa	Yes, it can be safe. Use the Split-Cage method (Search for how-to do it online) After they get comfortable with each other, they MIGHT mate. But there is an overpopulation of pets in the United States so if you breed them the babies might have to be euthanized or something because there is no place for them. Just make sure that there are homes for them before you breed them.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Educate yourself properly BEFORE attempting to mate.  You should do your own research (other than just asking a bunch of strangers) if you seriously want to breed your hamster.  If you don't even know how the whole process starts, what are you gonna do once she's actually pregnant and ready to have the babies?  You'll have no idea what you're doing.
12b2ae165a26d98cccbcd9cbb7c2f71aaa	Yep, the videos are a little hard to see, but it looks like he's doing pretty well. One of the hardest things to teach a horse new to jumping is not to run at fences - they tend to speed up because they get nervous about jumping.<br>  <br>  I'm biased about martingales - many times I see them being used because the rider is not good enough to train the horse, not because the horse "needs" it. Work on getting your horse to relax and bring his nose down at all speeds before you go to higher jumps. Work on gymnastic expercises before going to higher jumps. Too many people want to go higher before they and their horse are ready. <br>  <br>  Have fun!!!|`|dBRxfRGqaa	i don't jump, but it looks like you did a good job and your horse is having fun!!!!|`|VRoiGUW9aa	He has a huge, fast canter! Try to hold him a little when you are approaching the fences. Then he is less likely to hit the poles. Just take it real slow. Don't go any higher until he completely clears the course no problem. It looks like his training is going well! Good Job!
NZ68zuq3aa	Sure the Vet can issue you a new one. Happened to me too and there was only a small fee. I wouldn't take chances and replace it as soon as possible.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I would call the vet's office and check on what you need to do to get a new one.

3zv2bbolaa	Continue to give the medication. It takes a few weeks, but she will eventually develop a tolerance to the Phenobarb and start to act like her old self once again. <br>  <br>  If you take her off the Phenobarb she will start to seizure and those seizures can eventually kill you pet. Be patient and please follow the directions.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	If the medication is not suiting her, rather than just stop, go back to the vet and tell the vet. They may have to tweak it a bit for a while until they get the right amount that will control the seizures without affecting your dog.  If you stop, the seizures may get worse and your dog could die. <br>  <br>  Good luck with this.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Call your vet.  There are lots of meds for epilepsy and it may be this one is not for her.  But don't stop her meds without talking to her vet - suddenly stopping can make her condition much worse.  You may have to wean her off this drug and onto another that may be better for her.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	DO not stop the treatment. Seizures can kill.

AA12048299	One individual image costs us $75 in our area.<br>  <br>  But remember, when talking about radiographing all 4 legs, you're not talking about one image per leg. There's several joints in each leg (pastern, knee, coffin bone/ joint, pedal bone, hock, etc.), and depending upon what you want to look at, several angles per joint involved (medial, lateral, oblique, etc.)<br>  <br>  Only a personal consultation with your vet will tell you exactly how much you're going to have to spend.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	It varies from vet to vet and it depends on if you want digital x-rays or not.

They will more more than happy to help you.|`|RloOJ43haa	It depends on how many angles you get.

M9o5WpOqaa	Put a good sized piece of polar fleece in the cage and the mother will make a nice warm nest for her babies.Thoroughly check the fabric from time to time to make sure none of the babies gets trapped and is suffocated.I almost had this happen to one of my babies when it crawled underneath the fabric and one of my big ratties laid on top of him so he couldn't breathe or get out...Good thing I was in the room and saw him trying to get free.<br>  Also,keep the cage in a warm spot in the house,away from drafts.|`|dhljEfddaa	Most of the time breeders will put a lot of extra bedding in the cage. The mother will typically use the extra bedding to build some type of shelter that will keep them warm and then they will lay on them, sort of like birds. Also, you could insulate it by putting a small blanket underneath the bedding for added warmth.<br>  <br>  Also, if the mother is not keeping them warm by building a shelter or sitting on them then you will need to keep them inside a small blanket a watch them very close.|`|dsypxyh4aa	I used to have some rats, and one had a litter. Their "home" was an old-fashioned washtub, and the floor of it always had fresh cedar chips in it. That worked real well for her and her little ones. Of course, the walls of this "house" were high, and solid, so they were not subject to drafts. The top was open, and they had a wooden "house" with ramps for them to run in and out and around, and "downstairs" into their "yard" This was a homemade housing setup, and my little rat kids liked it just fine, they had room to run, lots of it, and they were safe, warm, and not in a cage.  Good luck with the new family!|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	Depends on how much money you are willing to spend.  Typically the mother keeps the warm just fine on her own with the help of a little extra bedding.  Carefresh and toliet paper work great for that.  Also you can buy heat lamps for reptiles and heating pads that stick the the bottom of teh cage and plug into the wall.  However, I think this only works with glass aquariums as buring plastic isn't good.|`|PMWj0mcFaa	You light them on fire trust me this works wonders!!!

AA10977265	I honestly dont know if lotion could be harmful. But if you think about the fact that leather is actually an animal hide, and lotion helps mosturize skin, then well I dont think its probably a bad thing for it! <br>  <br>  I take care of my boots the same way I do my tack. I scrub it with saddle soap, and then I oil it with like leather balsum or something like that. It's kept my boots in good condition. Wiping your stuff down with a damp cloth after your done is fine, but if you do that like every day you need to oil it really well at least once a week! Otherwise it will get really dry and cracked.|`|waoh4KUZaa	Well first of all, rinsing them with too much water can make the leather hard and cracked, even if you do dry it.<br>  <br>  As far as hand lotion, I've never even thought about that! Haha. The only thing I can think of is that it might make the leather greasy and slippery. If they're tall boots, I'd just stay away from putting it on the inside where your leg hits the saddle.<br>  <br>  But hey, if it works, and they're still in good condition, I say keep doing it. (:|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I wouldn't do it.  Get something like Horseman's One Step which is a GREAT conditioner which contains lanolin (Rendered sheep fat).|`|YHpePjb9aa	i wouldnt suggest using hand cream on leather boots. Also wetting leather can make it crack and brittle. After a hard day competing i strip all my tack and  wipe the worst of the mud off with a damp cloth. I then clean it with saddle soap and oil it etc. before putting it away. As for my boots... i have aigle long rubber boots for xc which you just wash down with warm water and some long leather boots. I wipe them down with a dry/damp cloth and then rub plenty of saddle soap into them (and sometimes oil if they are fairly dry because its been a hot day etc.) I then leave them to dry and polish them up with some boot polish. For jodh boots i just scrup them off with some water and then rub saddle soap into them... the same goes for my gaiters and chaps.<br>  <br>  I bought some dublin advanced boots a while ago to go under my gaiters for local shows and found them very comfy... although they rubbed slightly if i didnt wear long socks! I wipe over them with saddle soap every time i use them which feeds the leather and helps to keep them fairly waterproof. I also polish them before a show!
kvHqnR5Haa	When I was in high school my boyfriend's great-grandma had about 30 dogs in her tiny little house - obviously not a healthy situation.  I turned her in and helped find homes for the dogs so that they wouldn't have to be put down (by the way, I was able to find homes for 18 of them, the rest went to area humane societies).  There was one in particular that melted my heart, he was about 3 pounds and a bundle of fur who kept sitting on my feet :)  I really wanted him but my dad said no - I brought him home anyways and my mom absolutely fell in love with him.  When my dad got home he was gruff about it so we set him on his chest after he reclined in his chair - from that moment on Alic was a daddy's boy!  My dad fell in love with him immediately and we had him for the next 12 years :)  <br>  <br>  The last six years of his life we gave him IV's 3 times a week for his kidney failure - he sure cost my parents a small fortune but we would have done it all over again because he was our baby!|`|uofIL0flaa	I've had my cocker spaniel for 12 years now, so since I was 7.

This is then shaken well and spread over the pet’s skin to keep the fleas away. You can also make effective flea collars by rubbing an essential oil of eucalyptus , tea tree , citronella , lavender or geranium on webbing, rope collar or even a doggy bandanna .<br>  <br>  <br>  Essential oil bath:<br>  If your pet is badly infested, it’d need an essential oil bath. So, draw the bath using a few drops of tea tree or lavender essential oils. An alternative is a herbal flea dip made from fresh rosemary leaf <br>  <br>  <br>  Internal flea repellents:<br>  Garlic when fed to your dog works wonders. This is because its smell is excreted through the skin making it ‘inhospitable’ for the fleas. Brewer’s yeast tablets also help in controlling fleas. Another good alternative is natural apple cider vinegar that makes the skin more acidic and unpleasant to fleas and ticks.<br>  <br>  <br>  External flea repellents:<br>  Sprinkling diatomaceous earth, generally in the filtration system for swimming pools, all over the yard is an effective way to keep the fleas at bay. You can also put cedar chips along your fence to keep the fleas out. Planting a herb, called tansy, around your pet’s pen will also keep the problem in check. All these external repellents are effective natural home remedies for fleas<br>  <br>  Citrus repellent:<br>  You can make an effective flea repellent from lemon by cutting it into quarters and immersing it in boiling water. This is then steeped overnight to get you the repellent. By spraying this all over your pet, especially behind the ears and generally around the head, and also at the base of the tail and the ‘armpits’, you can rid it of fleas.|`|fnLbedPgaa	No such thing as a home remedy to get rid of fleas.  There are some out there which allegedly prevent them, but having tried them in the past, I can say they are not effective.<br>  <br>  Frontline or Stronghold are the two best flea prevention treatments in my experience.<br>  <br>  As the person who used garlic said - they "only" found one flea.  One flea in their coat = 20 in their carpet and floorboards.  That's 20 more fleas than you'd have if you used a veterinary treatment.<br>  <br>  Makes you think.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	There are no tried and proven home remedy. Frontline Plus works great.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	None of them are effective. You need a pesticide.

I have a Golden Retriever and a purebred Mongrel.  What I like best about my Golden is his sunny disposition.  He never gets aggressive, he's not afraid of anything, he obeys about 98% of the time, and he's a couch potato.  What I like best about my mutt is that she only barks when a stranger is coming to our door, she is the most focused dog I've ever known, and she's smart as a whip.  Tell her something one time, and she's got the idea; tell her twice and she's got it down pat.  My golden isn't at all smart - I think he left his brain at his breeder's.  But his temperament more than makes up for it.<br>  <br>  What's YOUR favorite dog?  Why?<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	My very favorites are herding breeds. Border Collies #1 & then Aussies.

AeTqQL4Gaa	Assuming the tank was established, it probably came with some live rock.  Bristleworms live in live rock, so you will probably always have a few in the tank whether you can see them or not.  You really shouldn't worry about them unless they are harming the livestock in your tank.  I have a few in mine and I only see them every other month or so and they don't seem to be hurting anything.  If you're dying to get rid of them, I would try scooping them out with either a net or a little paper cup (that's what I've used before, a little easier).  I just flushed them down the toilet.  And be sure you don't touch them -- ouch!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	bristle worms are one of the more beneficial critters in a marine tank. They are scavengers, eating fish waste, left over food, plus they help aerate you live sand. The last thing you want is to kill them.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	just catch it with a net, don't try and stab it like you tried before|`|Um8osMNuaa	lf you know where it lives, just take out the rock and pour boiling water on it, or poke about with a meat skewer until it's dead.<br>  Bristle worms are scavengers and will eat waste products but they will also feed on fish, especially gobies that will back into holes in the rocks on a night to sleep, if any of these holes contain a bristleworm they will snack on the fish, they can also burrow into corals, especially clams.<br>  Some see them as beneficial, l don't.|`|M3ffmTmWaa	Bristle worms feed on plankton and other bits of organic matter, including algae or pieces of dead organisms.|`|YZowEwCoaa	I'm no expert, but I think when they turn white they are sick and going to die|`|nlRr07dRaa	This topic is an ongoing argument between fish keepers<br>  but.......<br>  Bristle worms are good for the tank, especially if you're new to the hobby. you're better off leaving them alone. they are good scavengers and detritus eaters. they will eat all the excess food in the tank.  i wouldn't suggest getting rid of them. they're usually out of sight during the day and do all their scavenging at  night...  alot of them are bicolored, either dark and half red, or light and half red. you probably only saw half of it, as they do like to hide in the rocks!<br>  <br>  but I don't suggest you take them out.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	They can reproduce and harm your tank. This page gives tips on removing bristleworm:<br>  <a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/msubpestbworm/a/aa102198_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/cs/msubpes...</a>|`|urIm4YaBaa	You can get bristleworm traps at virtually any store that sells aquarium supplies, but it will probably be unnecessary.  A vast majority of species are harmless detrivores, and they'll do more help than harm. They won't harm livestock, but they will eat an animal that died of other causes. Their bad rap as killers is likely a result of this after-the-fact scavenging.

Ema8Rxi5aa	Without actually seeing the cat and her situation, I can't be sure of the problem. The #1 reason she wouldn't use her box is if it's dirty. You should clean it out at least twice a day and change the entire box ever month. If you are sure it's adequately clean, here are a few things you could try:<br>  <br>  1. Have you recently changed litters? If so, switch back to whatever you were using before. In order to change litters you must do it very gradually, adding a small amount of the new litter to old and increasing the new litter gradually over the course of a few weeks.<br>  2. Is your litter scented? If so, change (gradually) to unscented litter. Sometimes cats cannot handle the smell of the perfumes/fragrances in scented litters. I had a cat like that...<br>  3. Do you use a covered litter box? If so, switch to an uncovered one. The odor of the cat urine/feces can get trapped in the box and make the cat not want to go there.<br>  4. Is the litter box near the cat's feeding dish? Cats should NEVER have those two objects close to each other. Cats naturally urinate/defecate at the boundaries of their territory and eat in the middle. Having the two near each other is usually perceived by the cat as unsuitable. So they choose to "go" somewhere else.<br>  5. Since the cat has already urinated outside of the litter box, make sure you scrub the floor where she peed really well. If cats smell their own pee somewhere, they're very likely to "go" there again.<br>  6. Is her litter box near a noisy appliance? If so, move it.<br>  <br>  If all of this fails, shut the cat in a small room with her litter box. Keep towels on the floor. This is a last-ditch option to retrain her.<br>  <br>  Lots of luck!

AA11211495	Stand in front of your horse.  Use your left thumb and slide it into the right side of his mouth.  Reach back and see if you feel any sharp edges.  If you do it is time for a floating.  Use your right thumb to check the left side of the mouth.<br>  <br>  Younger horses usually need their teeth floated twice a year.  When horses get older the growth slows down and you can back it off to once a year.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i would recommend having your horse's teeth floated once a year, it helps keep them flat, so that nothing sharp forms, also it helps the horse keep food in their mouth and chew it well|`|eXDDODfHaa	well if ur horse doesnt eat that fast like it used to and is spiting a lot of grain back out that is when he needs to be floated.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I just run my fingers along their teeth and if they are jagged I float them.<br>  But thats me.  You can take a look inside his mouth to and see if they are smooth, level, and rounded on the edges or sharp and jagged.<br>  He probably needs a float at that age if he hasn't been done in a while
oCJVZ1WCaa	Hey(:<br>  As you canter keep kicking on the horse,  use your whip if you need to - just give him a little tap with it on his bum. <br>  <br>  x|`|jUjkvis8aa	Before you actually ask for the canter, you should be in a steady trot with lots of impulsion. Lazy trot= lazy canter! When you're giving the aids for the canter, make sure they're clear. If there is no response with your leg and seat aids, give them a small tap with the crop just to back your legs up. Make a clicking noise with your tongue aswell.<br>   As for keeping the canter going, make sure you're not nagging with your legs all the time because your horse will switch off. You generally find that because riding school horses have been ridden by all kinds of riders they become "dead to the leg", so you need to get their attention by doing the above. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|motYSp5waa	Hmmm.. My horse is like this sometimes . You can start with NO WHIPS AND NO SPURS!! If you are using whips and spurs stop!<br>  they might not like cantering because every time you start to bring them into a canter then the think they will get whip ed and or spured.. That is 1 way here is another. Start out with your horse on a lunge line and then after a few mins each way Cantering get on him/her and ride on the outside close to the fence and push her/him into the corners and tap her/him into a canter and everytime you feel the pony slowing down lightly tap him with your inside leg and do this everytime you ride with all of your ponies for a week each ! Hope this helps!<br>  Mykkie!|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Go into sitting trot.<br>  <br>  Pick up the reins - a warning to the horse that we are going to be doing something a bit different!<br>  <br>  Inside leg left on the girth, gives the horse something to bend around, outside leg behind the girth, gives the forward impulsion and also prevents the canter from swinging.<br>  <br>  In a corner of the school, squeeze without speeding up the trot and you should have canter.<br>  <br>  My bet, without seeing you is that you tend to rush into the canter and are rising trot, perhaps realising it, and of course the horse will not canter.  He thinks you want to trot faster so obliges!<br>  <br>  Also feel the rhythm of the canter and decide to give a little squeeze every three beats or every time the horse's shoulder comes forward, you decide.  Swing the hips and these should all help you to keep going.|`|1itC64nVaa	If you're riding western then you'll have leather ropes for the bit. So with the excess rope, (I know you might think that this is kinda cruel but trust me, horses want to obey you) slightly whip him/her on his/her shoulder. And kinda kiss when you want to canter, but you probably already knew that! And if he/she (your horse) is (well your still saddling it or your not on it) then you can take your hand and slap its stomach. Right by the cinch/girth.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	Sit down deep in the saddle and then urge the horse on. It would probably help to use your whip, at least untill the horse knows you're in charge. I find that just having a whip that the horse can see helps, you don't always have to use it.|`|GIBbKJQ1aa	It may be you or it may just be the horse.  A lot of riding school ponies are lazy and slow because they have to be ridden by loads of beginners around the same arena everyday which gets boring.<br>  <br>  When you get on the horse make sure that you wake him/her up.  If you need to give him a few slaps with the whip then do this because it will make them listen to you.  You need to keep your inside leg on the girth and move your outside leg back.  Try not to pull back on the horses mouth as they will then think they need to stop.  Ask the instructor as well.  You will not be able to get a perfect answer on the internet and the instructor will know the horse because they work with them everyday.  Some lazy horses need you to ride them with shorter reins as well.<br>  <br>  How long have you been riding for?|`|VRoiGUW9aa	Do you own a crop? If you do, then that helps A LOT with the stubborn horses. I have a super stubborn 18 year old Appendix and when I use the crop, he listens. Just wack them with the crop like 3 times. It will help. If the horse is a good horse that rides out well and you don't need any motivation to get it moving, (like my thoroughbreds) then just remember to keep your legs on them and make sure you aren't pulling on the reins. Keep it nice and collected. Push your heels down in the stirrups and keep them like that no matter what. Give the reins a little bit but not so that they are too loose.|`|a9a67d339b01d91d50de293f9c0a0e8caa	Unfortunatly you wont be able to find much help here are we cant see how your riding and we dont know the horses.

If you can possibly, have someone work with you giving you a 'longe line lesson' where you can work only on your seat & position (no stirrups, no reins ideally) whereas your ground person can worry about the horse.  <br>  <br>  My Morgan has a hard time holding a nice canter together until he has been working for a good six weeks, because he just doesn't have the strength to carry & hold us both until he is in better condition.  <br>  <br>  Also, think about riding circles for awhile....it is much easier to keep your horse on the bit in a circle than on the straight.  I would limit the jumping to only gymnastics-type work until you feel comfortable as a rider and you are capable of holding your horse together.  Practice lots of walk/trot, trot/canter, canter/trot, canter/walk, walk/canter transitions.  Transitions are the key to improving quickly.<br>  <br>  If you'll work on those exercises for a month or so, you'll be able to keep your horse in a canter without a second thought.  It's not a matter of speed, it's a matter of balance.  Good luck, I am sure you can do it with your great attitude.
3TM4TLdfaa	well there is no such thing as a dwarf tortoise. i have 2 russian tortoises and they make great pets no matter what people say.<br>   you can buy them from petsmart or petco. they are about 50-70$ but they are worth it and there average size is about 4-8 depending on how old they are and what sex they are. that is about the smallest tortoise you are going to get in captivity. and they are the best in my opinion. trust me just about any other tortoise you get is going to get much larger. the foods they eat includes lettuce, carrots other vegies and some fruit but do not feed them any sort of meat they are strictly herbivores. so i hope that i helped you and good luck with your new little friend.|`|Kx6WPr0aaa	sorry kid , but you may have to break the federal law as it  illegal to bring exotic animals into the U.S.A. turtle's carry many viruses

Has she even researched available breeds?<br>  <br>  Why not just give her little supplies - like a bowl for the dog, or a little bed? Dogs themselves don't make good surprises, EVER.

d6kekKgeaa	i don't know much about the showing except that their is a cat one. as far as norwegian forest cats go - they are fluffly balls of love. they get larger then most cats, have medium long hair and are one of the biggest teddy bear type cats i've ever meet - in apperiance and in attitude. - supper mellow and very friendly. love people, but not "always" a huge cuddler - they will shadow you around and lay near you, but not always big on cuddles, but when they want them, they turn into the biggest babies. :)|`|u7vrul2Faa	Norwegian Forest cats are beautiful. I have never been to cat shows before but there is an American Cat Fanciers Association.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.acfacat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acfacat.com</a>|`|4aAhEK9daa	The main cat registries:<br>  <br>  TICA - The International Cat Association - <a href="http://www.tica.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.tica.org</a><br>  <br>  CFA - Cat Fanciers of America - <a href="http://www.cfa.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfa.org</a><br>  <br>  ACFA - American Cat Fanciers Association - <a href="http://www.acfacat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acfacat.com</a><br>  <br>  There's also other registries in other countries.<br>  <br>  Each registry has breeds they recognize and breeds they don't.  For example, you can show a Ragamuffin in the ACFA, in CFA they're in the "Miscellaneous" class and in TICA they're "Register Only" - they're not a recognized breed and can't compete.<br>  <br>  Cat showing is LOTS of fun!  I have three shelter cats - all obvious purebreds but without papers.  At TICA shows they can compete in the "Household Pet" class and earn points, titles and regional and international standings just like the pedigreed cats.  Instead of Champion, though, they're "Master".  So you earn Master, Grand Master, Double Grand Master all the way up to Supreme Grand Master just as pedigreed cats earn Champion up to Supreme Grand Champion.<br>  <br>  Pedigreed cats compete as Kittens (4-8 mos), Cats (unaltered cats 8 mos and older) or Alters (altered cats 8 mos or older)  They are judged to the breed standard for their specific breed first against cats of their same breed and color and division then against others of their breed and then against others in their coat length and class.  For example, a judge will look at all the Red Classic Tabby and White Exotic Shorthair Cats and pick Best of Color.  Then of all the Tabby and White Exotic Shorthairs pick Best of Division.  Then of all the Exotic Shorthairs pick Best of Breed.  Then when picking cats for the final in that ring pick Best - 10th (sometimes more if more cats competing) of all cats in that class.<br>  <br>  There's two types of rings - Allbreed and Specialty. In an Allbreed Ring the judge picks Best-10th of all the cats in that ring - both long and shorthair.  For example, Best might be an Abyssinian, 2nd a Singapura, 3rd a Ragdoll, 4th a Persian, etc.  In Specialty Rings the judge has separate finals for both Longhair and Shorthair.  So in the Shorthair Specialty ring Best might be an Exotic Shorthair, 2nd a Bengal, 3rd a Burmese, etc - all Shorthaired cats.<br>  <br>  In each ring your cat accumulates points for how well it does in its Colour, in its Division, in its Breed and in its Class.  It also earns points if it makes it to the Finals and points are based on how well the cat placed and how many cats it beat. These points are how cats earn titles.  You have to have a certain amount of points and win a certain amount of Finals in order to advance.  <br>  <br>  The Finals points are also used to track how the cat scores Regionally and Internationally.  The show season runs from May-Apr and a whether a cat is an Alter, Cat or Household Pet it's top 50 points make up its score.  So obviously if you go to shows with higher cat counts you stand a much better chance of moving up in the rankings.  Here's my cat Mocha's points so you can see how they track it <a href="http://ticamembers.org/estimated_standings/HHP/cafemochavalencia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ticamembers.org/estimated_standin...</a>  We have a few more shows this season.  Any Finals that she scores 187 or higher in will mean those scores will drop down and the higher scores add on.  She's currently #1 HHP in the Northwest and #8 in the world :)  She may end up moving up as high as 4th Internationally but the cats in 1st - 3rd have points from shows with REALLY high cat counts that we could never beat them.  A lot of people "campaign" their cats out of their Region to accumulate more points or are lucky enough to live in an area with higher cat counts.  Showing cats can get VERY expensive.  We've done 9 shows this season and have spent over $5K.  I can't imagine how much those that have done 15-20 shows have spent!<br>  <br>  Cat shows are hosted by cat clubs and are generally two days long with six rings each day.  So over the weekend a cat will be judged 12 different times by different judges.  Cats stay in cages in what's called the "benching area" until they're called to the ring.  They're then put in cages with just their numbers on them.  The judge doesn't know the cat's names, who owns the cats, any titles they've earned, etc.  They just have the cat's breed, colour, sex and age.  Obviously after awhile a judge knows who owns what cat but judges tend to be very ethical and pick the cats they truly feel best adhere to their breed standard.  They also obviously like cats that are friendlier and seem to enjoy being shown.<br>  <br>  With Household Pets they're obviously no breed standard since cats in this Class may be obvious purebreds, like my three, cats of no particular breed or pedigreed cats that don't fit their breed standard - like a Japanese Bobtail born with a full tail, a LaPerm lacking a curly coat, etc.  Cats in this Class are judged by how well they're groomed - the coat is clean and free of mats, ears are clean, nails are trimmed, eyes are clear.  A large portion of their score is also based on personality. Does the cat mind being held?  Is it friendly?  Percy, my Persian, is sitting out the next couple of shows cuz he's failed miserably with this LOL.  The last couple of shows he's looked amazing - impeccably groomed.  He's also even sat up and pawed at toys - judges love that.  But then once the judge puts him back into his cage he hisses at them and swats at them  - VERY bad!!!  So you can't have a Household Pet that looks great but isn't friendly to the judge - nor can you have a friendly, playful cat with dirty ears and untrimmed claws.<br>  <br>  I've had a lot of fun showing over the last two show seasons.  I'm very active with a no-kill cat shelter here and two of my cats are from that shelter.  Percy's from another.  So for me it's a great way to promote that shelter and the adoption of adult shelter animals.  A lot of people don't realize that you can find obvious purebreds at shelters.  And even more don't realize how wonderful ADULT shelter cats are - all of mine were adopted between 2 1/2 to 4 years old.  I've also met tons of really great people and made lots of friends.  One of them is my best friend now and we roadtrip to shows together.  I've also learned SO much about breeds, coat patterns and colours from the judges.  Ever heard of a Peterbald or Selkirk Rex?<br>  <br>  I don't really know anything, though, about the Norwegian Forest Cat.  I do know someone from Idaho that has a gorgeous black one that competes in the Alter Class.  Your best way to learn about the breed would be to go to shows and talk to breeders and owners of them.  They're not as popular as Persians, Ragdolls, Maine Coons but you do still a few of them at shows.  If you go to the calendar at <a href="http://ticamembers.org/calendar/" rel="nofollow">http://ticamembers.org/calendar/</a> you can see when one will be near you.  Your best bet to see the most Norwegian Forest Cats would be to go to Regional Show.  Each Region has show where they have a banquet and awards ceremony and hand out the Best-20th awards for Kittens, Alters, Cats, Household Pet Cats and Household Pet Kittens.  These shows always tend to have at least 200 cats at them as everyone that's going to be receiving an award goes to them.<br>  <br>  I've been showing my three shelter cats at TICA shows in the Household Pet Class for two show seasons:<br>  <br>  RW SGM Penelope Princess Pumpkin (Exotic Shorthair)<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/penny-ta6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/penelope/pen...</a><br>  <br>  QGM Percy (Persian)<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/cats/chanan/percy-10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/cats/chanan/...</a><br>  <br>  SGM Café Mocha Valencia (Ragamuffin)<br>  <a href="http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-ta5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretocious.com/mocha/mocha-...</a><br>  <br>  (RW = Regional Winner, SGM = Supreme Grand Master, QGM = Quadruple Grand Master)|`|Uh6EV4wgaa	cat and dog shows are cruel!<br>  poor animals are suddated and are drousy  for a whole day!!<br>   wat a watste of a day in their lives1
fd544611fb7e3c21f3077bb64d757972aa	For 40-50 dollars you could probably get a nice ten or maybe even twenty gallon tank. You may even be able to get a starter kit with rock, water purifier, net, and other items for that price.<br>  <br>  The Pros of the tank you have picked are that:<br>  It will easily fit on a desk or table<br>  they are flashy ; ).<br>  <br>  The Cons:<br>  water is hard to maintain<br>  can only have a few certain fish.<br>  <br>  With this type of tank I would really suggest only a male betta (no snail, many betta's will attack even a snail).<br>  You could probably get away with a few guppies or neon tetra's.<br>  the problem with keeping fish is you always want to expand. At least that is waht I found in my own experience we started with One betta nad now we have 10 fish. (not all in the same tank of course!)|`|BMri9tITaa	I wouldn't get the Petco one, because it's only a 5 gallon.  And I wouldn't get the Wal-Mart one, because it's Wal-Mart.  I would go with the tetrafish.com one by process of elimination.  There doesn't seem to be any real difference between the Wal-Mart and the Tetra fish one.<br>  <br>  Although if you intend to pick it up in-store then go with the Wal-Mart one, because that's a physical store as opposed to ordering online.<br>  <br>  Check out this site for some suggestions on stocking a six gallon: <a href="http://www.aquariacentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=120193" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariacentral.com/forums/sho...</a>|`|D1KT9ioJaa	1 arowana<br>  or<br>  2 gold fish|`|jnzSz3tRaa	well they are all pretty small.  you could put some neon tetras, or small guppies, or some small cat cories.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	They all seem pretty much the same to me.<br>  The pros are: they don't take up much space and make a great home for one betta and a snail OR for a few male guppies.<br>  The cons: small tanks are difficult to maintain good water parameters after cleaning, you shouldn't put more than 3 small fish in (though people do and their fish die), you are limited as to fish choices, not appropriate for any types of goldfish.|`|ktLmwXo2aa	I wouldn't recommend guppies, they require a 10 gallon tank, as they love to swim around and is very active. I personally would recommend a betta(only one though, as they are aggresive) fish. They don't need that much space, I put my betta in a fish bowl and it's fine and healthy. Some cons would be that there aren't that many fish that live in a 6-gallon tank. Such as the guppies and tetras. And there is a limited number of fishes you can put into the tank 2-4. The pro is it is easier to clean and maintain, though you do have to change 20%-30% of the water more often. It takes up very little place. And it's very good for a betta.<br>  <br>  *If buying a betta, you can only put one in the tank so buy only one. They are really violent and attack any other fish smaller than themselves in their territory. They are territorial!<br>  <br>  *Make sure you olden the tank before putting the fishes in! Keep the tank running for atleast one week without the fishes. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your new fishes!!! :)

Depends on the outfit. Is the dog comfortable? Can it move freely? Does it seem unhappy about it? <br>  <br>  In purses?  Is it safe? Is it totally enclosed where the pup has no chance of falling out?<br>  <br>  Pampered? Colored nails? Why not? Was the dog hurt in the process?<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth. I have chihuahuas. Love them dearly. I'm a chihuahua kind of gal. My brother just got his first chihuahua since growing up and leaving home. I'm all excited, and can't wait to go visit the new baby. <br>  As to my own, yes, I dress mine for when it's cold, or my little girl if I'm taking her out. She enjoys it. <br>  She has a purse and a stroller. Both let her enjoy the environment without being at risk of getting stepped on or equally as dangerous grabbed by some snotty, ill-mannered kid. Either are used for shopping expeditions. Neither are used for walks around the neighborhood. <br>  I used to paint her nails. I also used to be quite bored. I have better things to do now I guess, as I haven't painted her nails in about a year.<br>  <br>  So long as the dog is comfortable, safe, and happy, I see nothing wrong with any of it. My little girl enjoys those things. How do I know this? It's all right there in her body language. She feels safe and secure in her purse or stroller. She sits happily and alert. Inquisitive.

I really loved him when I was younger, but lately he's so annoying. They bark way too much, and its an annoying pitch. Why do people dress their dogs?? They are dogs NOT people, they don't need clothes. Also, a dog doesn't belong in a purse. They are not an accessory, they are an animal and shouldn't be used for image purposes. If you do this then you really want to be like Paris Hilton, don't you?! (fyi- she dumped the dog, maybe it's your time too) Also, why are people pampering these things?

Yes, you need bedding.  Also, litter box training will keep your rabbits cage cleaner.  I use aspen bedding for my rabbit.  Never use cedar or pine bedding.

They are a major commitment of time, energy, and money - think about food, vet, and supply bills.

They make great companions but they're a big responsibility.<br>  <br>  It's not really fair to compare these two things. If you're looking for something to have fun with, get the ATV.

hRikwc00aa	1. Buy a crate and crate-train him; housetraining will be so much easier. Dogs view the crate as a den and will not potty in it. Make sure it's just big enough for him to stand up and turn around in, or he'll potty in one end and sleep in the other. If you don't want to have to replace crate, buy a divider.<br>  <br>  2. Have a set schedule - make sure you take him out at the same times every day. Remember, he can't hold it for much longer than 2-3 hours at this point. Make sure you feed him at the same times too.<br>  <br>  3. When you take him out, have him on leash and stand in one spot. Only give him five minutes - he needs to learn this is something to do quickly. If he goes, give him lots of praise and give him a yummy treat, then reward him with at least a short walk.<br>  <br>  4. If he doesn't go, take him back in and put him immediately in his crate, so he doesn't get a chance to potty on the floor. Try again in twenty minutes and repeat until he goes.<br>  <br>  5. If he has an accident, don't scold or punish him. It'll only confuse him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Add: Nothing reliable takes only a week. I don't consider most dogs reliably hosuetrained until they are at least six months old. Be patient with him.|`|2YovZwdZaa	what i do is after eating take him out after drinking take him out, when he wakes up take him out and while hes awake every ten Min's or so take him out and give him plenty of fuss and praise when he does it outside ive had my pup 4 days and hes nearly there. just remember the worst thing to do is make a big fuss of doing it inside now matter how mad it makes you.|`|NZ68zuq3aa	Take him out about 10- 15 times a day. First thing in the morning and last thing at night. Reward him with treats and praise when he does go outside. Do not scold him inside unless you catch him in the act. It will take time and probably will not happen in a week, because your puppy needs to build up his bladder control and that takes time.|`|lvpBedrvaa	ayyyyyyy this is easy.!<br>  When ever he pees or poops find him and take him to it and put his nose in it then take him to the door and put him out for 20 Min's he will be house broke or crate trained in a couple days (three days)|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	Agree with Emily, but wanted to add 2-3 hours is a bit optomistic in my opinion. My 6 month old can only hold for 2 hours max. Also don't let them pup see you clean up the accidents, and make sure all smells are removed and the patch is dried. It can also help if you put a treat or toy over the area he/she soiled to disassociate it with being a potty area.<br>  <br>  Alllso, regarding the lead/leash thing, my puppy would not go potty until she could wander around and find her spot on her own, so see how that goes.<br>  <br>  Crate training is brilliant, and my pup was majority trained within the week.<br>  <br>  PLEASE do not put your dog's nose in it!!|`|Kk6LQAf9aa	He's 12 weeks old. You can expect no more! <br>  <br>  In order to house train him make sure you take him outside to pee without fail upon waking from sleep, immediately after eating and every half an hour during the day. Let him sniff around etc and when he 'performs' praise him or give him a treat. If he doesn't perform don't get mad, just remain quiet and don't treat him. <br>  <br>  If he goes in the house quietly pick him up and take him outside. DON'T scold him. He won't know what he's done wrong.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	It won't happen in a week or two...<br>  <br>  Puppies learn new skills at different rates. It will take time for your puppy to develop a firm understanding of where it's acceptable to potty and where it is not. It will take time for your pup to consistently understand that all of the house is the den, an area not to be soiled. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogownersdigest.com/news/libr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.dogownersdigest.com/news/libr...</a><br>  <br>  Puppies need to relieve themselves frequently, sometimes as often as once an hour. There will be many accidents, especially at first. Consistency is the key!<br>  <br>  He will learn not to be afraid of going outside. Sit with him out there and praise him when he does potty outside. Have a tiny treat ready too!
C5YBD3F1aa	Pit Bulls were originally bred for hunting vermin and bull baiting. Whenever bull baiting was outlawed, people used an alternative; dog fighting. Now, people think that because a dog was bred for fighting with another dog, that it is going to be vicious and cannot be trusted. WRONG!. During a fight, if one of the owners felt that his dog wouldn't last till the end, he would walk between the dogs and pick his dog up and just walk away. Any dog that nipped, bit, growled, snapped, etc. at any of the owners/trainers were immediately culled. Human aggression wasn't tolerated, for multiple reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Pit Bulls were raised in the home with children and family, family dogs were actually commonly used in the fighting ring. They had to be lovable to people and children of any age, shape, or size for this reason.<br>  <br>  2. Pit Bulls had to be pulled apart in the fight, and the humans were the only ones that could do so, so they had to reach in and pick the dogs up. They, of course, didn't want damage done to themselves, so they wouldn't tolerate any dog that showed any aggression towards them.<br>  <br>  3. Sometimes fights got really bad, and a man would soon lose his valuable fighting dog that had won him many fights and money, so he would reach in and grab his dog and leave. The dogs had to gain a lot of trust with the owners, and they weren't allowed to show ANY signs of aggression.<br>  <br>  <br>  What people don't understand about these dogs is that they are TERRIERS. American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier. TERRIER, TERRIER, TERRIER! They are lovable, intelligent, but they can be aggressive due to their prey drive. They have INSTINCTS! They want to chase anything small that is moving fast. And, many people think that because they were bred for fighting, that they will turn on them and attack... Again, wrong. They were raised for dog-dog aggression only, for the reasons above they had to be very friendly with any person they came around. A man and his fighting dog often strolled around town in a casual fashion, meeting many people and animals and the dogs NEVER attacked anybody or anything. They only fought whenever they were supposed to, whenever they were in the ring with another dog, whenever the smoke was rising in the air, when the money was being held in the air, when people were yelling bids, and whenever their owners TOLD them to attack.<br>  <br>  So, they went from vermin hunters to bull baiters to dog-dog fighters to what they are today... Misunderstood, lovable pets who would be perfect for anybody that understands Terriers. AKA, anybody who understands how to TRAIN and CONTROL a dog.<br>  <br>  And, today, now that dog fighting is illegal, stupid little gangsters think it is cool to make them aggressive to people. These are often the ugly little silver hippos you see with the huge spike collars and "XXL BULLIES" label slapped on them. People don't get it that Pit Bulls are sweet dogs, they just have to be raised and trained correctly. With all of the human-aggressive bloodlines coming in, and all of the abused/neglected/untrained dogs being bred, they are started to inherit different traits that are getting worse by the day. That is why people need to leave the breeding of them to the professionals, the ones who HEALTH TEST, BREED ONCE A YEAR, COMPETE WITH THEIR DOGS, GET THEIR CANINE GOOD CITIZEN CERTIFICATE, etc. Anything that will prove to people that they are GREAT dogs!<br>  <br>  Now, this is all coming from a 13 year olds mouth. It is pretty sad that a CHILD  is more educated about the breed than adults are, and that I can understand them more than any average, mature adult that has a lot of thinking ability, more than a child! People just need to sit down and do some research instead of saying that they are mean, aggressive, bad dogs, etc. They just don't even know....|`|PM23RDycaa	Pit bulls were used in animal baiting, usually bull and bear baiting. They were and still are especially down south in the US as catch dogs when hunting feral hogs/boars. They worked cattle and have been family protectors and military dogs.<br>  <br>  Ignorant people however have taken much of the breed and bred them to be even more animal aggressive than intentioned for the breed. As such they have also bred in HUMAN based aggressive which the breed was never meant to have.<br>  <br>  alykate - who fed you that line of bull? Pit bulls used for hunting do not KILL the animal. They with the other dogs being used to hunt runt he animal down and catch until the human hunter can kill it. An APBT would be unlikely to effectively get at the throat of a 200lb wild hog without being seriously injured if not killed.<br>  <br>  A properly raised APBT will be fine around ANY human including a child. Dogs don't just snap no matter what the media says.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Pit Bulls have bad raps because they are one of the most loyal breed of dogs on this earth.  Because of this, they will do anything to please their owner.  If it means killing another animal or a human they can be trained to do it.  What most people don't understand is they are NOT born aggressive.  They do not suddenly CHANGE when they get older and kill children.  This comes from a dog that has not been obedience trained, raised properly, exercised and has had a thriving environment.  It is due to HUMAN error and neglect, not the dog.<br>  <br>  Now, what were they originally bred for?  Several different things.  They were bred to be nannies.  That's correct.  Mind the children.  They were also used to bring down Bulls.  <br>  <br>  What makes people so afraid of a Pit, so cautious and believes the dog will suddenly turn on you is the heightened media coverage every single dog attack gets.  They also do not correctly define the animal.  Most people cannot tell the difference between an American Pit Bull Terrier and a Bulldog.  <br>  <br>  The media RARELY gives coverage for the Pit that saved a child's life.  Or make note of how many APBT were at 911 as search as rescue dogs.  Oh, they are also used in drug detection and therapy.  <br>  <br>  The American Pit Bull Terrier is one of the finest breeds I know.  They are extremely strong, beautiful animals.  And their dedication and loyalty is unsurpassed.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	they were originally bred for bull baiting in england. when bull baiting was outlawed they fought them against each other. there determination to please there master made them prime canidates for this. so what happened is the wrong people took a great family dog and tarnished its reputation by abusing them and fighting them. there strong build frightens alot of people, thats what intrigued the people that have taught there pit to be human aggresive. they are the best dogs to own in my opinion. i happen to be a mommy of 2 wonderful pitbulls|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The “pit bull” was originally bred to fight bulls in pits.<br>  They are an aggressive dog, and the aggression has not been bred out of them.

They are known for turning on their owners, their neighbors and anyone else in sight.<br>  <br>  Pit bulls are, at best, semi-domesticated.  They cannot be trusted.  A 60-pound pit bull is more than a match for a strong, 160-pound man.<br>  Ask Michael Vick.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Pit bulls have a bad reputation because the breed usually has irresponsible owners. You aren't going to get a tough wanna-be macho guy with a lab, they get pits because they look tough. Then they train them to be "tough" dogs to show off to their friends or to protect their houses. I'm not saying all owners are like this (I own a pit and i love her to death!) but they get the bad rep from stupid owners.They were originally bred to be bull baiting dogs.|`|KUWDICSVaa	Bad humans create ill tempered dogs. It has nothing to do with pit bulls themselves. Humans were aggressive with them and they were abused. Put that together with the strongest jaw in the dog kingdom, and you have a problem.|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	They have such a reputation because they are such powerful and smart dogs. (i own an american pitbull terrier) Originally their job was to take dog big game such as deer, bulls, and hold them by the neck or face until they are too exhausted to fight. This was outlawed in the early 1800's which is when they began being used as fight dogs. <br>  <br>  All these dogs need to be happy, healthy, and balanced is a reliable owner who puts the time and effort into the dogs training. Its all about the owner and the love they are given.|`|Muz6YB18aa	Pit bull is a catch all term, especially in the media. They lump all bull dogs, staffordshire terriers, staffordshire bull terriers, bull terriers, mastiffs, boxers etc into one group and call them pit bulls. There are many different types of staffordshires ie american, australian etc, many types of mastiffs ie neopolitan, english, french, tibetan etc. Really endless list of dogs that are lumped into the media's description of a pit bull. This would account for the fact (per one study) "that pit bull breeds are the breed most often involved in fatal dog attacks in the U.S. Out of 238 dog bite deaths for which the breed was known from 1979 to 1998, 66 were caused by pit bull attacks (over 20%), more than any other breed."<br>  <br>  "There are studies that claim certain breeds are more likely to attack than others. A study by Merritt Clifton, which analyzed serious attacks in the U.S. and Canada between 1982 and 2006, determined that Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, Presa Canarios, and their mixes were responsible for 74% of attacks studied and 65% of fatalities.[6][7] Another study indicates that pit bulls and their mixes were involved in approximately one third of the reported human dog bite-related fatalities between 1981 and 1992, while Rottweilers were responsible for about half of those fatalities reported between 1993 and 1996."<br>  <br>  You need to take into account that when these studies are talking about pit bulls, they are including MANY breeds of dogs. When the are talking about rottweilers, they are ONLY including rottweilers.<br>  <br>  Most dogs included in the Pit Bull catch all term are very powerful dogs. Powerful dogs need training and exercise. Unfortunately, many owners do not give their dogs proper training or exercise, which may lead to problems. <br>  <br>  "They were built for performance. It is common knowledge however, that the Pit Bull breed was developed for blood sports: Bull baiting, bear baiting, and later, dogfighting. What is not common knowledge is that in the days of organized dogfighting, the handlers of the combatants were habitually IN THE PIT with the dogs for the duration of the fight. They were required to pick up and separate the dogs several times while the dogs were in full fight frenzy. Before the fight, the handlers were required to wash each other's dogs, and after the fight, the badly injured dogs were often treated at ringside by strangers. Any dog that attacked or bit a handler (even if it was the other dog's handler) or anyone else at any time was culled, often on the spot, and would never have been bred."|`|NYzCYCmJaa	Pit bulls have a bad rep because all you hear about them is the bad stuff.  You never hear that Hellen Keller had a Pit bull or that the first recorded case of a service dog was a pit.  Pit bulls were not breed for dog fighting, they where originally breed for bull baiting and for fighting bulls for the Romans.  No not all pits are bad it is all in how you raise them.  They are a very dominate breed that need an owner that can handle them and know who they will react in different situations.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	APBTs have a poor reputation due to horrific breeding lines creating a dog that isn't family motivated, but instinctual destroyed and crafted for dog-dog aggression, and has a predisposition to aggression (due to untested breeding stock). <br>  <br>  Breeders today are looking for smaller, stockier bodies with larger heads. NO regard for temperament or natural tendencies. PROPER breeders are looking for taller, leaner, longer dogs with a family oriented personality and shows zero aggression.<br>  <br>  The ORIGINAL dogs of this breed were bred first for hunting vermin and baiting boars and bears. The second wave of dogs were bred for fighting, and this kept up for many many many years, which is why so many "lines" of this breed have tendencies for dog-dog aggression (properly bred dogs have a low tendency if no tendency for dog aggression).|`|sHTpXUScaa	They are having a bad press because of irresponsibly owners let them run around. Pit bulls were bred to bait animals for centuries and unfortunately people who had them first were not good people. They were into drugs, gambling, and making profits from dog fighting. Pit bulls found their way into world where it is very cruel to them. <br>  <br>    It is a myth when someone says pit bulls have the strongest jaw of all.  It is all false so be cautious who do you want to believe in. They are great family dogs as long as they are in the right family.|`|TVOMzct3aa	Pitbulls were originally bred for bull baiting - where a dog and a bull fight in a ring. When that was deemed inhumane, they were used for dog fighting. For the longest time, that became illegal too, and they were bred only as housepets. They were the American Dog and even considered nannies to children. Now, even though it is still illegal, they are mostly bred for dogfighting. So yes, the fact that they were, "Bred to kill" is definately true, however so were airedale terriers, yorkshire terriers, jack russell terriers.. All terriers were bred to kill. Not just hunt, but kill.<br>  However, unlike other terriers, APBTs are more prone to just wanting to please their people. Think about - If, god forbid, you were a dogfighter, would you want a dog that was stubborn, didn't do what you wanted them to do(attack things) unless it wanted to, and tried to bite you when you took it to the fighting ring, OR would you want a dog that just wanted to please you and was easily trained, and excited about going to "work"? This is why bulldogs aren't as common in the dog fighting ring. Bulldogs are stubborn.<br>  EDIT: Oh yea, just figured I'd add this in. APBTs don't even make the top 5 dog breed bite strengths. Number one is the rottie, number two is the GSD.|`|2YovZwdZaa	how many more times 9/10 times its the owner, i had a staffy, well he looked more like a pit bull and he was as soft as sh*t and ive got a bullterrier, all my dogs where around kids and other dogs with no problem, if anything they loved the fuss and attention. no matter what the breed if you teach it something its gonna do it, so like i say BLAME THE OWNERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|SJ9PuBvdaa	Pit Bulls do have a bad rep, but they aren't bad. They were actually bred and built for dog fighting because people are stupid and would place bets. But the truth about them is that they have learned to become aggressive towards other dogs and not people. But if they have good owners then they aren't aggressive at all. They only attack people or are aggressive towards people if the owners teach them to be like that. They are actually loving pets. There are no bad dogs, just bad owners. Understand??|`|m7hnnEW5aa	They were originally built for fighting and guarding.<br>  <br>  Regularily used to enforce things years ago.

I would like to know the secret too!|`|pMbvyHMTaa	you should not let your kitten go outside at all this is bad and lasy ownership you may as well toss it in the dump yard and tell it to get on with it. cats are bred to be inside at all times and the breeder of the kitten would have told you to keep it inside and maby let it explor your yard when it is  a year old but. you can not be so lasy as to make it go into someone elses back yard to poo and wee it is totaly discusting.<br>  <br>  I HAD SOMEONE DO THIS AND THE RSPCE TOOK THE CAT OF THEM AND GAVE THEM A WARNING AS THEY GOT SO LASY AS TO NOT FEED IT OF LET IT IN THE HOUSE SO IT WAS MATTED UP AND EMASIATED AND JUST ONE POORLY LITTLE CAT.<br>  <br>  JUST DONT DO IT|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Why would you want to do that?  If he's going outside, you have no control where that would be.... including your neighbors' flower beds and porches... which would create an unwelcome nuisance for them.  As well as the reality that it's simply not safe outdoors for animals you care about, there are too many hazards.   Add in that many cat illnesses become apparent by blood in the litterbox, and you'd be giving up finding out about those illnesses until it was likely too late to do anything about it... while increasing your pet's chances of contracting some of them by letting him roam around outside..... sorry, it just makes no sense for you to do this.|`|T3dbweQ6aa	Why do want a cat to go outside? There is nothing but trouble out there for a cat. Wild animals, dogs, poison leaves, kids with BB guns, fleas, neighbors that don't like cats and might poison them, being lost and confused bad weather, cars, traps and crazes that steal them to kill them. I could go on and on. Please leave the kitten in the house...|`|MKWrLkH8aa	Don't. It's up to your cat where they prefer to use the loo and if it's only a kitten there's still a chance it will decide on outside, particularly when the weather warms up.|`|VJnmHFR0aa	get rid of the litter tray, leave a door or window open.  Cats are so clean they hate to soil their environment, they will try to get outside.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Don't.  It's not your garden they will probably go in, and why should your neighbours clean up after YOUR cat. <br>  <br>  At least your cat is going in a litter tray, all you've got to do is empty it, if you can't do that, don't have a cat.|`|WI8qeyJmaa	rig up a bug zapper screen on your litter box...when it pees, it will get the idea it's better outside|`|zz982Znjaa	Alright. You all aren't very smart. Well, most of you anyway. My cat goes outside to use the bathroom and he likes to play outside too. But he also is allowed inside when he wants to come in. He NEVER comes in all matted and gross. And if he gets dirty, he is definitely groomed. Some cats don't like to be inside at all times. Some do. Give your kitten a chance to spend some time outdoors with you to see if he/she likes being outside. If it doesn't like being outside, then you should just accept that it's going to use a litter box. But if your kitten DOES choose to be outside, be sure it is up to date on ALL shots, becuase there are a lot of bugs and animals that carry diseases outside that can spread them to your cat. Also, make sure to check frequently for any odd-looking bites, cuts, scratches, or any other wound and get it checked out and treated right away. As far as the animal going in someone else's yard, try to train it to go in a certain place. My cat always goes near the trees at the back of my yard. Never in anyone else's. Remember, they're much cleaner than dogs, so your yard won't stink and you won't have any neighbor problems. Hope this helps!|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Move the tray near to the door to the outside. When the weather's fine move it right out. Your kitten will gradually stop using it. It may stop anyway, my cats did. I only stopped providing a tray about a month after they last used it. They HATE the tray if I have to keep them indoors. One of my cats held his bladder for 30 hours to avoid using it!|`|723qR6p8aa	Hi.x<br>  Put the tray to the door like someone else says and in good weather put the tray outside and gradually move the tray further away untill the back of the yard the kitten will eventually get the message,<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Mwah/.x|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Try moving the "tray" a little every day towards the outside door.<br>  Once by the door move outside.<br>  Ideally have a "cat flap" as well.
meMF69tXaa	You need to change your vet. Any vet that would recommend that a rabbit stop eating pellets is out of his/her mind. Rabbits need pellets as a main food source.|`|Q0yg21TZaa	Your vet probably meant to take her off on that particular pellets you're giving her.

vDINRJAfaa	Take the father out. Chances are he is distracting the mother from feeding her babies. They only feed once or twice a day and this itself only takes around 10 minutes. When she has done this she will hop out the nest and leave them on their own until the next feeding time. She doesn't sit with them like other animals, in fact she aviods them.<br>  To check if she is feeding them, when you get a chance to look at the babies, look at their tummys. If they are round and plump then she is feeding them and if they are shriveled and skinny then you know shes not. It is easy to tell because if they have been fed they are like right pot bellied pigs and their bellies stick out way far. If not their stomachs are flat and straight and sucked in. You can solve this by holding her above the babies and giving them a chance to suckle.|`|pJBtWbtnaa	Are the kits(babies) In a nest box? if not they should be moved into one that is lined with hay and the fur the doe(mother) pulled.If they are on the floor of a cage they will most likely end up crawling and falling out of the cage. they also can get chilled and this will kill them.<br>  <br>  Does only feed the kits once and at the most twice a day. they do not like to feed them when anyone is watching. They do not stay with the kits unless they are feeding them. They just stand over the kits and let them nurse, it usually takes less than 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  You can check the kits and they should be checked daily, preferably at the same time each day. Just give the doe a treat to keep her occupied. Reach in the nest and pick up each kit and check it. If there are any dead ones remove them immdeicately as this can cause the rest to get chilled and die. If the doe is feeding them they will look round and plump. If they are skinny and wrinkly looking they are not getting fed. Place the kits back in the nest box. If she is not feeding them and most does do not start feeding the kits for about the first 36 hours. it takes this long for the milk to come in, you will have to force her to feed them. It is next to impossible to hand feed baby rabbits. To force her to feed them they must be in a nest box. Place the box on a table, place the doe in the box and then cover her and the whole box with a towel. Let her sit in the box for 15 minutes The tkae her out and return her and the nest box back into the cage. You will need to do this 2 times a day for at least a week.<br>  <br>  If you need more help you can email me privately|`|s9xucwbSaa	i once had a surprise litter of kits (i didn't no there were there until i started to clean there mums hutch out and they were around a week old when i found them lol) i didn't no what to do with them as i had no idea that they were on the way but as you have had kits before i am sure you no all that you have to do for them ( nothing much just give the mum extra food and water)  <br>  i wasn't sure if the mum was feeding them so i looked around on some websites and found out that because the mum has pulled out al her fur it means you can see there **** so just squeeze a couple of them to see if any milk comes out if there is any milk you will have to take the kits away from the mum and hand rear them but not meant bunnies will survive if they are hand reared so best to keep them with mum if possible buy some kit formula to feed them if there is no milk.<br>  <br>  if there is milk the bunnies will be fine but you should take the dad a way from the mum and kits otherwise he will try and mate with the mum which will cause stress and she may abandon the and when the kits get to 4 months if any of the are girls the dad will mate with them and that would kill the kits as they would be to young to have any kits of there own.<br>  <br>  but you will probably not ever see the mum feed the kits as she will do it very early morning or late at night when it is most quiet|`|AA12124588	Daddy should leave...he might be making Mama nervous?<br>  Another interesting fact about Rabbits is that they are only fed a few time a day.

It can also be an "American" Shorthair, but it's less likely.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Tabby is NOT a cat breed. Tabby is the term used for the markings on a cat's coat. <br>  British Shorthair is the breed of that cat, and "Black Silver Tabby" is the color markings of its coat.<br>  <br>  ADDED: Even though British Shorthair are more commonly seen in Blue (Dark gray), they also come in Tabby. Other people are saying that it's most likely an "American" shorthair, but I strongly disagree. That kitten is very "stocky" and usually American SH are a lot SMALLER when kittens. So NO, that kitten is not an "American" Shorthair. <br>  Domestic Shorthair is NOT a breed, but more like a title for a cat that doesn't really have a pedigree or it has a wide conbination of different breeds. You can very well tell that the kitten in your link is an actual purebred British Shorthair.

O6r6Zqsuaa	FERRET<br>  <br>  here's a bit about them.<br>  <br>  They are a bit like dogs, in the way that you can walk them if you wish, and they are also like cats by how friendly they are and that they love nothing more than to play with you and then curl up on your lap. They also do not take up as much time as dogs and cats, you don't have to have them out all of the time, you can have them around the house during the day and in their cage at night, or they can just live outside 24/7<br>  <br>  The best food you can give a ferret is dry ferret food from a pet shop, you can also give them dog food, but not on a long term basis as it does not have enough vitamins etc in it, you can also feed them on chicken and rice which they seem to enjoy, they can also have an occasional treat of sultanas.<br>  <br>  You can either keep them inside the house with you giving them their own room or what ever, or you can keep them outside in a cage, but make sure it has enough space or them to play in.<br>  <br>  They smell! so to combat this you can give them regular baths using ferret shampoos, also keep their living space clean to reduce the smell, the other thing is that you can get them neutered and have their glands removed.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are very hyper animals, so make sure that they have plenty to play with, and if you can't spend most of the day with them then i would recommend getting more than one. You can also take them for walks on a lead just like you would a dog, although they will not walk very well they will soon get used to it.<br>  <br>  When they are babies they will bite, so if you either flick their nose or squeeze their paw every time they bite you they will soon work out that it is bad for them to bite.<br>  <br>  Um... i think that's it, hope i helped.<br>  Here's some handy websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.all-about-ferrets.com/total-f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.all-about-ferrets.com/total-f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Estat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Estat...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://my.en.com/~rcmcr/info.html" rel="nofollow">http://my.en.com/~rcmcr/info.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ferret-universe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferret-universe.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maferrets.org/info/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maferrets.org/info/index.htm</a>|`|stMcVPCMaa	There are many adult dogs in need of rescuing that are already fully "trained"- particularly house trained and some general obedience training.  Dogs need a couple hours a day of your time, but really, if you establish rules for behavior and are consistent in enforcing them, dogs don't take as much time to train as you might think.  Most of my dogs' training comes about naturally in my daily interaction with them, when I play with them, pet them, groom them, walk them, etc.  Unless I have a specific problem to solve (pretty rare!) I never spend time "training" my dogs.  And they are EXTREMELY well behaved!<br>  <br>  Even saying they take a couple hours a day can lead you to believe you don't have time, but you can easily adapt activities you're already doing now to include a dog.  If you watch TV or chat on the phone-sit with your dog and pet or cuddle him while you're watching or talking.  If you're at your computer, a small dog can sit in your lap.  If you exercise by running, walking, roller-blading, take your dog with for his daily walk.  (and if you don't exercise - you probably should start! :-) )  The rest of the interaction is just fun play time, especially if you get a short-haired dog that doesn't require much grooming.<br>  <br>  Definitely get a dog!  Cats can be nice but dogs are much more fun to play with!|`|7QDDI7TFaa	i would say a cat or an older dog.  they are both good choices and do not need much training.  i would advise getting them from an animal shelter or rescue.

As the lion usually represents different aspects of our own inner nature either as we are, or as we think ourselves to be, then in this light the dream must be correlated by using as many of the symbols you see in your dream and carefully analyzing the different actions of each character. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lions <br>  To see a lion in your dream, symbolizes great strength, aggression and power. You will overcome your emotions and/or difficulties. As king of the jungle, the lion also represents dignity, royalty, leadership, pride and domination.?You have much influence over others. You need to exercise some restraint in your own personal and social life.? <br>  <br>  To dream that you are attacked by a lion, indicates that you have many obstacles to overcome.

Bathing cats takes the natural oils from their  fur which it needs to keep healthy.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Unless there is an urgent emergency need to do so      usually a cat cleans itself thoroughly and in general only show people with some long hairs actually wash and blow dry but that is started from a very early age as cats in general hate water re baths.If the cat has managed to get oil or some grease you can and should remove it with different mild de-greasing agents as remember a cat will lick itself after a bath so watch what you use if you are determined to wash your cat.As said if an emergency l would use the services of a vet groomer or a vet to advise you as what to do a phone call does not cost much.If you wish to wash for no good reason do NOT it is NOT necessary l have ye to meet a cat that does not wash itself!|`|0mb78CiWaa	Cats do not need baths not as often as dogs.

But if you are insistent about bathing your cat, you should start when they are young, say about 8 months.  Introduce the cat to the water gently.  Bathe it again in about 3 weeks.

Treatments may include one or more of the following: <br>  <br>  <br>  Vomiting should be induced if ingestion was recent.<br>  <br>  Activated charcoal can be administered to bind poison remaining in the stomach.<br>  <br>  Gastric lavage (pumping the stomach) <br>  <br>  Intravenous fluids <br>  <br>  Additional treatments may include:<br>  <br>  <br>  Anticonvulsant drugs<br>  <br>  Blood transfusion<br>  <br>  Muscle relaxants<br>  <br>  Drugs to treat kidney failure such as furosemide and dopamine <br>  <br>  Drugs to reduce swelling of the brain such as mannitol and steroids<br>  <br>  Vitamin K1<br>  <br>  Oxygen<br>  <br>  Heat support<br>  <br>  Nutritional support<br>  <br>  Cage rest<br>  <br>  Antibiotics may be prescribed if a concurrent infection is identified or suspected. <br>  <br>  (Taken from link below.

I recommend the glue traps that can be placed out of the reach of larger mammalian pets and against the wall near places where mice or rats/ crawling insects might go.  A cat who accidentally gets entangled in a glue trap can easily be freed from it by using scissors to free it from the trap and then using a small amount of mineral spirits to remove the glue from the paw, followed immediately by soap and clear water.  This event was very unfortunate and could have been avoided with the proper planning and preparation.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	There really isn't anything you can do at home for rat poisoning. Poisoning with other things - well, presumably your friend can be in phone contact with a vet? Depending on what the poison is, it may be appropriate to cause the animal to vomit to bring it back up - this is what a vet would do - but depending on the poison (e.g. rat poison!) this may cause more harm than good.<br>  <br>  So, the thing to do is ring a vet to find out what you can do at home if you're too far away from a vets in an emergency.

I have the prevue hendrix fiesty ferret home, it is slightly smaller than the FN 142 but I have no complaints about it.  You want a cage that has sturdy platforms and ramps and bars. You also want a LARGE door for ease of cleaning (the FN141/142 the whole front opens so you can easily get in to clean the Prevue Hendrix feisty ferret home the front 1/2 opens so still easy access) Both these cages are expensive (over $150 each) but well worth it and you will never need to replace them, and they can both house multiple ferrets. <br>  <br>  Go to ferret.com and go to the forum section ther are 1000's of posts about cages and housing them, how and what to feed, behavior, and anything and everything you could ever want to know about ferrets. <br>  <br>  Based on your questions about feeding you need to do alittle more research before you get a ferret they are ALOT of work but well worth it<br>  You should also buy the book "Ferrets for Dummies" before you get your ferret it is the BIBLE for all ferret owners, it breaks down everyhting you need to know before you take you fuzzy friend home like how much you should expect to pay in vet bills, food costs and feeding options, how to ferret proof your house, training, and everything else you could want to know the book is worth it weight in gold

xyPpruSjaa	Hi!! As an owner of both, I must say they are both AWESOME!! Overall I would pick gerbils though, I will tell you a little about both though. Gerbils are very hyper and SUPER SUPER soft and fun to hold because they run all over you. You must get two though because they will get lonely and can even develop depression on their own. Hamsters, sleep all day and thats the only bad thing Hamsters are super fun to hold though because they are cuddly. If you love to have a pet you can watch scamper around and play you and you love a pet that when you hold they are active and run about and explore, choose gerbils. If you want something that sleeps all day, wakes you up at night, but is fun to hold and even falls asleep in your lap, pick a hamster. I believe pet stores only sell Mongolian gerbils. There are tons of different colors to choose from. Mine are agoutie pied (a gerbil color) and the other one is polar fox (another gerbil color). Hamsters: You have kind of a lot of choices....there are tons of different types of dwarf hamsters, but there is one kind of Syrian hamsters. Syrian hamsters are the large fat ones :) They are super kind and fun to hold. I do not prefer dwarfs because they are VERY fast and they bite alot. Have you ever seen Teddy Bear hamster, Black Bear Hamster, Golden Hamster, etc.? Did you know those stupid names are made up by petstores? There is only 1 type of syrian hamster. Pet stores just give each color a name because if you were a 5 year old, which would you rather choose...Teddy Bear hamster or SYRIAN hamster? Which sounds better lol. <br>  <br>  Housing:<br>  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not get plastic cages, the ones with the 'fun' tubes? Yeah those are dangerous, very expensive, and a pain to clean. Get a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium with a mesh lid. They are super easy to clean and actually mostly less expensive than the plastic cages. Gerbils can CHEW through the plastic! Syrian hamsters can get stuck in the tubes! A gerbil's tail can also get stuck in the cage. I had my mice in one of those cages, and one of the mouse's tail somehow got stuck in something and it got lopped off! It was really rather gross, thank god the mouse was okay. I now house my mice, gerbils, and hamster in aquariums (not in the same aquarium). Oh one thing I forgot to mention, if you are going to get a syrian hamster GET ONLY 1 THEY ARE SOLITARY ANIMALS and will kill eachother if housed together. It's amazing how they keep them in the same cage at the pet store. To hang a water bottle in your aquarium use some sticky backed velcro! <br>  <br>  Bedding: Don't buy cedar, pine, softwood, or any dusty bedding because these can harm any rodent in large ways! I recommend Sunseed Freshworld bedding. A little goes a LONG way. It's usually found at Petsmart. Carefresh is okay, but it is VERY expensive and it's ugly. Aspen is fine but it hurts their feet and some can develop skin allergies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tip: Gerbils love to chew and so do some hamsters (not all hamsters). Their teeth are continuously growing so you MUST provide chew toys. Gerbils in particular love cereal boxes, poptart boxes, paper towel rolls, toilet paper rolls, etc.! You can even build playgrounds out of them. Just be sure you don't give them a box or something with a glossy surface and make sure the ink isn't wet on the box. Remove any glue on the box too.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions or need any help, email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com!|`|ct8MWxJOaa	I think you should get a gerbil<br>  Hamsters smell more<br>  Gerbils smell less<br>  Hamsters sleep during the day<br>  Gerbils sleep on and off during day and night so its fine if you wake them<br>  Hamsters are cute and cuddly<br>  Gerbils are very energetic and wild however some are cuddly<br>  Hamsters aren't that smart<br>  Gerbils are very smart and you can train them to do little tricks like agility. I trained my gerbils and it was very easy and fun!<br>  They will both play with you and hamsters are a bit more tame but that depends on the hamsters <br>  same with gerbils, there are a lot of tame one but it just depends on the gerbils. =D<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|OFaImbSiaa	Hamsters and Gerbils arent the easiest rodents to train. And depending on the hamster/gerbil, they can be pretty tough to tame. I never had a gerbil, but ive had 4 hamsters and my last hamster took forever to tame and even then he wasnt truly "tame", he still drew blood occasionally, and he was smart, he knew how to get out of his cage and into the walls of our house, we had to tape the door shut to keep him in, and he figured out how to get out of that eventually too.<br>  <br>  Rats are considered the nicest and easiest to train.|`|OrvTG44laa	I prefer gerbils over hamsters.  Gerbils are very social, and like your attention- this could be an issue, because you should really get two gerbils.  Hamsters are solitary, and don't crave attention.  Since gerbils want your attention, they will be tamed quicker.  Hamsters don't really want it, but will tolerate it, so they are more likely to bite.  Since gerbils want attention, they will be more playful.|`|Xlbl8ydsaa	gerbils, but they are illegal in some states so depending on where you live.|`|YRrfqsKxaa	hamster|`|Oa3KfmKCaa	Hamster, definitely!

I think your algae would reproduce even more under that lighting but I could be wrong. From what I understand you want to reduce the light, not get one that will penetrate even deeper into the water.|`|Um8osMNuaa	Past experience would suggest that you need to improve the quality of your water, by reducing both phosphates and nitrates, and also replace your lighting for tubes with a Kelvin rating of 6500 or above.|`|svrFBaENaa	I doubt it.

GdBG4PGYaa	Getting rid of Lily should not be an option. The problem is, you should have been giving Johnny more attention than he usually got when you brought Lily into the picture. You should have kept Lily in a room for a few days, and introduced the cats slowly. Always giving Johnny more attention. Once they got used to each other you could give them fair amounts. Did you do that? Nobody really does....<br>  <br>  How you get Johnny to like you again:<br>  <br>  Bring him in the house, if he isn't already. If you can't do that, then ask your neighbors to not pet him or anything. That's your job.<br>  <br>  Give him extremely good treats, like chicken, and tuna. (Not too much tuna, as this is bad for cats.) Pet him a lot (even if he scratches you) and invite him to be with you as much as possible.<br>  Just don't forget about Lily, though if she is getting attention Johnny should be getting attention too.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about him seriously scratching you, take him to the vet and have them put on Soft Paws. Which don't prevent cats from retracting their claws, or using them, but only prevent them from hurting somebody.<br>  If he is an outdoor cat, and gets into fights this is not a good idea. You can take him to the vet and get his nails trimmed though.<br>  <br>  I really hope everything works out! Please don't get "rid of" any cats, you made a life long commitment getting them in the first place.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Some cats NEVER accept another cat in their household but in general i time they do get used to it.You obviously do not realize that outdoor cats have two homes yours and some neighbor in your area that feeds them as well as you that is the nature of a cat.<br>  At present it seems to you your cat does not love you but in fact it is not that it just cannot cope with another new cat on its territory being your household.There is Absolutely nothing really you an do except try and give your first cat as much attention as possible and ignore the hissing which is not usually directed at you but the smell of the other cat on you.Only other alternative is have one indoor cat and one outdoor cat.|`|AA11151794	Have both cats spayed and neutered so that Johnny will not try to mate with Lily.  That is the probable cause of the hissing, scratching and biting.  Then, introduce the cats to each other gradually by confining them apart in difference rooms in the house so each will become accustomed to the smell of the other animal.  Then, let them eat close together.  Do not show favor to one animal without showing the same favor to the other animal. They are just like children in a family.
Os6VjLH0aa	The old saying "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar" really applies here.<br>  People tend to shut out, ignore and get offended by strong expression of one's opinion.<br>  I have found that gentle education gets more results.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	I, too, am like you. I won't sit here and just pretend I've not noticed the BYBers questions or someone asking how they can treat their dog, that has just been ran over, themselves. It wasn't usual to get many thumbs downs for blunt answers before but I have received more than usual lately.<br>  <br>  You get some members saying that it's their dog so they can do what they like but dogs are defenceless animals, humans are supposed to look after their animals, not kill them.<br>  <br>  Y!A is a way for me to get my anger out at idiotic dog owners really, I see so many puppy ads for ridiculous 'breeds' and I can't very well email them all telling them that what they're doing is disgusting but on the Dog section I would hope that my, and others, harsh answers have brought some people to their senses.<br>  <br>  I don't consider myself rude, I'm honest. I don't use fowl language and I do answer questions with what I believe to be the answer.|`|CJMhtM7maa	I have no problem with your answers.Sometimes with stupid people you have to be blunt.You are much nicer to the idiots than i could be. I don't answer a lot of the stupid questions because if i told them what i really feel i would be banned for life.I don't like BYBs,Ban breed laws,and like you people who won't take the time to have a vet properly treat their dog.I have 4 rescued Pits and when it comes around to see the vet its expensive but my wife and i tighten our belts and do without to make sure they get the best treatment possible.We took on the responsibility to care for these dogs and we do it with no regrets.You keep up the good work and be proud of yourself for speaking up for the dogs.|`|J5hsCONRaa	I get a lot of those - half the time, I'm not being rude, I'm just being to the point and telling the truth! Some people dont actually want answers though, they just want us to validate their stupidity with "Ooh yea, she will have nice puppies" etc, not be told they are being out and out dumb!<br>  <br>  I object to no-ones strong opinions.....as well as they are well-founded and with reason (not just "I watched a programme and now will boycot Crufts/Dog shows because I learnt everything about breeders in an hour.....")|`|MYEEK4dcaa	The problem probably isn't WHAT you say it as the way you say it.  You see, people can express strong opinions without making anyone feel stupid or humiliated or embarrassed.  But they DO have to care about other people in order to think carefully about what words they use.  You can "have a go" at people and still be tactful and kind.  They don't have the same opinions, and they probably don't have the same experiences or education or whatever that led you to your opinions.  By giving them a bad time, you're not encouraging them to change their opinions, you're just giving them a bad opinion about you.<br>  <br>  I happen to agree with you about back yard breeding and people who ask health-based questions on the list instead of even telephoning their vet (who isn't likely to charge for the telephone call), but I understand why they do it.  The back yard breeders want to replicate their own beloved dog, and think they can do so by breeding him or her.  They simply aren't aware that is their particular treatment of their dog that makes their dog the dog they love so dearly.  Or they think they can make a few bucks selling puppies.  These folks need to be told not that they are stupid, but that they need to do a lot of research - and often that research will help them change their minds about breeding their dogs.  Those who ask health-based questions are sometimes afraid to call their vet because they're afraid of what the vet might tell them.  They can reassure themselves that all is well by asking here and getting lots of different opinions about what might be wrong with their dogs.  Invariably, though, the reply to health-based problems is "get him/her to a vet!"  I think I'm the only one who suggests they CALL the vet first - because the vet may be able to advise them over the phone instead of asking to see the dog.<br>  <br>  Does any of that make sense to you?  It isn't what you say that earns you the thumbs down... it's how you say it.  In my personal opinion, it took real courage to post this question, and I applaud you for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	i completely agree with you,i am sick to death of these type of dog owners who are completely irresponsible, i know of someone who owns four dogs and has not worked, this means that everytime a dog gets sick its the good old taxpayer that has to pay the bill.  i see young 'hoodies' wandering the streets with two or three dogs, most of them are unemployed, its the same with young mums who have no means to support babies but keep on having them knowing that we will foot the bill. i suspect that most of the people giving you the thumbs down fit the bill of unemployed|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	We have had 4 boxers 3 of which were rescue, we were very lucky as regards their health, until no 3 he had a sudden massive problem,the bill ￡1500, my vet thank god let me pay off in instalments, my boy died but I still had the bill to pay. the next one we got we had insurance straight away and good job another ￡1500+ bill covered by the insurance this time, We take our responsibility's seriously and I like you get fed up with people who treat their dogs with so little care,If I had the money I`d have more rescue dogs, but at the moment I can only afford to help  one.He`s part of our family not just a dog.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	A lot of people think that if you cannot afford a vet then you don't need a dog, but if you have acctually worked at animal shelters (no matter how nice they appear to be) it is not much better there. I would much rather see a dog go to a loving home that could not afford a vet rather than see them spend their days locked in a kennel with only enough attention to feed them. They only get so much affection at these places and many of them after a certain number of days will acctually euthanize an animal if it does not find a home. (Not all shelters do this but some do) I think that as long as the pet is loved and cared for the best of ones ability it is doing the pet much better to live in an acctual home rather than a shelter. As for being rude, just as you give your oppinions to them that is just them giving their oppinions to you so I would not take it to heart. Everyone has their oppinions.|`|xdzn5ib5aa	You're right, such people are idiots. Unfortunately, if you answer truthfully, you will get some thumbs down, for the sole reason that idiots do not like to be told they are idiots. Personally I think the few docked points is worth it.|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	I'm in agreement with you.  But I try to be more tactful.  Sometimes tact won't work.  Sometimes nothing will work because either people will hear only what they want or they just don't care.<br>  <br>  Thank you for telling it like it is.|`|KHhfcMtgaa	have you never thought that people may have had a dog for many years and then lost thier job?  instead of attacking people that genuinley cannot help the circumstances they find themselves in, or are do not have the knowledge and experience that you have, why dont you save it for the real idiots that abuse animals just for fun.     yes pet insurance is always a good idea, i am just saying surely it is better to help someone become a better pet owner and help educate them if they are asking for help rather than attacking them|`|VQlkO7lqaa	This is the place to express your opinions.  But don't be surprised when others express their opinions about what you say.  Many people donot realize what it takes to own a dog.  The best way to to try to explain what they should do and not put them down.. However, there are times when I've had enough and just tell they to go to the Vet.  Irealize then it's time for me to go do other things for a while.|`|jlngtrj7aa	I know how you feel. If someone does not have the money to care for a dog, or the knowledge, they should not have one. That is how so many dogs end up at the shelter.<br>  <br>  But you have to realize that people's economic situations change...especially now in the condition that the country is in. They might have been perfectly capable of caring for the dog when the got it... but a few years down the road and changes happen..<br>  <br>  I say, if you want to make a difference with these issues, Yahoo aswers is not the best place to do it. It is good to give advice and honesty, but calling someone an idiot won't make them change.<br>  <br>  If you are as passionate as you sound, perhaps you should volunteer at a shelter- and help educate the potential dog owners. Or even start a website on things to know for new dog owners. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Just remember that there are many other ways to make a difference without getting so many negative reactions.|`|kceGobAXaa	ya know what, Julie, I completely agree.  i have only been one here a few days and am frustrated with the amount of irresponsible dog owners out there.  I have 3 dogs and there is nothing i wouldnt do for them.  my Joey needed surgery that costs us $1200.  we are not rich but my dogs health and well being are first and foremost.  sure we had to do without a few things for a few months and some bills had to go unpaid, but if thats all it takes, thats fine.  and if my dog is showing signs that he is in pain or unhappy, my first reaction should not be to run to yahoo answers for advice.  the reaction to a responsible pet parent is to get off their a$$ and get their pet to a doctor immediately.  your dog is not going to tell you, 'hey, im sick'.  know the signs and know your animal.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I agree completely with you when it comes to people making statements about their ill pet, but they can't afford to take it to the vet.  I also feel that if you can't afford the pet, you shouldn't be a pet owner.<br>  <br>  But when it comes to BYBs.........that's just a subject that you shouldn't be b*tching about, because you don't know exactly what it is.  It seems like all breeders lately are lumped together in the same pot.  I'm a very respected breeder and take amazing care of my champion line dogs, but in order to protect my own constitutional rights, I have to uphold the rights of all breeders, even commercial breeders.  <br>  <br>  My dogs breed in the backyard, so does that mean that I'm a backyard breeder?  Heck, I don't want them humping in the front yard, with people driving by and watching.|`|AA11569882	Well, the people are idiots, but I don't think they need everyone on here to have a go at them.  So I usually notice that someone else has already done the honour and ignore it.<br>  <br>  I do however, dislike it when people have a go at anyone with an unsterilised animal, I mean, sure they are risking the dog getting cancer in later life, and having unwanted puppies, and all that other stuff, but I am sure that 'some' people would be good, responsible breeders, so I don't like it when people just automatically tell them off. <br>  <br>  Also, sometimes if you mention that you have a puppy at all you get the 'do-gooding brigade' having a go, saying they ought to have got a rescue.  And while I have always had rescues, I do still dream of one day getting a beautiful beagle puppy, and I don't think it's right that they are shunned by the dog community.<br>  <br>  That's just my two pence worth anyway...|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Having a go at people isn't educating anyone.  We all want what is best for dogs, but by attacking their owners, you aren't teaching them anything at all.. Yeah you get mad, and it's easy to be rude, short or blunt.. but you have to make sure that you are educating... People obviously have no clue generally where to buy a dog, how to choose a dog, and how to raise a dog properly.. If you are seriously concerned, then then teach them.. Attacking them is like poking a bear in the corner.. He is going to bite you ..|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Same here. Those people are idiots.<br>  <br>  I try to explain it nicely, but sometimes, I just explode and scream at them.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Great question<br>  <br>  I totally agree if they can't handle the answers then they shouldn't ask the question, let them do their own research.<br>  <br>  I just got a nasty email from the one with a 5 month infection.<br>  <br>  It amazes me when you answer with a perfectly acceptable answer and then get attacked by the asker. <br>  <br>  I guess we should just consider the source<br>  <br>  You might want to throw in a legit dog question so the question doesn't get reported|`|Rva0ocMOaa	Yes, it is very irritating but there is nothing you can do about it besides answering and moving on. This happens to many of us. There will always be ignorant, selfish and uneducated people. This is a waste of five points in my opinion, it is a rant.<br>  <br>  ADD: It is not as though this subject has never been brought up before, we all expierience it. Maybe it isn't a rant per se, but i really don't view it as a question. You answered your own question, the reason people are like that is because they are selfish and stupid. If you have been in the dog section for any amount of time, you would be used to this and not feel the need to have to post it to see if people agree with you.<br>  <br>  By the way, i totally agree with you, it is annoys the hell out of me, i am not saying what you wrote isn't true, it is.|`|plhfe5Zaaa	Maybe you get thumbs down because the answer "You should not have a dog if you can't afford it." is not helpful or apply to the question "My dog is really ill but I don't have the money for the vet, what shall I do?". Maybe try answering by saying contact your local shelter and see if you can receive low cost vet service, ask local vets if they will offer a payment plan, or it may be in the best interest of the dog to rehome it if you can't afford to take care of it. How do you know this is a poor lazy person with a low paying job who shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place? Maybe this person has been laid off or is going through tough financial times. My mom's dog is 14 years old. She has had him since he was 2 months. We could always afford vet care until this past year when money got tight and the bills were more than the paycheck. Just change your answers to be helpful. This person is saying I need help and you are saying you shouldn't have a dog. That is rude and unhelpful. Why even answer if that's what you say? Tell them if they cannot afford the vet care and can't find a way to pay for it they need to rehome the dog or give it to the shelter. That's a nicer way of putting it. Also this isn't the place to b*tch about BYB unless it is an answer to a question such as "What do you think about BYBs?".
L22hVXTIaa	Keep your spay appointment.  And, yes, the bleeding will stop after surgery since they will be removing her uterus and ovaries.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	If I'm not mistaken, I believe that it's not recommended to spay a dog until she's out of heat. If she's bleeding today, she'll be in full heat by Wednesday.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think a vet will spay during this time.|`|236ec04bbd4131ca8c28403df2b8717caa	My puppy was in full heat when we got her spayed.  The vet never said anything about not being able to spay them while in heat, however, there was an extra fee for doing the surgery during that time.|`|oK5kVlrnaa	Dogs tend to have periods like us humans.

You will want to MAKE SURE your female doesn't get close to the boys. You can make the appointment for 3 weeks from now.<br>  <br>  I know that after a female has babies she isn't allowed to be fixed until after she has dried up and the puppies eat only food supplies by Human friends. that could be anywhere from 5-8 weeks after the babies are born.<br>  <br>  I hope I'm not wrong here I do believe this is your answer.|`|oVwGit7qaa	it will stop dont worry. In reply also to Angie's comment, the vet will let you know if they cant do it then. you should let them know before hand, so it isnt the day of, that they realize that they cant do it. They will probably, if they cant do it, tell you a date when they think it will be fine to do it on.
FQyeGsIyaa	It took some time, but I got my cat used to traveling in the car and now take her on 3hr trips for summer vacation with no problems.  Always keep the cat in a carrier when you travel, it's safer for you and for the cat.<br>  <br>  Leave his carrier out on the floor for a few days with a t-shirt that you've worn in it.  He'll get used to it being there so just seeing it won't scare him.  You could toss in treats or a favorite toy to encourage him to go in it.  My cat got to the point of taking naps in it and using it as a place to hide behind and jump out when I walked by!<br>  <br>  Next, put him in the carrier, take him out to the car, count to 30 at most if he's anxious, and bring him back in the house.  You'll need to repeat this step for a week or more.  The cat should get used to going in and out of the carrier, out to the car and back in the house.   If he's calm, stay in the car for a longer period of time.  Put the carrier in the car where it will be when you travel so he gets used to his spot and when you bring him back into the house, put it on the floor again.<br>  <br>  The next stage is to start the car and just sit in the driveway so the sound of the engine becomes familiar.  Once that hurdle is over, take a short trips around the block. After he's used to this, it's easy to take longer rides.  My cat just curls up and sleeps.  <br>  <br>  Take his food and water away about 2-3hrs before you go.  This will help minimize the chances of him getting car sick.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy your vacation!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Legally you cannot have a loose animal in a car so forget the lap business unless you intend being scratched to death,use a cat cage that is covered.You can get some tablets from the vet to alleviate the stress and these are not dangerous as in general cats hate going in cars and will yell all the way.You could try short car trips but it will make no difference at all as none of the cats l have ever owned have ever accepted the cat drive when it is needed
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I have rescued several cats from the pound and I always use my own vet.  One reason I do that is what you just said about burdening the community.  I KNOW I'll be having vet work done on my cats and can afford to use my own vet (who gives me multi-cat discounts).  I'd rather that money be used towards their spay/neuter program for someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to have it done. <br>  <br>  I adopted my dog from a Humane Society Shelter and wasn't given the option of using my own vet.  She had to be spayed before I could take her home.  It was quite a bargain- she was fully vetted, microchipped, groomed, flea treated, spayed, and heartworm tested for an adoption fee of $70.  I paid to have a dog I rescued fully vetted with everything but the microchip and it cost $250.  <br>  <br>  I have nothing against people using the shelter vets but for me personally, I'd rather do it myself and help out all I can.  We also have to keep in mind, some people won't have the vetting done if it isn't done before they get the animal.  In a perfect world, we could spot those people instantly and not adopt to them but sometimes they can slip past even the most discriminative eye.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	As you said you have opened up a can of worms.We live in a democracy which means free choice.if you wish to adopt a kitten and have worked out the cost factor involved for food,vet bills etc then the choice is yours whether you adopt from a shelter or a private person who has neglected to have a female de-sexed and has had kittens being given away.if you prefer the pure breed and think you would be a responsible pet owner than go for it that is CHOICE.<br>  Where is the burden on the Community it only happens when te pet owner is negligent and does not de-sex their animals if they are not breeders And take a risk if they have a female and are negligent if they have a male as then Yes it is a burden on the community as  too many unwanted kittens will arise.<br>  Perhaps l have not got exactly the gist of your question but to me if you are o going to get a pet whatever it is you OWE a duty of care to that animal and the society you live in to do the right thing re your animal whether breeding pure breed animals or simply having a pet that should be de-sexed or fixed as some people say.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	thee not much different than people in some respects, If you choose to add another member to your family or household, would you not give it the upmost respect and potential?<br>   To some they are just vassels of life to be used and disguarded, especially in hunting and breeding circles.<br>   Personally most of the animals i have ever had, I treat with dignity, I have known people that have died(literally) defending their pets.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	I do not particularly trust the shelter vets.  While I was at the shelter I saw this little black cat scratching her ear and shaking her head.  I decided to go over and have a look at her ( I decided to adopt her) - but before I left, I asked the shelter vet to take a look at her ear, the vet there said "oh, her ear is just dirty, i'll clean it for you".. so i brought her home and she was still itchy and kept shaking her head and there was this really rancid smell coming from her ear.  I decided to bring her to my vet the next day, and they told me she had a severe ear infection.  <br>  <br>  I even knew that she had an ear infection when I left the shelter, but I decided not to say anything because I really do not want someone who either doesn't know what they're talking about or just does not care about the animal to treat it.<br>  <br>  A lot of the times I think shelter vets lie to you, so you take the cat from them.  I would have taken the cat sick or not, but they should be taking proper care of the animals there and take responsibility when a cat is sick.|`|OjXAcwJPaa	a responsible pet owner is just that.RESPONSIBLE> it shouldnt matter where or how, though personally I dont care for breeders who just think of their animals as money machines. Ive adopted from the local shelter, from barns, took in many many strays & taken from people with litters. If they show up they can stay. Healthy or sick. If they get to me, I'll help them. btw this week, we have 22 cats & yes they are are up to date on shots & spayed & neutered. if everyone spayed & neutered, I wouldnt have 22!!|`|cii9XShcaa	I went to the Humane Society to get my first cat but, in the end, decided to go with a breeder to get the breed of my choice. I understood that, with this decision, I would spend much more money. But it was my decision to spend over $1500 for my animal's and the vet costs. I chose a breeder over the Humane Society since the chances of me finding a Bengal in a shelter were very slim. I'm happy with my decision and wouldn't have it any other way.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	You mention a very good reason for using your own vet. I do as well when I adopt a rescue cat. I want my vet to get acquainted with my new pet from the git go. =)
taLD45Sqaa	That makes him a puppy, not bad! Sounds like he needs some training. I suggest puppy pre school classes and reading up on his breed all you can. Owning a dog is a lot of work and Yahoo Answers won't fix all the problems that will arise from an untrained dog.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	When a puppy does not respond to training, you don't blame the puppy, you reevaluate yourself.  If the commands are not working, change them.  Baby teeth come out between 4 and 6-months-old.  This mix is going to need a lot of exercise in his life to drain all the energy.  You need to correct the biting the second it starts.  You can trade your fingers for toys or bones, or carrots.  You can use garden gloves for training.  I point, snap my fingers, and say "no biting" and when he behaves, say "good boy"  When he does a behavior you don't want, correct it the second it happens.  You can also divert attention.  So when it is doing a wrong behavior, teach it something you want it to do.  So if he is biting try teaching him sitting or something else instead.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	because he's a puppy.Make sure you have chew toys out everywhere. My dog also loved chewing on pop bottles. then when the puppy bites you say no and stick a toy in it's mouth. I know it seems like it will never stop but it will. If you dog try's biting shoes and chairs or anything theres a spray you can get to spray on all of that that makes it taste bitter. My dog hated it  and stopped biting things like that. Also its going to play rough if it cant burn off it's energy take him for walks or run around outside or even in the house and then your dog will sleep or at least chill out for a little while. Good Luck and it gets better as they grow|`|1mHRVG5Jaa	Its only because he's a puppy, its normal. But to make sure he doesn't turn agressive, discipline him with a little tap on the nose when he bites people and plays rough, but when he doesn't and plays nice praise him :) x|`|kceGobAXaa	you have to teach him the right behavior.  you can't just let him do whatever he wants and expect him to be good.<br>  <br>  try some obedience classes.|`|wxyfgE6oaa	well if it is probably just a play bite and at that young of age puppies don't know good from bad so if jumps an tries to bite you just push him down and say no bite.|`|ZkwrHLVCaa	He is just being a puppy. He needs some training to show him that he cant just go around biting and playing rough whenever he feels like it. When I first got my puppy she did the same thing but whenever she would bite I would tell her to play nice and stop playing with her for a minute. Then I'd play with her again and if she got rough I would again tell her to play nice and stop playing with her for another minute. Again I would repeat the process but if she still bit I would stop playing with her for longer than a minute, more like 10-20 mins. Mine is now 3 yrs old and I can rough house with her and then all of a sudden say "easy, play nice" and she immediately licks me and stops playing rough. If you keep up with it, that routine should also work for you. I would also recommend joining an obedience class to help with training. Dogs need structure and discipline to be happy... training is not a bad experience for them as long as you use positive reinforcement. Good luck with you puppy.
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Everything sound great except two things: <br>  <br>  1) the major thing is the filters, they do not sound powerful at all and you will have serious water problems so i hope you meant 60-90 gallon filter, because you need filters that will filter water up to 250-300 gallon an hour. Weak filters will be very useless for oscars and will not provide them the right water flow.<br>  <br>  2) the rocks make sure you don't get too many, 2-3 is enough and make sure they are smooth rock because oscars love to run into things so if the rocks are not smooth or safe they can get seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  You suggested to get a small pleco (BIG MISTAKE). Let me warn you, if you plan to buy one make sure it's much bigger than the oscar because if it's not the oscar will eventually kill and eat it while it's growing. Oscars are known to grow very fast and will grow faster than the pleco so keep that in mind. Many people tell you that it's ok but i will tell you that it's safe while the oscar is small but once it gets big, it's all about luck, because i have kept one of oscar with pleco for several years and my oscar turned against the pleco just one random day and i have not been able to place anything else with him; but my other oscar is still living peacefully with another pleco so it's really all about luck.<br>  <br>  This here is an excellent site that has everything you need to know about oscars, i always recommend this site to people and it brought them lots of success, here's the link: <a href="http://www.oscarfishlover.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oscarfishlover.com/</a><br>  <br>  Take care i am very sure you will enjoy them because they are wonderful pet, they are the closet pet one can ever get that is so close to being a puppy.|`|D1KT9ioJaa	what you need to add is a friend for you oscar...i suggest an arowana|`|jnzSz3tRaa	sounds gorgeous
2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	No vaccinations should be given under 8 weeks of age. Doing vaccinations underage interferes with natural immunity, suppresses the immune system, can make a puppy more susceptible to the very illness the vaccine is suppose ot prevent and can cause future problems with vaccinations.<br>  Vaccines should be given for distemepr/parvo at 8, 12 & 16 weeks of age and then not again for a year. After that no more for at least 3 years (study after study has proven that distemper/parvo is good for the life of the dog so really never has ot be repeated). Rabies should not be given until 20 weeks of age (it can be given at 16 but it is best to wait if possible) Rabies should never be given at the same time as any other vaccination.<br>  coronavirus & giardia should not be given to any dog/puppy. These are no longer recommended ever.<br>  Lepto, lymes and bordatella (kennel cough) aren't recommended for all puppies/dogs only those at high risk of exposure and even then very careful consideration needs to be given before giving a lepto vaccine.

MCczXQW3aa	i've had a lot of hamsters. he is just nervous. because if they were in a pet store they were used to the atmosphere and environment of the place. and who ever else they shared a cage with. you should give him like 2 weeks to adjust to his new habitat. also, dont handle him yet. he is provably already traumatized from the trip and moving. just let him be for a while. and be aware of wet tail for hamster.|`|BCOmoJ59aa	okay first off hamsters are nocturnal so you really need to let them sleep most of the day, and set certian times each day to play with it(take it out of the cage)before you put it back in the cage put food in its bowl or give it a treat as soon as you take it out, that way it assoiciates you with possitive things. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SOCIALISE IT AT A YOUNG AGE, otherwise the hamster will bite you every time you try to touch it. he isnt doing anything yet because he is still tramatized from the ride, give it a day to settle in and explore and sleep. but dont worry, what your hamster is doing is perfectly natural!! and for future reference make sure your hamster always has water they get dehydrated very fast and can dye from that alone. syrian hamsters do not get along with other hamsters!! so dont put more than one in a cage. hope i helped < ;|`|SWftVTNFaa	let him get used to living in the cage, obviously he has been in a different envireoment for the first 8weeks of his life, he'll almost certai nly get back to his normal self.<br>  <br>  oh and he'l be asleep during the day because hamsters a nocternal like owls, they sleep in the day and are awake at night.<br>  <br>  dont worry about him he's just getting used to his new home|`|4t10YACQaa	Well my sister had a hamster and when she got it the man who worked at the pet store said that when the hamster moves into his new cage you should leave him alone for about a day.

M7KT6NSCaa	ok i had this same problem with my neighbors and it worked very well for me if you put the dog into a room then put the cat in a room that are next to each other so they can sniff each other and smell each other but can not see or have any physical contact with each other. after they seem confident and comfy with that then let them see each other by putting up some sort of gate. after that then let them have a little physical contact for a couple of minutes, then put them back into their own space. its also very good that are letting them go back to a house that is having the other animal with them so they can relax. btw- i will worn you that this takes quit a bit of time. hope i helped:) good luck. if you have any questions email me at Schrodey42@yahoo.com.|`|TTPkHro6aa	if you have a back door thats see through, pu the dog  out back and have it come to the door and hold the cat at the door, so the dog cant hurt that cat, and go on from there:) what i did, i have the same problem but the dog likes the cat but the cat doesnt like the dogt, he scratches the dog sometimes, but for the most part they ignore each other|`|WJ9zb2Vraa	I am an Expert so do what I tell yall.<br>  <br>  Yall need to rub that cat with ketchup and dog food when you release it near the hound.<br>  <br>  Dawgs loves ketchup and dog food so it stands to reason they will like yore cat.<br>  <br>  Stand back and leave room though.|`|FBSXz8L9aa	when i introduced my kitten to my dog (she is a big german shephard) the dog was just curious and wanted to smell her we just done this in the living room with time my kitten came down from the couch and was hissing at the dog, but after a few days of putting their feeding bowls near eachother the kitten was ok, now they are best friends my cat runs over to my dog and sleeps on her tail, the only problem we had was the cat we had before (a male) didnt like my dog or the kitten probably cos the house was all his territory first but he was happy to sit with them as he got older. id recommend just sitting with the dog on a lead and putting them withing safe distance, ps my dog chases other cats still just not my own.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Take your dog for a long walk before the introductions to burn off some of her excess energy, so that she will be less exciteable.  (Keep her on the lead, so that you are in total control.)   If the dog has a blanket she sleeps on, or something else that has her scent on it, wipe this over the cat before you introduce them.  Animals rely much more heavily on their sense of smell than their eyesight to identify friends, and if the cat smells familiar, your dog will be less hostile.|`|6sXG3Plkaa	If the dog is a puppy then you should be able to get them at least use to each other.  Unfortunately if the dog is older then most likely they will never get along.  We got a husky mix he was almost 2 when we got him and already hated cats.  We have two cats.  They live inside and the dog goes crazy outside if he sees a cat, but inside we have him where he doesn't bother the cats.  If one cats do on occasion go outside the dog does chase it and bark at it.  My point is since this cat isn't yours and will encounter the dog outside it will be I think anyway impossible to train him/her to get along with the cat.

IMPvzBk1aa	The bacteria that ferment feed in the horse's intestines exist in balance and whenever a new feed is introduced, different bacterial populations are activated to digest it.  The end- products of their activity causes sometimes massive die- off of the bacteria that were normally functioning to digest the old feed.  This results in acidosis within the gut, and release of both acids and endotoxins that disturb the gut environment and can cause colic,  and also enter the bloodstream and can lead to laminitis.  By making a change more gradually, the degree of bacterial disturbance is reduced and less likely to result in colic or laminitis.|`|motYSp5waa	It is important because like real deal said they do have very delicate digestive systems and if u just change from one feed to another right away than it can make them very sick and it can also cause colic. You can put mostly the feed you are giving your horse now and put about one 8th of  a scoop of the new feed in and then a quarter and then half then a full scoop of the new feed and he should be fine!|`|Jrc2dgMAaa	Because a horse's digestive system gets used to the type of food that it has to digest. It becomes good at digesting that type of food, and finds it quite easy to do so. <br>  <br>  If you give it a new type of food suddenly the system will find it difficult to break down as it's not used to it. When you introduce a new food slowly the system only has to digest a little bit of new stuff at a time, and will eventually get better at digesting that different type of food.<br>  <br>  It's really the same for all animals! If you think about an extreme case, our digestive systems would find it quite challenging to break down a meal of raw meat, as we are used to cooked meat only!<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped you.|`|AA11196683	you should feed fastrack Microbial supplement when changing over to a different feed.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	because horses have very delicate digestive systems and it can shock it,and cause colic and Diarrhea and that is dangerous for them...|`|as3EF0BSaa	Exactly why you need to change over gradually, COLIC and possibly the loss of the horse.
eOe0uGVzaa	i do a fair bit of eventing competing, so i know what can go wrong. ive never had an accident on course, but ive seen them happen - they can be catastrophic. I think non-solid fences sound great, but then it just turns into showjumping over hills. And you would have to get rid of fjords, water jumps, logs, walls, etc etc. I think that cross country would lose what makes it so unique. I think in some ways non-solid fences are a great idea, especially at lower levels with novice riders who cant cope with a fall, but at higher levels, the thrill of galloping through water or jumping a huge ditch is what makes the sport apeal to me. <br>  <br>  to be honest, im aware that accidents happen, but most people who do eventing know the risks, but they do it anyways for the thrill of cross country. If you cant handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen<br>  <br>  maybe if they could make the traditional jumps look solid when they're actually nto it would work, though. if they decide to switch to non-solid, i wont complain. I hope they can make them non-solid without losing the look its always had|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Another thing you may wish to consider is speed.  As we have made our courses more technical, we have not changed the meters per minute.  In order to make time, horses are pushed very hard between fences, and have to pulled up to short, show jump-y canters in order to navigate the very technical obstacles of the modern cross country courses.  If horses don't rate back well, it makes safely getting through the higher technically difficult jumps very difficult or impossible.<br>  <br>  We have been using a radar gun to measure how fast horses are going between fences, and many are going twice as fast as the optimum time in order to make up ground lost in slowing for the jumps.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I think the jumps should be made non solid. They shouldn't be as flimsy as Show Jumping poles but if you hit them with some force they will break. At Kentucky Rolex 2008 two horses fell and had to be Euthanized and one rider had to be airlifted out. I think that if the best can fall then anyone can fall. There shouldn't be any more injuries because of something that can be fixed. If it's possible to make something safer then we should.|`|1tX7KwHsaa	I agree. The jumps should be non-solid. And if they want to blame it on riders not practicing, well that's crazy! Yeah they have a point that some riders should have been more prepared but is it really punishable by a possible death of a rider or horse? I think not. There are so many things that can go wrong for a rider and horse while eventing. Footing, rider error, horse error you name it! I think its about time for  some changes. I knows its tradition, but when has it helped anyone by living in the past?<br>  <br>  *EDIT* Giggs you hit that nail right on the head.|`|MBwln1m7aa	I agree 100% that it should be made as safe as possible.<br>  Break apart jumps that are hit with a force is a good idea, but they will also need to be put back together VERY quickly, and with minimal people because the rest of the ride can catch up if it takes too long and will cause a jam and will also annoy some of the hardcore competitors that their times will be effected by it. You can't have 5 people on stand-by at every jump to put it back together either.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Non-solid/break apartable.<br>  Why?<br>  Because tradition stands still but course and jump design has changed to make the courses a) more challenging for the competitors and b) more exciting for the spectators. In  other words the jumps are no longer what would be considered "traditional".<br>  20 years ago you would never have seen a jump like the one in your picture - it would have been considered outlandish and extreme so as the designs have been modernised then it stands to reason that the safety precautions should also be modernised the lack of a breakaway section or such is a design flaw pure and simple.<br>  Lack of practice does not account for a slippery take off or a moment's hesitation or distraction, we all know that you can jump the same thing hundreds of times but you will get variations with every attempt - it's a horse and rider after all - not a machine. Some of the excuses for not making the jumps breakable are that it would cost too much - in that case ( and bearing in mind the amounts of money that are generated by eventing as a sport) those jumps should not be used.|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	I think the jumps should be made non-solid. They should still look solid though because that is part of X-country. Not practicing enough is only part of the reason for accidents, and tradition should be changed if the change keeps people and horses safer.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think the jumps should be made so that, unlike in showjumping, when the horse touches it with his foot they don't fall. However, when a lot of force is put upon them, they will come apart.<br>  <br>  Edit: I also agree with Giggs that water jumps, ditches, etc, will not be taken out of X-country just because we want to make the jumps safer.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	I completely agree with you. The jumps should be made nonsolid.<br>  <br>  Why-<br>  <br>  Well, yes, I understand that it is a "tradition" for the jumps to be make solid. But just because it is a tradition, does not mean that it is a good idea.<br>  <br>  Both riders AND horses get seriously injured each year from cross country. And many deaths also occur. It is just plain common sense that the jumps should be made nonsolid.<br>  <br>  Many people who think the tradition should stay as is have never witnessed a fatal fall as in the picture you posted. And it is pathetic that they need to actually see it in real life for it to change their minds.<br>  <br>  And it is not fair to constantly blame the rider. I'm not saying that it's the horse's fault either. It's just sometimes you aren't going to make it their on time, or the horse might misjudge how high he needs to jump. Cross Country events are almost impossible to be completed in a perfect fashion.<br>  <br>  So basically, yes, I believe the jumps should be nonsolid.<br>  <br>  Edit- The answer above me was partially wrong. Just because you make the actual jump unsolid, does not mean you have to get rid of extras (ex- water jumps).<br>  <br>  It won't turn into show jumping. You can still have different types of jumps, just in a safer construction. <br>  <br>  Cross Country will never be completely safe. Unsolid jumps will just help to prevent some injuries.<br>  <br>  Edit again-<br>  And it is also not fair to the horse. Just because the rider needs to feel that "thrill" does not mean their horse should be put in danger.|`|RFM2Cb1Zaa	I agree and disagree.<br>  I agree because the safety of the horse and the rider is important and if you get just an extra stride put in it could be fatal and there are so many accidents where the horses trips and falls and can shatter a bone, die or be put out of work for life. It would be better for non-solid but I don't think its gonna happen :(<br>  However, solid jumps have been around for years and for the people who worry for their own safety or others should stick to show jumping or jump cross. So all the fun of cross country and a lot safer in terms of accidents! But in any sport of riding there can be accidents, its just cross country is more risky than some.

d6kekKgeaa	1 - raw fish is bad for dogs, don't have any idea why it would have helped, maybe a vitamin in it. 2 - get a new vet 3 - i have epilepsy and had the joy of diagnosing a seizer in my friends dog who chose to sleep with me on a camping trip. i woke up to getting my a** kicked by a seizing great dane. they took her to the vet, epilepsy was comphermed and they gave her meds that she takes daily and is now fine - it's been years now - 4 - what you discribbed dose sound like a seizure and the reasion your dog dosn't want to be alone is because it's confused about what just happened and knows you'll keep them safe. when you first come out of a seizure, you have no idea what's going on. it's like if your coputer crashes and you turn it back on, it take a bit for everything to reboot to where it was. when i have one, at first, i have no idea who i am, where i am, what's going on, who the people around me are and i usualy come to in the middle of a conversation i don't recal starting about stuff from two years past. slowly everything reboots and i remember where i should be. -5- you have trouble with vets and your akita because they have a rep for being kinda nasty to stranger - not all of them are, they can be great big teddy bears too - but some vets/groomer/ect... wont even risk it. find a vet who is willing to do the simple tests that will tell them if your dog is epileptic - yes it's easier to tell during an episode, but those can be indused. don't ignore this. every seizure causes some amount of perminet brain damage, and on day the dog may have a seizure tthat they don't come back from --- if its epilepsy, if its not you still need to know whats going on, cause what-ever is causing the seizures needs to be fixed asap.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	You need to find a different Vet that specializes in large breeds.  Thge salmon was a fluke.|`|L22hVXTIaa	First, you should NEVER feed a dog raw salmon.  They can get Salmon Poisoning which can be fatal if left untreated - please read up on it.  Cooked Salmon is okay.<br>  <br>  Second, you should find another vet who is willing to work on your dog regardless of his breed.  <br>  <br>  Last, it does sound as though your dog is suffering from some type of seizure disorder.  Find a new vet and get him checked out.|`|gpTOomPvaa	If your akita were epileptic he would fall on his side and shake uncontrollably and be completely unconscious for these episodes, and he would wake up hungry and tired and extremely lethargic.  These episodes he is having do not sound like seizures but I am sorry to tell you I have no idea what they are, you do need to find a large breed vet who will take him and see him.
5QG9Zrjaaa	It's not the respiratory system that is the issue, it is the density of their muscles.  As for many horses with very dense muscles, they are not as efficient at ridding their bodies of heat as say a TB would be.  This makes recovery from a hard, fast cross country round very difficult for them.  They also tend to gallop very up and round, not reaching and speedy.  They are built for flashy movement, not efficiently getting from point A to B.  It's kind of like taking a pickup truck on a Nascar track, or expecting a weight lifter to win the Tour de France.<br>  <br>  As previously mentioned, the angles of their shoulders limits their lifting and tucking over a jump; they tend to hang their knees rather than tuck them up.|`|0uqsaxEqaa	How fit the horse is would be up to you and your exercise programme :) It rather depends on what level you are looking at. Whilst some of the best hunters are first generation heavy horse x TB and have the stamina for a full day in the field, jumping anything put in front of them, if you are looking at high level competition you would want more TB and less heavy. <br>  <br>  The same goes for your Friesian - beautiful horses though they are (and one of my personal favourite breeds), they are neither very big, nor I suspect have the scope of say a Hannovarian. So if you are looking at local shows and one day events fine, go with the Friesian, If you are thinking Badminton and the next Olympics, well, no I think you would need a different type of horse.|`|eOe0uGVzaa	they can probably jump at lower levels, but because Freisans are originally bred as carriage type horses, their shoulder shape makes it so that they would not have very good form over fences. Because of their shoulder, some friesans actually cant canter.<br>  <br>  oh btw, your grammer is really bad and it took me a few tries to understand what you were trying to ask

K5IOSGXAaa	Other parrots besides cockatoos do this as well, I had a Moluccan who would raise her crest and do mad dancing and "head banging" in time to music or just clapping as well, and the more we made a fuss over her the more creative she got !  My other parrots, a Timneh gray and a B&G macaw, also do this crazy stuff but not to the extent of the cockatoo, they are just crazier birds. It is absolute joy they are expressing and it is absolutely joyful to watch !|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	Cockatoos know that a good day begins with a nice ROCKIN OUT!|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Sorry don't do links but Cockatoos, usually bang their heads, really it is 'bobbing their heads up and down' in rhythm to the music.<br>  <br>  Cockatoos are mimic birds, they can talk, and love to squeal and squawk, they hang upside down, rip things up and dance.<br>  <br>  If you are the owner of one and you put music on and dance they will mimic you.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	They aren't banging their heads, they are bobbing their heads.

Its also a sign of excitement and/or happiness.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Oh they are just dancing!! haha they do this to show emotions and excitement.

RN1wGlWWaa	She is pregnant from your description.  If you cannot care for kittens for 10-12 weeks after they are born, then take her in now and spay her.<br>  <br>  If you choose to let her have kittens, you must keep her inside from now on and she has to be inside after the kittens are born or she will get pregnant again when nursing.  Spay her by the time the kittens are 8 weeks old.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I have very little doubt your cat is pregnant.  Since she's just into her third week, she can still be safely spayed.  That would be the best option since you probably aren't prepared for a litter of kittens and don't have homes lined up for them.  I would call the vet for the first appointment you can get to have her spayed.  Over 10,000 cats and kittens a day are killed in shelters because of overpopulation.

nMKhfKLvaa	Hello<br>  <br>  It is safe to keep a goldfish for up too 4 hrs in a plastic bag, it depends how well the animal was bagged up in the shop to start with. If oxygen was put in the bag then maybe longer. The problem is a lack of oxygen, if the weather is warm then the amount of time is considerably reduced, don't forget to mix the water in the tank in the bag slowly when you get it home.|`|OjXAcwJPaa	well if your car trip is say 8 hrs long, how else would they get there?

And the fish was still fine.<br>  <br>  If you keep it in an environment that's not too hot and not too cold, then it's safe to say that the Goldfish can survive in the bag for more than an hour.<br>  <br>  By the way, what size tank are you planning to keep the Goldfish in?|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Golds can take lower tempertures then tropics but ask the store to double bag them and to do so with lots of air. i just received some bettas in the mail which had to travel overnight so they will be okay for a while. just when you get them home, float the bag and slowly add your tank water for at least 20-30 mintues.|`|BMri9tITaa	I always heard that the limit was 2 hours.  I try to keep them in there for less than 1 hour, if possible.<br>  <br>  Try to make the pet store your last stop, or maybe buy them on a day when you can get them home quickly.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Most fish can survive a good 3-4 hours without a proper setup as long as the temperture does not fluctuate too much.<br>  <br>  Try to save the fish store for the last stop, the shorter amount of time you take the better.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|yXDtGo8taa	Fish can live in a plastic bag for as long as 3 hours as long as the temperature does not get too hot.

We sold more rats than hamsters BY FAR! Hamsters tend to be nippy and you have to tame them down. Rats(from Petsmarts..idk about other stores) are already friendly and they learn who you are very quickly! They can also learn their names and you can get them out and let them run around on the bed,floor,couch. Whatever. They are also lots of fun because you can feed them so many different things. My friend's rats love peas. She puts them in water and they go "bobbing for peas" Or you can bury seeds in dirt and watch them dig(in an unused kitty litter pan) <br>  The ONLY downside is they live for abour 4-5 years..but it's totally worth it :)|`|KuWLNfYbaa	A Leprechaun|`|38fimwFCaa	I would recommend a hamster because they live longer than guinea pigs. They sleep in the day but when they are awake you can play with it in a rolling ball. It is very fun. Advice: Don't leave it in the ball, like my brother did, it looks like it has died, it sort of freezes in a position. It gave me a fright when I came to play with it!
W2UuRaReaa	I used human shampoo on my dog and nothing happend so Im pretty sure its okay|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Never use human shampoo, the PH is not suitable as dog shampoos and can dry the coat out and irritate it.<br>  Many human shampoos have paraffin in them which as a quick fix will make the hair shiny but also causes build up. Just like it does in our hair<br>  <br>  add all dogs have hair and not fur, but they have different hair than we do.|`|L22hVXTIaa	You may be sorry if you use your dog for a science project.  And,  human shampoo is to harsh for most dogs.<br>  <br>  Think about how often you wash your own hair versus how often a dog needs bathing and that should give you an indication.<br>  <br>  Using lots of different human shampoos on your dog, could cause any number of hair and skin problems.  You really should reconsider and come up with some other kind of scicene project.|`|0DIHY37daa	I think washing your dog so many times in such a short time period will be harmful, won't he lose the oils in his skin? I don't like the idea of animal testing on your own pet. Can you choose another topic?|`|VQlkO7lqaa	Human shampoo won't hurt but it can dry out the dog's hair.|`|aYghne2oaa	it can make there skin really sore and itchy! dont do it|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Well, to start with, you'd need two dogs to do this experiment, since you need to have both the control dog and the dog you're experimenting on.  But it isn't the shampoo that makes a dog's coat shiny.  It's the dog's diet.  If you're feeding him a meat-based diet with few, if any, grains in it, his coat will be brighter and shinier than if you feed him a grain based diet with little or no meat (just meat meal or by products - not really meat).  It will take several months to see the difference. His coat won't get whiter with human shampoos any more than human shampoos make a human's hair get blonder or browner or redder.   <br>  <br>  As for whether it will affect his skin, yes it will.  It will dry out his skin and make it flaky (like dandruff), and his coat will lose its natural protective oils.  That means he won't be "waterproof" any more.  Right now, when it rains, there is a period of time when the rain just sits on the top of the dog's coat and doesn't penetrate to the skin unless it's really raining hard and the dog is outside in the rain for awhile.  The oils will come back, of course, but the skin may never be the same, and your dog will be very uncomfortable with the itching and scratching that comes with dry skin.<br>  <br>  It's not good for dogs to be bathed more often than once a week, and it's better that they get bathed once or twice a year rather than every month.  However, if a person has a show dog, that dog gets bathed before every dog show.<br>  <br>  There ARE shampoos that will make your dog's coat whiter and brighter - <a href="http://www.completecanine.com.au/pages/products/shampoos-and-conditioners/animal-house.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.completecanine.com.au/pages/p...</a> is one of them.  If you google "canine coat whitener" you'll find more.<br>  <br>  But... the object of your discussion is your science project, isn't it?  I don't know when the science fair will be held, but if you have a couple of months, you might change the focus of your project.  For example, you might start by taking a picture of your dog now, then feed it a meat-based kibble for two months, then take another picture.  You should be able to see the difference.  Your dog will also have more energy and a better disposition.  His stools will be smaller and less stinky.  To find a good meat-based canine diet, google "meat based dog food." <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas

dmuwhzQtaa	I am horrified at the condition the poor dear was in.  <br>  African Greys as you may know can live 50 to 80 years.  They have the capabilities of attaining the level of understanding of about a 5 year old child and generally maintain the behaviour of about a 2 year old child. <br>  If you think of her in this light you will get a better understanding of what she is going through.  She obviously had some rough treatment in terms of hands.  I have a five year old grey and she is wonderful.  <br>  I can tell you that you are going to have to spend a lot of time just being patient.  Imagine that child who doesn't speak english and that you are now trying to convince her that you are not like her previous owner.  Please try to react calmly in all situations.  <br>  <br>  My grey Joey has just come over to help me with this response.  She is only in her cage when I go out and I have actually 'potty trained' her for the most part anyway.<br>  <br>  You may get bitten but try not to react badly.  Mine at first would nip but if you didn't pull away abruptly she would not bite hard.  Your sudden movement will make her bite down even more.  It is the fear that you are going to do something bad to her that makes her react this way.<br>  Spend time each day (1/2 in the morning, 1/2 hour at night minimum) just being there, don't wave your hands about.  Keep them in site.  Offer treats but don't expect much.  The head scratching is a terrific start and shows some trust and the desire to be loved.<br>  <br>  Patience patience patience and it is really worth it.  They are incredibly sensitive.  I found that by allowing them their 'safe place' (the cage) where I would not put my hands or make them do anything they didn't want to, it gives them a HUGE sense of security.  <br>  Respect, love and understanding.  Just look in her eyes and you will see a difference as time progresses.<br>  <br>  Your African Grey is an abused abandoned child.  Treat her with love and time and the bond you will establish will fill your heart and your life.  <br>  If you start early by including a friend of the opposite sex in this process you may find over time that she will be open to you having relationships knowing you still love her too.<br>  Good luck<br>  If I could be of any help or further advise, please do not hesitate to contact me.<br>  With kind regards<br>  Sue|`|bnpgh39Waa	Go to the link below and start learning immediately about gaining trust through Clicker training. Greys are naturally suspicious... you'll have to go slow. But you will make immediate progress with this method. I have 3 greys... they all responded to positive reinforcement.|`|hpmAf0FXaa	Oh my word, poor bird.. She must have been tormented.. you are going to have to very patient with her and give her lots of attention... Find out by experimenting what treats she like and then use that as bait to gain her trust... keep on praising her in a tone that is forgiving and loving... I know of friends who had a similar situation and it took them quite a while to gain the birds trust, so patience is your best friend here....|`|rQEhf23raa	I have a 10yr Timneh- We think it is best to just give your bird a very comfortable tone of voice and some gentle talk. Echo was terrified of me at first- I thought I would never touch her either in our outside thecage. After alot of patience on my part- sitting by the cage and gently talking to her. Alot of eye contact from me eventually she started a return eye contact. We now have staredowns- she comes out of the cage with ease- no longer afraid. Give your bird time and love.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	It doesn't sound bad.  Remember, ferrets have to establish a pecking order.<br>  But here are some signs of a bad introduction:<br>  Blood or pooing during the encounter<br>  One ferret hiding continuously whenever the other ferret is around<br>  One ferret running away during 'wrestling' and not returning.<br>  <br>  You can test the last one yourself. When your ferrets start biting/jumping on each other, pick up whichever ferret you think is being bullied the most, and move him across the room.  If he runs back to the other ferret to initiate the bout again, it's just play, and there's no problem.<br>  <br>  Another tip: you have to always take ferret vocalization within the context of the situation.  What people say (hissing is a sign of anger/fear) is just a guideline, to give new owners a basis.  Once you get to know your ferrets, you learn their quirks, and what EXACTLY they mean when they express themselves through sound/body language.<br>  For example, hissing isn't always fear or anger.  It can be excitement (during play or when someone goes to initiate play), slight annoyance, etc.  When my ferrets hiss (rarely), it always means just a little irritation and they never are about to fight (even though it can sound like it).  My youngest mostly do it over their RMBs.  If mine are really angry at each other, they are silent and just strike (Pixie does this most often, since she's the oldest and has to teach the kits some manners :) ).<br>  Just watch your guys and learn their individual personalities, since each ferret's 'language' will be different.  Good luck :)|`|hpxc5szsaa	i dunno...|`|OrvTG44laa	This is how ferrets play.  They have very tough skin, so it doesn't hurt them.  While it looks like fighting, it is just them playing.  <br>  <br>  If they do start drawing blood, however, then they may be fighting.  Are they males?  Are they not neutered?  If they are unneutered males, this is probably fighting.|`|9qn74wi0aa	that is 100% normal ferret behavior, it is how they play, it looks worse than it is. As long as there is NO BLOOD, NO POOP, then NO FOUL! If one bleeds or poops because of the play it has escalated Beyond play and you have to separate them. At this point they are figuring out who is dominant ferret once that is established the play should get a little less intense. As part of play/dominance one ferret may drag the other by the scruff of the neck also 100% normal. <br>  Since they are new to each other they should be housed seperate until you are sure they get along. But in the meantime you can try to help speed up the process by switching their bedding. Put the towels or blankets you use for bedding in the others cage so it has the other scent and they get used to it. OR you can give both a bath so they both smell the same.
CECLWRFgaa	I 100% advise you to get a golden retriever. They have strong bladders that only require them to be taken out once or twice a day, that is, of course, once they are past the puppy stage, they are docile, they don't need much maintenance, and they will be your best friend and you wont regret it.<br>  They are so friendly and always have a sunny disposition and are better than labs because labs tend to be a LOT more hyper around people. <br>  Many buy labs because they do not shed as much as other dogs, but often, short-haired dogs shed just as much, and with my golden I just normally vacuumed once a week and the hair was not even a problem.<br>  <br>  Make sure if you're getting a half-bred golden that you know the other half. If a golden is mixed too much with another breed, it loses its sunny disposition because it becomes aggressive due to whatever its mixed with.|`|0HAn67yZaa	here are a few great choices to consider.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bassethound.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bassethound....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/beagle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/beagle.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/cavalierkingcharlesspaniel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/cavalierking...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/collie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/collie.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshepherd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/goldenretriever.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/goldenretrie...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/keeshond.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/keeshond.htm</a>|`|VQlkO7lqaa	If I were you, I'd go the the local SPCA.

They're letting other dogs know they're there setting their new boundaries.<br>  <br>  You can always crate them or put them in a spare bedroom, etc. which will take care of the blinds issue.

" Dog bark.  That is what they do."  They don't meow, moo, neigh, roar, chirp,  they bark.  This was told to me when my dogs were turned in for barking at all hours.  In my neighborhood there are about 2 dogs per household & most all are outside dogs & they all bark when they see someone on the street, a cat, another dog & they howl at sirens.  Animal Control Head honcho came out & stood at my fence line for a good half hour to 45 min. & listened to my dogs.  They did not bark at anything that wasn't worthy of barking at.  I received no citation.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you find something for white noise so you don't hear every bark.  I use a humidifier turned up on high.  During the summer I use a fan.  I also have one of those sound machines that I use sometimes.|`|Zjq6vcAvaa	i have a pair of labs and my neighbour has 5 little mixbreeds.his dogs bark all the but my dogs though r open all day ,never pay any attention.when i play with my labs or train them,his dogs empty their lungs out on the sound of our commands and running.i guess it must b that the change in enviroment and dogs r very sensetive to other dogs smell.u try to isolate their room and use a crate for a week.and give them some good workout at night so they hit it.feel real sorry for u.goodluck.|`|VQlkO7lqaa	They are learning the sights and sounds of their new home.  It may take them a while to get used to the new surroundings.  Be happy they bark, they could warn you in an emergency.|`|1itC64nVaa	Well my neighbors have 2 dogs, and they both bark! all the time, in the night! My mom went out there at like 2:00 a.m. and fed them some leftover pork chops, and they stopped. They might also be lonely too.|`|Tpls1ZXgaa	They provably need to go the restroom let them out then take them back in there cage if they still bark they just want to be out of there cage.|`|BCOmoJ59aa	well i have a big dog and if i dont put her in her cage at night then she usually will go to the window growl at random stuff like a trash bag blowing in the wind or somthing stupid like that. lol<br>  i keep her in a cage in a cage at night away from the window and cover the cage with a blanket she is trained to follow me up the stairs at night and go directly into her cage to sleep. If you make the cage comfotable for the dog it most likely will have no trouble sleeping and therfore stay quiet at night.<br>  but if you dont like the idea of the dog being in a cage i suggest disiplining the dog every time she barks. she will still bark if somebody enters the room that she doesnt know but that is just for protection.
8owlj2xHaa	Some of these answers are just to funny. Of course you can. Where do you think the fishstores get them from? ? Some special disease free ocean only known to them><br>  It is not safe to use the water in your tank though. To use ocean water you need to collect it from a mile or two out. The water close to shore is way to dirty to use. The aquariums that use seawater filter it in ways that are just not feasible for a home tank.|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	they might have diseases.  if you have a quarantine tank, it would be great to stick them in there for a few weeks before putting them into your tank.  if not, i really wouldnt add them.  if you found them along the shore, they may not be healthy since they are so far from the sea.  i would hate to have it affect the rest of my tank later on.  good luck!|`|z4pB3oVWaa	absolutely!you're getting for free something we who don't live near saltwater have to pay for!large hermits can be distructive,so be careful there.you can also collect your own seawater,too.invest in a good identification manual,so you know what you are collecting.its unlikely you would have problems with protozoan parasites,as they attack fish as part of they're life cycle,not inverts.the animals you buy at the pet store,most came from a simular habitat anyway.so i ask you,whats the difference?other than,is it a colder seawater invironment?or tropical?ship some my way!|`|qGpiWuATaa	No, I don't think so. I mean, it's kinda like taking someone from their home... but of course, if you really want it, put them in a quarantine tank first, because, yes, they may be carrying harmful things! But, please, think about how you are taking an animal from their natural habitat. And since everything in a tank is different, they might be mean to your fish, they might even die because they're not used to the water quality, or being captive. So think about it before you do it.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	In this situation, I would quarantine the crabs and snails you got from the sea for a few weeks to see if they show any signs of parasites or disease.|`|VSdhrf2Saa	i wouldent
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	You absolutely did the right thing for her.  Don't be sad she IS with your mother and her spirit will always be in your heart.<br>  <br>  It was wonderful for you to take your mother's cat and see her to the end with love and caring.  Your mother taught you well.|`|AA11151794	Yes.  All living things eventually die.  Unfortunately, sweet little innocent animals we love must also die.  I am literally,  buying some time for my beloved pet cat who is in chronic renal failure and I understand your pain.  These animals are our hearts.  It is okay for you to cry and to remember this dear family member, as you certainly will.  You might consider making a special poem, memorial tribute or charitable donation in the name of the pet and of your mom.  My heart goes out to you at this difficult time.  You can help yourself my remembering that time gradually heals all sorrows and fond memories will take the place of sadness as life goes on for you. Stay in touch with close friends and thank you for sharing your experience. Best wishes to you.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	im sorry,it takes time,it will get easier,but it does take time,I know cause I had to have my dog put to sleep on groundhogs day,just remember,you did what was right for her,and what she needed....|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	hey(:<br>  <br>  i'm sorry for your loss. it will hurt and it will continue to hurt, but you will move on eventually. you done the right thing and dont blame yourself for it. <br>  <br>  hope you feel better soon(:<br>  <br>  ?|`|AA11106082	I totally understand I lost my cat a few years ago. There part of the family and we grow so attached. You've just gotta think to your self shes not in pain any more she gone to a happier place, and you no its for the best.<br>   Ive recently just got two stray kittens they make me laugh so much and bring me so much happiness. I hope I make them happy too. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should get another cat, I was the best thing Ive done since losing my other cat. Id like to think Im giving them a loving home instead of them bein strays.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	We went through this twice in two months, and it's a hard thing to get past. You need to let yourself grieve or it just hangs on longer.<br>  <br>  What helped me was writing down all the good things I remembered with her, all the little stories, the funny things she did, how she was when she was healthy.  I may never read them, but it helped a lot to put it down on paper.|`|MS7e2iDEaa	oh im so sorry , my wee dog died 5 weeks ago and im still not over him i still cry every day , i have created a memorial for him on a website called gonetoosoon.com it really does help , so sorry for your loss xxxxx|`|1OjUQcJpaa	I am so sorry for you...I just had to put my sweet 3 1/2 year old cat to sleep on Tuesday and I am having really hard time too.  Mine had kidney failure and was hours away from death...he was hurting.  You did THE RIGHT THING and it is way better than your cat having to be in pain.  My advice (much of which I have received from others) is to grieve, grieve , grieve.  Don't hold it in.  If you feel like crying and you are at work or school or whatever...just do it.  It is more important to feel than for you to try to move on.  And keep that sweet thought strongly in your head...that she is with your mom now.  By the way, I am SO SORRY about your mother having died too.  That is just so devastating.   <br>  <br>  If you feel you need further support you should definantly lean on friends, family or seek council.  You may even need anti-depressants if it gets really bad and you feel you are going to a dark place, but I always recommend allowing yourself to be sad first because I have spent many years on and off anti-depressants and they can be blinding to true recovery.<br>  <br>   I wish you the absolute best...bless your heart.|`|0mb78CiWaa	I am so sorry. You just need to take it easy for awhile. Maybe you should get a new kitten to keep you company. It can keep your mind off of everything and keep you cheerful.<br>  <br>  You could also visit a psychiatrist too. They could help you get back to normal.<br>  <br>  Again I am so sorry.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	<a href="http://www.indigo.org/rainbow/" rel="nofollow">http://www.indigo.org/rainbow/</a><br>  <br>  Dont be sad, she is with your mother.
AA11151794	Do not allow young children who do not understand how to respect animals to handle your cat for any reason.  Take your cat to a veterinarian to determine if she is pregnant and if the cat and the kittens might be healthy.  Your veterinarian it the best adviser you can have to get information about the best food, medicines or vitamins to give a cat. A cat can go into heat as early as 6 months old.<br>  Female cats must be spayed before the first heat in order to avoid male cats being "all over her".|`|ebyGhKT8aa	SPRAY SOME BAD SMELL ON HER THATS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|UNFxjNHkaa	if you're saying that your cat is still "kinda" a kitten, then it is really not safe for her to give birth to kittens, it could do serious damage to her body.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest bringing her to the vet and having her spayed immediately.  This will abort the kittens - it is the SAFEST thing you can do for your cat right now. <br>  <br>  How young is she exactly?|`|hetZz4c1aa	The best answer is to have Snow Bell spayed.  She's very young to be having kits and it can be dangerous.  Please take her to your vet.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  If she is 1 1/2 years she can safely carry a pregnancy.  But how irresponsible of you not to have had her spayed!|`|AA10063059	nothing you can do or give her can stop her miscarrying just don't pick her up anymore|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It would be best to have Snow Bell spayed.  Being pregnant and nursing a litter of kittens will be quite a strain on her young body.  If you let her have the kittens, you need to have a vet check done to make sure she's in good health.  She needs to be eating a high quality kitten food from now till after nursing so she can keep up her strength. You need to be saving up at least $300 in case she has complications with delivery and needs a c-section (this often happens with young pregnant kittens).  She needs to stay indoors so she can be safe and can have her kittens in a safe place where you can monitor them.  You need to be studying all you can on orphaned kitten care as young cats often have no idea what to do with kittens and will sometimes reject them.  Start finding good homes for the kittens now. The average litter is 3-5 so you need that many homes plus a couple more in case someone backs out.  Have money saved so you can have the kittens wormed and their first set of shots at 8 weeks old.  They should not leave mom till they are at least 10-12 weeks old. <br>  <br>  Keep your niece away from the cat now and the kittens when they arrive. Be mean if you have to but don't let her near them.  <br>  <br>  After this litter, please have your cats spayed.  More than 10,000 cats and kittens are killed every day in shelters because there too many of them and not enough homes for them all.|`|WJ9zb2Vraa	Wail you need to throw a M-80 on yore cat and I guarantee you it will miscarry.<br>  <br>  Oh you want to know how to make it so it dont miscarry well I aint quite so expert on that sorry.

GVR9AjoQaa	VERY negligent on your part to leave the wormer where the dog could get it!   Did you even bother to read any of the warningson the packaging?   Dog chew on the balling gun?|`|hRikwc00aa	That would be a question for your emergency vet, who I'm hoping you're driving to right now.
AA10421436	I've had two pet rabbits myself.  I love rabbits as pets.  Mine would charge me too on occasion.  It usually had to do with not getting enough attention or that I didn't give it any raisins yet that day.  Rabbits love raisins and when I forgot to give it treats, it was mad.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your rabbit is being very aggressive.  You should consider having him fixed.  This costs about $40 at an animal shelter and that should stop that behavior. <br>  <br>  .|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Maybe your roommate teases it while you're not around.|`|XPfzzmQpaa	maybe your roommate is handling him to rough also try moving him to the other side of the room and take turns taking him home|`|qAg0PWEhaa	occasionally animals just don't like people for no reason at all<br>  <br>  what your roommate says is possible however it is more likely that it is just a grudge
Qc0x3Ldaaa	You can start handling them more frequently now.  As long as you are not upsetting the mother, there is no such thing as too much handling of puppies!|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	They will do that on their own,but domestic animals get their personality from the way they are treated by humans,just as children do.If you ever notice,mean people have mean dogs as a rule.They really do appreciate affection and if you show that you will have a fantastic companion.|`|hRikwc00aa	The puppies should be handled daily by family members. Once the pups are three or four weeks old, start having friends come over to handle them (make sure they have clean clothes and hands and have not been in any contact with non-vaccinated dogs).<br>  <br>  Also start desentizing the puppies to a variety of things - make sure they're comfortable on wood, carpet, slippery floors, and grass. When they're a little older, get a very shallow tray of water for them to splash around in (make sure you are supervising them closely, don't leave it out when you're not watching!!). Also start making loud noises around the litter - get them used to people yelling, loud TV or music, and loud, unexpected sounds like clapping or dropping something.<br>  <br>  Make sure the puppies don't leave mom until they are eight weeks old.|`|7hZ2yzK4aa	You're doing good. You need to handle them as much as possible...but dont be like inconsiderate either. let sleeping dogs lie, lol. But puppies, dogs everywhere, need mothers...but more importantly, they need a leader. let them know (through example with the mother) that you're Alpha. they're pack animals, and they kinda go nuts if they dont have a job of some kind. make sure you train them. <br>  so far, so good!|`|J7sf87mcaa	whn they are about 2months old they will start doing that themself. just watch out for them ans.d take good care of the type of food you give them it usually takes about 2 month|`|Os6VjLH0aa	From the minute they are born they should be handled, gently, and often.|`|xTsbN9YXaa	well make sure they stay with their mom but after like 6 weeks is when puppies can be seperated from their mom so if u want to be safe wait till then but i dont think it would harm them to start eariler|`|Tpls1ZXgaa	about 7 weeks or less
4bPizbOLaa	Well first i have 2 say texas Joe your funny lol but on the other hand get some water sprayers,a cage, and some treats(you don't have to get the treats) put him in the cage over night then in the morning go to get him out and if he  bites you spray him on the forehead a little but if he pures or something nice like rubs up against you then give him a cat treat and/or pet him and give him lots of attention ( even if he bites you and you spray him still give him some love like saying " who is a good little kitty cat you are such a good little kitty cat" if he keeps following you )|`|L5sfYvU7aa	How old is he? If he's young he might not still be used to you. Try to pet him when he's angry.|`|OkpbDYrUaa	I''m srry but not every1will like u <br>  It's pretty sad to kno tht CATS! don't like u eithr|`|WJ9zb2Vraa	Wail Carrie R you done come to the exact right expert on the subject.<br>  <br>  Seems yore problem was in neutering the little feller.  Aint nobody gonna like yall too much after you went and done such a painful invasion of his personal space.<br>  <br>  You need to find yore cat a gay boyfriend to help make up for his loss of intimacy you done inflicted on him.  By gay boyfriend I mean a gay cat boyfriend but I guess it dont really much matter.  I bet that will perk the little feller up.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	well you just have to earn his trust i the people i baby sit for have a male cat who also scratches and bites alot i found that if i let him come to me hold your hand out first and let him smell it he gets used to me and my scent and eventually i can pet him with no problems i also talk to him in a very soft voice and don't make any sudden movement with time he will come around|`|7QLDjdylaa	One of the main differences in personality between cats and dogs is their attitude towards people. It can take awhile before they trust you. (my cat hated me for two years before loving me.) don't force yourself on the cat. make sure your giving him enough food. but don't reject your cat when he asks for attention. hopefully, after awhile, your cat will learn to trust you.
GMvzUYbSaa	He will be fine :]<br>  You can put some neosporin on it, unless he's licking it. If he's licking it then it's a good thing. You may not even need a vet unless it's bad.|`|8c13b1e1d6401ca48454fd7bf55d38faaa	Blood on it like a scab? Or still bleeding?  There is a big difference.<br>  <br>  If there is a scab, I wouldn't be too worried about it.  It it is bleeding, it is going to depend if you care enough about your hamster to have vet charge or not. I would suggest going to the vet if it is still actively bleeding.|`|ICCP8m26aa	You should really bring it to a vet. You don't want that little wound to infect other places and your other hamster! Bring it to the vet ASAP.|`|rchaTSI9aa	Well I would say you should bring him to the vet. The last thing you want is for the wound to get infected. I don't know exactly how much money the vet costs, but I've heard that it isn't too too expensive. So call up the vet, and try to get him in as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck! ;)|`|Oa3KfmKCaa	Vet ASAP.|`|yo9Cr7wZaa	Vet<br>  !
1gDTiPVyaa	I have a cockatiel who cost me $681 for one series of vet trips. There were x-rays, blood tests, antibiotics and a stay at the hospital in a special cage to help her feel better. I keep telling her she needs to lay some golden eggs quick if she's going to do that to me. (My actual bill from the hospital when I had surgery the same month was only $602--that didn't include everything, but I still found it hilarious that her hospital stay cost more than mine did.)|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I help you out here:  The bigger the bird the more it costs.  Also, the more birds you have, the more it's going to cost you.  <br>  <br>  I've owned parakeets, budgies, and finches for 15 years, and the cost isn't very high as compared to other pet birds.  However, the cost is higher compared to 15 years ago.  I spend more money on them now than I used to because of all the prices of birdfood, toys, etc.. going up.  They don't need to go the vet all the time, so compared to other animals, are one of the least expensive you can own.  <br>  <br>  If you think you're spending too much now and it's causing you financial hardship, then don't buy anymore birds.  However, if you're sure you have the funds to keep more birds, then go ahead and buy them.  Make sure you have the space, too.<br>  <br>  I started out with one budgie, then two, and now I have three of them.  Budgies are so adorable that you just keep wanting more of them.  I've figured that I'm not owning more than three because I couldn't afford it.  Plus I have 2 zebra finches to feed and care for, besides.|`|dbFJ0a45aa	I have a cockatiel and he eats pellets, bird seed and some people food. He goes to the vet 3 or 4 times a year for a nail clip and a check- up. I spend between 300 and 350 dollars a year to keep him healthy and happy. My total cost includes new toys and treats which I give him  on Easter and Christmas to make him feel special and keep him occupied while I entertain company. The average cost per week is between 5.76 and 6.73 dollars per week. I offset the cost of his care,  food,and other needs by saving and cashing in soda bottles and cans. I also save change every week and my roommate gives the bird twenty dollars a month towards his care.<br>         I would wait a couple of years to find out if you have both male and female parakeets. If you do you won't have to buy more birds.<br>  Bubba|`|8zbSrlY3aa	The price of keeping one really isn't that high, considering you have a healthy bird. Food(pellets last longer than seed), New toys(which they need but they dont have to be expensive ones) and Fruit and veggies(if you can hopefully get your parrot to eat them). Lets say 50$ a month if they're spoiled lol. But if they are/ get sick it can be very costly so make sure you have money put aside just in case! <br>  in addition:(reccomended but optional)<br>  Yearly vet check ups lets say 50$ <br>  Wing/nail clipping (some places do it for free) lets say 20$<br>  Luckily budgies I find can be a little less "high maintenace" as far as parrots go but still need the same things none the less.<br>  I Have 6 parrots (2 budgies,2cockatiels,1 lovebird,1 ringneck parakeet and 1 dove) They all have differents likes and diets which can get expensive at times but I work at an Avian vet and get a good deal luckily. I LOVE ALL PARROTS!<br>  Good luck =)|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Financially-wise, it doesn't cost that much really. I have 5 parrots,and the biggest price is in time and energy. They all need love and attention individually in order to thrive and be happy.<br>  Some days, like today, it can cost my sanity, because they are all having a SCREAMING contest, trying to see who is the LOUDEST!<br>  ARRRRGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!<br>  Such is life with birds. :-)|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Check out this site. Besides each bird there is a price. There isn't any big birds if that is what you were looking for.

9Zdt7E56aa	Dwarf hamsters can be kept together (larger syrian hamsters never can), but they won't always get along. You should have a completely clean, disinfected cage (neutral territory) and should gradually introduce them, keeping a close eye on them. They might wrestle, and this isn't anything to worry about, but you have to be ready to separate them if they start to fight. This is the best way to introduce them, but there's no guarantees, you might have to keep them in separate cages for good. There's a better chance of females getting along than males.|`|W6uHaI1kaa	SEPARATE THEM IN CAGES|`|OrvTG44laa	Hamsters are solitary animals.  They don't need company, and they don't want it.  They prefer living alone.  The ones at the store are probably litter mates, which is why they aren't fighting.  While some hamsters will tolerate another hamster, it is too risky.  They can kill each other, or seriously hurt each other.  I suggest putting the new one in a different cage.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	Hamsters are territorial.  The old female sees the new one as an intruder.  The ones in the store are probably brothers and sisters, they're used to each other.  I used to have two brothers that I kept together, they never fought.  But, yeah, you need to keep these two seperate.  Next time if you want two, get them at the same time.<br>  I've heard a trick of sprinkling talcum powder on them.  That way they both smell the same.  You could give that a try.|`|JqVU84yLaa	don't ever put the same gender of hamster or any of animals in a cage because they will fight for dominance separate them or get rid of the other girl and buy a male instead|`|rcQgfKPTaa	u cant give them a chance to get along because they might kill eachother. <br>  give one away or seperate them<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|wa47F7DLaa	awe.. yea my birds fighted at first, just put them in cages next to each other.. then take them out and have them near eachother but not close enought to fight and eventually when they see eachother the first thing they think wont be "attack!" itll be "eh shes always here.." thats what i did with my birds, now theyre in the same cage. :)|`|Rfj2ULibaa	You can only keep sibiling dwarf hamsters together, and even then, once they have been separated they can't be reintroduced.  You will need to get a second cage or potentially end up with dead hamsters.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/p/dwarfhams.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hamsters/...</a>|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	umm, they might kill each other.  we had some that tore each other to shreds, so....watch out!  like we woke up one morning and our really fat hamster was clawing at one of the other ones and then sat on it and completely flattened it.  it was HIDEOUS|`|ISRTiSnoaa	they can only be together when they are young, mixing to adult hamsters is not a good idea, so i would advise getting a seperate cage so they don't kill themselves. <br>  good luck|`|Oa3KfmKCaa	Have 2 separate cages for them, and put them maybe a foot apart from eachother.|`|yo9Cr7wZaa	SEPARATE THEM NOW!!!!!

I had to males. The only reason they get along at the store is caause they are younger and haven't developed their territorialness yet. Mine wasn't related and they lived together till the bigger one got older then he tried to murder my younger one. So I seperated them.|`|OcLWUMtXaa	i have 2 female Dwarf bunnies and they sometimes dont get along! Maby you need a bigger cage. They need to get use to each other!

YpEswTQdaa	Yes Guinea Pigs,also known as 'Cavies' are naturally shy,however most DO become very tame & friendly towards their owners.<br>  <br>  Try to not rush around/with them if you can help it,slow movements. It takes a while to 'earn' a G-pigs trust. Hopefully they will become tamer,some are more flighty than others. I have had shy ones that i have tamed to be calmer pigs. Don't worry,i bet they'll become tamer piggies!<br>  <br>  Good luck.xxx|`|bv3QKW0Kaa	Yes. Guinea pigs are timid from the get go.<br>  It takes lots of handeling(everyday) and feed them treaties too!<br>  Like Oranges :D<br>  They need lots of vitamin c..especially since they cant produce it on their own...
QB0CnrmJaa	You can put your bird house near a bowl of seeds that they eat from. Seeds like sunflower seeds, and poppy seeds and liked by many birds.<br>  <br>  An only exception is that the birds will drop the shells onto your ground. I suggest putting a rug/rock/mat under the feeder so you could easily wrap up the seeds and put them in the trash with no mess. <br>  <br>  You could put a bird house in a tree, not hanging though, on a fence, or someplace safe from rain, wind etc. But make sure it is at least 6-7 feet off the ground. <br>  <br>  You may have to wait for several weeks or months for birds to actually lay eggs in the bird hose. So don't except sudden happenings.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your birdhouse placing! Hope this helped :)|`|qAg0PWEhaa	it depends on what type of bird you want to live in the house<br>  it is best to put it in the shade so it is cool inside some birds like the house in trees but they can usually build their own nests in trees, just make sure it is large enough <br>  <br>  purple martins for example need the house to be at least 30-40 feet off the ground, at that height it doesn't matter where you put it<br>  <br>  i guess the best piece of advice is from field of dreams "if you build it they will come"|`|as3EF0BSaa	Birds have specific requirements, in habitat and houses.<br>  Bird houses should be high, out of the reach of cats.   It should be near cover, not out in the sun.  Martin houses are the exception to this.|`|gBSAiEiGaa	You can put in a tree, or if you want birds around ur house u can put it right out side ur door. Or you can put it in a garden for birds.|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	You can put them on trees  or up on a post.

Jkt3UkTBaa	If you are doing fish less cycling then wait till all of the ammonia/nitrite/nitrate levels are down.<br>  <br>  But if you are getting the tank setup, just let the filter, heater and any other accessories run for about 3 days, put all of the gravel and ornaments in before the fish, including live plants.<br>  <br>  Cycling the tank takes around a month, you can speed it up if you use cycled filter media from a buddy or cycled tank water, even gravel or ornaments will help a lot, be sure to check the ammonia/nitrite/nitrate levels every 3 days while cycling.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, it's a good thing that you haven't got any fish for the tank yet since the tank needs to cycle. The cycle can take some time, but it's best you wait.<br>  <br>  For a 35 gallon, you can make a nice community tank, but it really depends on what you want. I suggest looking up fish profiles because some fish like certain water parameters, some like living in schools, some can grow too large for certain tanks etc.<br>  <br>  Check the links out.|`|VSdhrf2Saa	when i first got my fish tank i let it run for 4 weeks just to make sure every thing was working properly and if i were you i would get all your plants and rocks first then let it run over night|`|ZkY6dUTFaa	2 or 3 days before putting any fish in.

7HxJvbjMaa	Yes you can, and I always suggest it to people who are setting up a new tank. And it will shorten the duration of your cycle too.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	This will help a lot, and will greatly encourage a beneficial bacteria colony.<br>  <br>  Go ahead!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Yes, this can help your tank out and speed up the cycle, but the tank you take the filter sponge from needs to have 2 cycled sponges in order for that tank to stay established and not go into another cycle all over again.|`|3KoVhMnuaa	it wont speed up the cycle of the tank. it will add some beneficial bacteria. itd best to rinse the sponge off in the same cycled water, so it doesnt remove all the bacteria.
7HxJvbjMaa	No, the cichlids and puffers are not compatible with your live bearers. Cichlids need a species only tank and are very aggressive. Puffers are aggressive too.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Generally any name with "cichlid" in it means a no when adding to a community tank with livebearers. Your guppies especially will vanish as the cichlids get bigger. I'd stay away from puffers too.|`|AA10616287	I'm not sure about puffers, but I definitely wouldn't put Aceis with your current fish.  Aceis are African cichlids.  They require a high PH, whereas your fish do best in mid-range PH water (around 6.5 or so).  Also, Aceis are aggressive, not community fish.  They will chase and possibly kill your fish.  Although they are primarily vegetarians, they will eat anything that fits in their mouths.  The guppies especially would be under attack.|`|VSdhrf2Saa	chilads are aggresive fish they should have their own tank they are know to be fin nippers so your sword tails wont have that long thing on their tail any more D:

GMvzUYbSaa	Okay, so first off, you should get a syrian hamster (teddy bear hamster.) I know the dwarf hamsters look so cute, but the truth is, they're mean and they take a long time to tame. Also, you'll need a good cage. I would go with a bin cage. It's very cheap and spacious. Here's a pic: <a href="http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/5712/dsc0185rc7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/5712/...</a><br>  But that one is a little fancy. All you need to do is cut out most of the top and replace it with hardwire cloth/window screening. And get a good sized CLEAR bin. But if you're not into DIY, here's some good cages:<br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/106282/PETCO-3-Level-Small-Animal-Habitat.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/106282/PETC...</a><br>  ^ This one is good, but make sure you don't get a cage with more tubes than this one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3076905" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  ^Looks pretty good but has some bad reviews<br>  <br>  But of course, a bin cage would be the best and cheapest.<br>  <br>  Also you need to get it a good hamster food. Anything with lots of colorful seeds and whatnot. I use this: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2754591" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  When you first get your hamster, it will be shy. Mine was very vicious, but turned out to be the sweetest thing. And don't go returning your hamster because it's mean. You have to tame it. Hold it everyday. If it's a jumpy hamster, then dry out the bathtub and sit in it with your hamster. That way, if it does escape, then he can't get out. Some people wear gloves if it's a biting hamster. And it might be good to rub your hands in some of your hamster's bedding. (The clean kind)<br>  This way, you will have a familiar smell. Never wear lotions or perfumes when you hold your hamster. Also, hamsters are nocturnal so it's best to hold them in the evening. But it's okay to wake them up every once in a while.<br>  <br>  As for toys, you hamsters need a wheel. One like this: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753369" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  ^But make sure you get the bigger size. I have that one and it's totally silent! And hamsters need wheels. Otherwise they will get bored, and fat. Hamsters also love tubes. I use toilet paper/paper towel rolls and stick them in their cage. They don't need anything fancy. And if they happen to get stuck, they can always chew it up. Hamsters need chew sticks. Like these: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753354" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a> or any little blocks.<br>  Their teeth NEVER stop growing. If they get too long, they won't be able to eat and they will starve. It's okay if they chew on that bars of their cage, but they need chew toys. You can also feed hamsters any fruits and veggies besides watermelon, celery, lettuce, or anything with a high water content or they will get diarrhea. My hamster's favorites are sweet potato and carrots. <br>  <br>  Never let your hamster go near water (besides the kind in their water bottles.) Don't let them swim or give them baths. Not only do they not need or want this, it can kill them. They can get wet tail, which is where they get diarrhea and die from dehydration. But if for some reason your hamster does get wet tail, there is medication. You can but it at petco/petsmart. And your hamster needs a waterbottle like this: <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2752722" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  (doesn't have to be that exact brand) <br>  MAke sure you replace their water every day, or every other day. Replace their food when needed, and clean their cage once a week. Just trow away their bedding, and give them fresh bedding. No need for soap or fancy cleaning stuff.<br>  <br>  The hamster will cost around $10 itself and the bin cage will only be like $20 but a store bought cage will be more. Plus the cost of food/bedding whenever you need it. Overall, they're pretty inexpensive.<br>  <br>  That's all you need to know :)|`|cb5fKlRCaa	if  you have a little budget get a dwarf hamster as they requiter little space but saying this they do like to be in pairs .syrians (golden hamsters) like to Live Alone but can grown quite big .if you get a decant sized cage it costs around ￡40 or $70 hamsters need bedding saw dust a wheel food water and love toys if they are not occupied they may try to escape hope this helps ,,,meg x p.s dwarfs are more active syrians are easy to handle and remember all hamsters are nocturnal .|`|OjXAcwJPaa	1. theyre VERY fragile.<br>  2. they'll eat most anything that grows. dont give them onions. not good for them. they love hard boiled eggs, oatmael, P.B carrots, Kix.<br>  3. think..if you were little would you like to spend your entire life in a 1' square cage? give them some room.(we connected a couple larger cages together, with tunnels & such.

So I would get a med. size cage. And don't put too much stuff inside of it. Just enough stuff for your hamster to play around in it and still like it! But if you get a hamster at your local pet store then (depending) your hamster wont cost but $15.00. depending though. BUT TRUST ME ITS WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ICCP8m26aa	OK. If you don't want little hamster babies don't get a boy and a girl together. If you want dwarf hamsters only buy one, don't worry they don't get that lonely. If something doesn't seem right with your hamster take it to the vet. My first hamster was a teddy bear hamster. So, maybe you want that. Don't wake it up early. It'll get stressed out. Um. . . you'll need a food bowl, vitamin thingy which you put in the water, a water thing, hamster wheel, a cage, and some chew toys and more. Ask a person at the pet store about stuff you need! I hope that might help a bit.

Although Discus are a bit picky about their water conditions, normal tap water that has been conditioned (with a product such as Aqua Plus) will work fine. The conditioner removes chlorine and chloramine, two harmful chemicals. If you condition it, tap water is actually better, and safe, because you don't need to re-add the minerals. I've kept Discus for quite a while, and I've certainly never bought water for 60 cents a gallon! You really don't need to go that far. having a good filter is fine. However, if you WERE going to get the water, get the RO water because it will save you money and excess of the API. Make sure the water was not treated with chemicals to sanitize it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|svrFBaENaa	It depends a lot on what the water coming out of your tap is like. 50-80% may be enough.<br>  <br>  The problem with using distilled water is it has no KH value.

Don't confuse it with Animal Control (Dog Pound). You can get a fixed purebred including all of it's shots & registration for under $100. The only downside is you may not be able to get a puppy & you will be interviewed to see if you can handle the needs of the dog. So learn about the dog before going.<br>  And DON'T get a dog from a pet store. They get their dogs from puppy mills. These "breeders" put out a lot of puppies under VERY inhumane circumstances.

Any dog will want to spend 100% of their day with their master, so you need to think about how you would handle that.<br>  <br>  As far as dogs that are easier to train, that again would depend on what you want to train your dog to do. If its just house training that you are referring to, this is quite simple to do for most dog types.<br>  <br>  You simply need to be consistent in what you are asking your dog to do (when and where). You also need to reprimand them when they do something you don't want them to be doing, and reward them when they do what you want them to do.<br>  <br>  Reprimands and rewards are usually handled by subtle changes in the tone of your voice. You never need to yell at a dog and you never need to strike them. Dogs are desperate to please their masters, so if you are consistent, there will be no problem in training your dog.<br>  <br>  The Pet Gate Guy|`|jlngtrj7aa	To start, you need to assess what kind of dog will best fit your lifestyle. Do you live in a large house, or an apartment? how much time will you have time to play and walk with the dog?

Saving a dog is so gratifying, and they are often the most wonderful animals. Both of my dogs came from the shelter. And it saves you tons of money...
IxuMTGd4aa	You feed it once a day, and you give it fresh water once a day. Clean out the bowl thoroughly, and give it lukewarm water and fresh food. To help get insects otu of the feed and keep it fresh and good, keep it in the fridge or in the freezer. And make sure that the chunks aren't so big in the food. And the water can't contain any chemicals, so bottled water and tap water is good, too.<br>  ~~~<br>  Change the bottom of your cockatiel's cage every few days or possibly more often if possible. Wash the cage bottom weekly, and monthly, disinfect the whole entire cage completely! Diluted chlorine bleach is one of the best and least expensive disnifectants available, but you must wash everything, including perches, toys, bars, bottom, and especially the grate! And make sure it is thoroughly cleaned before putting the cockatiel in the cage. But wait about five or ten minutes for it to dry.<br>  <br>  So, here are a few ways to clean:<br>  Diluted water and bleach.<br>  Hot water and vinegar.<br>  Hot water.<br>  Dish soap (make sure it is unscented and non-toxic!).<br>  Non-toxic bleach.<br>  ~~~<br>  They can eat:<br>  <br>  Fruits:<br>  Apples<br>  Pears<br>  Peaches<br>  Bananas<br>  Berries<br>  Kiwi<br>  Pomegranate<br>  Grapes<br>  <br>  Before feeding your parakeets any fruits or vegetables, clean well! Most store bought fruits/veggies have pesticides on them which can prove to be lethal to your bird.<br>  <br>  Veggies:<br>  Carrots<br>  Sweet Potatoes<br>  Broccoli<br>  Cauliflower<br>  Bell Peppers<br>  Beets<br>  Legumes<br>  Frozen Mixed Vegetables<br>  Kale<br>  Zucchini (and other squash)<br>  Asparagus<br>  Bean or Alfalfa Sprouts<br>  Spinach<br>  Brussels Sprouts<br>  <br>  Again, make sure you clean well! Pesticides are used on store-bought vegetables and plants and can kill your bird.<br>  Also, try cutting up the veggies or fruits into dices, long slices, or thin little strips. You can feed apple whole as long as you skin it. My birds love to shred apple! You can also feed them *plain* apple sauce! Also, make sure you remove the roots, pits, and seeds of the food you give them. <br>  <br>  Foods You Should NEVER Feed:<br>  Chocolate<br>  Avocado<br>  Sugary Foods<br>  Salty Foods<br>  Greasy Foods<br>  High Fat Content Foods<br>  Caffeine<br>  Soda<br>  Alcohol<br>  Pits/Seeds/Roots of Fruits/Veggies<br>  Candy<br>  Rhubarb<br>  <br>  Here is another list with more options:<br>  <br>  Greens: Kale, Bok choy, spinach, chard, mustard greens, radish, carrot tops, beet tops, dandelion greens (make sure they haven't been sprayed or collected near a roadway) and just about any other leafy green veggie.<br>  Veggies: Carrots, peas, zucchini, corn, squash, radishes, bell pepper, broccoli, green beans, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, chili peppers.<br>  Grains: Steamed rice (white, brown, wild) cooked pasta, whole wheat and multi-grain bread, popcorn (no butter), bran muffins, polenta, grits, cous cous, sprouted seeds and grains (quinoa, amaranth, millet, teff, kamut, spelt), oatmeal, all natural cereal.<br>  Proteins: Raw sunflower seed (small amounts), chicken, eggs, fish, small amounts of hard cheese such as Jack and cheddar, tofu, cooked beans (lentil, kidney, black, garbanzo, navy, white).<br>  Fruit: Apples (seeds removed), peaches, bananas, melons, mango, pomegranate, oranges, papaya, strawberries, plums, pears, berries, nectarines, cherries. (Please remove all pits from fruit.)<br>   <br>  Bell Pepper Ring Treat:<br>  I use red, green, and yellow Bell Peppers for this recipe. I cut the Bell Pepper into little rings, or circle, so it looks like "O". Make sure you take out all of the seeds, and make sure you wash it very well. Hang them around the cage, or put them in a bowl together and let your bird paly with them! They love to use them as necklaces, munch on them, and hold them on their food. This is a great, healthy, and very fun toy for your cockatiel!<br>  <br>  Wow, look at how much we learned and how fast time goes by! You learned your information and you have done your research, now it is time to choose a bird. <br>  <br>  It is best to choose a hand fed baby or at least a young bird that has been handled regularly. Prices will vary with color and you can expect to pay a bit more from a conscientious breeder, but a well handled young bird is worth any extra cost. Cockatiels are quite widely available at pet stores, but these birds may have an unknown history. As a result, they may be older, not used to being handled, and harder to tame. <br>  <br>  Look for a bird that is bright, alert and active. A bird sitting quietly with puffed feathers might be ill and is best avoided. The feathers should be smooth and shiny and lay down flat on the body. The feathers around the vent/cloaca should be clean, dry, and free of fecal matter. The scales on the feet should be smooth, the nails in good condition, the beak should be smooth and well-shaped, and the nostrils should be clear and clean. <br>  <br>  Feather plucking is a very common problem with birds, I think it is too common. Birds would pluck their feathers for multiple of reasons, such as stress, depression, and the most common reason, not enough stimulation. <br>  <br>  You can stop this by spending more time with your tiel and giving it more toys to stop him/her from being too bored and not having enough stimulation. You can also get another bird, but I do not advise this because the older bird will spend more time and attention to the new bird.<br>  <br>  Your tiel may be stressed because you left or something is bothering it. Is everything turned off at night like computers, television, or radios? Your cockatiel could have been stressed because it didn't have enough sleep. They may have been stressed because something happened or something frightened it, or you got it a new toy or brand of bird food and/or treats, or other things. <br>  <br>  I would switch EVERYTHING back to what it was when they didn't pluck their feathers, and this may stop its extremely bad habit.<br>  <br>  Depression is very common with birds, too. There are multiple ways to stop this. One is to get a new bird or toys, get medication from your Avian vet/specialist which I do NOT recommend because this could easily kill your birds, or another safer and easier way is to spend a lot more time with your bird.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to get medication for your bird, these are the best ways that I have found to give it to them:<br>  * Feed it to the bird with a syringe. I have found this works best with younger cockatiels, and with older birds it is harder to do. But do NOT force feed it! This can choke your tiel, or get the medication in its nostrils or eyes, which probably isn't the best thing.<br>  * Put the medication (in powder or liquid form) in the cockatiel's water. The bird will drink it, no harm done. Just make sure the bird doesn't bathe in it or else it can cause damage to the feathers.<br>  * Put it in the bird's food. This could be in powder, seed, treat, or any form that won't make the food nasty. This, from my point of view, is perfectly safe.|`|rOK7eJQtaa	feed once a day... small birds clean weekly..  larger birds like macaws need daily..... always have water available.... get toys and make sure your feed says its for ur type of parrot. All birds love millet, treats, and also need cuttle bones.....Please just research the type of bird your getting....<br>  <br>  the above person just copied the first results from google... do research to the paticular bird!|`|9V37u3Kqaa	What kind of bird? Well what you should do is get a book on the bird you want, you will figure out what you want to know and more, you don't even have to buy it, try your library . Birds are not like cats and dogs you keep the food (seed and pellets) in the cage all the time. They will eat when they are hungry. But you have to keep an eye on it so when it gets low you can refill it. They also need fresh everyday (more if they poop in it or get it dirty) I put a container of water in the fridge for 12-24 hours before giving water to my birds, this way the chlorine has a chance to get out of the water. Every 2-3 thee days I take the bottom slid out try with news papers lining it and replace the news papers. About every two week I rearrange the cage (perches toys etc) and put all the perches and toys in hot HOT soapy water for a while than scrub them. I also stick the cage in the shower and wash that down. If you see that he went to the bathroom on a perch just wipe it off.   Here is a site to help you get started good luck! <a href="http://www.parrotcentral.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrotcentral.net/</a>|`|as3EF0BSaa	The assumption of a cockatiel AND an encyclopedic (zzzzz) dissertation.

xL9EpNctaa	spaying her is the only thing that will stop heat cycles|`|yXDtGo8taa	Take it to a veterinarian. I don't think it's because she's in heat, she could be ill|`|0w3Uyprpaa	Spaying is the only answer.  Your cat will go into heat every month until she gets pregnant.  In my town we have a program to spay and neuter cats and dogs for only $20 each, I had 2 cats 'fixed' and all their shots updated for under $80 through this program.  Look in your phone book or call a vet to ask about this kind of program in your area.  Not all cats are so overt in their behavior while in heat, urinating in inappropriate area spreads their scent so a male can find her.  I even had a male find a way into my house to get at my female.  There is often a wait for spaying at the vet or in spay programs so call soon, it could take a month to get in for an appointment, also it is more expensive if your cat is pregnant to have her 'fixed'.  Between now and then keep her shut up with a litter box, food and water so you can contain her from peeing on your bed etc., Talk to her and pet her letting her know it will be ok and you will take care of her.  Good luck!|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	you need to get her spayed it will stop the screaming and cats are in heat non stop till there mated and preg it may not stop the peeing i would call your local vet and get info on it also clean the box as much as possible and the pee asap if your other cat smells it she might take it for another box i have a 16yr old female who pees on mostly clothes but she cant control her bladder any more we talked to the vet and she printed out paper on how to prevent her peeing all over the house hope this helps
6odO4PK0aa	I don't do it with my horses. But , I train english and It's kind of a western thing. I'd say it's okay for an hour or 2 . ( Like at a one day show.  I sometimes  tie my horses to a the trailer With a hay net.) <br>   All Day is too much , No water or food? and They Can't move or stretch? That sounds Like abuse to me.|`|xadlDnegaa	its not abuse if they arent there for long periods of time.  horses can go weeks without eating or drinking.  i know it sounds really mean but a horse has to realize they are the horse and they have an owner.  most horses are tied to a post to calm them down and make them relax.  it really isnt done today, most people use a twitch to calm a horse down.  this is just basically squeezing the upper lip which releases this calming sensation and the horse basically goes into a sleep type stage!  hope this helped!!!!|`|dBRxfRGqaa	it's supposed to teach patience, but i really agree that all day long is way too long. an hour or two is ok, but there are other ways to teach patience. i don't think it's abuse though, it just is boring to the horse.|`|as3EF0BSaa	There's a time when any horse needs to be tied.  However, tying one with it's head up for hours so it'll lower the head in a WP class, that's abuse.|`|VCIdnISPaa	Not abusive.  It is part of teaching them ground manners, learning to stand still (as you would want them to on a trail ride, and you decide to take a break), or to have a farrier work on them.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	no,it depends,if you tie them up in the rain,or direct sunlight,THEN it might be abuse,but tying them up teaches patience...and respect...I have tied mine for a few hours before....and he is fine...|`|IMPvzBk1aa	If you are referring to tieing the head up high, It is an old "some cowboys" training method.  One that was never used by the more evolved and enlightened cowboys. I have still seen this done by some "trainers" to this day, and not many years ago one horse died while tied up and was witnessed hanging dead from the tree by a schoolbus load of children as the child of the "trainer" was dropped off  after school.  The horse was removed before authorities arrived and nothing was done.<br>  <br>  If you are simply referring to leaving a horse tied without the head being raised, then it is not abusive unless the horse is not protected from the elements, insect attacks, or worries from potential wildlife attacks.|`|motYSp5waa	its not really abuse i had to do it with my horse and its just telling them that they cant get away with whatever they are doing. It helps them learn ground manners and it also makes them respect their owners and handlers.

NAGiNKFWaa	I don't understand what method you are using.  You can't let a puppy have full run of the house, it is too overwhelming.  They are only in the crate when you are not watching them, all other times you are practicing being good in the house.  My honest advice would be to give the puppy away and wait until your baby is 8-years-old before you get another dog.  Puppies and babies are never a good mix, it is just cruel.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|VQlkO7lqaa	Stop changing the way you do this first of all.  You must be completely confusing the pup.<br>  <br>  Keep the pup in a small area.  If you do not want to crate train it, use your bathroom.  The door can be closed and the pup contained.  @0 minutes after feeding the pup, take it outside to one specific area and wait for it to go.  Praise it like crazy.  After than take the pup outside to the same area every hour.  Praise and more praise.  KEep the area you are containing the pup in absolutely as clean as you can.  This will teach the pup to like a clean space and to not think of it's 'crate' as the place to go potty.  If you have a big space, you can put pads down.  However, you will need to leave them down, even a bit used, so the pup can realize that is the area to go potty in.  There is more but this is a start.|`|JEUP2MyDaa	Well first of all every dog is different so some of these people on here need to stop and think about that.What i did with my dog is i would take him outside about every 15 min. For an hour at a time.When he would go i would reward him and tell him good boy and all that stuff.If he would go on the floor i would tell him bad with a strong tone in my voice and take him out side for a few min.I t took about 2 weeks to completly train him.But like i said every dog is different.|`|GPCLoECLaa	When my dog was a puppy we used the puppy pads they were awful, he started peeing on rugs because he thought they were the pads. I broke that quickly, you just need to take him outside as often as possible. Say it's time to go potty and if he goes outside, make a big deal about it plus reward it was treat!|`|io3lMQgFaa	Hey there!  Here's my "story" that I've been recommending:<br>  Me and my boyfriend got a German Shepherd about 6 months ago. We took him out VERY frequently, and whenever he would go to the bathroom we'd praise him; it helps to start saying the action when they do it (good boy go pee!). Whenever he had an incident in the house, which he didn't really have many chances to, we'd say "no!" if we caught him in the moment and would immediately take him outside, but of course if you don't see him actually doing it, just clean it up and try to take him out more often until he gets it. If you do find something after the fact, don't tell your dog "no", because some dogs would then keep going in the house and try to hide it from you. Again if you catch him in the act it's fine to say "NO" and take him outside immediately, and if he does go anymore to the bathroom out there then praise him. From what we've done with our German Shepherd, we quickly got to the point where we could take him out and say "go pee", he'd pee, and we say "good boy." <br>  <br>  I know it's hard for you to keep one method of training, but the thing is, consistency is the only thing that works for dogs when training.  Find time to just take out the dog frequently, and after a while you won't need to.  Good luck :)
dISHCaqhaa	Flying has impressed man ever since Icarus tried his hand at it. It's a different story that he couldn't make it. Many of us have wanted to fly freely in the air, without any inhibition or any traffic rules. I have always envied birds for their ability to soar so high and be so close to the world of the clouds. Birds have therefore always interested and impressed me.<br>  <br>  Does flying mean the same to you? Do colorful birds steal your concentration and make you yearn to be like them? If you are passionate about birds, especially parrots, and have always wanted to own one, but never dared to bring one home, this is the website for you. Parrots are one of the most colorful members of the entire bird kingdom. They can be cute and cuddly, and sometimes, simply awe you with their majesty and elegance. Parrots have many sub-species. Macaws, cockatoos, cockatiels and budgies are some examples. They are often referred to as winged rainbows.<br>  <br>  Bringing a parrot home is like bringing home a new born baby. It is not easy to understand parrot behaviour. Some pet parrots are very adjusting and will eat anything you serve. The bigger parrots are often stubborn and moody. They want your attention all the time and grow very loud otherwise. Parrots may be eclectus, Senegal, Amazon, African Grey and many more. Parrot training is an art. A talking parrot can be hillarious and perform amazing tricks.<br>  <br>  If you are in need of some color in your life, a macaw is the right companion for you. The blue and gold macaw is just as sensational as the Hyacinth or the Scarlet or the Hahns. The green wing macaw will simply take your breath away. For a healthy bundle of colors, the macaw diet should be right. The old saying that the way into a man's heart is through his stomach applies to the secret to a healthy parrot. <br>  <br>  After a long harsh day everyone deserves a sweet pill at home. Cockatoos as pets are the best rewards. The cockatoo behavior is so endearing you will miss home every minute you are out of it. Goffin, Moluccan nad Umbrella cockatoos are absolute winners. You can't resist falling in love with a rose breasted cockatoo. <br>  <br>  Conures are also a colorful bundle of feathers that win you with their playfulness and sweet dispositions. Blue Crown conures, green cheek conure, nanday conure, sun conures and the jendaya conure are absolute visual delights. Take time off for conure care because they are lively but tender birds. They will return your love many times over. Conure training should be as good as possible, otherwise they tend to become just as unruly as ill-behaved children.<br>  <br>  Lovebirds are meant to be loved and cared for. In fact, you can't resist falling in love with them. African lovebirds are the cutest things on earth. However, they tend to become moody and irritating if they miss proper lovebird care. A pet lovebird is a thing to be cherished as a prized possession. Love birds fill up your life with love and harmony. Bring one home to feel the difference. Besides lovebirds, parrotlets are absolute darlings! Good and patient parrotlet training will show its results when you will no longer be embarrassed to call guests home. <br>  <br>  Parrots or parakeets (as they are known in the USA) are sensitive birds that need a lot of care and maintenance. The quaker parakeet is simply a visual delight. It is sheer joy to see and hear these highly intelligent members of the avian kingdom imitate human speech and learn tricks. Good parakeet behavior is a proof of excellent parakeet training. As a parakeet owner, parakeet health should be numero uno among your worries. Parakeet illnesses are quite common and you need to be careful in dealing with them. <br>  <br>  Cockatiels as pets are darlings in the house. Cockatiel behavior can be groomed and almost perfected by good cockatiel training. Cockatiel diseases are also quite common. Learn all tips for cockatiel health maintenance before you bring one home.<br>  <br>  Budgies, as is evident from the name itself, make wonderful playmates and, sometimes, even soulmates. They are one of the sweetest living beings on earth. They make your life worth living.

In the sun you will see hints of blue through the fawn on the rest of the body.    <br>  <br>  The adut dogs you are talking about do not sound blue fawn at all. They sound Blue.

As over bred as this breed is it is impossible to know or predict the adult coat. Unless the breeder has been breeding many generations of the same breed going just for color.

If everything is okay with the fish..give them time.|`|svrFBaENaa	Mollies can get to 4 inches in under a year. I know this from personal experience, so I doubt they're too old.<br>  <br>  My guess is the fry are getting eaten. The reason you may be seeing fry form the plates is because there are a lot more of them, producing more fry.<br>  <br>  This theory would only be valid if you don't see your male mollies trying to mate with the female mollies however. If they aren't trying to mate, that's a different story.<br>  <br>  Water temp could be a factor too. Mollies like warm water up around 80. And to get the best breeding results out them, a light amount of aquarium salt isn't enough.|`|xdzn5ib5aa	Do you separate the fry? They may be getting eaten before you get to them.

AKC will NOT register that dog, even with a DNA test.  The only way that a dog can be AKC registered, is if both parents are AKC registered, with full registration, and if the breeder gives you the puppy application, with full registration rights.  I've been a breeder for over 10 years, and only deal with AKC champion lines.  So I know what I'm talking about when it comes to AKC.<br>  But if you want papers on the dog, your best bet is through CKC.  The website is continentalkennelclub.com  You can go to the site and print the application.

First, they aren't any good, and you don't even know if she has worms and those things are hard on a dog's system.<br>  <br>  As for her coat thinning, I'm afraid that's just a symptom of old age.  When dogs age, their glands don't distribute oils to the hair like it used to, their coat's condition isn't as good and it often gets thinner.  You can't make her coat thicker again, but you can help her out by giving her a salmon oil capsule daily or adding a bit of olive oil to her food (1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon depending on her size).<br>  <br>  As to her eating more, given her age, she needs a health check twice a year anyway, so mention that to her vet when she goes in next.  It could be a symptom of a problem.|`|cnZlMojUaa	You should call the vet and tell him your dog's symptoms. You may be recommended to bring the dog in for some blood and urine tests.

I've provided a link for you. It lists symptoms, so please check this out. The test for Cushings involves doing bloodwork and is not painful for the dog. I had a dog who was tested twice.<br>  <br>  Taken from the link listed below:<br>  "The most common symptoms include:<br>        ? increased/excessive water consumption (polydipsia)<br>        ? increased/excessive urination (polyuria)<br>        ? urinary accidents in previously housetrained dogs<br>        ? increased/excessive appetite (polyphagia)<br>        ? appearance of food stealing/guarding, begging, trash dumping, etc.<br>        ? sagging, bloated, pot-bellied appearance<br>        ? weight gain or its appearance, due to fat redistribution<br>        ? loss of muscle mass, giving the appearance of weight loss<br>        ? bony, skull-like appearance of head<br>        ? exercise intolerance, lethargy, general or hind-leg weakness<br>        ? new reluctance to jump on furniture or people<br>        ? excess panting, seeking cool surfaces to rest on<br>        ? symmetrically thinning hair or baldness (alopecia) on torso<br>        ? other coat changes like dullness, dryness<br>        ? slow regrowth of hair after clipping<br>        ? thin, wrinkled, fragile, and/or darkly pigmented skin<br>        ? easily damaged/bruised skin that heals slowly<br>        ? hard, calcified lumps in the skin (calcinosis cutis)<br>        ? susceptibility to infections (especially skin and urinary)<br>        ? diabetes, pancreatitis, seizures "<br>  <br>  Cushings cannot be cured, but the condition can be treated and managed to give the dog a longer, better quality of life.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You havent given any details so it's not really possible to help you.  Best advice is to take your dog to obedience classes where he can be socialized with other dogs in a controlled environment and you can have the benefit of a qualified instructor to teach you how to train your dog.  If he's very aggressive, you need to give the instructor a heads-up first.|`|OFpl236faa	Is there anyone that you can do private lessons with? It might be worth looking into. If you go back to the person who told you no, they might be able to refer you to someone who does private one on one lessons.<br>  <br>  I would start by getting him on his leash and then working obedience right by your house. The moment he starts to loose it, he goes in for a time out. Then he can come out and try again. Teach him a command to look at you. This will break his view on the other dog or other distraction. It's important to have a reliable sit and down. This way he isn't throwing himself at other dogs. Once he can be in front of the house and function, then start moving closer to the street. If he has a hard time, back up until he is successful and always reward for the correct behavior or what you are looking for. So always take treats with you. You can teach him to heal on both sides of your body. Then when you are walking down the street, you can put you in between the other dog and him so the other dog won't get close. Ask for the sit and look at you. <br>  <br>  This is going to take a while to fix. You have to have a ton of patience and be as consistent as you can. You can also look at the book "Control Unleashed".

Seek out a professional trainer to evaluate your dog.  If the aggression isn't too severe you might attend obedience classes, but get opinion first.  If the dog is not safe and you can't control, it would be dangerous to expose others to its aggression before you have trained privately.|`|BQUZsLxaaa	my dog is the same shes not aggresssive towards other dogs but she does'nt seem to know how to act with other dogs i let her sniff round them a bit and most times they get on fine  try taking it to the park where plenty of other dog  owners are about they can sometimes give you good tips as well. good luck|`|nERp0vMYaa	well my friends dog does the same thing it is most likely to be domination.

If she is not eating you can try making her chicken and rice. Just plain rice and boil the chicken and NO SEASONING....they will sometimes eat that. And if you have a heating pad you can lay that somewhere on her bed, your bed the couch or the floor, put a towel over that and lay her on it, it will help to keep her warm. If she is not drinking on her own if you have a seringe or something similar you may need to forcibly give her water, just a little here and there to keep her hydrated. If she seems really dehydrated you can also give her a VERY little amount of pedialyte it will help to keep her hydrated and give her electrolytes. And if she is still not wanting to eat the chicken and rice then you may need to force feed her a little bit. Just put some on you finger and give it to her that way.

You have to go outside with the puppy, use your commands, and praise her when she does good.  Here are some tips. use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|41b845f2132fdf84e98905aed951f679aa	Try taking the dog outside when you know she's ready to do her "business".  Like after a nap or a little while after eating.

You will have to keep doing it and if he pees on the floor or poops take him outside to go to the bathroom then put him in his cage.|`|qWPLDgPiaa	<a href="http://www.petvideo.com/index.cgi?channel=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.petvideo.com/index.cgi?channe...</a>|`|MYEEK4dcaa	One way you can help your dog to learn bladder and bowel control is to put her on a very rigid schedule.<br>  <br>  When you get up in the morning, take a treat (like a tiny bit of cheese) in your hand and take her on a leash for a walk around your backyard. Lead her to the place where you want her to do her business, and just wait while she sniffs around trying to find exactly the right spot.  As soon as she squats, say, calmly, "go potty" or "hurry up" or "get busy" or whatever phrase you want to use as a command word.  As soon as she's done, say "Good hurry up" or "good potty" or "good busy" or "good" whatever phrase you chose to use, and give her the treat.  Be sure to praise her effusively, but don't let her jump up on you while you're doing that.  Then stay out in the yard with her for a few minutes so that she doesn't get the idea that outside time stops as soon as she empties her bowels or bladder.  When you get back inside, you can remove both the leash and the collar.<br>  <br>  Then feed her.  Whatever she hasn't eaten after about 15 minutes should be picked up and put away - she can't learn to just dawdle over her meals.  After she's eaten, wait 15 - 30 minutes and then take her (and another treat) outside again.  Remember it's important that you go with her so that you can verify that she has indeed gone potty.  Again, just as she squats, give her the command word, and just as she finishes, give her the praise and the treat.  Again, stay out with her for a few minutes longer so she doesn't think outside time stops when she does what you've asked her to do.<br>  <br>  After breakfast, if you have to go to work, put her in her crate with a toy to play with, and close the door.  If you don't have a crate for her, put her in a room with a tiled floor and close the door.  If you put her in a room instead of in a crate, be sure to include a bowl of water. (I don't know about all crates, but ours came with a water bowl attached.  We got it from a friend, though, so I don't know if crates come with them or you have to buy it separately.  I don't see them in the pictures in the catalogs, though.)  Don't forget her toy.  And, if you like, put a wee-wee pad in the room.  It's scented so that she should be drawn to it when she has to go.<br>  <br>  If you don't have to go to work, she will play for an hour or so, then probably nap for awhile.  When she gets up, follow the same routine.  Take her (with a treat in hand) on leash to the area in which you want her to go, wait til she squats, give the command word, wait til she finishes, give her the praise and the treat, then hang around outside for another few minutes.<br>  <br>  Dogs should be taken outside 15-20 minutes after every meal, and as soon as possible after they wake up from sleep, whether at night or during the day in a nap.  Between times, don't expect her to hold her urine for more than 30 minutes for each month of her life until she's about 8 months old; at 3 months, that means no more than 1 1/2 hours, at 12 months, that means no more than 4 hours. If you find that she's going more often than that, decrease the time you wait between outings.<br>  <br>  Be sure to clean up any spots she has wet or soiled in the house with a good enzymatic cleaner.  There is one called Urine Gone that comes with a blue light so you can see the stains even when they aren't visible to the naked eye (I don't have any affiliation with the company that makes it).  Some folks say you can use vinegar and baking soda.  Put the vinegar on the spot, then sprinkle the baking soda on top.  Wait for it to dry and then vacuum it up.  I haven't tried this myself, so I don't know whether it will work or not.<br>  <br>  Never, ever scold her for making a mess in the house, especially if you don't catch her at it.  If you DO catch her, pick her up, tuck her tail between her legs, and take her outside to the designated area.  Since she won't be on leash this time, take her back inside when she's done.<br>  <br>  If you don't catch her at it, and you scold her, she is likely to think that it is the very act of pottying that you disapprove of.  Because she goes in so many different places in the house, she won't know that you object to the location instead of the act, and she's likely to start hiding or going into another room.<br>  <br>  Be sure her meals, playtimes, and exercise happen at the same time each day.  <br>  <br>  Don't expect this regimen to work overnight, but within a few weeks, she should have a pretty good grasp of it.  Then and only then - after she has stopped going in the house - you can teach her how to let you know when she has to go.  Some people have their dogs scratch at the back door, others have them ring bells hanging from the wall beside the door, and still others have their dogs just come and sit beside them and wait.  You'll have to choose the method that works best for you and for your dog.<br>  <br>  Hope this works for you!  good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas
cnZlMojUaa	If she is strong enough for the surgery, they will do a biopsy of her liver at the same time. The spleen, or suspicious parts of the spleen will also be biopsied.<br>  <br>  The problem with the spleen is that it functions as a filter and like a giant lymph node. The body can live without this organ. Removal can cause the dog to "throw" cardiac enzymes which mess with the heart. If your dog has surgery, you will want to make sure her heart is monitored. As for the blood count, if the spleen is engorged with blood, then the blood isn't where it belongs in the body. She can get a blood transfusion.<br>  <br>  When we went through this, we were told that spleen issues can and often are cancer related. Lymphoma is often the cause, but is one of the more treatable cancers. I'm not sure what the auto immune means, but I do know the spleen works with the immune system. My dog did not have cancer. She recovered from the surgery after facing the heart issue mentioned above. She did face many odd and difficult to clear infections during her final year of life. I feel this is partially due to not having her spleen. She passed from kidney failure brought on by a medication to treat bladder cancer (runs in my breed). She did not pass from her spleen. It is a serious surgery and I wish you and your spaniel all the best.

AA10863966	Young dogs can be started easily at 6 months. As long as you are careful to work slowly and consistently.  I work with Alaskans, so you may also want to talk to experienced Siberian mushers as well.<br>  <br>  In my experience young dogs are eager to please and enjoy the interaction with you training time brings. You need to make sure training is fun and up beat. Before you begin with the dog you need to decide ahead of time exactly what commands you will use and what they mean.<br>  (a dictionary of mushing terms with a link to commonly used voice commands:<br>  <a href="http://www.ultimateiditarod.com/Dictionary.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimateiditarod.com/Dictiona...</a><br>  <br>  Once you have defined what you want to teach your dog then remember consistency is key. Your dog needs to always understand what you are asking of them and need to be rewarded when they are giving you the right response to your commands.<br>  <br>  The first step is harness breaking. Get assistance to make sure the harness if fitted correctly.<br>  here is a part of an earlier answer I gave------------<br>  -------------And now that your dog will be pulling you need a real harness designed for working sled dogs. Other pet harnesses will not have the correct padding for your dog to pull in.

The weight pull harnesses above are IMO overkill, they are designed for dogs pulling huge weights over short distances. The types of harnesses used by dog sled racers are probably more appropriate.

I would research proper techniques on how to train a husky to pull a sled.  I have had huskies but never trained them to mush.

Some people like to splint the feet if they are weak but it doesn't really make much difference and will sometimes make getting right take longer.

If water is cold they will stop eating! <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  <br>  He should be eating  fish they NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle. <br>  ** When I got these two girls 37 yrs ago all we had to feed them back them were brown worms, tadpoles I caught  and goldfish. And my girls are still going strong and  just turned 37 yrs old this month.<br>  <br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes  from lack of Vitamin A.  Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Forget the apples. Feed earthworms, fishes, soft-bodied insects, strips of liver dusted in bone meal, or other non-processed meat. Once the turtle is sexually mature, you can start adding dark green leafy vegetables to the diet.|`|HLwvfOTxaa	Pellets are the best for their staple, daily diet.

f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Wow.. Are you sure it's your dog causing the problems ? It sounds to me like you guys have a few dogs, yet no one is in charge. You should see the vet, and a behaviorist, and find out what is going on in the home that is causing the trouble. Make sure they are all spayed /neutered and go from there..|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I agree with the first poster: it sounds like you have a lot of dogs and no leader. You really need to get control of the dogs. To start with, let them out one at a time in the house and work on basic obedience. Practice NILiF (Nothing In Life is Free) with them. If they are being fed, make them sit, if you want to pet them, make them sit. It also sounds like you have a dominant dog in Hubble. Taking other dogs' toys is a sign of disrespect and dominance: she sees them as all HER toys. You will probably have to work hardest to control her. Good luck! I hope the consultation with the behaviorist goes well.
zqVDJxUIaa	Here are some fish that would go well with your fish and water parameters:<br>  <br>  Serpae Tetra (provide lots of plants, and buy at least 6 or more to prevent fin nipping) <br>  Hyphessobrycon eques<br>  Black Phantom Tetra (very attractive, breeds easily)<br>  Megalamphodus megalopterus<br>  Red Platy (colorful livebearer) <br>  Xiphophorus maculatus<br>  Corydoras Catfish (bottom scavenger)<br>  (Corydoradinae subfamily)<br>  Neon Tetras (very attractive, but hard to breed)<br>  Paracheirodon innesi<br>  Plecostomus (eats algae)<br>  Paracheirodon innesi<br>  <br>  As for the 24 inch thing, that's ridiculous. So is the one inch rule.<br>  The best rule of thumb is : 1' of tropical fish per 2 gallons., or<br>                                           1" of goldfish per 3 or more gallons.<br>  Although more can be kept if you have a good filter, to prevent stress, you should keep the above amount.<br>  <br>  Calculating surface area won't work, obviously, so your rule doesn't work. Think about it: An aquarium with two pieces of glass 17" by 17" with a space between them 1". That would be approximately 288 square inches! But no fish would survive in that aquarium.... because no fish could live in a 1" wide tank! (they wouldn't be able to TURN AROUND!)<br>  Calculating gallons is always better.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ImC4V2hcaa	i always loved tiger barbs but never have room in my tank. if u get them they should be in a school of 6 <br>   <br>  TIGER BARB (Puntius tetrazona)|`|KqZhJpZ0aa	Only thing I could possibly come up with is an angel fish. <br>  <br>  not many african cichlids will live in your PH, let alone find a Non-Agressive one.<br>  <br>  just make sure your not getting the angels that get 16-20 inches tall....<br>  <br>  Usually the common ones are great, and theres many colors.<br>  <br>  Pick up about 6 of them at quarter size or bigger if you wish.<br>  <br>  Angels will die for no reason and I can bet you, that some will die.<br>  <br>  also this way thy can pair off when older, and if you wish you could breed them an make some money.<br>  <br>  I'd also avoid pleco's because they have habits of eating or destroying plants, But there are some that would work.<br>  <br>  On a side note, search around for some killifish that can live in that PH, there are some and you will love killies.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Cichlids won't go in your tank. Cichlids are always aggressive in one way or another and will eat every fish you currently have in your tank.<br>  <br>  Goldfish are cold-water, so they can't go in. It's good you don't want them.<br>  <br>  The smaller plecos are good, but "common" plecos includes several hundred species that get over a foot long.<br>  <br>  You could always get more shrimp. Cherry shrimp, more viper, or ghost shrimp. You could safely put 10-20 in the tank. They may breed however.<br>  <br>  Gourmis may be able to go in your tank. I've never had them, so I cannot say for sure, but they aren't considered aggressive. They are colorful and there are several veriaties.<br>  <br>  Almost any tetra would also work, just remember that 99% of tetras like to be in schools.<br>  <br>  Other then this, I really cannot advise as it is personal choice

I give him the sign and he barks as long as we need him to bark.  He is big, fluffy, and definitely is one of the bigger golden retrievers in body, head, paws.  So, he could be a bit intimidating to some, but as soon as they see his eyes and his tail wag.....the intimidation is all over and gone.  But, he will do what we ask him to do.   <br>  <br>  If a small child comes to the home, we need to make sure Pilot doesn't get too excited cause the huge tail with the foot long hair can wack a wee one pretty good.  <br>  <br>  Those who come to visit us must expect that they will be slobered on so we keep paper towels and lint rollers everywhere!!  And, I mean everywhere....kitchen, family room, livingroom, bathrooms, bedrooms, etc.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	If your dogs are trained to not charge the door and not jump up on guests; if they are socialized so that they get along well with other dogs and with people, and if your guests aren't allergic to dogs, then yes, to know you is to know your animals (at least for people coming to your home). <br>  <br>  But if your dogs crowd the guests or jump up on them or are aggressive or fearful of other dogs and of people, or if your guests are allergic to dogs, then no, your guests should not have to tolerate that kind of behavior.  <br>  <br>  I do not suggest that you  hide your dogs.  Instead, if there is a reason to keep your dogs away from your guests, put them in the hall and put a baby gate across the hallway entrance to keep the dogs in (assuming they will respect the barrier and not try to jump over it or go through it).  <br>  <br>  If you think they're going to be there for more than a few minutes, give them chew toys to keep them busy - assuming they won't fight over the chewies.  <br>  <br>  And finally, no, I would not be scared off by someone with 500 lbs of dogs and two parrots who can talk.  But I would be hesitant to visit such a person, because there would be dog hair all over everything no matter how clean she tried to keep her house, and if I didn't want dog hair all over my clothes, I wouldn't visit.  I would explain why, though.  <br>  <br>  At the same time, I would not be scared off by someone who had no dogs or who had only a 6 pound chihuahua.  Dogs aren't frightening creatures unless the owners are irresponsible and allow the dogs to rule the household. <br>  <br>  I have two large dogs (golden retriever size, although only one of them is a golden - the other is a mongrel) who have been trained to stay away from guests in my home.  They are not to even approach the guest unless and until they are invited to do so.  Even then they are not allowed to crowd the guest or to jump on  him.  It all comes down to who is in charge of making and enforcing the rules in your house.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|TWfDAYK4aa	My dogs are usually crated until the person is inside my home for a little while.  And, the dogs "adjust" to them.  Then I let them out, one at a time.  My one girl will sniff, and walk away, grab a toy.   The other one thinks she needs to be on their lap, so it also depends on the person.  <br>  If it was a "bad" date, I don't think it was wrong to release the dogs and scare him away.  I would do it too.  And, when people see a Rottweiler coming at them full bore, they tend to back off.    Unfortunately, there are some guys who really like the big dogs, and think themselves "big" if they have one, or can say my girlfriend has one.  No ofense meant to the good guys out there.    Hopefully, the critters did their job for you and he doesn't return.

OrvTG44laa	It all depends on what you're looking for.  I'll make a list for you.<br>  Pets that are affectionate, loving, loyal and playful- cats, dogs, ferrets, guinea pigs and chinchillas.<br>  Pets that are easy to care for- mice, rats, hamsters and gerbils.|`|cda4ff7230d2243a9aa628f9410dcf2eaa	Cats and dogs take a lot of time and commitment for training and everything else, especially if you get a kitten or puppy. From experience, puppies can be almost as much work as a human baby. They are adorable and your hard work will pay off but don't get one unless you are willing to make approximately a 10 year commitment, for a dog or cat.<br>  Please check into shelters at www.petfinder.com to find your future pet!|`|QhSzQNaeaa	I personally think that Guinea pigs make great pets because they don't eat a lot, they don't bite, unless of course you put your fingers right by their mouths. They love carrots and you can even litter train them if you want. They don't normally mind if you hold them or not, but enjoy it while you hold them. They live to be like 5-7. They make really good pets if you ask me.

The shedding!  lol  Your reaction to the shedding really has me cracking up. How did you not realize that a furry white cat with fluffy hair would be shedding before you got her.  You shouldn't ever get another furry pet, EVER!  You should find your cat a new home because I can tell that you don't care for the cat too much, because I have 2 cats, 3 birds and a bunny of my own and nothing they do could ever make me consider getting rid of them.  My orange tabby sheds like crazy and the hair is short and sphere like and really gets into fabric tightly, lint rollers cannot get rid of it and I have to individually pick some of the hair out of my clothes even after washing my clothes. He also has asthma and is about to cost me $600 at a vet if he has another attack because that will mean xrays and inhalers. My other cat is very sweet but has a chewing habit.  She chewed up a flip flop last night as if shes a dog.  I just bought them too and I was mad. My bunny is litterbox trained but has a habit of peeing on the couch when I am on the couch. I love him but that drives me nuts. But I love my little buns.  And my 3 cockatiels? They start peeping and squawking around 7 AM when the sun comes up.  They wake me up every morning at the same time.  But I love them also.<br>  <br>  So see, your shedding problem is nothing!  You could have gotten the problem under control by brushing the cat with 'The Furminator" deshedding tool every week or so.  You could also vaccumn daily like most cat owners have to do in order to keep down on the hair.<br>  <br>  That being said, you don't care enough to try that.  And I don't want you to either.  Find your cat a nice home or take her to a NO KILL shelter where she can find a family where she belong and a family that will love her unconditionally.  <br>  <br>  And as far as the baby goes, umm I was raised along side 3 cats.  Never had a problem.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	You didn't know cats have hair before you got one?  Shedding can be controlled by daily grooming, good diet, and proper health care.  You made a possibly 20 year commitment to that cat when you got her.  Pets aren't disposable.  Would you get rid of your daughter if her hair started falling out or would you try to fix the problem?<br>  <br>  If you do decide to get rid of her *bless her heart*, please read this article on safely rehoming pets.

But why didn't you think about it when you got the cat? I think it's selfish, a pet is a lifetime commitment, until it dies.|`|DgkpK8UVaa	Our cats shed a lot but I would never get rid of them over it. Before getting rid of the cat try taking her to the groomer and getting her shaved. We did that with out cat and she didn't shed half as much.|`|LMB4pUMWaa	I dont think the shedding lasts all year, i think it stops at some point then starts again|`|77KWbtdaaa	Well you should of researched a cat breed that would fit your family . If you don't like fur everywhere then you should of gotten a short-haired cat , i assume that you would of known that a cat with long fur will shed . In your situation it would be cruel to get rid of a family pet , a family member just because you think they shed too much . Think of your daughter she would be heartbroken. You got a cat , it's your responsibility  to provide a home , Pretty kitty made a good point too .  One thing i don't get is why do people get cats , and then complain that they scractch everything and shed . Plus it's bad luck to kick a cat out .|`|IRaIxWJKaa	It's horrible to get rid of a cat for no other reason than the cat sheds.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a lint brush for the clothing, and hang clothes up in the closet so she can't lay on them.<br>  <br>  Get a large car wash sponge and use it damp to wipe the fur off the furniture and bedspread.  <br>  <br>  And BRUSH the cat daily to help get the loose fur off. Cats go through two big sheds each year---a summer one which is ultra heavy, and a winter one which isn't as bad. They loose fur the rest of the year too but not in huge quantities like these two times.  Brushing helps keep things under control. Use a slicker brush on her, that gets the undercoat out. I hear good things about the furminator also.  <br>  <br>  Owning a cat means you deal with fur. People who own dogs have the same problems.  You compromise and work with it. This is part of pet ownership.  People who discard pets because they shed don't get looked at very nicely at the shelters.  Getting a pet is for the life of the animal, not for a short term till the convenience gets too bad.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Cats are a lot more complicated than goldfish! I think it's horrible that you want to "get rid of" the poor cat just because she sheds! Maybe you should think about what you are teaching your daughter.<br>  <br>  Cats need to be groomed, and they usually love it. The more fur you get off them with a brush, the less you will see on your furniture and clothes. But since a little cat fur bothers you THAT much, then I'm with Spike and Pretty Kitty. You should find a more loving home for your cat. She deserves to be taked care of!|`|pDd5jRxEaa	Yes,  it is not only rude it is  a terribly cruel  thing to do to the kitty and your daughter who am sure loves the kitty.<br>  <br>  When aperson gets a pet it is understood that problems will arise and one has to deal with the problems.<br>  <br>  WE have four cats....all do the ususal amount of shedding and we deal with it by brushing the cats every day with a good cat brush.<br>  <br>  Fluffy white cats DO shed a lot but that is part and parcel of the nature of the cat... you need to brush her daily to remove the excess shedding.  There is also a medication [found at any pet store] to prevent the shedding.<br>  <br>  You should have thought of the problems a cat might bring before you got one.|`|4aAhEK9daa	DEFINITELY find a new home for this cat.  It deserves to be with a caring, responsible pet owner that will take the time to groom her so that she doesn't shed everywhere.  Surrender the cat to a no-kill shelter so an appropriate, loving home can be found for her.<br>  <br>  Shedding is a natural process of hair growth and if you don't bother to comb a longhaired cat at least every other day (or brush a shorthaired cat at least once a week) the hair will naturally shed onto your clothes and furniture.  Do you really expect it to just disappear?  Not only will it (oh the horror!) get on you and your things but uncombed fur will also cause the cat's coat to mat.  Mats can be very painful for cats as they twist the fur and pull on the skin.<br>  <br>  Why did you get this kitten if you can't be bothered to care for her properly and are so fickle that you'd dump her simply because she's shedding fur?  GOOD LUCK being a mother - babies are FAR more messy than cats could even ATTEMPT to be!  Here's hoping we don't see a question like this in a few months asking if its "rude" to get rid of your child!|`|KvUJZa1Paa	OMG You would get rid of a poor defenseless kitty because it sheds. You would doom a cat to death because of shedding, What kind of mean heartless person are you.  Brush and comb this kitty more often. and get a furminator it will help rid some of the hair.<br>  <br>  OH when baby sh its in diaper are you going to get rid of it cuz you cant handle it<br>  You shouldn't have animals or kids either one.

They are intelligent and assertive, and training can be difficult.|`|BSlVGJ62aa	How about a golden retriever. Or huskies. Wheaten Terriers are great dogs that are very lovable. And keep your mind open to little dogs because there clean up is not as messy. Hope I  helped. Oh and whatever you do never get a Pitt bull. There nasty dogs.

rdcxVqfxaa	I think it would be okay to move it as long as its around an active area. In other words, don't move it to a corner of the house no one ever goes near. Also, do not move it into the kitchen as this is a pretty dangerous area for a bird. Cooking with teflon pans can kill birds, it could wander under a refrigerator or stove, fly into a pan of boiling water, etc. I keep my budgie in my bedroom, but often move him into the living room to be with the rest of the family. If your budgie is tame and gets time out of the cage around the house, this will most likely be an easier process. Try moving your budgie and if it shows any unusual or strange behavior, it may be a good idea to move it back. If it stops eating, drinking or going to the bathroom normally, it would be a good idea to move it back. The move may startle your budgie a little, but it should adapt just fine. I think my budgie likes being moved because when I lift his cage, he spreads his wings and looks like he's soaring, lol. Sometimes he even lifts one of his feet up like he's doing some weird acrobats. :) I hope everything works out, and good luck!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	It's okay to move him to another room, but choose one that is located where he can socialize with you and other family members.  Once you pick out a spot, try to stick with it.  Constantly moving him around from room to room will be stressful for your budgie.   Budgies like familiarity and routine.|`|rhTCejrtaa	Depends on if you let it fly around the house or not.<br>  If you let it fly where it wants to and its has been in that room a lot then yes its ok.<br>  But if you don't let it fly about then you should let it explore and get familiar with the room first.|`|F5vsY4rOaa	if he is comfy with you and you need to move cage go ahead but NOT with him inside follow the cage with him on your hand and talk to him about what is happening then as soon as the cage is set pop him in still talking budgies are smart little birds and take calm quiet moves well

k9gC23apaa	Yes, you can trap them in a trap. You may be able to rent one from the shelter or an exterminator.  It is called da cat trap.  Its a long metal cage, you usually place some canned food in there, and BANG ! The trap goes off, cat is in place.  You pick up trap and take cat the shelter or just relocate it.  You could even take them in to a local hospital, have them fixed, and release them.  If you do that though, I recommend for the vet to tip its ear off, that way you know if it been fixed or not.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Is there any local group that does TNR?  Getting the females fixed will allow the other strays to go back to their territories and leave your area alone. Right now it's the unspayed female cats that are the main draw.<br>  <br>  Our shelter does TNR on strays free of charge. They get ear tipped, microchipped, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, de-flead and de-wormed.  I get them back and release them. No more kittens, and the strays keep other strays out of their territory here.  I feed and water them to keep them healthy (a reliable food source always keeps animals healthy).  <br>  <br>  If you can catch the neighbor's cats and get them fixed without his permission (since he's not taking care of them), then that would solve your problem.<br>  <br>  Fleas come in via squirrels anyway, so don't blame the cats on that. Ticks are in the environment regardless.  Internal parasites are gotten from the prey animals--they don't originate with the cats themselves, so you're again looking at environmental issues that the cats are not instigating.  Don't blame those on them, your local wildlife has a hand in all this, which includes possums, raccoons, squirrels and skunks.<br>  <br>  The screaming, meowing and spraying stop when there's no females around to mate with.  Everyone goes back to their original territory.  Your focal point is the female cats--get them fixed.  See if there's a feline rescue in your area, they can maybe piggy back the females with the next batch that goes in for spaying.|`|0w3Uyprpaa	I agree with travisan answer - trap them and take them to a no-kill shelter if possible.  Also look into a spay/neuter discount program in your area to recommend to the neighbors.  I'm sure that they would not appreciate it if you let your dogs run around pooping in their yards and chasing and possibly killing their cats.  It's unreasonable for the neighbors not to understand this and with the huge number of unwanted dogs and cats that are destroyed in this country any animal owner should have their animals spayed and neutered.  It's the responsible thing to do.
bnJLKQWMaa	Get him used to you playing with his feet.  Run your hands down his legs and say 'pretty feet', when he lets you do that, make a big fuss of him, praise him and give him a great treat!<br>  <br>  I have had to do this for one of my dogs and the difference is night and day.  I also taught her to 'shake' her front paws, easy to do with good treats, that will get him used to having his feet touched more and it will get better!<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful.  Best wishes|`|6sXG3Plkaa	Your dog could be feeding from you.  I am the worse at clipping nails.  My dog (which is a medium breed) goes crazy on me, but my hubby has no problem.  I have determined he is reading my insecurities which makes him anxious when I do it.  I bought a pedicure to use (basically a dremmel you can actually buy a cover for a dremmel).  Getting him use to it (the noise) took a few times, but it has made our nail trimming time much easier.  I feel more secure using it (not worried about clipping to much or all the other fears that crossed my mind while clipping).  <br>  <br>  If all else fails take him to a groomer.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I agree with the above poster, just start playing with his feet making a game of it. I use a dremmel in my shop and at hope it gives a much smoother ege with less chance of harm. You  just have to let them get used to the sound.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Spend more time with his paws during cuddle time. Let him know that this is a positive experience. I play & snuggle with my pups each day on my bed. They love the attention and petting. I constantly play with their paws too. They will become more comfortable with this common touch. They won't be so prone to being afraid of the nail clippers over time.
ld2vmypNaa	They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle. ** When I got these two girls 37 yrs ago all we had to feed them back them were brown worms, tadpoles I caught  and goldfish. And my girls are still going strong and  just turned 37 yrs old this month.<br>  <br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes  from lack of Vitamin A.  Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  *** Google vitamin A fruits for yor turtles.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries,banannas and squash , apples cut up.. <br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  ‘Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles.<br>  <br>  Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle. <br>  ***You need a heater...set at 80 / 82 degrees.

What happens may seem 'odd' to you, because most people and animals want to close their eyes and lie very still, and you expect everything to 'do the same' ... but there is a good reason for sharks, whales, dolphins, and fish to do this ... they live in a 'ball' world that has the possibility of predators coming from any direction at any time, while humans and land based creatures live in a 'half sphere' world, where the 'lying still' makes more sense because they don't want to attract the attention of predators.

Some sharks can lie on the bottom while actively pumping water over their gills, but their eyes remain open and actively follow divers. When a shark is resting, it does not use its nares, but rather its spiracles. If a shark tried to use its nares while resting on the ocean floor, it would be sucking up sand rather than water. Many scientists believe this is one of the reasons sharks have spiracles. The spiny dogfish's spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so it is possible for a spiny dogfish to continue to swim while sleeping.<br>  <br>  It is also possible that sharks sleep in a manner similar to dolphins, one cerebral hemisphere at a time, thus maintaining some consciousness and cerebral activity at all times.|`|8RApfe9waa	no they dont sleep because if they stop swimming they die.
Q8Sv4V48aa	You sound like you need to learn a lot more before you get a horse. They should be fed everyday and should have constant access to water and hay(if grass is not available, ex. during winter.) Do you even know how to ride?|`|PUspAGxFaa	you need to make sure you know how to ride, tack up, lead, etc., before getting a horse. horses should be exercised or at least turned out every day. a horse left in a stall all day will be more likely to develop leg or hoof problems such as founder. i do not suggest feeding alfalfa hay because depending on what the horse is used for, it gives them a lot of extra energy. a horse should be fed twice a day, morning and night. talk to an equine nutritionist or the horse's previous owner to find out what they need to eat. i would suggest feeding bermuda grass hay or timothy hay. bermuda grass is best because it is good for their feet and timothy is good if you have a sport horse but with your lack of knowledge it sounds like you should definitely learn more before buying a horse because no matter how much their price is, horses cost thousands of dollars a year. Good Luck!|`|5zpp408Zaa	You're not ready to own a horse yet. Sorry. But you need to know everything about them before you get one. It's also a lot of work.

To teach you everything and make sure you know how to do everything before you do it by yourself.|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	Before I learnt to ride, my Mum bought me a horse; it was the best thing she ever did. I learn't SO much; because that horse was mine. But she'd rode all her life; and she had her own. It depends on how much work your horse is doing, how much weight is on them, what pasture they're being turned out on etc. I give my 16.3 TB X ID, 17yro 1 bucket a day of chaff and pasture mix or old and faithfull with chaff. Though recently he's put on a LOT of weight, so I feel him every other day, and he's not rode that often.|`|x787hJbBaa	Horses are not pets. They are animals that need to be taken care of and loved. You sound like you don't know enough to own a horse. I have been around horses since I was born (13 years) and I barely know enough to have my own horse. I would learn some more (and by some i mean a LOT!!) so you are definitely prepared. I love horses, I read about them, I dream about them, I love to ride, but I am still barely ready for my own horse. You are definitely not ready. I am sorry but it is true. Take another few YEARS worth of lessons and then start to consider buying a horse. You sound like the kind of person who wants one just because they can have one, no offense. I would die for a horse, and here you are saying "I don't know enough... Should I buy a horse anyway?"|`|5qgSr4wMaa	A horse is a long commintment. i think you should research, find prices and other things before you consider buying a horse of your own.|`|AqqFO2QMaa	you should get an experienced trainer to help you. horses are A LOT of work and very expensive. feeding them is just one part of taking care of them.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	it totally depends on the horse.|`|qNuynJNLaa	there is alot mroe things you need to think about, not just what to feed them and when to feed them! Every horse is different so if you buy a horse it's going to be used to it's own feeding routine & feed. So your going to have to find this out from the owner, also, do you know how to ride? Do you know how to groom? Do you know how to much out? theres is alot of HARD work to owning a horse than just feeding and riding it!<br>  <br>  So can you be prepared for the early mornings to get up and put the horse out in the field & feed your horse, can you be bothered giving up ALOT of your free time to look after and ride the horse? It will mean you wont have as much free time as you used to, you wont have as much time to spend with friends and family as you'll need to look after the horse, if your prepared for this then buy a horse, but if your not then dont! <br>  <br>  Of course make sure you know what your doing and all the information you need to know about horses! Get the information from anyone you know who has horse, ask your riding instructor to give you some tips about on looking after a horse, ask if you can look after one of your riding schools horses for a week or so to see if you can manage the work, because it is hard when your not used to it! I myself found that out when I was 9 & got my first horses!|`|j5SEfhtWaa	anyone can get a horse if they know the basics. but remember you need to have everything before you get the horse. you should read a couple of books before you get a horse to freshin your mind and to help you learn more stuff you will need to know. here are some books that would be good and they are cheap. you could also get them at a local book store or library.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=first+horse+books&cid=12998549140518851927&sa=title#ps-sellers" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/products/catalog?h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=horse+care+books&tag=googhydr-20&index=stripbooks&hvadid=1144449881&ref=pd_sl_8w0p0bzhy6_b" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keyword...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  you can look through the different books on those websites they should help.|`|G79hFe5Kaa	No, you're not ready. Go to a stable and do a live-in for a week and see how much work is involved. It's also really expensive to own a horse and very time consuming. Wait until you learn more.|`|HQSwNlG7aa	You are not ready! there's allot more to taking care of a  horse then feeding it, you have to clean out his stall, brush it, exercise it.<br>  <br>  don't get one! you'll end up selling it anyway|`|zdcK4FRXaa	get a yearling and work up or a beginner horse. feed them once or twice, I leave mine to pasture feed and they get grain only at shows.|`|eOe0uGVzaa	your not ready. if you need to be asking on Yahoo Answers when and what to feed a horse, then no, YOUR NOT READY<br>  <br>  sorry|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	ohh...<br>  please dont get a horse right now.<br>  You dont know enough, i can tell just from this.<br>  Horses need:<br>  3 X daily care (minimum)<br>  water<br>  food<br>  exersize at least 4 times weekly.<br>  they require lots of money to properly be taken care of!<br>  companionship...<br>  the list goes on!|`|paaozogGaa	alfalfa every day??NOO!lol! I give my horse a bite of that stuff and she acts like a wild mustang! lol!<br>  <br>  I honestly don't think you should! Horses are $$$ and you need yo know a lot about them before you get one|`|qiUYTCnzaa	you shouldn't be asking this quesiton on yahoo answers, you'll know for yourself when the time is right. I got my horse when I was 10 after riding for about seven years. You should ride seriously and be around horses alot for another year or two before getting one. take lessons, offer to help out at a stable and learn new things. you'll know when your ready|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	id work with some others horses with a trainer for a little bit longer then get a QH or somthing along that temperment. ask your instructor about the feeds. what to get and what NOT to get. try to take your trainer to see any horses u wanna buy for his or her opion. Have fun!|`|WxACyBbgaa	I`m not trying to discourage you but  you need to find a trainer or an experiened friend to help you a little more be fore getting a horse.Good luck|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	you're not ready to own one. dont get one. sorry, but its for the wellfare of the horse.<br>  <br>  ?
kwhOcN0taa	Try to get the Dog Whisperer to come to your house. <br>  He honestly might be able to help. <br>  I hope you can keep your dogs.|`|AMyZvgcVaa	Try to get the Dog Whisperer to come to your house! Seriously! Watch his shows on TV he can tell you what to do!
Ih0B30Pvaa	i have no idea what you are talking about....
Nzb5QmNXaa	First, don't breed unless you have experience with easier fish and unless you know that you will be able to care for 200+ new bettas. You risk losing both fish during breeding as they will attack each other in most cases. Please see this link: <a href="http://tetra-fish.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10040" rel="nofollow">http://tetra-fish.com/forums/showthread....</a><br>  <br>  Second, you can tell the age of a betta by size, coloration, and the length of the fins. Males will look like females when young. They will have short fins and will be smaller. As they get older, their fins will become longer and they will get bigger. Once they have reached the two year mark, they will slowly lose their coloration. It will become duller over a long period of time.<br>  <br>  For females, they will be smaller when younger, reach a maximum of 2.5 inches at adulthood. Other than that, I really can't say how to tell the age. I would think that she would be anywhere between 6 months and just over 1 year if you got her from a chain pet store like Petsmart.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	If you didn't get them from a breeder, who would be able to tell you teir age, its almost impossible to tell you. if you purchased them at a pet store or walmart type store, chances are they are any where from 6months to a year old.
iCdnucujaa	My cat was doing that and when we took him to the vet it turned out he had crystals in his urinary tract. Now he has to be on a special diet, but other than that his life is normal.|`|AA11151794	Cats who urinate in inappropriate places are usually sick or they have been taken away from their mother cat too soon (before 8 weeks). Do not leave clothing where the cat can get to it.<br>  Confine your cat to a location inside of your home where the only place it will have to pee is on the floor or in a litter pan.  Show the cat where the litter pan is.  Take her paws and go through the motion of scratching in the litter.  If the cat still does not start using the litter box, take it to the veterinarian for a complete physical examination to determine the cause of the problem.|`|FBSXz8L9aa	itz just showing you she cares basically my cat peed in my trainers had to buy more because it smells bad, just keep it away from you stuff, is it toilet trained?
8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Likely her trachea is inflamed or irritated due to intubaton.<br>  Sometimes the veterinarian or veterinary technician use lidocaine orally to help intubation go smoother.<br>  The lidocaine can causes excessive salivary secretions that the cat has not fully expelled yet.<br>  <br>  If the cat is still gurgling on monday I would take her in for a recheck.<br>  Also when you are administering the anti biotics make sure sh is swallowing the drugs instead of aspirating the drug.<br>  <br>  I understand your concern with metacam.<br>  Typically if pre anesthetic blood work was preformed and kidney function was checked your cat will do fine with the metacam.<br>  Due to the off label use and kidney implications our hospital dipenses bupernex post op.<br>  <br>  It may be wise to check an xray to rule out aspiration pneumonia.<br>  Follow up with your vet on monday.<br>  If anything changes or breathing becomes labored seek veterinary care immediately.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|F5vsY4rOaa	get her back to vet not to frighten you but a vet scraped my cat's throat with a tube day and a half later she was bleeding down her throat also you should take back the med that is canine only as it could be causing problems please take back to vet
HbnhpnL8aa	Female frogs look the same as Male frogs. The only difference is that males usually have black markings on their arms and will be somewhat smaller. However, do not depend on size alone to determine. Males are usually the vocal ones as well.|`|4NmQtnUyaa	they look like frogs|`|pBDEa6JEaa	They are normaly bigger.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Males usually have black markings on their arms and will be somewhat smaller. However, do not depend on size alone to determine. Males are usually the vocal ones as well. This depends on what kind of frog we're talking about too. Vocalization is a more general clue. If you should happen to find to frogs clamped together the one on top is the male. <br>  <br>  The black markings referred to are called nuptial pads, they are used to help the male grasp the female and do not occur in all species. The majority of frogs only develop them during the breeding season anyway. Most males are smaller than females but not always. Males are often more brightly coloured but this is not universal.|`|IIIKFDOoaa	The same as males
gU34xa9vaa	Do you think he has been in a fight ? He might have a painful wound on or under his tail.He does need to see a vet as soon as you can get him to one.Cats get poorly quickly but they also recover quickly too, with treatment, so don't think the worst as it may not be too serious.But whatever it is, the vet will help him.<br>  I hope he's OK.|`|5JLGyaWUaa	he is in pain..<br>  hes dieing..<br>  im sorry!<br>  go to the vet for<br>  some meds to just hault<br>  the pain..<br>  he time is coming...<br>  he lived a long life<br>  its almost over make the best of it|`|IRaIxWJKaa	He is in a lot of pain, At least call and make a vet appointment for him so you don't have to wait or take him in to the emergency center. His tail may be broken, he may have broken bones or cracked bones.  Either way, this cat needs help and soon.  I highly doubt it's 'just stones'.  Besides, urinary blockage can kill a cat, there's nothing 'only' about it.|`|AA11151794	Take the cat to the closest veterinary hospital or office as soon as possible.  Best wishes.|`|pDd5jRxEaa	TAKE HIM TO A VETERINARIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wx1WVpP5aa	Hi how is your cat now?
