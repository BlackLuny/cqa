20090220073125AAcHiOJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My color is a turquoise blue - blue bridesmaid dresses? (picture)?	My wedding date is July 12th, 2009, (4 ? months away!), & my girls have yet to buy their dresses. I have decided their dresses will be coming from David’s Bridal, & since my main color is a turquoise blue I have decided to mix up my bridesmaid’s dresses & colors! I told my girls in their first bridesmaid letter that I want them to visit David’s Bridal’s web site & browse through the dresses & choose whatever they like! I only ask they choose a knee length dress because of my July wedding in Alabama & that they also have 4 blue colors to choose from: Mermaid, Pool, Juniper & Oasis. Think this sounds weird? So does everyone else, but the bottom line is I don’t want to put my girls in the same dress! I want them to feel comfortable & beautiful & happy on my big day! I want them to choose a dress that fits their body & that they feel comfortable in, (& hopefully will want to wear more than once!). Do I still sound crazy? I want to set up an appointment with David’s Bridal to have all of my bridesmaids & I go in together to select & purchase their dresses. What do you think of my idea & how soon should I set this appointment up??
20090220073235AAwdKpD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband got a girlfriend who doesn't know he's married. Wife finds out, want to confront other woman, but how?	Wife confronted him, of course he denied.  But the emails and phone call records can't deny he's having an affair with a woman with kids,  who thinks he's divorced. Wife sends anonymous letter to GF to warn her but GF believed the guy's alibi, it wasn't true. So the affair goes on. Wife pity's the GF but don't know how to confront her without letting the husband know. Wife loves her man so much, wouldn't want to lose him.
20090220073029AADxdnE	Family & Relationships;Family	Does my father hate him?	well you see, there was this guy and he confessed to me that he likes me, and i told him that it's okay. then i informed my dad about this. the guy and I, became very close, but i didn't forget his feelings for me. We really got close that we even come to the point that we were even sending SMS to each other. Then when my dad found out that we were text mates, he always confiscate my sim card, well our communication didn't stop since we really need to talk about our school activities. whenever my dad found out that i'm sending him messages, he always give me a new sim card. And when there was a time that I was supposed to watch a stage play in my cousin's school and the guy was invited, my dad found out that he was going to watch so he didn't allow me to go, he even accused that my cousin was trying to set us up. So what do you think, father doesn't like him, does he?

20090220073514AA7o0tf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend help. Mid 20's serious relationship. I need help please!?	The situation is a little complex. We've been together for almost a year  now. The first few months were pure love. Crazy in love. Together all the time. Best time of my life. I thought the rest of my life would be this way and that made me so happy. I've never been so in love in my life. I've never been so happy.      She basically lived at my house everyday. A few months went by like this. Our only problem at the time was a pesky ex-boyfriend of hers that she left a month before we met. His feeling were still hurt and she wanted to put him down easy but he was clearly trying to get back in her pants. That has been an ongoing problem.      Anyways, a few  months into it, she told me she needed space. She had a room in a house with other roomates and she didn't want to pay rent and never be there, but didn't want to move in "officially" with me until we got married. She also missed all the things she did before we started dating : working out, tv shows, girltalk, alone time.      This was a little hard for me because I was still 100% mad in love and didn't want to change anything. I was the happiest I've ever been, why would I change anything? I do however want her to be happy as an individual and am supportive of all her "solo" ambitions. It was still a little hard but I understood and have been trying to give her space and time. We don't sleep together every night anymore. We see each other every other day. This is still a lot but not after living with someone. I liked the way things were. I could have been super happy living like that forever.      Since that change (her moving out) things have not been the same for me. We started fighting more. A couple of big arguments mainly about her ex-boyfriend. She has not been honest with me regarding him. She wants to secretly have a "best friends" kind of relationship with him. I believe her when she says she is not attracted to him. The sneakiness kills me though. I'll learn from a third person that they were hanging out. He calls on the phone (one time I picked up and told him to stay away from my girlfriend) It's clearly her fault though. I've always told her she needs to be very direct with him but she does things her way disregarding the damage it does to the trust of our relationship. She lies to me about it. That really hurts.      I feel like the spark is gone. I don't trust her anymore. Sex is not the same. I feel like she is not as attracted to me as before. She used to be crazy about me. I don't want a liar. The more the lies continue the uglier she gets to me. She's very beautiful on the outside. I'm still very much in love with her. But I'm afraid I'm in love with the girl I met and lived with. What that a facade? Am I discovering the real person behind it....? Is she just a girl who doesn't know what she is doing but is really trying and really well intentioned? ( If so, I'm willing to tackle our issues as a team.....) or am I going to get lied to as long as I am with her? I definitely don't want that.       What do I do? My gut wants to marry her. My brain is saying "stay the #@$! away from this girl, she's really made you feel very sad several times now and she will continue to let you down. she is dishonest. stay away. she is not who you thought she was."      I would have no problem leaving her but the few months we spent living together were sooo good. I need more of those kind of feelings in my life, not the ones I have now of instability and distrust. Is this the one? or do I need to go find those feelings elsewhere? I know I will not last long with the lies. Do I need two more months of distrust before I can say ok, this is enough. She has a strong hold on me. She uses it. Is there any hope in this relationship or should I move on?      What do I do?      Thanks so much.

But the thing is, we just can't live togethor. I realized this about 3 weeks ago, she is a totally different person when you share the same house with her. She treats it like a mess, and pretty much uses me to go out and buy things and suddenly she has gotten this attitude and is less willing to have togethor time with me and go out for dinners and such.      She has no place else to go because her father died about 2 years ago and her mother lives with her step father who she hates. If i kick her out i feel it will ruin her life, me and her are going in two TOTALLY different paths.         What should i do?

In all my relationships, I have major trust issues.  I am afraid that I am going to come home and my boyfriend will be gone.  I am a afraid that he will find someone better and leave me.  I worry that he is doing something wrong and hiding stuff from me.  These are all problems that I had in my very first relationship with a man as well as in relationships with my family.   I was hurt by my family alot and couldn't trust anyone.  I really feel that everyone is going to hurt me emotionally and physicaly.  I think that's because I have been physically and emotionally abused my whole life.  It is so bad that I have constant nightmares and can't sleep at night.  I feel like i'm going crazy. I told my boyfriend all of this and I also told him that I know he is a good guy and won't leave me but I don't understand why I have these thoughts.  He is willing to help me through difficult road which means the world to me.  He is also my best friend and has been for a couple years now.  I tell him everything, but I still am scared.

I promised my wife that I will never sleep with ne1 else and I have never slept with ne1 else. i have an extremely strong libido and my wife is still young, so can keep up with me. but i heard that old women don't want any sex, so I am worried that I might not be able to honour my promise when my wife is old coz she won't do it with me anymore when she is old. Do old women want any sex? If no, then how can I keep my promise? Please state your age and gender and how you know what you state. Please give any relevant reference/s.
20090220075736AA4nYf9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHATS GOING ON HERE? I don't get it?	So a few weekends ago I went drinking with my good friend. Im a guy, she's a girl. She has a boyfriend so it was just as friends (although they are not getting along lately). Anyway, as the night went on she got really smily and at times tried to tickle me and stuff. At the end of the night I was going to pay for it all, but she grabbed my card and paid for anything with it as if she were paying - even though it was still my card. I didnt mind, but when I asked for my card back after she paid, she handed it to me behind her back so no one could see her giving it back to me. Whats with that? Why did she feel the need to pretend she was paying? Make no sense to me.

Then he started calling me and saying he's gonna beat me like hell.      Point is, I've been getting into fights recently and I could beat him up, but I can't because his mom and my mom are friends..and that would ruin the whole family's relationship..

Now I am in a relationship and I work in a predominately female environment and honestly, I don't know if it is me or if it is because I am one of the only men in the organisation but I get at least 3 or 4 very attractive women, the type most men would do anything to get to know coming onto me strongly every week!

20090220080632AACDgUV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex & phone harassment?	My ex along with his current girlfriend are calling my man on his work cell from blocked numbers & mostly being quiet. I am pretty sure my sister's husband gave them my man's number as he is weed smoking buddies with my ex. We share 2 children that he has minimally been involved in their lives since 2005. When my man answered the call today he told them to "F off or call from an unblocked number" because no one spoke when he answered. So my ex called him back again cursing him out & telling him he needs to learn how to speak to a woman (my ex treated me like shite & was abusive our whole relationship). I have been to court for injunctions due to him threatening me & past abuse, my last one wasn't granted because he has turned his threats towards my man & mostly through 3rd party contact. But was warned by the judge to do things the legal & proper way. And that he needed to cease all contact with my man & only contact me if it regarded my kids. What should I do now?

20090220081243AA1TL3k	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Cheap Flowergirl Dresses and kids dress blues?	My hubby and I are having a Military/ Catholic Marriage blessing in June (but it's going to be like a normal wedding ceremony for our families and friends since we just did JP in October).        Anyone know where we can find cheap flowergirl dresses (like $20 or less if possible? Because we have 2 flowergirls (my sisters, age 2 and 4), and our wedding is on a budget (we have orders to move to CA 3 weeks after wedding, and my parents can't afford a lot for the girls).   Question #2: My little brother (age 7) is going to be the ringbearer. We are trying to find little dress blues for him to match the groom and groomsmen. Any idea where we can get this? (Preferably with as little pain to the wallet as possible?)      The colors for the wedding are white and red, so I'd prefer if the dresses were plain white or white with red accents (such as ribbon, bow, or flower)      Thanks in advance for any help you can give us! :)
20090203125518AAsz1Ob	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend hit my friend? (not hit on,  but hit like slapped)?	Ok I've been going out with this great guy for like 2 or 3 weeks. He's really sweet and funny. He is a little bit - i'm not sure how to put this?- hyper. Like he's a little bit of a show off. So he rough houses with his buddy's and stuff.      Best Friend: AR, Boy Friend: CB      Well AR today told me my boyfriend hit my other friend, and made her cry.  At first I was shocked as to why he would do something like that. The more I thought about it the worse I felt, even though its not really my fault.      My Boyfriend has a history of getting in trouble, and has punched a guy in the face before.       I don't want to choose between my friends and my boyfriend.    Also I don't want to apologize for my boy friend, because our relationship isn't that serious yet, and I don't want to seem smothering(apologizing for him seems like something married couples do, and it might make him mad).      My friends don't like CB that much anyways, and I want to do some thing, but I don't know what.      CB has never, ever, hurt me before at all, he's actually really protective of me.      We are still in school if that helps.

Ok so yesterday I asked a question about what would happen if I interrupted my brother's wedding, because I hated his girlfriend and I didn't want him to marry her. Well some replies said that it's none of my business who he marries, and blah blah blah. Ok how is that none of my business? He's my brother, so basically HE is my business. Also the girl he marries will be MY sister-in-law. I'm not gonna take her in as my sister-in-law, no way she's stupid and I hate her. I think my brother should listen to me, I'm more important to him than his stupid GF, I mean I'm family. There's a reason why the pastor says speak now or forever hold their peace, and when that moment comes I'm gonna stand up and reveal my feelings. If my brother loved me than he should listen to what I say and call the wedding off. Why does everybody think I'm stupid for wanting to interrupt his wedding?

20090203125745AAEP7Fh	Family & Relationships;Family	If you was put in this situations with you family what would you do?	I am in a rut and a hard place and need help figuring out what to do. My mom was never there for me and my siblings, and I have a chance to confront her about our past and the way we grew up, but I am lost on what to do. My husband doesn't want to support me on the problem because he believes no matter what my mother is told he doesn't think she can change. I don't know if confronting her would work. She has spent the last 13 years of my life thinking there was nothing wrong and anytime she is confronted with any of her past it is an automatic defense reflex that she throws up and manages to make work for herself. I want to confront her on this matter, and I want to be able to have something to do with her during my life, but until she comes to terms with reality that will never happen. I have 2 small children that have never even met her, and a niece that she has never met as well. I want to do this for me to work my issue out and put that part of my life to rest, but I don't want to do it without the support of my husband. I understand his point of view on the matter, but I still want to do this. I am at a loss on what to do. If I confront her with out my husbands support is he going to be there for me when it's over. If I let it go and try to move on with my life am I every really going to be able to forget what happened. I know all families have problems in there life but I can bet on anything that there's is nothing like this. I can give a quick view into the matter, but I will not go into detail on all of it. It started when I was 11 and my parents split up. My dad left because of problems they had and the fact that he ended up in the hospital with a nervous break down and the doctor telling him he has to change his way of life or it's going to end up killing him. After he left I was molested by my sisters boyfriend at the time. She knew it happened and never did anything to protect me from it. My mom lost custody of us twice to my dad, and both times the state returned custody to her. My sisters boyfriend continued to molest me, when I was 13 my mom asked me about it, and I told her everything that had happend a week later she dropped us off at my dad's and never returned a month after that the state gave my dad full custody. From the time that happend untill I was 16 we seen her maybe 4-5 times. Then she went to prison for drugs. After she got out she still hadn't changed. She never took care of us growing up. My oldest sister did untill she married at the age of 16 and moved out. I had 2 older sisters between me and her who wanted nothing to do with raising us, so the shoe fell to me. I was 11 at the time taking care of 6 younger brothers and sisters. We never had a full meal to eat, and moved constantly. She looks at some of the problems as there was nothing she could do. They "my sister and my mom" claim I made the decision to sleep with my sisters boyfriend at the age of 11, and never did anything to help me. I feel as though she was nothing more then the woman that gave birth to us, and I want to know why. This eats at me all the time. If we are out and I see kids with there parents I think to myself why couldn't my mom be like that. Why didn't my mom want anything to do with us. I am lost and confused and need help working these issues out. I have the chance but not the support. What should I do?

Okay, so we don't go to the same school, but I take a class every day that lasts 2 periods and sometimes I see him in between their classes and go to talk to him and he starts walking to class and i try to walk WITH him but he walks fast I guess... and today he was trying to make a call so I kinda just left him while he was doing that to go to my car and leave, so we didn't say goodbye or anything, it really just makes me mad he hardly acknowledges me besides"hey", and a smile... He has told me how happy he is to be with me and that he is going to put his all into this relationship, so... i dont know. if it happens again i'm not going to be happy.
20090220081946AAET8YK	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think about this situation?	ok well there's this girl who i met this summer at christian camp . we were becoming friends and we would talk all the time over the phone when camp was over. then all of a sudden every time i called her she didn't answer. she had deleted me from a christian networking website.  called everyonesapostolic.com i decided t o e-mail her and she said that she didn't want to be my friend because i hang out with gay people. I do not hang out with gay people but one day i was talking about a close friend of mine and as i was describing him i told her that he was a little feminine which is probably why she doesn't want to be friends anymore. He is the best quality friend i have and i feel that he is a better friend than she could ever be even though she is a christian. should i try to have a friendship with her or let it go since she already has..

20090220080946AA9nYTE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think this is rude?	Well, this isnt that big of a deal at all but I'm just wondering what your opinion is.    Okay well about a day ago, my friend came over with her mom cuz my mom and her mom are friends. Jenn (my friend) has been my friend for a long time now, and we know each other well. Her dad isnt the most reliable. He will say to do something with her and then cancel. But the other day when her mom and her came over, we made plans to go to a place (state landmark kind of thing) and my mom who has a VERY busy work scedule took a half day to do this. My mom called her mom yesterday and she couldnt get a hold of her. So then finnally we reached them this morning and wanted to no what time we were going 2 go, and my friend says that she is going to do something with her dad, like go to the park. And, here is my mom who took a half day to be with them. Now, the part that annoys me greatly is that I think my friend knows that her dad might not evn take her. And she even said, "umm idk whats going on cuz I cant get a hold of my dad." I really just want to say to her, "Well, if you cant get a hold of him maybe its not important." But I know tht it would be mean. So, what do you think of this situation? And what should I do?      sry its so long lol

20090203130139AAkTrZ2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How many women are turned on by being dominated?	I realize that this question sounds a bit sexist, but I've found almost invariably that women are turned on by being dominated. Maybe it's just me - I'm 6'3", 245, and bald - but the more violent and aggressive I acted in bed, the more women loved it. I found that, regardless if the female was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both), the recipe for turning them on could be broken up into:      1) Hold them down firmly by the wrists...apply enough pressure to hurt them slightly, yet not to cause serious pain.      2) Thrust as hard as you can.      3) While doing so, mouth in an angry, aggressive tone things like "Yeah, you like this, don't you?" and "Come on, beg for it".      I admit, I'm less than thrilled by the whole procedure...while some men get off on dominating someone, I find it sort of caveman-esque and was a bit disappointed to find that the women were so traditional and stereotypical in what they liked. However, I've posted questions in the past mentioning that I hated my height and build and generally people acted like I was crazy, like almost all women wanted a big man who would "ravage" them.  It's hard for me to reconcile turning someone on with something I totally hate about myself, but there isn't exactly a way for me to alter my height, build, nor baldness.

20090220080952AAvOi9J	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife always thinks im always cheating on her. What can I do?	Of course, I never have and never would cheat on her. We have been married for almost three years and have an 18 month old son.       She constantly thinks I am talking to other girls on the phone, internet, and in person. My job requires me to drive an hour away every other day, So im not at home much during the day. I get off at 5 and rush home to spend time with them. However, if a strange number calls my phone, im cheating. If I get a text from a wrong number, im cheating. When I have to leave town on the days required, im cheating. What can I do to convince her otherwise?       The latest has been with the cell phone bill. We share a plan with U.S. Cellular. When the bill came in, there were only 16 recorded calls on my side of the phone bill. She called US Cellular and asked them and they told her the only way calls would not show up on a bill is if the user requested it.    POOF!! Im cheating again.    So I called them specifically about my account, and apparently US Cellular stopped showing detailed information on an account several months back except for on the newest number, which is hers. Which is why there were very few calls shown on my side of the bill (it only recorded peak and roaming).    So, I told her about this, and she still acts like Im lying about it. So I told her to go and check it.       Any advice on how to get her to quit thinking this crap?

I'm in college and with my first long term boyfriend and I feel like everything is great between us except that if I haven't waxed I won't let him touch my back or something and that's usually a week out of each month or something and my boyfriend thinks I'm avoiding him for a reason. I can't keep making up "I'm not in the mood" stories forever. Should I just come out and tell him or is this a bad idea?       Would this be a big turn off for him?  <<This is the part where I need you to be honest with me!       I'm 19 and he is 20.

20090203125452AABSnJS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need Love Triangle Help!!!!!!!!!?	I like this guy named Alex. He likes my best friend, Amanda. Amanda likes a guy named Philip, but ALSO likes Alex a little. Alex liked me for like..2 weeks.    Now he likes Amanda. So he asked her out this week, and she said no, but that she DOES like him. She knows i really like Alex, and as a friend she should respect girl code and not like him since i do and I was first! I got really upset, and told Amanda and Alex I was very mad at them. Me and Alex were texting throughout class, which was when I began ignoring him. Then Danielle (me and Amanda's friend) tells me that Alex asked HER out on Saturday, right before Amanda! So I was disgusted and cussed at Alex over text about how he asked Both people out. He texted back saying how he "SWORE ON HIS LIFE HE DIDNT ASK DANIELLE OUT!" so I texted Danielle and asked her and she said "I swear to GOD he asked me out!" So I dont know what to do. Alex has never lied to me, but Danielle has, but Danielle is in my "group/clique" so I have no idea what to do. I'm freaking out an in tears. Please tell me what to do, and how I can fix this!

20090203130730AAc2njN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Music ruining friendship?	Music is my best friend's life. Since her dad is Satan (believe me, he is) - shes never allowed to go anywhere unless hes there, so she stays home (talk about around the clock temptation...). Anyhow, my best friend is like a musical goddess! She can't play any instruments (again, Satan's fault) - but, she knows the lyrics to all the main stream and even indie musical masterminds and appreciates even the most complicated of things within the music. Me - I suck, and I'm not that devoted. I LOVE music, don't get me wrong. But, unlike her, I don't have all day every day to sit around and memorize the date the Beatles began or when Marlyn Manson came out with his first hit. I just don't. Even if I did, I probably wouldn't. I have love for music, but I don't have that kind of passion. I think its messing up our friendship too... Like, years and years down the line - and I just now realize? I talk about books, the newspaper, and my church... I probably sound SO boring! She once told me I'm like an eighty year old woman stuck in a sixteen year old body. The sad part is, she'd probably have other friends if her parents would let her, do you think I'd be out of the picture? Would I need to start going to bingo and make some friends more like me : / ? Music is awesome, my friend is awesome, but neither of them are my life - they accompany my life. I feel like the day I let something be my all is when I loose everything! Someone, what should I do here???

So i start feeling angry inside & i asked her if she could please change the chanel. & she did. but she said that she wasn't going to do that any more. because i need to get over that & im going to learn the hard way. so i started crying because it made me upset. and when she goes out with friends, im constantly thinking that what if her friend brings a friend & she starts looking at her in her ways that she shouldn't be.. things like that cross my mind all the time. and i know she wont cheat on me, but im always worried that shes going to end up leaving me.       keep in mind that this is a long distance relationship for 2 years & 3months now.      what can i do to solve this?
20090203130557AAwK2Ql	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad died a year ago but his wife has said I can't have it?	I only found out yesterday my dad died a year ago. His lawyers have been tracking me down - he's never seen me and I've never seen him but he got the few letters I sent him, he never sent me any back apart from my 18th birthday.    His wife is in charge of making sure everyone gets what he put in the will but she can decide if they get it or not. She's refusing to let me have my inheritance because she doesn't see why I should be allowed it. My inheritance is about ￡20,000 and the house she's living in - in france - at the moment. Can she do this? She and my dad have four children together and I'm at least ten years younger (I'm 22) and I'm the only one to receive so much.    I don't understand why someone would do this.   Is she allowed to do this?

About three years ago we split for a month and I ended up buying my own bed.  When we got back together we gave away what had become his bed and kept the new one I bought.  He's never been fond of the bed; it has a foot board which drives him nuts and he doesn't like the mattress.  I have no issues with the bed or the mattress (of course, because I bought them for me).  He wants us to get a new mattress, but since I have no problems with the one we have and I paid for it myself I don't see why I should help pay for a new mattress.

20090203125928AA4EhLH	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Differences between loving someone, and having sympathy for them?	I am in love relationship with a wonderful girl since 3years. Since past 2years we leave in two different countries. We both love each other so very much and want to marry and grow old with each other. We both e come family which follows different religion. Since past 2years we both are in different country, its really hard for me to go her country and her to come here. And since then we both have only been in touch through Internet, Phone, or any other way possible. We havent seen each other in personal or cant even give each other a hug in bad times since past 2years. And despite of all this bigger problem is that our families dont accept our relationship. My family has and is trying all they can to stop me, but what can I do I love her.       In this past 3 years it has been like a rollercoaster. which relationships dont have good and bad moments? We both stood strong through it and still love each other and love is much stronger then before. I am truly loyal and devoted to her, never had a second thought or looked at any other girl in that way, and have not lie or hide to her. And she is same with me. We both have and can go to any extaned for our love.     I am more into caring side always after to take care of her and making sure she is alright on every moment and step of life. And she is more towards making sure I doing right things for our relationship and bit more possessive about me, she cares about me deeply but knows that I can take care of myself.      However, currently we are in bad moments of our life, she things I only have sympathy for her and not love. It has stunted me by knowing this. I know the meaning for sympathy and love. But it has made me stuck in thinking that all this moments of my life which I thought was True, Real, and Pure love, but to her all my love is like sympathy then what is love? What is it, that I have done that she thinkins my love for her is sympathy.

20090220092923AA1fsYS	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do to the person supplying your teenage family member with drugs?	I have a cousin, a very close cousin who I care about so much and would go to the end of the universe for.      Her crack mother left her and her 3 siblings 9 years ago to persue her drug habbits.  My cousin, 17 now has been battling her own drug addiction to cocain since she was 14.   She has a very addictive personality and is often persuaded to do things she doesn't want to do,  hence her original addiction at such a young age  which was brought on by her boyfriend originally forcing her to use.   She got pregnant, lost the baby, got pregnant again and vowed not to use drugs and fix up her life.  (The misscarriage tramatized her a bit)   So she was doing so well, came to live with me  got off the cocaine, ate healthy, didn't drink at all.    But as soon as the baby was born a girl showed up that ruined EVERYTHING we worked so hard for.      I found out recently that she introduced my cousin to heroin a few weeks ago,  my cousin even told me she didn't really want to do it but the girl kept insisting and insisting and because my cousin is a people pleasing drug addict of opportunity   (which this girl was well aware of before offering the drugs because she USED TO BE a family friend).   And keeps comming over to my cousins new home all doped up with more "bags of fun" and even when told to keep it away by my cousin she still brings it around....now 1-4 times a week.        Im on the verge of killing this girl,  shes turning my sweet cousin who finally got her life together back into a drug fiend  and I can't handle it.

20090220083159AA8LE0t	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is love fundamental to human existence?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?
20090220094330AAU3XD7	Family & Relationships;Family	How many siblings would u want if u could chose how many u had?	And how many siblings do u really have?

I would want 8 siblings if I could chose, which is exactly how many I really have, basically I wouldn’t wanna change how many I have.

Just a lil over a year ago though I was the youngest child, lol, then my parents adopted 2 kids, and then my mom had twin boys about 5 months ago.      I liked being the youngest, but I also like being the middle, and so I wouldn’t change that even if I could.

20090220094042AAECd4D	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Abusive in the future or just job related stress?	I have been with my love for a while now and I am deeply in love with him. He will surprise me with sweet things like flowers take me to dinners and movies (I as well make plans for us at take him out to do fun things, we have taken trips and just have fun as a couple) you would say "Wow nice man" yes he is when he wants to be BUT, we have been arguing more and more as of late and it used to be that when he was wrong he would admit it freely. The last 3 months have been horrible, the way our fights turn out is that I am wrong and he is right (well he feels he is). He gets very loud, shakes and just gets very angry at times. He has never ever hit me EVER or laid a hand on me. However he has hit the wall and has punched the bedpost so hard his hand still hurts from time to time. He is Marine Combat Recon Force Instructor and has seen a lot of action in his days, as he has students to train and maybe that is why seems to have the issues with being right all the time. When we do have issues we start out by putting them on the table but it escalates very fast into a fight and he will not let me get a word in edgewise. I have to ask him over and over to let me talk. We do live together and it is just getting to the point that I am not sure if I want to marry him. Yes its great when its great and we do try to work on it we talked about counseling and we need it but honestly have you ever felt your heart is not in it as much anymore. Have any of you ever been there. If so, please help me out I really wanna find the spark, but not sure my heart says stay.

20090220082012AAJQRsW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my wife do everything right except for the one thing I want her to do?	My wife is perfect in nearly every way.  I've told her this.  She doesn't have emotional fits, she doesn't yell at me, she doesn't complain a whole lot.  She cooks and cleans, takes good care of the kids, and runs our family schedule with delight and precision.      But when it comes to sex, the neglect is beyond repair.  It's like mold festering in the basement, covered with old blankets and then covered again with a pile of old junk.        One day I said "honey, why don't you loosen up... stop doing so much around the house.  Let it get messy.  Let us order out for chinese food.  Let us get a babysitter.  And along with the 10,000 other things you schedule, how about scheduling some sex?  Or better yet, just drop everything else whenever YOU feel like it, and let me know.  I promise I'll be ready.  I could come home from work at any time.  I could wake up in the middle of the night.  Whatever.  Whenever.        After having these conversations several times, and then going to 3 months of marriage counseling she has INCREASED her organization skills.  Now there are written schedules all over the kitchen, and she's cooking delicious meals every night from recipes!  She's vacuuming on a daily basis.  But... she will not find time for sex.      Our kids are 8 & 10 and they do their homework on their own.  They get good grades and everything is fine.        What the F is this all about??      And yes, I've asked her.  She won't say anything other than some bumbling excuse of the day.  We've been married for 12 years and this is droning on like a bad 4 hour movie without intermission.

20090220091933AAUrcHP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just shy? or do you think he may like me? help, long story sorry!?	There's this guy i fancy. He is the shyest person i know :(... great i know! He seems more shy with me than everyone else though, but i'm pretty certain he knows i like him because one of our mutual friends knows- i didnt tell her but she purposely mentions him in front of me and stuff ( also, she has become friends with me recently after loads have people have known about my crush for ages, much to the annoyance of my crush- so she could have just become my friend to panick and annoy him, or to get us together i just don't know!). With her though he is sooo much more confident, he will sit and chat and have a laugh. With me though, i've tried saying hi a few times but after that its just like ................ and he just seems very nervous and tries to get away from the whole situation. She is ALOT more confident than i am, i'm quite shy aswel.    As i mentioned earliar, she talks about him with me ( i havent admitted it but its obvious she knows) and she's told me that he is shy, and is encouraging me to get to know him- again i dont know whether this is a big joke to her to annoy him, or she knows something i dont! she also told me he doesnt have much experience with girls and has never really had a proper girlfriend, but i've never had a proper boyfriend so we're in the same boat really.    I'm not sure whether he likes me or not though. Around my friends he is very very shy and will not speak to me, or look at me, or look me in the eye. We were doing group work once and although we were supposed to work together, he would not look at more nor speak directly to me. He will also kind of run off when my friends are around, they are quite confident and loud though- im the little quiet one of the group.   But, he's done strange things as though he does want me to talk to him. On the way to class we were both walking alone and he saw me walking quite far behind him and he started walking slow ( a lot more slower than he does when he "runs off" when mates are around) and i had to catch up with him- even though i really tried not to, and he was walking very close and kept looking over, i kinda smiled but i dont think he saw because he looked away then- he has done this kind of slow walking thing 3 times now. Also in class he will look in my direction and when i turn around he will imediatly look away. I don't know whether he is just curious, or wants to be friends or what but im reallyyy confused.    There's loads more but i've already wrote enough!

He broke up with me saying that he did not want to deal with my trust issues, then when I called him shortly afterwards to ask him to meet with me to try to work things out, he sent me an email that said he didn't see us getting back together and that he had things he needed to work out for himself. I never responded to his email and have not contacted him since.       On Valentine's Day, when I checked my online dating profile on match.com, I noticed he'd viewed my profile (there's a section that shows you who views your profile).       Of course, I have not been able to stop thinking about him since I saw that he checked out my profile. I want to call or email him to say that I saw that he checked out my profile -- use that as an excuse to contact him again. We didn't date very long -- almost 4 months -- and had I not confronted him about his texting this other woman, who knows we may still be together. I really want to get him back. I've been on several dates since he broke up with me but I compare all the men to him and it's really stressing me out. I miss my ex-boyfriend a lot and want a second chance with him.       Tell me this, why would he bother to check out my profile if he's truly moved on, and is back on match.com browsing other women's profiles?       I had changed my username when rejoined so he couldn't have found my profile that way. Plus, on match.com if you don't know the person's username, all you can do is a random search. And even if my profile randomly popped up in his 5 daily matches, I still wonder why he'd bother rereading my profile if he's moved on.       We're both in our late 30s and I don't know if that makes any difference.
20090220085525AA6aBcO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've known my wife for about 5 years and?	we've been married for almost 2. When we were dating I had made a choice to have little or no contact w/ my family (parents and siblings). I hadn't spoken w. them for about 2 yrs before we met. While we were dating she asked if I was ashamed of her and I explained that it had nothing to do with her. I grew up in a very distructive environment and spent many years trying to become a better person. Jump to 2 yrs ago around the time we went to the Justice of the Peace. She tells me that 'you can't not tell your parents you're getting married'. Although I disagreed w/ her and tried to explain that she does not know the situation I wound up getting in touch w/ them and we all started talking again. They came to the JOP and expresed that they would have preferred if we did the traditional wedding.      My Wife and I have been spending the last yr or so planning a reception and during this time things have gotten quite strained between my family and I. It took about 6 months to get a guest list from my parents, when they did give us the list they kept adding people. They're contributing about 30-40% of the funds. Now we find out that even though we told my parents that we didn't want young childrem at the wedding (under 10) one of my parents friends can not get a babysitter and will have to bring her 2 children or not come to the wedding. My wife has decided that she wants to call this friend and tell her that she is not welcome if she brings her children.      I am mortified that she wants to do this.   What do you think?   I just feel that this whole thing would have been so much easier if I had never gotten in touch w/ my parents.
20090220093533AA1hwbn	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What should i do this is getting on my nerves!?	My sister who got married in October is having her wedding this sunday which I am in. All of the bridesmaids and maid of honor have the same dress but me because I a pregnant. Their dresses were 49.00 at sears. She forced me to buy a dress from davids bridal that was 189.00... When it was altered she told the lady what she wanted and now it looks ridiculous. Also she is saying that we all have to go out and get matching toe nails and flip flops and hair things and jewelry. And on the wedding day she picked the most expensive place for us all to get our matching hair do's and just told me today...the wedding is Sunday!!!   I already had plans for my hair, my mom is a hair stylist and was going to do it for free.      I lost my job On the day before thanksgiving and I am 8 months pregnant, she knows I cant afford this, yet she keeps throwing things at me that she assumes everyone can afford!   I told her that is she keeps saying this stuff is mandatory then I cant be in the wedding.   I did not pick out my bridesmaids dresses (She herself was 6months pregnant at my wedding by the way) I did not force financial obligations on them either so why should she feel it is ok to do that when 6 out of her 9 bm's don't have jobs?
20090220082953AAkqcY0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over your ex in a matter of hours........for men?	all you have to do is focus on a girl from the past that you don't care about anymore. what i mean by focus is that you have to constantly think about her when you think about the heartless girl who recently dumped you.       why did you stop caring? how long did it take you to get over her? what's more important is that you don't care about her NOW. she's in the past. the current one you're trying to get over is like the one from the past. she is already in the past. she doesn't matter.      if that doesn't work..........write down on a sheet of paper "she's just another girl i banged" 100 times and use that as a reference whenever those hurtful feelings come up.       FOCUS ON AN OLD GIRL.      it worked for me. it eliminated about 95% of my heartache. i can smile again.

20090220082031AA7DJ2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I too jealous of a person?	I love my boyfriend a lot, but I just can't help being so jealous.    I met my boyfriend from an internet game, we talked for about 7 months, and throughout those months he's had this one girlfriend whom he used to always talk about to me. Well after awhile he fell for me, so he broke up with her and started dating me.    Now that that's said, you'll understand a little better.   I'm an extemly jealous person. Last night, we were on the subject of cybering, and he admitted he cybered with his ex giirlfriends best friend. It pissed me off, I started cursing him out for a half hour and in that time he told me he cummed off his girlfriend before but all that was in the past. It just bothered me that he has done those things in the past. I feel like he loved her more than he loves me now... and it haunts me everyday but I just can't stop thinking about it.    Any advice on how I can move forward? I know he wouldn't leave me over this, but i don't want to keep hurting him by bringing up his past. I know the past is past but for me, I just can't seem to forget it.   Is this normal?
20090220093907AAQi3Jx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Can't I Relax And Act Normal?

20090220090315AA92USO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I cheapstake? How and whether to patch up?	Its my birthday tomorrow and my spendthrift husband is throwing a bash for me. As a conservative in this time of credit crunch, I blew him up for not asking me before sending out invites to friends. I know I am going to lose my job in couple of months and see our earnings falling. Despite that, I said to him that I would rather prefer a gift instead of spending money on a party (I am a simple girl). Also because, he never gets me any gifts and never makes any efforts (the party has been arranged by somebody else for her birthday as me and her share our birthdays). Whenever I try to talk to him about money, he thinks that I am a cheapstake and that it shows from my face. When I told him that you're not making any efforts from your side for any occasion, he blamed me because the iPod that i got him for his birthday arrived 15 days late (thanks to amazon). Now, because of the party, we have fought badly and he has said to me that he doesnt want me in his life because i am too bossy and i dont let him live his life in his own way. I also want to buy a house and have been looking around (because obviously it is more expensive to rent than to buy). He agreed to it a couple of days ago but just leaves himself to my mercy when we go for a viewing and blames me if the house doesnt turn up to be nice. In short he is not taking interests in things that I want. i feel i am not demanding anything off him at all. he works for 12 hours - i dont complain. i barely get to talk to him during the day but i dont complain. he doesnt understand my priorities and whenever i talk to him about money, he would start justifying it. please help and let me know if i should actually walk out of his life as he is feeling that i'm making it miserable for him by being a cheapstake.

20090220092531AAGiTsK	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding etiquette - is this fair? Please give me advice.?	I have been friends with someone for 15 years. We used to be close friends - lately we have drifted appart some. She lives across the country where she is planning a very elaborate and expensive wedding. Her combined household income is about 200g - while I am unemployed. I eventually told her about 3 months into the planning that I was angsting being able to fly to this affair, buy the dress, gifts, hotel stay, etc.....she told me that she would fly me out - but I tried to tell her that honestly, it wouldn't make a difference - I still have no expenditure income to cover this. I feel bad - but this is reality. I was apologetic and sincere - and tried to get her to realize the difference in our lifestyles.      Meanwhile, I got married at city hall and had a very modest overnight at a B and B with my husband in this midst of this year of her wedding planning. I didn't receive so much as anything but a facebook "congrats." from her for my wedding.      Granted, I realize people expect gifts and stuff when a wedding costs lots of money --- but am I crazy to be slightly annoyed? What happenned to honoring the real reason people get married?      I don't want anyone to spend money for "gifts" - but if she can't even send me a damn card for something special to me --- why should she expect me to inconvenience myself and seriously put myself in debt to afford to participate in her wedding?      I am ready to write her off and politely tell her that I can't even make the whole thing. Am I crazy here? Am I missing something.      I appreciate the advice. Thank you.

20090220094034AAt3mO5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	After A Year Boyfriend Admits He Still Has His Guard Up?	My boyfriend and I had a heated discussion a couple nights ago. In which I found out that he has not let his guard down. He told me that if I wanted to leave he would understand, and be ok with it. He tells me all the time he loves me, but how? He has been divorced twice, so I know he is being cautious. But, I feel like I am not being given a chance. He gave me a promise ring for Valentine's Day, but I have since decided I am not gonna wear it. He says he can't promise anything, like when he will let guard down, or when/if we will ever get engaged/married. If I even try to just TALK to him about our future, he says I am pushing him. I don't get it. I guess I am wanting to know- If someone still has guard up after a year, what are chances he will let it down? AND- How do I help him to let it down? I have given him no reason not to trust me.

20090220091231AAtfZ0A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you think, reading this letter? HARSH!?	My neighbor uses my computer sometimes when I am not home. It's cool. We are good friends.   But I found thison my desktop.   It's a draft of a letter she wrote her husband?   Should I ask her what's going on?I thought maybe her leaving it there was a way of asking for help...   What do you think?   Here is a copy of what was on my desktop:      I want a divorce.   The past year has by far been the worst one of my life.   I have made a huge mistake by thinking that you were the man that I am supposed to spend the rest of my life with.   You are selfish and smug. Your thought process equals that of a child and I am tired of it.   I never thought that the early years of my marriage would be spent with a person who thinks it is fun to irritate his wife.   Or with one who can sit and watch TV for 10 hours straight every day.   It has quickly some to my attention that I am in need a man.   That of which you are not.   The simplest tasks that you think any man can do, you find hard to accomplish.   This relationship is one-sided and I would rather be by myself!   I am not happy and everyday spent with you makes me that much more miserable.   I hate what my life has become since I married you.   I have no friends and all I get to do is sit in the house all day, every day and let the damn TV keep me company.   I do not want this type of life for myself anymore.   We are two completely different people and it is just impossible to try to merge the two of us under one household.   Every day I wake up feeling as if there is a huge gap in my life and a hole in my heart.   I can’t stand to be touched by you 99% of the time.   I have never had this problem with anyone else that I have been with. My entire sex drive has gone down the drain since I’ve married you.   I have completely lost any interest in pursuing any type of relationship with you.   I am tired of wondering if the reason you haven’t called me when you wake up, is because you are talking to some other woman on the phone.   Or if the reason you stay at  the library for 4-5 hours at one time is because you are talking to someone else over the computer.   I have insecurities about this marriage and I would just rather not be in it!   I’ve said it too many times you don’t believe it.   I WANT A DIVORCE.   I am not in love with you. I cannot offer you anything because I simply do not love you.   The thought of wasting another year in this crap makes my head hurt and I physically become ill.   Our anniversary was ruined because you lack to ability of foresight to plan anything!   You can plan your whole first marriage a child and God only knows what else for your first wife and I keep getting the short end of the ******* stick.   You plan nothing for ours, you tell me to abort MY child and you have us living like ******* paupers. But before it was all wine and dine with her? What the f*** ever!!   I don’t want it to take 15 years and be miserable the entire time like my mother to figure out that this is not what I want from life.   If you don’t think I am serious about it, then by time you wake up tomorrow you will be in for a rude f***ing awakening.   From this day on, your life or marriage will cease to be the same and that is a f***ing promise!   I would rather be dead than have to spend one more minute with you!   I hate you!   I wish I had never f***ing met you.   My life was so much better before you were in it

20090220084400AAcKTEO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Muslim Girls and Marriage?	In the Quran it says marriage should be mutual.   So how come many families disregard a sacred book, which they think so highly of and force thier children to have a marriage?   Even if it's against the Quran to have forced marriage?   And if the adult doesn't want to be married and the only optionis to run away why are they disowned?      I don't mean to offend by this question :)         I'm asking this because I know some muslim girls who have been forced and some have ran away
20090220085553AAokBhK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she a good friend?	I must warn you - I BABBLE and it's complicated and I hope I explain it well enough for you lot to understand ;)      I have this best friend (best friend of 3 years), but now I'm questioning her friendship so I wanted a second opinion.   Last year, I went through a really bad patch (illness) and she wasn't there for me. That's over now, and at the start of the new school year, we were "back to normal".   Another thing, (this may sound selfish) I thought you were only supposed to have one best friend, but she seems to say it to lots of people : / It just makes me feel sad because I only have her as a best friend because if you have one best friend, it makes it more personal if you get what I mean, but there she is saying to most of our close friends that they're best friends :(   The other day, I wanted to go to the cinema and the mall with her, just the two of us, and she invited someone else : /  They made me feel left out because the other friend is more outgoing than me, so I was just the person following them around..   I don't want her all to myself, I have other friends and i want her to have other friends too but sometimes I just want it to be me and her : /   Do you think I have a right to feel like this or am I being unreasonable?      Thanks :)

20090220084954AAzepYv	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm gonna be the most hated girl in school?	You see, there is this one circle of friends in my school called the Twelve. Let's just say that the leader of the gang is called Abigail.      Abigail here is one very snobby yet one of the least person who you would want to hang out with, let alone messing around and getting her upset. She and the other 11 members of the Twelve are always cussing about who's who and what's what in a bad way.      Two of my best friends, Sheila and Tanya are in the Twelve. It's hard to get out from that circle because they fear that Abigail will be mad at them and then she and the other nine will talk about them and then they'll black list Sheila and Tanya. Abigail always presumes that the other girls outside of the circle are just trash.      My other best friend, Seline, told me when she and Abigail were in sixth grade, Abigail and a couple of girls went to her house. Seline's room was full of girls, and Abigail wanted to change clothes. She than forced Seline to let her go inside of her parents' room (which was not polite) to go and change. Seline let her (her parents gave her a quick we-will-talk-about-this-later glance). After Abigail looked around, she than yelled "Whoa! What is this, your maid's room? Gosh this room is so small I can barely move around!"      The other 11 always discuss about Abigail's dance lesson, hum her dance songs, talk about the friends from her dance lesson, or other stuff that goes around in Abigail's life. The member of the gang who isn't talkative or isn't praising Abigail for pretty much everything that she does or is out of the orbit of the topics that are in, will be on the danger zone. Believe me, it'll be a thousand pages for me to write about other things about Abigail.      Well, you see, a week ago, a girl who was my former not-one-of-the-twelve-but-now-she-is friend held a plastic bag which contained Prata, it's an Indian bread. I thought that the bread was hers, so when a girl asked me to take one for her, I did. Abigail saw me and then snapped at me, telling me that those are hers and if I want to take any things that are hers I should tell her first. I was so so scared. I wasn't even taking the bread for myself!      You see, in my school, to graduate, you have to make a scientific paper, not just some papers. The paper must contain real facts about the topic that we choose, the polls from the students about our topic, etc. My paper is about the obesity rate in my junior high. I used the height and weight data of my almamater which I got from my P.E teacher to calculate the type of the students' body types. I inserted the height and weight data, plus the category of the students' body types (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese). I didn't want to insert it, but my teacher and mother insisted to.      Abigail was calculated as normal, but a couple of the girls in the twelve are calculated as obese. Today she talked at me, looking pissed, asking did I put the height, weight, and body categories of everyone in the almamater in my paper. I answered that if I don't have the student's height or weight, I wouldn't have inserted him. I tried to explain that my teacher insisted for me to inserted that data, but she wouldn't listen, she just walked away real pissed.      Later on, a friend of Seline from the Twelve told Seline that Abigail was really really mad and was complaining non-stop and yelling to her and the rest of the girls about me. Seline told me and I asked Sheila if it's true. And Sheila said yes.      Now I am really really scared and nervous. Sheila and Tanya once told me that Abigail can make the rest of the Twelve to hate somebody even if they weren't even irritated by him/her (well mostly her). Some of the girls in the Twelve are just also pure scary and fearsome and the others are just following so they won't be in the danger zone.      What should I do? In less than three months I'll be entering high school and it's not easy for me to study concentrationly while having the Twelve hating me for something that I did (not to mention the rumors they'll spread that can make the rest of the girls in my almamater hate me too). Any advice on how to fix this problem? Or how to act? Please help me, thanks.

20090220082930AAnKS9a	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this what real mediation is like?	Accused of domestic violence, a father is brought before a mediator.  That mediator had already met with the man's wife and brand new boyfriend for forty-five minutes.  The man is asked three questions:      Mediator: Would you say you are well bonded to your children?      Father: (Already looking at the mediator like he's a drooling idiot.)  Of course.      Mediator: Would you say that loss of time with you would inadvertantly harm the children?      Father: Of course.      Mediator: Have you ever awakened your children with an air horn?      Father: (Completely caught off guard by a question that has no basis in reality) No, he answers tremulously, not understanding what dimension he is in and suddenly thinking Rod Serling might jump into view at any moment.      Mediator: Denying that one are you?      Father: (Says nothing.  Notices the Mediator thinks he is shizzle.)      Mediator: You can go back to the courtroom now.      Four minutes later, the father is back downstairs in the courtroom shaking his head in bewilderment at his first experience with "mediation."      Later, in court, he discovers with no great surprise that the mediator has recommended any further time with his children to be supervised.      My question is, is this fair or proper mediation?

20090220083820AAByL6Y	Family & Relationships;Family	Should my mother attend my husband's uncle's funeral?	My mother is a very caring person, but also very emotional. My dad died when I was 19 and it has made my mother even more emotional, especially when someone dies.   My husband's uncle had MS, and passed away very suddenly this week. The funeral is next week, and I know my mom would like to attend but I'm not sure if it is appropriate? She never met the uncle, but she did meet his wife & daughters at my wedding and shower, but by no means are they close.   I love my mom very much, but when she is upset she needs a lot of support. I kind of feel that the support at the funeral should be for those who knew him, and she didn't. It would be memories of my dad and her father coming back to her, and re-living the pain again. I know she just wants to show respect and support, but would the survivors think it's weird that she's there? Or would they be grateful?

Below is the question I asked several days ago.  11 out of 12 answers were in agreement that it was her problem to get her own insurance.  I found out yesterday that my company WILL allow me to cover her.  Now there is a dilemma...      She refuses to accept a "parenting plan" I have filed with the courts that outlines visitation and other child related issues.  Should I use the insurance as leverage to get her to agree to the plan?  i.e: "sign the agreement and I'll cover your health insurance"       Ex Wives Health Insurance?   My ex is upset b/c the insurance company discovered we are no longer married and living 700 miles apart. Her coverage was terminated as of Jan. and she is now uninsured. (I still provide coverage for our kids)       Do you think she is justified in feeling that I (and my employer) should still be providing health insurance for her?       Background: she initiated divorce, final in October 2008.

When he's talking to me his eyes stare in mine like..no one i've ever talked to before..   He's kinda shy, until you get him talking...   And he cut himself on accident, recently, and he kept coming up to me showing me the progress of his finger, if it was still bleeding..   and then i decided to pick on him by saying "You think there's gunna be a scar?" and he started laughing and said "I think i'll get a scar." and while we were talking his dad turned around, looked at his son and i, shook his head and started laughing.   Also, i had my teeth cut out before one of our 'big games' and he was making sure i was well enough to play the bb game. It was really sweet,..   and when i'm talking to him or next to him, one of his friends will come up and embarass him. [like smacking him in the butt. saying "wooooo [then his name] ....etc etc] then he'll look at me and his face gets really red...   Recently one of my friends was sitting next to me, she left and went to the bathroom..and he was sitting behind us, but then he came up and stole her seat and started talking to me..and One time i smiled at him and said hi [just being friendly, i do that to everyone] and he smiled really big and looked down..    Also, i DO NOT like him in that way, although, he is kinda cute..but thats besides the point.....i'm just wondering if he likes me.   soo, what do ya'll think?

20090220091825AAsoChN	Family & Relationships;Family	Visitation rights to addopted siblings?	My mom was in and out of jail when i was younger and on multiple drugs. She has two other kids. She lost them about six years ago. I being the oldest took care of them up until the point of adoption. At the time my sister was 5 mths and my little brother was probably 4 yrs old. Before the addoption was finalized i was able to see them when ever i wanted. However when it was finalized they took that away from me. I basically raised those kids. I know that they are in a good home and are very loved by their new parents. And i thank them for that. However all i want is visitation rights to them even if it has to be supervised.    My grandpa passed away in april and left me $17000.00 and with this money i want hire a laywer to sue them for visitation rights. Since i have tried talking to them and i have tried everything i could possibly think of. without getting the law involved.    I would like to know your opinions on this and if i should carry through with it. and if you think tha ti would win a court  case or if im just wasting my time?

20090220091957AA7HxzM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	She wanted to sleep w/ my husband & now she is cheating on hers?	I met her & her husband 1 yr ago. her hubby adores her. She was giving my hubby lustful stares, innapropriate comments, etc.. My husband is oblivious and he even noticed it. We just chalked it up to her hav. a crush. So, we moved away for 8 mo's and came back & reconnected. we were so happy to have them back, b/c of interests fun, etc.. so, she goes away for many weeks to training(for her job)& comes back & tells me she cheated w/ this guy and cant wait to do it again and she doesnt feel guilty. so im trying to councel her by giving my life experiences and my mistakes, yet slipping in consequences from time to time.. no reaction, she just keeps talking about the sex. I try not to judge, we've all screwed up. but now im thinkin bout her poor sweet hubby. then she says she gave sexual looks under her hat to this guy at training so noone would see. at this point i FLASHBACK to when she used to do that SH** with my husband. So, now im thinkin i CANNOT trust this person EVER.. RUN!!! i went home told my hubby and he was FLOORED. my husband wants to tell her husband b/c he is a loyal friend to him & feels SO bad for him. she wants to stay w/ him, but just sleep around. We feel like she is cheating him of his right to happiness (she wont even let him touch her now) Geez, when I saw him he looked SO SAD. (he knows something isnt right) So, my question is do i try to be her friend and try to councel her or cut ties and us tell her hubby?

20090220092924AAApVCf	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't know what to do!?	My family has close ties with another family. Impromptu plans were made to get together tonight. Then, the idea of shopping was tossed around. However, another (not-so-close) friend of the family has called and asked me to baby-sit her son and puppy about 20 minutes after plans were made. The town we were going to go shopping in is the same town the mother is going to. She said we, so I think her boyfriend is going along with her. So the whole lot of us going together is out of the question. Besides, I don't even know where she is going, or if she is going shopping. There's a chance that I will get stuck baby-sitting everyone's children and the other adults go shopping. But as I said, no one may even be going shopping. If I were to go shopping, I would need to stop at a Coinstar to cash some of my change, and that may be irritating to those who may or may not go with me. What should I do? Should I bring the kid along, (that would make six people going)since the puppy is old enough to be left alone for a while? Or would that offend the mother and my might-be company? But then again, I'm not even sure what might happen in the Shopping Department. I'm, like, up sh*t's creek without a paddle! Help!

I have some other guys calling, but I really like this guy.  Should I just forget about him and go out with the other guys?  Should I feel guilty if I do?  Does he like me?

20090220100654AAaeMnJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you fight over money?	My husband is obsessed with having money. He has dreams of the Escallade, huge luxury RV bus, etc... He want's everyone to think he's loaded. I can't stand it. He only brings home $400 a week! I make more then him! Duh, we don't have enough money to pay the bills, and he wants people to think we're rich? What is wrong with him?      Anyway, this past week was really bad, bank wise. I hate doing the bills, but he doesn't know how to do them (go figure). There were about $400 in overdraft fees. I'm already pissed about it, stressed out about it, but there is nothing I could do, so I let it go and just look forward to today to get paid. I screwed up, I admitted it. I didn't tell him right away, because every time there is an overdraft (which seems to happen a lot with is $400 paycheck) I get b*tched at. He yells and screams and carries on for days about it. I can't stand it anymore. I told him to do the bills, and of course he won't because he "doesn't know how". I am so tired of fighting over money. I'm at the point where I want to take our 1 year old son and leave. Of course, I can't leave WITH NO MONEY!      Uggg. He really pisses me off.      Does anyone else fight over money? Am I over reacting? I think it's verbal abuse.

20090220095621AAv7qiv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it possible to still be friends?	My ex and I were together for about 6 months on and off. It gets complicated but basically he didnt want to be tied down in a relationship so he broke up with me. He insisted that we remain friends because he didnt want to lose me and we hung out a few times since the break up. He would make plans for us to have dinner and stuff but then never called and went to go party. I finally had enough and whenever he called or texted after that, I didnt reply. A month later, I saw him and he asked why I was ignoring him and I said I have been really busy. This was the last time I talked to him, over a month ago. I think I am pretty much over him (I have been kissing this other guy haha but he is a manwhore so it will go nowhere) but I have really missed his company and now I feel that ignoring him was a mistake and that he is still immature but maybe I should be patient with him. I dont think I want a relationship with him anymore, as he cant handle it but I do think he will make a good friend in the long run. He was my first so I dont want him to simply disappear out of my life. I know his schedule and I want to "accidently" bump into him and see if he will talk to me and if he still wants to be friends. Is this a good idea?

20090220100356AAnWCQn	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why do brides wear white and grooms (usually) wear black?	I looked up the reason for the brides white dress tradition. The color symbolizes purity, holiness (untained from the world), happiness, and even virginity.    So, if thats the case, why do grooms usually wear black (the color of mourning)? Shouldn't he be as happy as the bride, and dress accordingly? (I know there are grooms who wear white, but in most weddings grooms wear black tuxes).   Please give me your opinions, and tell me if it actually looks better for the groom to wear black or white.    Thanks everyone in advance!

20061027085852AAdwzHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls/Women, I need a little help here...?	I recently sent a non-descript love letter to someone I vaguely know...      Does it sound resonable that someone would sent a 1-page rant about I make them sick, I have violated them, and they wish they could remove me from their thoughts, etc, etc.      I can see how she does not like me(I don't like everyone I meet, so I can't expect everyone I meet to like me), but what motivates someone to be so harsh? We have not spoken more than 2-3 sentences together? I did not believe in love at first sight before meeting her, but within 2-3 days of first meeting her, I virtually fell off a cliff in terms of love(not lust, not obsession, not a crush), and you know in your heart what the it is the real deal, and so I moved on it.

Ok I'm pretty upset here....      basicly my husband has known I have ALWAYS wanted a SMALL dog. (been together 2 years and married 8 months) He's told me, time and time again if we found a small dog at the pound, we'd look into getting it. Well I have found the dog!!! About 5yrs old, 5lbs (underweight as it was a stray) poodle mix. BEAUTIFUL dog. I spent about an hour with him yesterday. I'm in LOVE. Look at his face tell me you don't love him too:  http://photocache.petfinder.com/fotos/WI...       Anyways, Talked to the husband he said "no, its not fair to the dog to bring him into the home when we can't be home 24/7 for it"    I posted how to tell the shelter "We can't take him" and they were saying I was being a door mat.   I want to respect my husband and I also don't want him to think i'm a doormat.   What would you do in this situation?

Then the next day he was telling me how much he missed me and how much he still liked me. So finally agreed that may be we could work things out and he said that yea we could do that as long as things weren't like before and then I kicked him out of my house one day for telling me I couldn't go to his house  ( I dont get along with his roommate, but he also didn't want me over so that things wouldn't be like before, but I was still pissed)       then we fell out this was about 2 wks ago and then we started sleeping together again and we tried not to talk about the issues and just take it slow, but then I started getting hurt that he was going to see movies without me or not going out with me to places. So i called him out on it and he said that if he was going on dates it was going to be with other girls. So we had a fight and I told him he didn't loveme, and he said he did love me, just that he ...
20061106092413AAfH5dR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he being hot and cold with me?	I've been getting together with a guy who lives a few hours away from me, and the only times we've ever seen each other is when we go out with our mutual friends, who by the way are all guys. He told me he's always likes me, but then he's acting really funny. A couple of nights ago we saw each other again and we ended up sleeping in the same bed, which is the third time it happened, we've never had actual sex and he's never pressurized me to although we did do other things, and i took as this as him really liking me and wanting to wait. The next day though he was ignoring me and acting all cool, is this because his friends were there? His friends tell me that he really really likes me and that he's funny around girls he really likes, and that i should just tell him how i feel, but I'm pretty sure he already knows. We all went out again the next day and he was being really quiet which isn't normal with him. I asked him if he was pissed off with me and he said no, i'm just feeling ill.
20060622143332AALJUMZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are young Asian (any nationality) chicks (between 18-28) the most beautiful chicks in the world?	I ask because after spending a few in the Military, lots of men, Black, white and otherwise...fall in love and marry and bring these women back home.

I am an attractive balck female, about 5'10 1/2, 135 lbs., cafe au lait complexion, in shape, college educated, beautiful (in my own opinion) But my nappy hair can't hold a match to the magic that long black silky hair of theirs weaves on men's consciences and nether regions.

First I saw this "third" guy and since I don't talk to him I decided to go socialize a little bit and asked him where the other two guys where. He didn't even look at me and said he didn't know. Then, someone else asked him who "his friend" (referring to me) was. And he said "WHAT FRIEND?" And after that he just stood up and sat like 10 feet away from me. Then I tried hanging out with them but when somebody else asked me if I was hanging out with them, one of my "friends" said he didn't know what I was doing, that they saw me all alone and then I started to follow them.

The reason why her daughter didn't say anything was because she is afraid her dad will do something to the guy and go to jail.  The court has the papers already - I guess they are going to press charges - he is in jail now for DUI, so it's going to take a while.  Anyways, my question is - what can I say to her?  Her daughter is like a daughter to me... I know the guy too and it pisses me off that they have known him for so many years, and gave him all their trust, treated him like a brother and yet he does this?!  I also want to know how can we some how control her dad - he will find out about it eventually!!  I know he will be hurt, full of anger, and will do something about it without thinking clearly.  I have no clue on what advise I should give - can anybody help?

And I use to like her but I stopped because it wasn't getting anywhere because she was just using me and  ignoring me and stuff. When I told her i liked her she first blushed and then looked away. Shortly after she told her mom. (I am really cool with there family) So after a while I have gave up. A year later after deaning to herself that I still liked her and her being mean to me. She suddenly stopped being mean to me and, now she just teases me, hits me at times, messes with me, and so on. That's when we are around ppl. When we are alone, she is nice to me and, around me. I have tried to ignore her and for the first time she walked up to me and said hi. I am trying to keep my cool, and not going back to my old self and falling for her like I did and do stuff for her all the time because then she will be back in control. I have just been using kino ( the art of touch) and I have beenteasingg back, being a little more nice, and so on. Should i continue, does she like me or, is this a trap. What should i do?

20090220103024AAPEBdI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he confused? Does he like me?	Ok my best friend is a guy and he's been dating this girl for about 6 or 7 months now and I like him and its kinda obvious so he knows. But when I'm around him he puts his arm around me, talks, laughs, and always is concerned if I don't look happy. He always jokes about his gf and never says anything like she's so nice. When I'm around he tries to avoid talking about her. But when his gf comes into the room, its like I don't exist. When I'm not in the room, I heard from my friends that his gf got him to come up with a 'plan' to make me fall in love with some other guy. He told me about it a little later and I got all mad at him and he said omg i'm sorry i didnt think you would b mad at me and stuff like that. Whenever i ask him to go to the movies as like friends, he always says yes or if he cant he always makes new plans so we can go some other time. His gf is soooo jealous of me i dont know why cuz she already has the guy. So do you think he could be confused about who he likes or could he possibly like me? Knowing him, he wouldnt want to hurt his gf by breaking up with her for me and i'm fine with him going out with her so is he just trying to make us both happy?

I am very lonely and have never had a boyfriend or had interest from guys.   I am 17 and feel like my youth is slipping away from me and before I know it I will be too old to have a relationship with someone, as I won't have any experience with them. I want to experience things that other girls my age do.      I am 17 and when I went on holiday I went to beach parties and older guys (between the ages of 20 and 26) looked at me and talked to me and wanted to have sex with me. I said no at the time, but next year I am going back (ill be 18) and I'm thinking about losing my virginity then so I won't be a freak anymore, and I'll know that I am desired and liked. My time is running out and I feel like this is the best thing to do.      Has anyone had any similar experience?

So the night before Valentine's day, my boyfriend and I were doing laundry together in the laundry room of our apartment building, where there are multiple shared washers and dryers. We had just come back from dinner and as part of his valentine's day to me, he had cleaned the entire apartment.As we were putting clothes in the dryer, I pulled out a girl's camisole that was definitely not mine. We were both speechless, and I just threw it away and walked upstairs, not knowing what to say. We are together almost all of the time, so I really want to believe him when he says he has no idea where it came from. Nonetheless, it was a horrifying discovery. I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and not dwell on it, but I can't get it out of my head. I can't prove that he did anything, but I can't prove that he didn't either. HELP!

20090220094627AAWxvY1	Family & Relationships;Family	Need some help with my teenager brother?	I have a brother that is turning 18 yo. I am 25 yo. I graduated from a top university with honors  and is currently working as a electrical engineer and a real estate agent on the side. Although I have a busy schedule, I always make time for my brother. He is one of the most important people to me in life. I take him out to dinners every thursday and hang out with him on the weekends. He likes to build things with his hands so I always get him things like radio kits, Lego Robots, RC cars to build and he has a lot of fun with that. I also take him on mini trips as well and he really enjoys that.  I also started a college fund for him because I want him to have a good education and not to be buried in college debt when he graduates.          I know when you're a teenager you go through a lot of changes. Recently, my brother got his ears pierced and has decided not to go to his high school graduation. I was a little disappointed but I respect his decision. People tell me that he really looks up to me. I never really thought too much about that. I just try to give as much as I can to him because I really love him. I always tell him I am very proud of him and no matter what I will always be there to support him. I try to encourage him to dream and to find a passion in life because he's really smart and has a lot of potential to succeed in life. But sometimes, I feel like I am too hard on him because I want him to do well. Although I am not that old yet, I sort of forgot what it was like being a teenager. Sometimes I feel like I am not understanding enough and can end up getting mad at my brother for things that are not that important to him but are important to me. I really don't like to get mad at him, because it always really hurts me to see him sad and quiet after I get mad at him.             I would like some support and some advice on how to be a better brother for this supposedly "crazy" time in his life.   Thank you!

20090220095241AAA70Vt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My ex boyfriend dumped me because he is addicted to pot?	^pretty self-exlaintory, right before Christmas my boyfriend decided to break up with me so that he could continue to smoke pot everyday. He is mentally addicted.       He did not tell me during the realationship that this was going on in his life because he knew my personal views. He I noticed a big change in his behavior around the middle of our relationship which is probably when he started. He pretty much said I love you one day and the next he dumped me which is messed up because I have already expereinced a boyfriend who was a pot head and dumped me the same exact way.      Now I have been broken up with him for about 3 months and I am left with the wounds, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and even tried to commit suicide last week. Sadly I have started to smoke cigerettes and some pot to handle my stress. But I still don't like it and I only smoked pot like twice and really it wasn't that great of an experience.       Really I don't care about my disorder because right now I am getting help from medications and therapy.       Sadly I really became close with his parents but now I beleive they hate me because they know about the suicide attempt and everything. Anyways recently I have been talking to a lot of my ex's best friends (which are my friends as well) who suprisingly  never see him anymore...he's done the same thing to them as he done to me, he ditched them so he could smoke pot. And these are his friends who been there for him throughout high school.       I know that he is my EX boyfriend and maybe I should stay out of it but I still love and care for him. He is an only child and I know his parents love him very much. To see that he's been ditching everyone for this drug and most likely his family. He also recently either lost his job or quit. Which he is a workaholic and loves working.       I would have thought if his parents knew that they would get him help. Because I know that they don't like him smoking cigerettes and even asked me when I was dating him to try to get him to stop.       What I was thinking of doing was to get a couple of his close friends who were ditched as well as me and meet up with his parents and tell them that their son needs help before he hurts himself or gets arrested. I don't like being a narc but I really do care about his family and him. I really don't care if my ex hates me for the rest of his life because I do this. I know that he is driving while under the influnece.      Do you think this is a good idea? To get a couple of his friends and I and confront his parents?       I know that he just had his cousin at the age of 21 die from a motorcycle accident and he may have been under the influnce of something. And I know that was hard on his parents because they were close in age and looked alike.       Please tell me what you think or have anyother ideas that may help him? Because I know he wants help because he has told me in the relationship he wanted to find help for his "problem" but he wouldn't tell me what it was.       Thank you for reading.      Losing your boyfriend because of drug addiction hurts friends and family...
20090424140851AAWtMjC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE WAY MY EX IS ACTING?	I would like help dealing with an ex boyfriend situation. 10 points for the best answer, since it's so long.      We were each others first loves, it took him two months to talk to me, he would just stare into my eyes. Once we finally did, we were obsessed with each other. It was the deepest, most passionate relationship I have ever experienced. He even told his mom that he loved me more than he loved her. Anyways, he proposed the idea for us to take a break, and I went along with it, figuring it would be good for us, I think it was because we just needed space and wanted to find ourselves. The next day, he tried to kiss me, but I resisted. He got mad and started telling people that I had cheated on him and he would talk about girls in front of me trying to get me jealous. (we go to school together). I ignored it. I tried to contact him to give him his things back, but he never answered so I brought his things in a bag to school and set them in front of him and walked away. He left the bag there. My guy friends, who are really protective over me, knew how he was treating me and didn't like it, so word got around that they were going to fight him. He heard and approached them, and I just happened to walk by when they were about to start fighting. A crowed had already gathered, but before they could start fighting I jumped in and starting punching him before the cops pulled me off. He was stunned, shaking and speechless. It was the talk of the school for a bit, but eventually people forgot about it. He began doing drugs and skipping class, which he never did before. He also started making everyone refer to him by his last name, and now doesn't answer to his first name. Other people noticed the changes in him, and his art teacher suggested I should try and talk to him. I drove to his house and we layed in the grass together, talking. He told me that he didn't care about me anymore and that I didn't need to worry about him. He was holding back tears though. After a couple of hours, we hugged, I left, and I figured it was all over. Two days later, he got a new girlfriend, and I let him be. The summer came, and he went back to his hometown for two months. During that time I realized he was getting people to check up on me for him on myspace, once I realized what was happening I put a stop to it. I also got a new boyfriend, but broke up with him for other reasons.   During the first couple months of school he would pass by my classes, staring at me through the door. It was like he was waiting for me to say something, but I always just turned away. I figured he was playing games.   Then I was introduced to a girl who like him and wanted me to tell her what he was like. I told her the truth, and she was dumbfounded. She told me that everything he says about him and his new girlfriends relationship sounded exactly like what I told her about ours. She thought I should try and talk to him. And of course, I did. I called him one day after 5 months of not talking, and he hung up on me immediately. I texted him saying that I was offended and didnt understand why he would hang up when we were supposed to be cool with each other. He called back and apologized. He said he was just so shocked to hear my voice he didn't know what to say. He then told me that he was sorry for everything he did to me, and I said I was sorry too and that I never meant to hurt him. But he told me to not get in between him and his girlfriend, so i told him i wouldn't. I asked him about all the myspace stalking, and he denied it. The next day, he tried to move closer to me when we were around each other. Then my friend told me that he walked right up to me and just stared at me, but i was looking the other direction so he walked away looking hurt.I just let it go. Another couple of months went by, and I heard he was talking about some personal stuff about us, to a group of people. I was mad so I called him. I thought he was going to be hostile towards me but instead he spoke softly and said he was sorry if he woke me up and that he would let me sleep if I wanted. I continue to call him by his first name, and he said it was ok but I'm the only person who can call him that. But he still swears he doesn't care about me anymore. We got the issue resolved, and haven't talked since then. He is still going out with that girl, but she goes to a different school. He also still does drugs and skips at least 2 days out of the week. Then last night I was at work and got a call that one of my guy friends who was involved in the fight between us, his little sister who is 14 had snuck out after a fight with her mom and he picked her up to take her to spend the night. I got my friend and his mom and we went to his house and got her, there was lots of drama.   My friend says that it seems like hes trying to get to me through people close to me, since he cant do it directly.   What do you think? Whats going on?

20090220094849AAEfc2S	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did you ever get the feeling people admire you greatly but don't want to admit it?	I'm a bit weird and I couldn't see it much as a kid but now I notice people go out of their way to make believe they can't stand me but I also see a lot of admiration in their eyes for the way I am. Co-workers roll their eyes and get aggitated at the strange way I act and then I'll take a vacation and everyone's eyes seem to light up when they see I'm back.       I also recently got on to Facebook and I have schoolmates who I thought hated me when I was a kid, friend request me and are very excited to see me. I also notice that I'm really the only one of my classmates that every one else has as a friend. It seems to me that people are just programmed not to like anything that goes against the norm but they secretly admire that freedom I have to not to care how others view me. Would anyone like to share their own experiences?

20090220101201AAcoleq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it wrong to want to leave a friend because they don't open up to you?	I've been talking to a girl pretty much everyday for almost 6 months now whom I consider my best friend yet she never tells me much about herself. I'll ask her questions and she won't answer me. I know she's shy and all but I would have figured by now she would be comfortable with me. Now that she says she's fallen in love with a guy I feel like I need to end the friendship. I feel really disappointed with her because of the fact that she's going to be telling the guy she's in love with more about herself than me. She says she's actually pretty surprised that I've stuck around so long with the way she acts and tells me she appreciates me but I'm not feeling it much anymore.      So I'm wondering how long is too long to stick around? Have I wasted my time trying to get to know someone that will only open up to romantic interests? Do I need to leave or wait it out?
20090220101708AAkccYy	Family & Relationships;Family	I have lost the love for my father...am I wrong for this?	I have always had a difficult relationship with my father. Ever since I was a child he would hit me and force me into sports.  He would drag me to the court to play even if it was late and even if I had school work to do, if I would complain, he would scream and hit me. Eventually I became homeschooled so I could dedicate more time to my sport.  This was awful.  He would try to sit down with me and help me do my HW, and if I would not do it how he wanted he would get very mad.  He even busted my lip once when he punched me in the face.       I remember him abusing my mother when I was younger.  My older brother ran away from home and I was the only one left in the house to witness this.  He left my mother bloody and battered in the bath tub once.  I thought she was dead. I remember running cold water on her because I saw it on the cartoons...thats how young I was. I could not help her at all.      When I was old enough to decide whether I was going to go to college or not, it was a terrible time.  I received a scholarship from a very prestigious college.  I feel like I should thank him for that, but he didnt want me to go.  He told me that I should not go to college because I will become only a whore. He stopped talking to me completely when I did decide to go.        Now I graduated from college, I'm 24 and engaged to a wonderful man. We are expecting our first child but due to his harsh schedule, he is unable to be with me right now. My mother told me it would be good idea for me to move back home so she could take care of me.  I did.  My father wont let me sleep, he calls me a slut and a whore, tells me he will kick me if I get close to him, and has no respect for me at all, and I dont know what to do, there is no talking to him.  My mother works so much, all day, so she is not home much to talk to her, and when she is, he is asleep.        I feel like my family has fallen apart and I dont know why.  My brother never wants to be around, I have no idea who anyone else is in my family, and I feel bad when I hear its because they dont want to be around my dad.       I feel like a bad daughter, but I dont understand my own feelings.  I dont think I love my father anymore...and it hurts so bad.  I want things to be good, but I dont think they ever will be...I'm scared that he just doesnt care.       When my mother took me to a counselor when I was 18, the counselor told me I needed to be out of that house, and my parents got mad at me about what I told the counselor for thinking that...but I only told the truth...I dont know what to do.       I need to be stronger??  Its hard because Im 6 months pregnant and stressed out...Im scared for my baby...

20060630202044AAdeXPw	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think my best friend might be gay...?	Last night I was at my best friends house and sat down at his computer to look up something on Google. I typed in the letter "g" and the recently visited websites list came up: all gay porn sites. No one else uses his computer (except for me, on occasion), so it had to have been him viewing those pages. There weren't just pop-ups, they were all kinds of gay sites (pictures, videos) and the sub-pages that were visited, too. I've had my doubts for some time that he might be homosexual. No matter what, he's my best friend, and he sexuality doesn't play a factor in our friendship. But I have a question: Should I ignore what I saw, or somehow approach the subject with him? We've discussed sexuality in general, and he knows (because some of our friends are gay), that it would never change how I felt about him. What should I do? Forget it, or address it? I'd hate for him to be feeling uncomfortable, because he doesn't have to go through this alone... if he IS actually going through something.

20060722111029AADhSre	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm with a girl I love and want to be with but she is always throwing her religion in. What should I Do?	I am going out with a girl who I have been going out with for several months and I love her and we are happy together. The only problem is she is a strong mormon and I am a christian. No matter what I say it doesn't seem to be enough that we both believe in God and Jesus Christ... So she is always on me to go to church with her, which I have a few times. She gave me a book of Mormon and a little supplimentry reading. Now I read alot of this and Mormon is not for me.

20060725201950AAO0Krx	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Now that the number of females are far more than males,why then can't polygamy be officially legalised?	In any animal specie: human beings, cows, dogs, cats, wild animals, ants, etc, it is important that the number of females be far more than males. This naturally ensures that the specie does not go extinct. The males in these species have more than one female partner (polygammy). This helps to increase numbers because not all females give birth the same way.

He always applogizes for not coming and says that he had an emergency trip. He surely knows that I want to go out with him but he has never asked me out.

20060826082126AAKh5tj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a really good friend that I care a lot about and she's a cutter. How do I help her?	She's been doing this for almost a year now. The first time she did it, I told her that she shouldn't have done what she did and that was the end of it. And then a few months later she looked depressed and when I asked what was wrong, she said "save/help me" on a piece of paper and made me swear not to scream or tell anyone. She tried to lie to me about it but I grabbed her wrist and she yelped. That morning when I went to school, I was shaken up and my friends were wondering what was wrong and why I couldn't tell them. Finally, during lunch me and my friend went to the media center and I told her how to find out for herself. After she found out we went to a teacher that we trusted a lot. Eventually, the counselor found out and notifyed her parents. She still does it and her parents aren't doing anything about it! I really want to help her but I don't know how. I've already had her call me when she feels the need to cut herself and try to write about her feelings, but they didn't work.

My boyfriend, whom I've had since fall 2003, has given me some mixed signals for a while now. I live in BK, he lives in Staten Island. For the past couple of months we haven't went out much, and the sex feel likes wham, bam, finished. He hasn't "eaten" me since the beginning of our relationship. We don't speak daily. I don't believe in cheating, but I've dated on the side and I haven't been swept off my feet. I don't wanna date another loser or lesbian - I wanna be with my baby. I told him I wanna break up cuz I can't tell if he's feeling me. This weekend we caught a movie, and today stop by to give me a little money. Do guys really leave you when they get tired? Cuz as far as I've seen men will keep you around and mess with someone else. I always say, leave me- don't cheat. Does he still want me or what? Fellas, help a girl out with this question,too!

I made a bad choice, but I had no ill intent of any kind. Months after he helped me, he contacted my employer and told them. I have been fired from my job, denied unemployment, don't have insurance. This person took everything he could from me because he "loved' me and I didn't love him. We were friends; he wanted more; I didn't. I never treated him badly or anything. He harassed me to the point I got a restraining order. I filed a grievance trying to get my job back-doesn't look good. My employer seems to be trying to screw me. What he told them was true, but his reasoning behind it was malicious. Do I have any legal recourse against him? I want him to understand the impact of what he did. My job was my passion.

I was with him for only 4 months but I really liked him loads, and I still do. It's been 6 months since we broke up, so I know it is really pathetic. I have had other boyfriends since but I still really like this guy. Before he split up with me everything seemed fine, the week before he told me how much he cared about me, brought me flowers over and chocolates etc. But then the next week he said he had been thinking and he didn't want a girlfriend? Now he won't hardly even speak to me and the last time I did talk to him was when I gave him and his friend a lift home after a night out and all he went on about was some girl he got with that night?! I'm confused!

20061130065555AAJyoZn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm having trouble talking to my crush! Help!?	I like this guy that I work with, but I'm getting really mixed messages. For example, I've noticed that he walks away whenever I walk up to wherever he happenes to be standing.. I thought he was quiet at work, but I came out of the break room early yesterday and he was standing with the other workers talking to them.. as I walked up, he walked away!   The few times I talk to him, he smiles and looks embarrased, but why does he walk away?   I'm getting mixed messages... For example - when I first come into work, he'll stop whatever he's doing and walk my way to say hello (though I've seen him do this for another girl, too)..  But whenever I go up to him to ask him a work related question, he'll answer me while walking away...  I've invited him out to hang out with us, and he smiled and said that I should give him more notice and that next time he'll come out with us.. Not a yes, but not a no..      what the hell is up with this guy? should I even bother persuing this?

When Jane initially met Tarzan in the jungle, she was attracted to him, and during her questions about his life , she asked him how he had sex ?        "Tarzan not know sex" he replied. Jane explained to him what sex was.        Tarzan said "Oh,....Tarzan use knot hole in trunk of tree."        Horrified Jane said, " Tarzan you have it all wrong, but I will show you how to do it properly."        She took off her clothing and laid down on the ground. "Here" she said, pointing to her privates, "you must put it in here."        Tarzan removed his loin cloth, showing Jane his considerable manhood, stepped closer to her and kicked her in the crotch!        Jane rolled around in agony for what seemed like an eternity. Eventually she managed to gasp for air and screamed "What did you do that for ?"        Tarzan replied, "Check for squirrel."

20061201104145AACavjO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She "dumped" me 7 days ago, I tried to explain/apologize then but have refrained from contact.  Wait longer?	It was mostly work related.  I had been under the gun working long hours....and her thing has always been "so what, everyone has issues, you make it work."  She says all of my actions point to not wanting her to be the one, and that it hurts her too much to make me her primary focus.  I apologized and tried to explain to no avail 7 days ago but have purposely let her be.  should i wait another few weeks to contact her.  i know the 30 day rule stuff...but still want to hear it outside of the "textbook"  There are no other women involved...none of that stuff.  just a demanding career with long hours and stress....but not THAT bad imo.  it's a competetive world, gotta do what you gotta do.

This is an obviously clean thinking middle class family. But theyre used to her behaving like this.       Is this passive aggression? Why? I cant quite put my finger on what her deal is.       Im trying to figure out if its tied in with her obsession with always wanting to be the one to end the conversation and leave, and her lack of response sometimes to things I say to her.       I cant understand. How do I get inside her head and understand what shes about?

20061213181110AAZdcni	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I find the real reason he's mad? and how do I fix it?	I've been with my boyfriend for 3 yrs. 2 1/2 of those committed. We've had our ups and downs but nothing we couldnt get past. Recently he started acting a lil funny so after numerous attempts to find out what was wrong he finally told me that he feels used. He thinks I only keep him around because he's my "meal ticket". He is the bread winner in our relationship, but he's always done for me without me ever having to ask. i really feel that this is coming from someone else or its covering another problem. He called me selfish, but i do all that i can for him. I actually spent over $1000 on christmas gifts that he dosent know about. Regardless i love him and i wanna be with him, so how do i resolve this?

20061203204409AA9qnRL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would like advice on getting over someone . . . . (long)?	When I was a graduate teaching assistant. I had an intense attraction to one of my students (I was 23, he was 21).       Despite an obvious mutual attraction, I never acted on it (except for harmless flirting outside of class). I didn't want to risk my career, and I didn't want jeopardize my relationship (which was doomed anyway).      I've since met the man I want to marry, but I can't stop thinking about this guy. I know it's a "what might have been" situation.       To be honest, all I want to do is have sex with him. There is NO emotional attachment whatsoever. He's just the most attractive man I've ever met that was actually attainable, and I'm curious what it'd be like to be with someone with whom you have insanely intense chemistry.      My question is . . . how do I get this guy out of my head? I NEVER want to cheat, so I have to get over him. At the same time, we had a lot in common, and I'd like to reconnect with him as friends. Is that even a good idea?      Thanks all. :)

Brian has a kid and the mother of the kid wouldn't let him see his child unless he moved out of his parents house. I understood that Sam wanted to help Brian so we let him move into a two bdrm apartment with us. I don't like Brian. In fact i can't stand him. I think he's immature and a dumbass. Sam feels the same way and has allowed me to express my dislike for Brian. But Sam and Brian have been best friends for 12 years and felt he needed to help him. So we are trying to stick it out 6 more months until the lease is up and tell Brian it's time for him to be on his own. Since Brian moved in 3 months ago he hasn't once cleaned his bathroom and hardly ever helps out around the house. He's actually become better at helping out by taking out BY TAKING OUT THE TRASH. I just don't know how much longer i can take it. Any suggestions to help me last. I try to remind myself its only 6 months

I've found things in him i've never found in anyone else, and he's everything i've ever wanted. I know if it's meant to be it will happen and if not it won't but it's weird because everyone tells me that he has feelings for me and he's just scared but he says he doesn't and he even tells me he is scared he's been on his own for so long and its hard for him to love when he's lost (both parents are descesed).

20061213142413AA1fkhZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Indian girls, if u had a choice, would u choose arranged marriage?	Arranged marriages are a norm in most of the Indian families where parents choose suitable partners for their children.       Women get the bad end of the deal coz not only dont they not know anything about the guy they marry, they have to give dowry, they are the ones who are expected to change, adjust, compromise, sacrifice according to their husband's desires.      So, girls, if u had the choice and ur parents would allow, would u choose arranged marriage or would u prefer to choose a person urself who is compatible and who u love, respect  for an equal partnership of life?
20061214185254AArmsig	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you contest DNA on a child you are paying support for in Indiana?	My husband was previously married and his ex-wife had an affair and told him he might not be the father..so they seperated.  She put his name on the birth certificate anyway.  Now his wages are being garnished for a child that is not his.  He has two other children by her that she has not allowed him to see.  He attempted to call and make arrangements with her for support or even just gifts but she refused and denied any contact on the court papers.  We can't afford an attorney...is there anything we can do to stop paying for her affair and have visitation with the other two?

It's been 6 months my girlfriend told me that she was lesbian and didn't want to be with me anymore even though she still loved me. I was desperately in love with her and then I decided to do something that maybe no other guy would ever do for a girl: I subjected myself to a surgery in Africa to change my sex and turn myself into a girl so she woud have no reason to leave me. Last month the whole process was completely done and I hadn't told her anything yet because I wanted to surprise her. However, when she saw me she said that all I did was for nothing because she doens't want to stay with me even after all I've done for her. She said she would never ask me to do such a thing and that I was looking like a monster for her. Now I just don't know what to do. I like girls and I don't know if I will ever find another girl who accepts me the way that I look now. The doctor told me

Well me and my friend want to set up some system of body language or code words that would help us out of akward situations we usually get it...   For example my friend wanted me to see where like guy she liked lived so we drove by and he was outside with his buddy so we couldn't really jsut keep going (we would look like stalkers lol) so we stopped and chatted a while, but it became akward because they were working on a car and there was really nothing for us all to talk about--we could've just said we had to go but the situation made it seem like it would be rude to say      So i'm wondering does anybody have any good ideas for little body languages or code words that mean certain things so that we (for example) know if we both want to leave someone's house without the that person/people knowing what we are talking about, but not jsut that but codes for other situations also      Please no dumb*s* answers really your just wasting your time.      Thanks!

He's black, and I'm Asian (Vietnamese, to be exact). He's very sophisticated, educated, and smart, and he has a good job. But I can't get my parents to like him.

20070422115855AAheoli	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I find it so difficult to find someone (a man) attractive? It comes along once in a blue moon...?	Does being so fussy mean that I won't meet someone for a while.  Even for a man to touch me, I have to have that strong chemistry or I feel repulsed.  I will usually come across a man that I find attractive every eight to twelve months. My friends can believe how picky I am.

20070418042323AAVFkz9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm the only one in the gang who's single. Anything wrong that I can do something about?	I'm finishing my 2nd year of college, and just coming out of my first relationship from which my love was unrequited(She dumped me). Of all my friends, I was the last to get into a relationship, and the first to get out of one. Now I'm the only one who's still single.      I was friends with my ex prior to the relationship, and we continue to be friends, in fact we are even closer, and it makes it difficult since I have to accept it most likely won't work out(though it may), and I'm still attracted. It's hard to get over her because all my other friends have become so absorbed in their own relationships that our friendships are becoming neglected, and my ex is the only one I am really exposed to. We hang out so much the general public believe us to be a couple despite the complete opposite.      Because of my situation I feel especially lonely. I'm having a hard time moving on, finding other women, and dealing with my friends. Any stories, personal experiences, and advice to help a guy out?

20070329191254AAzEFIe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why some of females chose to be the "secret lover" of the boss?	I have a colleague who is having "special relationship" with a foreign boss many years ago despite knowing the boss is having happy family with young kids. In securing the relationship, she has done many firings towards those who gossiped and threatened her career in the company via the boss. Till now, she has no friends and close colleagues. What she is having is a nice luxury car, condo, cash and a "created career" in the company with high attrition. Really do not know why she opted to live with the material by ignoring her soul and happiness? She is always living in hatred, jealousy and cunning situation. Will this also due to her own unhappy grown up by a divorced mother?

20070408160251AAQ0mPz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy help!!!!?	theres this guy in my math class, hes so hot.   on the first day of class he was called up to the board, he looked back at me, then that same day he went with me to go get a soda, he said wow its is really to get a soda after class. he used to sit beside me, but he moved to sit in front of me, probably to hear me better, he always stays after class with me and helps me with talking to the teacher, i mean he understands everything i say. i have trouble talking. and then last tuesday, he usually has a class after that, and that day his class was cancelled, and i was at the ATM machine, he looked at me like he was in love with me or something. he was shocked to find me there. and then not too long ago, i was sitting outside the food court and he passed by out of nowhere and smiled a little while he saw me. i could also sense tension between us. thats not too much info, but is there a possibility that he could like me? and i am having a party and inviting him, is that a good idea?
20070408201729AARP4pP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do?	When your bf can't date till he's a certain age because of his parents but, they just now brought this up & you've been dating for along time (like a year or two)? Oh, && he went behind thier backs a bunch of times already & such & such. He also dragged you into the picture & made you seem like a crappy gf. His parents already don't like you or so your brother says...but then again your brother hasn't been known to tell the truth when it comes to your friends or boyfriends. The only difference is you have gone threw alot with this guy & many people don't like him. Your parents have told you that if it wasn't okay with his parents it isn't okay with them. So i broke it off with him & the problem is: You both still like each other, occasionally kiss & the main problem is he won't stop taking you out to lunch & your parents found out & say that your going behind their backs as well as his parents because, going out to lunch is a date-like dating i guess. I respect my parents too! Advice?
20070410031227AAEWs0x	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I have a crush or is it more serious?	I have a girlfriend of five years and we're happy together, we dont row and we always said our future was together.  Last week a group of friends went out and most of us got pretty drunk.  I ended up sitting next to my best female friend and we started cuddling.  My girlfriend went home early and this girl and I couldn't keep our hands off each other - we didn't kiss and before anything more serious happened I said we couldn't.      But all this week I keep thinking about that night and the girl.  Is this just a crush that will pass?  We're all going out again on Saturday and I'm a little worried it will happen again.

She is on 2 of my classes and she is always with her friends. She isn'tmore popular than me, and she's very quiet. In class, she talks to her friends, but the teacher doesn't notice. She' s really nice. I wanna get to know her more, but i'm not really sure how to start talking to her. Don't tell me anything like "be yourself" or"tell her you relly want to get to know her". It doesn't work that way when your 14. I wouldn't be embarrased to be with her even though many people don't know her. I don't really know her. I know her name and who her friends are, and i've talked to her only twice(a littlw while ago).How should i start talking to her? Should i do it when her friends are around? We are going to different high schools next year and a i don't want to wait too long.

Anyways, he said ill call you when i get off, so i jokingly said are you really going to call, you always say that you are going to call and you call the next day. Then we got disconnected, either he hung up or my phone dropped, i don't know. so i tried calling him back twice and he didn't answer his phone, and i even text him, and he didnt even call me back when he said. i feel like he is ignoring me, what do i do?

20070422230642AAFcEll	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't tell if we're dating or not.?	We are old friends (but not close friends).  On our first "date" together, we caught up.  On our second "date", we had sex. On our third, he had a cold so I left early.  On our fourth, we held hands, made out for hours, but no sex.      Are we dating (despite my use of "date")? Also, this guy hardly contacts me. I am always the initiator I feel when it comes to communicating, unless it is a few days before an agreed "date".      I can't tell if he is interested in me as a person, or in sex.  He also rejected my offer to come over because he was busy with work, but offered to postpone the offer.        I don't want to feel (thank god I'm at least not acting) clingy, but I just need confirmation that he is interested and wants to pursue whatever this is.
