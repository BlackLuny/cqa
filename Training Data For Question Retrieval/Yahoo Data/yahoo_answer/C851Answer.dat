d8933d0b428012ff805f44f6da437b2baa	Under section 80, Indians can invest upto Rs 1 lakh in ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Scheme, also commonly known as Tax Saver schemes) funds per year/per individual. The amount invested in a ELSS/Tax Saver scheme is Tax deductible on your tax return.    E.g.,    Say you are a male and earned Rs 2 lakh. You invest Rs 1 lakh in a ELSS fund, such as HDFC Tax Saver fund.    Your taxable income in this case would be: Rs 2 lakh - Rs 1 lakh = Rs 1 lakh.    For a taxable income of Rs 1 lakh, there is ZERO tax.    Had you "NOT" invested in the HDFC Tax Saver fund, then your taxes are    Your taxable income in this case would be: Rs 2 lakh     For a taxable income of Rs 1 lakh, there is a tax of Rs 15,000/-.    Therefore, in this scenario, you save Rs 15,000/- in taxes by investing in a ELSS scheme.    Now, what is the catch for investing in a ELSS scheme.    (a) Your invested money is LOCKED for a period of 3 years. i.e., Once invested in a Tax Saver fund, your money cannot be taken out for a period of 3 years. But this is a blessing in disguise, because Tax Saver funds generally yield healthy returns during a 3 year period.    (b) Except for the Pension plan funds which usually locks the money until the age of 58 or so, all ELSS schemes invest upto a 100% in equities/stocks. Therefore, inherently investing in a ELSS is risky.    Comparing equity mutual fund and a tax saving one, I would say Tax saving funds generally perform better because there is less pressure on the Tax Saving fund manager to SELL during down markets for redemption to unit holders.     With plain vanilla Equity MFs you could buy them today and dispose of them tomorrow - i.e., there is no time limit for redemption, except for exit loads.  However with ELSS MF funds, there is a compulsory 3 YEAR lock in for Equity funds and a mandatory lock in up to the age of 58 years for Pension funds.    Contrary to the popular theories, ELSS funds also comprises of Pension fund, such as Franklin Pension, which does not invest more than 50 to 60% in equities.|`|f704ff62fb4b73e51fa7962a83d5ee50aa	ELSS is Equity Linked Savings Scheme, where invesor is eligible to get tax benefits U/s 80 C of Income Tax Act, 1961 upto Rs. 1 Lakh in a financial year. It has a lock in period of 3 years from the date of investment which is minimum among any tax saving instrument available in India & with the highest returns on investments. The fund manager selects value stocks to invest in ELSS which gives good returns in 3 years horizon.    Equity mutual fund schemes are an open ended equity funds where investor can invest any time & exit any time i.e. without any lock in period.|`|5080fef6add56abed9e3c16b62ebf1a5aa	All ELSS have the provision for invetment in equity to 100%. But it is not practicable to stay invested to 100% everytime. ELSS are pure equity schemes and provide you the tax benefits.

6743241b5aaa7f9777de7e002799bf2daa	I've been an RN for almost 16 years, hard to imagine.   There are some really good advantages to being a nurse.  You get paid well, usually.  There are many different fields in the nursing profession if you get bored with one or more of them.  You can be a regular med-surg floor nurse, surgical nurse, psychiatric nurse, doctor's office nurse.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.   You can get personal satisfaction when you see smiles from a sick child, when you get a heart-felt thank you from a special patient that you've nursed back to health.  You get quite a bit of respect from the outside world.  When you tell people that "I am an RN,"  they seem really impressed by that and want to know all about it.  ON THE FLIP SIDE-- you don't get much respect from the doctors.  I hear it is better in some states, but in my little backwards southern state that I live in, our surgeons still get away with throwing instruments across the room,  yelling at the nurses, cussing them out periodically.  In the psych field, you risk getting beat up or hurt some other way.  Family members are the most annoying.  They are always looking for your faults.  Being an ER nurse can be rough when you are taking care of legitimately sick people(heart attacks, children in respiratory distress, car accidents) while in the waiting room, it is full of people who have a headache or an ingrown toenail demanding to be seen immediately.  There, of course, is your personal health risk with HIV and all those diseases out there that you could get.  I don't want to turn you off to nursing, because there is a desperate need for nurses.  There is always a job opening.  I do want you to know that it can be an awesome job one day, then be as close to hell as you can get the next day.  It's fun, boring, happy, sad, easy, rough, all rolled into one.  I hope this helps a little in your decision.|`|31a5c439cd4f5852a70bf9d8ad0ed8d1aa	It really isn't that bad.  You have to realize the are many facets of nursing.  There's all the different specialty units in a hospital....take your choice.  There's clinic nursing.  There's school nursing.  There's industrial nursing.  Nursing homes, and the list goes on and on.  You do earn your money in some of these areas, such as med-surg and emergency (in most areas).  But where else can you get out of school almost guaranteed a job with pay starting out in the 30's average.  Of course there's better things but nursing isn't bad at all.|`|74ba5508047be767e73583893889bf71aa	Nursing student myself...wife has been a RN for going on 6 years now.     Know about 10 Nurses socially through her and all of them love their job. Only Nurses I have ever met or witness who were either bitter, hating their job, or crappy at it...were those who got into it for the wrong reasons.     So what is motivating you to be a RN? Is it for the money? If so, don't bother.     Like the poster before me mentioned, there are so many areas of nursing. Don't want to do bedside care? Work in the OR, or do dialysis. Like it fast paced? Go for the ER. Want a good slow paced easy job, do post-op. I litterally could go on all day listing the various opportunities available to a RN.     Also, chances are, if you've heard "soooo" many nurses say such bad things about the line of work...they are probably just moaning about their job. And hey, that's what everyone does :p

When you cash these checks it will take a couple of days to come back bad and by that time you have already sent them money via western union.  You are then out the full amount.  I received an email from them as well which is why I know the story behind it.  Do not respond to this email as you will lose your money.

The fraud can be based on a statement in writing that is (1) that is materially false; (2) respecting the debtor's condition; (3) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for such money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; and (4) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive.    If you did not have the intent to deceive, then you may be in the clear and the creditor has a very limited time after you file bankruptcy to file the proper objection with the bankruptcy court to try and stop your discharge.  I've been handling bankruptcy matters for 12 years or so and I've only seen a creditor do this one time.  You should talk to a local bankruptcy attorney, but what you describe sounds pretty innocent to me.

You could save yourself a lot of grief by listening to the advice of  vsjunk23        ABIDJAN, 1 Feb 2002 (IRIN) - The World Bank has resumed full economic cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire, the bank's office in Abidjan announced on Friday, one day after the country paid in full arrears amounting to FCFA 31 billion (US $44.5 million) that it owed the institution.    Mamadou Dia, head of operations in Abidjan, said at a news conference in the Ivorian commercial capital that the arrears were paid via a bridge financing that involved the Central Bank of West African States and the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements. The debt settlement will allow "the total resumption of disbursements for all of the World Bank's portfolios in Cote d'Ivoire totalling an as-yet undisbursed sum of FCFA 200 billions (about US $270 million)", Dia said. It will also permit the Ivorian government to benefit from new loans and credits, render the country eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative, and allow it to implement a multisectorial HIV/AIDS programme.    The World Bank stopped funding Cote d'Ivoire in October 2000 after the then military-led government failed to make payments for over 60 days on the arrears.    Friday's announcement is the latest indication of an improvement in relations between the country and international lenders, many of whom had severed ties with Abidjan in recent years.     The aid freeze, which started in 1998 when the European Union suspended disbursements following the embezzlement of some FCFA 18 billion (US $24.3 million), worsened in the aftermath of the December 1999 coup d'etat. Analysts agree that efforts toward socio-political and macroeconomic reforms, begun by the current government, are slowly paying off. The European Union is expected to resume full cooperation by the end of this quarter.|`|bcb66524b5827511cf2539b806585cfdaa	This is an old scam.

These companies often reside at the core of American business and boast pasts as colorful as any novel (the phrase blue chip, for example, comes from poker where the highest and most valuable playing chip is - you guessed it - blue). Yet the prosaic-ness attributed to them is certainly not deserved; there is nothing more exciting than making a profit and that is certainly what blue chips are all about.     The definition of a blue chip stock    The exact criteria used to classify a companys stock as a blue chip is relatively subjective.     The title rests upon numerous ambiguities (perhaps Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewarts famous definition applies to blue chip stocks as well as obscenity, I cant explain it but I know it when I see it). Most professional investors agree that blue chips share several important characteristics including:     An established record of stable earning power over several decades   An equally long record of uninterrupted dividend payments to common stock holders   A history of regular increases in the dividends payable to each share   Strong balance sheets with a moderate debt burden   High credit ratings in the bond and commercial paper markets   Large size relative to American businesses as a whole in terms of revenue and market capitalization   Diversified product lines (e.g., General Electric) and / or geographic location (e.g., Coca-Cola).   A competitive advantage in the market place due to cost efficiencies, franchise value or distribution control     The Dow Jones Industrial Average    These characteristics usually help blue chip companies maintain their leading industry positions. The moderate debt levels and excellent credit ratings allow them to borrow money at a lower cost than their competitors. Excellent market place reputation also results in higher sales; a consumer is more likely to purchase a brand with which he is familiar despite a slightly higher price tag.   Perhaps the most famous list of blue chip companies in the world is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This collection of thirty stocks is selected by the editors of the Wall Street Journal. The only requirement for inclusion in the index is industrial leadership. Despite this seemingly low-hurdle, each potential Dow component undergoes incredibly scrutiny, resulting in a list that stands as the most prestigious roster of blue chips in the world. The individual companies that make up the index are rarely changed; considering the inherent stability of blue chip stocks, this should come as little surprise.       Investing in blue chip stocks    There are several ways to invest in blue chip stocks. An investor can acquire shares directly through a broker, a direct stock purchase plan or a dividend reinvestment plan. He can also purchase a mutual fund that specializes in blue chip stocks. Perhaps the most effective way for the average investor to invest is to begin a dollar cost averaging plan into diamonds. Diamonds are an investment instrument traded on the American Stock Exchange; buy purchasing one share of a diamond, an investor is indirectly purchasing a fraction of each of the thirty components in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Diamonds are preferable over blue chip mutual funds because of their low expense ratio as well as tax efficiency; because they are traded on an exchange, the underlying shares are only sold to reflect a change in the companies making up the Dow, resulting in lower capital gains taxes|`|AA11103584	Those are traditionally the strongest companies on the New York Stock Exchange.

f0e39c9c8329c40944757ce9e4ce496eaa	I work for a UK based freight company, so hopefully I can help, although I only handle exports by air.    It is relatively straight forward. Air exports are determined by either weight or volume (ie how many kgs in terms of space it takes up within an aircraft hold). Whatever is the greater you get billed on. So if you have something that only weighs 20kgs, but it volumes to 130kgs, you will get invoiced based on 130kgs.     Volume is determined by  Length x Width x Height divided by 6000.     Pricing is based on the weight, so for example you will get cheaper rate per kilo if you send more weight.    Certain commodites (the goods you are sending) maybe require special packing (hazardous material), or special documentation to either export, or import, from/to a country. This information can be found out by contacting a freight forwarder.    Most countries require you just to complete an invoice detailing what goods you are sending, the quantity the name/address of the person/company you are sending them to, the value, country of origin of manufacture. This is necessary to ensure your shipment can be customs cleared both on export & upon arrival at their destination.    I hope this information is what you are looking, & has been of some help to you.|`|d3d69637d8e42f368f151cf35433f87aaa	swallow the balloon to import....to export---try taco bell.
daa37892e21bba9509b61c3b18f4a9baaa	Dr Pepper is the oldest major soft drink in America.    Originally made in Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas, the drink's unique flavor was a hit when it was first sold in 1885. Wade Morrison, the drug store owner, named it 'Dr. Pepper' after Dr. Charles Pepper, a Virginia doctor who was a father of a girl Morrison was once in love with. (The period after Dr was dropped in the 1950s.)    Dr Pepper was introduced to millions of visitors at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, where it was an instant success. Other major food products introduced at the exposition included the ice cream cone, hot dog rolls and hamburger buns.    Following this debut, Dr Pepper grew to be one of America's biggest refreshment treats.    In 1986 the Dr Pepper company merged with the Seven Up Company to form Dr Pepper/ Seven-Up, Inc which was later acquired, in 1995, by Cadbury Schweppes plc. It would become the largest operating division of the non-cola beverages firm,    Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.    Still one of the world's favorite soft drinks, Dr Pepper has always remained original, showing its appreciation and commitment to diversity by sponsoring multicultural programs.

Les dossiers peuvent galement tre retirs auprs de l'organisme public qui passe le march.    Le candidat doit veiller scrupuleusement  ne rien oublier au risque de voir sa candidature rejete.

Dans les deux cas, elle doit tre re?ue par l'organisme public avant la date et heure annonces dans l'appel public. Le pli cachet enferme deux enveloppes : " la premire enveloppe " contenant les documents relatifs  la prsentation du candidat et " la deuxime enveloppe " contenant le dtail de l'offre.

What you do if you are starting a business flipping homes, is to go to the proper parties within the state, county, and community in which you are interested, and secure ALL of the laws, by-laws, building and electrical codes, water codes, etc.  You need to begin by doing that before you ever flip your first house!|`|AA10074148	There are several things you need to know when flipping properties.    First of all you  should go to the nearest book store, purchase several books on buying, fixing and flipping properties. There are several that you might be interested in.    Once or while you are doing this you should buy one of the TV guru's distressed property programs. These programs will give you some legal forms you might use when writing an offer to purchase a property. You will also find several scripts to use in taking to your potential clients.  The also give you tips and a formula on how to figure if you have a property that you can make money from before buying.     Now you have to determine how you are gonna market yourself to get.      1 You can advertise in your local paper that you are in the business of purchasing foreclosures.     2 You can do a direct mail to people in your city stating that you are now in the foreclosure business.      3 You can select an area of your city that you want to work and target your that area with your energy.  You can walk the area pass out flyers that you are now in the business of buying property distressed, divorced and foreclosures as well as probate property.    Pass out these flyers for at least 2-3 months after which you should go to a newsletter of some sort while still explaining that you purchase properties.    The law you are speaking of is Internal Revenue Code 21 and that pertains to a person or persons that live in their homes a total of 24 months or 24 months in the last five years get a tax break or $250.000 if single and $500,000 if married when they file thier income tax returns.

You will be taxed on any profit you make above the purchase price.  In my area if you sell in less than a year you are taxed at your income tax rate...if over a year than at 15%.

5e438ace7e9033760de5baf608b100beaa	Yes sir, try using some of your more "local" schools, small schools where the kids only care about graduating, not looking good.  Maybe community colleges or technical/business schools.  They are usually required to do an internship, but because of where they go to school its not like they are going to get on with Emory and Young, or Dean Witter.  They just need something to get them a good grade.  Promise them they will have fun and you will give them a good referrence as long as they give you a little bit of hard work and a positive attitude.  Call one of the business departments at one of these schools and state that you specifically want an intern because of the nature of the product you offer and how the internship experience would allow the student to have a direct impact on the finished product, providing them a fruitful and meaningful business experience that they can carry with them in the real world.  You are looking for a junior partner, not a paper shredder.    These business school types will eat that up.    Good Luck|`|cd3db14d1e54f8f56d160141b3b7357baa	I don't see why not.

5e438ace7e9033760de5baf608b100beaa	Yeah, I tried the carlton sheets one, it actually worked out ok.  You see though, it was something I wanted to do anyways but I just needed some structure, so they really just taught me a few tricks (most are obvious, there is no magic formula) and provided a great real estate forms and calculator cd.  All in all, I still consult the books and videos they provided, and most of all, it gives me motivation, if the schmucks on those videos can do it, I can do it.  And he is not lying, you can buy with no down payment, but his schemes to get around doing it without credit would probably only work in a major real estate market that is buyer friendly, like the market is now.  It involves alot of owner financing and stuff like that.  Most people I deal with wont do an owner finance, but its not a problem for me, I just go to the bank for the loan.  The thing that helped me was creative ways of getting the down payment.      The only downside, they freakin hound you to death about buying more of their products.  I finally told them to never call me again.  Good course though.|`|8d63e62cc2d7ea7b33f1a9be855e52d6aa	SCAM !!!!!|`|AA11332816	He's completely right.

The secret to it is just listen to what they have done on the course and apply it for yourself.     I had a little advantage than most because i do loans for mortgages and know a few Realtors. I would be glad to help you get started and if you ever need a loan or anyone you know, feel free to ask.     That's why I'm here.

This is a shocker to many people, because we are taught to believe that if we want a loan, we go to a bank.  But banks don't issue loans and there is no asterisk on that sentence.  Banks are prohibited from loaning their customer's assets because that would violate General Accounting principles.  They are prohibited from loaning their own assets because that would violate Federal Reserve Regulations.  What's left?  Nothing.  Banks don't issue loans.         What happens is when you leave the bank with a credit card application or another type of co-called loan application, you are actually giving the bank your promise to pay them with your signature on it.  It could be on a piece of toilet paper.  It is a promissory note that the bank cashes, and in a simple example, gives you a check of equal value in return.  They don't disclose that there wasn't really any loan or any risk or collateral on their part and that they merely paid a clerk $12 an hour or so to make an entry in a computer.  [This is what causes inflation because the so-called money is created out of thin air.]  Then they (the banks) violate usury and racketeering laws all day every day by charging you principle and interest on the fictitious "loan".         One way to terminate this unsecured debt, without bankruptcy, is:  when your STRAWMAN gets the bill, send in a minimum payment with a cover letter that says at the top "Notice of Final Payment".  In this half a page cover letter, make a formal request in commerce, that they (the so-called creditor) answer your question, and your question is where was the risk or the collateral for that so-called loan.         Well, again, there was no loan; there was no risk, and there was no collateral.  They can't answer that question, and you end up creating a new contract in which your STRAWMAN doesn't owe them anything anymore that replaces the old contract in which your STRAWMAN might have owed them thousands of dollars.  This new contract is called a novation.    TO FURTHER RESEARCH  THE TERM "STRAWMAN" follow links given in sources|`|AA10238876	None.

Answer to this question will determine the fate of millions of youngsters in India who opt call center jobs as their career.     Highlighting The advantage of the BPO, and its bright side is the easy task..........What is tough is the MAIN THREAT to it right now === The arrest of Nadeem Kashmiri in the HSBC call center fraud has raised a big question mark on the reliability and security of Indian BPO industry. In the past couple of years, several cases of data fraud have been reported in call center facilities in Pune, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Bangalore.    Such incidents are bound to affect the booming BPO industry in India. Experts believe that cases of security breach in India are minimal as compared to that abroad. However, here the question is why should not we provide hundred percent secure services to our foreign clients who heavily rely on us for the efficiency and effectiveness of their processes?    Now lets look at the brights side:  The future for the IT/BP industry holds bright. It is estimated that 56% of the BPO market could be India's by the year 2006 with the demand for BPO services increasing at an annual growth rate of 50 per cent during 2004-06. The pace at which the Indian BPO market is increasing is tremendous. The market of BPO in India is likely to be around $9-12 billion by the year 2006 and will employ around 0.4 million people. The BPO market is ready to fire up and India Inc is all geared for this big opportunity.       If you do a Google search with "future of bpo in india", you will get 824,000 pages. The first page itself will give you good insight on the future.    My take - the future is as secure as Air Force One. This is one sector, one industry that is taking its wings. Its on its way to fly.

In the U.S., companies and stocks are often categorized by the following approximate market capitalization values:    Small-cap: market cap below US$1 billion   Mid-cap: market cap between US$1 billion and US$5 billion   Large-cap: market cap exceeds US$5 billion   The small-cap definition is far more controversial than those for the mid-cap and large-cap classes. Typical values for the ranges are enumerated here:    Micro-cap: market cap under US$100 million   Nano-cap: market cap under US$50 million   Blue chip is sometimes used as a synonym for a large-cap, while some investors consider any micro-cap or nano-cap issue to be a penny stock, regardless of share price.|`|zqU7lCPyaa	NSE defines mid cap universe as stocks whose average six month's market capitalization is between Rs 75 Crore and Rs 750 Crore

061af023b1c6c2ec59462727d60795f3aa	It can be very difficult for immigrants to Canada to find work that suits their professional qualifications. In addition, Newfoundland has for a long time been one of the poorest Canadian provinces where it is difficult for even Canadian citizens to find employment.    It is likely that you would need to look for work that has nothing to do with public administration. Employment in the provincial or federal civil service often requires that employees be citizens or permanent residents.     This does not mean that your background will not help you. You can use it to find people who may help you with opportunities.     Here are several people who may help you:    The Institute of Public Administration of Canada has a branch in Newfoundland. The Chairman of the branch is Mr. Mark Butler. He is also Executive Director of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. You can e-mail him at: mbutler@acoa-apeca.gc.ca, or phone him at 1 (709) 772-2781, and ask to discuss opportunities in Newfoundland.     You may wish to propose a collaborative work project that involves sharing your international expertise with public officials in Newfoundland, and using Newfoundlander's expertise to help officials in your own country. This proposal will require work on your part, and will likely be received well in Newfoundland.     Mr. John Cummings, QC. He is James G. Channing Chair in Public Administration at Memorial University. He is also a St. John's lawyer and high-ranking civil servant. Speak to the Political Science Department to contact him. Peter Boswell is the Interim Head of the Political Science Department. Telephone him at (709) 737 8179, or Email pboswell@mun.ca.    Do NOT ask these men for a job. Do NOT ask them about immigration issues. Ask them for advice about how you can find a job in Newfoundland that would use your qualifications.

6b04ad334a89c6233aa6784d749ba30eaa	Not sure where you live, but this is helpful for Canada:  http://www.tarion.com/home/    Here is a general guideline:  http://www.ourfamilyplace.com/homebuyer/...|`|1ea6d812ee8de85976aa3f197388a76aaa	If you have a good realtor, they should be able to guide you systematically through this process and answer ALL your questions - and maybe even provide you with a list of questions you should know the answers to.  More importantly, a good realtor should be able to advise you on that particular townhouse development and make sure you are buying at or below market rate.      I would talk to SEVERAL realtors before choosing one and have THEM educate you on this project and see what, if any, alternatives they would propose.      In many new communities, the developer has special ties to a particular finance company that will provide very good rates - just seems to be some unwritten rule about back-scratching.  Still, talk with a mortgage broker or two as well - any realtor will be able to refer you to several good ones.    A real estate attorney is always a good idea as well.    If people already live in the community, I would try to talk with them to see what they did and see if they are happy with the builder and the community.    Regards,    Joe...

They will tell you pretty quickly so you know how much you can afford to spend.|`|wwJYCkY6aa	CAUTION:   Many lenders have a "generic" pre-approved or pre-qualified letter.  Usually when you submit these items, the lender is going to give you a pre-QUALIFICATION letter.  This is not the same as a pre-APPROVAL letter.  Look at the letter they provided to you and see what it says.  The generic letters say something like "subject to appraisal and verification of funds to close."  Well, if there are any "subject to" items, it is not a true pre-approval letter.  In other words, if you are being told you are approved but they still need some 'stuff', then you are not fully approved.  The best thing you can do is be smart and tell the lender that you want to see the 'conditions list' from the underwriter.  Make sure you get the list from the underwriter and NOT the loan officer.  The loan officer will give you a list that will be reduced to consumer issues only.  The underwriter will give a complete list of every outstanding condition.  Granted some of them will be the loan officers responsiblity, the escrow company's responsiblity, other entity's responsibity and things that are your responsiblity.  You can't control all of them  but it will put you in a position of power so that you know exactly who has to do what.  By the way, loan officers hate it when you ask for the conditions list.  It does cause extra work for them but too bad.  Make them do it.  While loan officers do loans on a regular basis and it's nothing new to them, it's not their future that is at stake. They get your deal done and move on to the next one. You might do this only a few times in your life.  Do it right and be smart.  Hope this helps.

Roth IRA's grow tax free, that means when you take the money out at retirement, you dont have to pay taxes on it, unlike a traditional IRA.     I would suggest going to Dave Ramsey's website, and looking for the ELP section. This will set you up with a financial counselor that will help you map everything out and point you in the right direction. Good luck.|`|zqU7lCPyaa	Good.. you have started planning for the future.    Put in Rs 7000 in a good ELSS like HDFC Taxsaver, Sundaram Taxsaver & Magnum Taxgain.  Better split the amount between the three funds to spread the risk.  Invest in these funds thro systematic investment plan (just like a recurring deposit).  These funds have a lock in period of three years.  You will save tax to the full possible extend considering that you are already inveting 24000 in insurance.   ELSS can safely give you a return of 15%.  If you are lucky you may get much more than that.  That depends on the market conditions. (OK there is a risk involved the market can tank and you can loose out - but then there is no gain without pain).  You will easily achieve your target in around 6 years time.

fTxESltmaa	Best advice...get an accountant.  That way your taxes will be done properly, you will get all of your deductions, and you will have someone backing you up in case of an audit.

Get the following forms from www.irs.gov : Schedule C, Schedule C-EZ,  Schedule SE and 1040-ES.  Also get the IRS guide to small businesses.    Depending on how much business you did, you use Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ.  You take you total revenue, deduct various business costs, and then carry your "profit" over to your 1040.    Schedule SE is for your FICA taxes.  You have to pay both halfs, employee and employer.    Also, if you have any real income, you should be making quarterly estimated tax payments (the government wants it's money as the year goes by, not in one lump at the end).  1040-ES is for that.  It has a worksheet to estimate what you should pay each quarter.|`|51153b309bbafe27f4c46f024e12ade3aa	you fill out one simple form. not sure what's so complicated about that... did you even try researching this online?|`|50054c474938470d8f949d36fbee2119aa	http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/arti...|`|c3GOiGdBaa	It's really not complicated.

Se entro 10 anni non si manifesta l' accettazione si perde ogni diritto sull' asse ereditario, che si devolve secondo le regole stabilite per legge.  Lo stabilisce l' art.480 del codice civile.  Il diritto di accettare l' eredit si prescrive in dieci anni. Il termine decorre da giorno dell' apertura della successione  La data di apertura della successione corrisponde alla data di morte del de cuius.  Ci sono delle eccezioni per. Ad esempio chiunque ne abbia interesse pu chiedere all' autorit giudiziaria il restringimento dei tempi. Quindi  consigliabile informarsi sulle intenzioni dei vari eredi per non trovarsi impreparati.

Remember, most businesses are registered to business in a state where they operate, sell, have employees or hold inventory.

My decision was solidified really by all of the people that I have helped (or received assistance for).  I just always figured that if I was a doctor I could do more.  I'm currently in medical school, so after I finish my residency, I plan on registering so that I will be able to provide aid in case of a national crisis (when I was younger I just thought any doctor could just go up and provide services when faced with disasters like 9/11 and Katrina, but I recently learned that you actually have to be registered in order to provide aid).  Although I pray that we don't encounter horrific events like this again, just in case we do I'll be ready to help.
q69toTDxaa	Basically, there are two paths for a massage therapist careers -- private practice or employee. Different massage therapy jobs exists; typical they are divided into two categories: location/setting and type of massage administered. Spa type jobs are typically found in resorts, salons, vacation destinations, day spas and hotels. Therapeutic massage jobs are usually found in hospitals, private homes, corporate settings, rehabilitation center and elder care faculties.     If you decide to enter this career, make sure you take good body mechanics classes.  This will extend your life as a therapist.  Massage can also include alternative modalities (acupuncture, body wraps, reiki) and body treatments.      Decide your path and pursue it.  you may want to extend into Management as a Spa Director, Fitness as a personal trainer, nutrition as a nutritionist or be a holistic practitioner.  Follow your passion and you will be successful.|`|AA11149006	cruise ships, working with business clients--many businesses hire massage therapists to give their workers a little bonus during the working day.

You can make $30-70 per hour and find a few clients per week, that would be fine. Making a living doing massage is possible, but it wears you down physically and emotionally. There are many career therapists but massage is a profession with a high turnover.    I did massage while in school and could make good money without having to put in 20-30 hours on a job.    Pretty soon every hospital in America will have professional massage therapists on staff. This will help the sick people and also help to legitimize our profession.

When a gift card is purchased, it comes with account disclosures that contain the rules and regulations associated with that card.  These disclosures should tell you if it can be reloaded.  Some cards, perhaps purchased by others as a gift, are one time cards and have to be discarded when the balance reaches "0".

4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	I am both an evangelical christian, and a distributor in a MLM business.  Both CAN be offensive to people for the same reason.  Both are supposed to be OFFERED to people, not forced upon them.    In the Bible, there's a parable found in Matthew 13 that all Christians and distributors in MLM companies need to read, learn and practice.  It's the parable of the sower and the seed.  The seed is good.  Not everyone wants it.  It is not within my power to make them want it.  In Christianity, only the holy spirit can convict a person and cause them to be ready to receive Christ - when we accept that, we do not push Christianity on anyone, but offer it to everyone.    In MLM (or Network Marketing) we need to realize that as far as recruiting is concerned, we are in the sifting business, not the convincing business.  We offer the opportunity to all, but not all are in the right life situation to either recognize it, or want it.  We simply need to leave these people with knowing that the door is always open for them if their situation changes.  Besides, the people who get "convinced" to join do not succeed, and so neither will the one who sponsors by that manner.  For a high retention rate, only sponsor people who are ready to start a business.|`|fTxESltmaa	Because MLM's are usually scams that screw people over.|`|t3DBHxt9aa	you're right.    you've got to have a    (.ws)  FREE!|`|UFmGsSreaa	It's only offensive to the uninformed.

AA12068719	In theory, assuming there is no expiration date printed on the check, it's good forever, but have fun trying to cash it after a year.  Most tellers won't notice the date if it's four or five months.  In ALL cases (with an exception coming) the check is legal tender and negotiable, so even if it says 90 days and it's been 120, it can be cashed.  You just may need to get someone from the issuing company on the phone to "sign-off" on it, which can be a headache.  Otherwise the issuer will have to void/reissue a new check.  The exception: when it's really old.  Each state has escheatment laws which basically state that all unclaimed property, including uncashed checks, become the property of the state after a certain period of time.  This is measured state by state and is measured in years, but if the check has been escheated (the unclaimed/cashed money was sent to the state), then you have to file a claim with the state in order tio get your money.|`|80330091cdfc005f951a0282145830b8aa	It usually states it on the check.

fTxESltmaa	Unless you are really desperate to sell avoid these types of home buyers...you will end up sacrificing a lot of your equity for a quick sale.  If you can try to list with a top real estate company and price below the market.  Offer incentives to the buyer for a quick sale like a closing cost credit.  Otherwise quick sale investors will probably just take advantage of your situation.  Good luck!|`|1a348ab0340b840f21ab2784d4cc3657aa	1. You can lease your house out with an option to buy. The new tenants must pay you an option fee and you can also request that they pay for any home repairs for the first $500. This will insure they will take good care of the property. Advertise it as "rent to own' because some people do not understand lease options.    2. You could contact some mortgage note buyers and see who buys new notes. Then you offer 100 % seller financing to potential buyers. Then you create a mortgage note with the new buyer and sell it to the mortgage note buying company and you are totally cashed out.
fTxESltmaa	Buy your property...for a loan that small you probably wouldn't be spending more than 10k a year on a mortgage.  Plus when you are finished with your program...you can sell your place and make money with appreciation.  Also the interest you pay on your mortgage will be tax deductible.  Good luck and it sounds like your doing great!|`|gTFQsIsgaa	On the rent vs buy question: given the financial ability Buying is ALWAYS better.  In your situation, you may want to consider buying a multi-family property and occupy one unit. Consider renting the other side to a Grad student to help you pay off your mortgage.  Over time, you'll build an equity position that you can use to buy a home or to use a 1031 exchange to trade your property for a better one.  If you follow this advice, you'll be in a position to create real wealth for yourself instead of giving that opportunity to a landlord.|`|AA11387869	Normally, I'd say rent--but if you're going to be there for 5-1/2 years, and the mortgage is not much more than the rent there, you might as well buy it.

When buying a home or thinking about buying a home you want to look at one thing, Rent vs Mortgage payment.     If you can get a mortgage payment for less or equal to what rent costs in the area then buying a home would be best. If renting an apartment is cheaper by a lot then you want to rent.    If you can afford to own a home then that would be great for you and as an investment.

AA10460629	The chapter 7 trustee can go after your assets until he files a no-asset report.  And  your discharge can be revoked if your schedules were erroneous and you knew it.

AA11585947	Just try to apply for a fixed rate loan with a lender, thats the best way to find out if you're qualified.    Most adjustable loans have annual caps on the increase.  So even if the indexed rate on your loan were 15% this year, it would only be able to go up 2% or so from what it was the previous year.  Contact your current mortgage servicer to find out what your new rate will be.|`|dc9a5eaac3799eaa0724745eba945ec5aa	If your rate is 6.35% then YES it could double but it all depends on the details of the mortgage.    My guess is that your are looking at probably a $3000 payment.  Some of the bad choices you made in 1999-2001 will already be off your report.  You can dispute any claims on your report and they credit agency has 30 days to verify that the claim is accurate.  This might help with some accounts but don't count on it.  Make sure to check out all 3 credit reports.  You can do this for free once each year at www.annualcreditreport.com (it's free by Federal law - there is no catch).    You will also need to have some equity built up.  Did you put a down payment on the house?  Has the value of your home increased?    Personally, I would recommend checking out a fixed rate refi sooner rather than later.  If you are denied they will tell you why and you will be better able to plan your next move.  Better to pay 7% or even 8% now than 12% or 14% in Sept.    Good luck.|`|2a49658683952d2886d8e1da6c0c6306aa	Don't panic If you are paying off your credit cards that in turn will increase your scores. However, I would not recommend waiting until September to look around rates are reasonable now. Even with a mid score of 600 hypothetically,assuming you can document your income and your loan to value is around 80% or less you could get a fixed rate 40 yr loan around 6.5 to 6.75.

I was once a teacher and I noticed that starting a small business is a lot like the preparation a teacher does for a school day. Three things that you should consider before you start:  1. Create a business plan: It is very important that you have a plan of what you want to provide to your clients, what your financial projections are and how you are going to get there. Your plan will never be finished because you will continually change aspects of your company in order to make your business successful. There are tons of software that creates business plans for you with samples and templates. Check out Business Plan Pro.     2.  Speak with a business advisor.  Consider your business advisor like a counselor. This is the person that will help to guide you through a lot of the legal aspects of creating a small business like tax ID  numbers, business attorneys, accountants, etc. Check your local Small Business Assocation (SBA) for business advisors to help you get your business off the ground.     3. Of course last but not least, consider incorporation. Research and have clear knowledge of all the benefits and drawbacks of sole-proprietorship as oppose to incorporation. I know that sole-proprietorship sounds enticing because it is quick and easy. However, research everything before making desicions. I know that with sole-proprietorships that your name is on the line when it comes to your company. If something bad happens with your company (God forbid), it directly attacks you; not your company.     I hope this information helps you. Remember these three things and also that preparation and planning is key and I am sure you will be successful. Check the link below for further information on starting a small business. I was helpful for me.

I was very much welcomed for my teaching, and I made friends that I will never forget -- both among my fellow volunteers, and among the people of Tanzania.     What Peace Corps requires is that you have a skill you can use in volunteering. What have you done with your life so far? Do you know anything about health? Anything about agriculture, carpentry, or another skill with your hands?  Do you have experience in teaching, or a degree in science or math?      It is most definitely an experience worth having! It gave me two years' experience in teaching, with ESL experience that helped me to get a job teaching at a good private school. Beyond the gain back at home, I was able to show some of my family the country (a visit from home) and I was able to make a difference in the lives of many students and a large number of friends from every country in the world. If you have the freedom to spend two years away from the States, you should definitely volunteer!     The Peace Corps is for US citizens only and is therefore more careful with its volunteers than many organizations. As a fellow volunteer stated, the organization is perfect for someone who has never left the country before. There are many weeks of training, and the volunteers are assigned "homestay families" who are also coached in the safety and teaching of their volunteer. Some of our volunteers who had experience outside the country found their extra care tiresome, but it does mean that the volunteers are safe.    Peace Corps does not have an active program in any country that is volitile, and if an area becomes volitile they will evacuate the volunteers. There are drills and plans to follow for each volunteer so that they know their role in such a situation.     That said, you may also want to check in the VSO or Volunteer Services Organization. If you join Peace Corps, you may choose a region of the world -- such as South America or Sub-Saharan Africa.     With the Peace Corps, there are contacts in every town and the people in your village have all necessary contact information with headquarters should they be needed. They also provide free medical care at the headquarters. If there is any danger by terrorists or civil unrest, they will bring you to headquarters and, if necessary, help you all to evacuate.       The "food allowance" is about the same as your "Host Country National" counterparts, housing is provided, and they give you language training and a "counterpart" or helpful local resident to help orient you.  The "food allowance" depends on the country you are assigned to, but it is usually about $150 - $300 a month -- more than enough to buy your food in a country where basic groceries cost about $50 a month!     You really should look into it and see if you would like to join; it is most definitely an experience worth having. You can contact me also, if you have questions. You have plenty of time to research it.    And yes, the volunteers made a tangible difference in their communities and the ones nearby. There are environmental volunteers (digging wells, teaching agriculture, teaching sanitation), health volunteers (teaching both in schools and in communities, including HIV/AIDS education), and education volunteers (teaching primarily in schools, science and math subjects).     There are also NGO's (Non-Governmental Organizations) in many countries, which can give you a long-term or even a permanent position.   They work with more specific issues, such as AIDS education, literacy in general, or religious education.      Try looking into things!  You have Americorps, Peace Corps, VSO, Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, Caretakers of the Environment, and NGO's. Most of these will give a (small) food allowance for your help.     If you have other questions, let me know! If you have experience with the Spanish language, there is a very good chance that they would accept you for the Western Hemisphere assignments, and there are many more environmental needs there. Depending on what your abilities are with other areas, fluency in Spanish alone can be a useful qualification.  Fluency in French can be a benefit in gaining an assignment  in Western Africa.  Just FYI!|`|aad1a4af73e641a005a5cf6207ea13eaaa	An online application is here:    https://www.peacecorps.gov/apply/now/ind...

They do prefer a college graduate, but it's not a requirement.  Just do a search on peace corp, you'll easily get to their homepage.  This is a very well recommended service organization, and your experience, though tough, will be memorable,and you'll come away with very valuable firends from cross sections, including the very infuential ones.  Med-schools and law-schools love to see this on an applicant's resume.|`|9b2344637d9e97dd424becec118e4234aa	Peace CORPS. Learn to spell, dammit. It is a proud organization, like the Marine Corps. It takes fewer people than the Marine Corps. It takes smarter people than the Marine Corps. However, PCV's never have to kill enemy sentries silently, and their shoes don't have to be shiny. "Dress Blues" for a PCV is a blue shirt that doesn't have too many holes in it, shorts with plenty of pockets and comfortable sandals.    Complete info:  http://www.peacecorps.gov/  Be warned - they only take one out of 10 applicants. Good intentions are not enough. You have to have a skill someone in a host country has asked for. 95% of PCV's have a college degree. The other 5% are very, very experienced.

I have also had the same experience.There were attractive advertisement about providing dataaa entry typing,proof reading and such home work for which we have to pay some upfront After this was dne the parties appeared to have had a sudden summer and mellted away.     There are a number of self-employing business one can do with a little or no appreciable investment. One is providing tiffins to office goers. There is a keen need of this service especially inmetropolitan cities.If you can ensure supply of simple but wholesome and clean food, believe me, you will have soon to seek help. If this catches up you may open a supplement service of providing breakfast packets.Like tiffin this is also a much felt need and in the absence of a good service the office goers have to perforce resort to hotels and you know very well what the conditions there are.The breakfast packets can be reached home or distributed from your place. The third step you can take is opening a small eatry where hot,delicious breakfast is available It need not be a very sophisticated establishment. The customers who are mostly middle class do not mind the domestic environment and even fetch water for themseves and friends.

AA10686104	if the money taken out of your account was to purchase stocks, and you haven't sold them, then yes, you should be able to claim them. you made need your certificates, if you were given one...you should also have the amounts of money deducted for stocks on your paystubs...may want to contact a legal advisor or your state's attorney general's office on what recourse you have...but the direct approach may be the simplest...try contacting walmart to see what help they can give you on finding out how much you actually have, and how to sell it...they probably don't want any more legal trouble or bad rep than they have been getting, so they may make it very easy for you; good luck!

Job postings at websites like Monster, Yahoo HotJobs and Careerbuilder carry information about salaries.  The Govt Dept of  Labor, (www.bls.gov) Bureau of statistics has information about median salaries for different professions and details of additional compensation offered. Other online resources are salary.com and payscale. Your salary will also depend on  your educational qualification and how you handle your career.

glI4M6Qmaa	Antes que nada, recurre a la investigacin de mercado. Esto es, por medio de encuestas vas preguntar a las personas de la zona lo siguiente: Si fueran a establecer un nuevo negocio en la zona de que tipo te gustara: negocio de venta de ropas ( para mujeres, hombres o ni?os ); negocio de comidas, negocios de artculos para el hogar, etc. Haz una lista de posibles cosas que puedan necesitar las personas y que todava no la ofrezcan. A veces preguntando se conoce que podra ser conveniente para uno.    Sin embargo, coincidiendo con la opinin de algunas personas aqu, puedes intentar establecer un negocio dirigido a la comida. Te puedo decir, que cuando hay recesin, la gente deja de comprar autos, casas, joyas, ropa de marca, etc, sin embargo, adems  de hacer la compra de comida del hogar, separan dinero para comer afuera. As que ese tipo de negocios siempre tiene demanda.    Averigua, si decides dirigirte al negocio de las comidas, qu tipo de negocio vendra bien en la zona. Puede ser un establecimiento de comidas rpidas donde se sirva emparedados ( sandwiches ), bebidas ligeras, postres, etc ; un establecimiento del tipo naturista o un restaurante familiar en combinacin con un pub; osea, por las tardes y temprano en la noche, ambienta el local para tener de clientes a mujeres, ni?os, abuelos, etc y ms tarde en la noche abres la parte donde sirvan bebidas, se escuche msica y la gente pueda conversar y compartir animadamente.    Sin embargo, no importa que decidas hacer, edcate, lee sobre temas que te ayudarn a manejar efectivamente el negocio, cmo promocionarlo, atraer clientes, fidelizarlos y por consiguiente tener xito. Comenzar un negocio no es tn fcil como parece y para triunfar se necesita conocimientos, perseverancia, disciplina, y organizacin.

AA12397330	Multi Level Marketing (or MLM as it is commonly known) is a marketing system or methodology by which people can promote, sell and distribute products. There are of course lots of other systems that have been around longer and thus are more accepted by the public.    Examples of previously radical marketing systems and methodologies are fixed pricing (there was a time where every single item was subject to negotiation) and franchising (there was a time that congress almost declared this system illegal).    So MLM is simply that, a system to sell stuff. What went wrong is, certain parties used an unfamiliar system to most people to sell stuff other people don't need, or are not meant to own. It happened before and it will happen again.    Actually if it wasn't for the bad rap on MLM its a pretty good way to sell your products with minimal advertising. It uses the power of familiar faces and the need of almost everyone to make a little extra money.    Having said that, there are some MLM practices that should be simply avoided. There are those that you make money simply by inviting people, and you get your commission from the initial membership fees which are used to claim products. In this case nothing is really sold, except memberships. This is more like pyramiding, which is illegal, but nonetheless it is still a form of MLM.    Check out MLM, you've got nothing to loose. You might learn a few things. You might find out you have a talent for selling. You might find out it's not for you. Either way its a positive outcome.    Just be careful when your sponsor or his boss starts telling you that it's really EASY and you DONT HAVE TO SELL ANYTHING. Then that's a scam, make a quick sprint for the exit.    Good luck    PS - Of course they were excited. For every one of you that joined they would make a commission|`|92fd69a0960dc0314607a31fc6851f63aa	there are 2 types, one of them with physical products involved and the second type is with no physical involved.

It has been shown in court cases and complaints with the Federal Trade Commission that there is a 97% failure rate with MLM programs.  The only ones making the big bucks are the ones that got in at the beginning of the scheme.  Then there is the way these programs are advertised and promoted.  What you saw in the meeting is a classic example: one or two big money makers up on a stage hootin' and hollerin' about all the money they've made and how easy it is for anyone else to do the same.  What they don't tell you is exactly what you will be doing and that is selling and most if not all people would rather be buried up to their necks in a hill of pissed off Texas fire ants rather than take up selling something.  Most of the products or services you will be selling are over priced and no different that what you could buy much cheaper at Walmart or Walgreens so it is an uphill battle to sell enough to make any money.  A good source of info is the FTC website www.ftc.gov.  Do a search on that site for multi level marketing or network marketing as it is also called.  That will give you an eyefull on this subject.  Another good source on this subject is www.mlm-thetruth.com.  This site very thoroughly explains MLM and how it works.|`|bab6d95fb869833a53954afc0b263edeaa	You are right to be skeptical - trust your gut. Multi-level marketing can also be considered to be a pyramid scheme. This is how it works -- the person that invited you to the meeting makes money off you because you are selling product. Then, you enlist your friends and acquaintances and maybe even strangers into the organization, and you will get a cut of their commissions, and they enlist their friends, etc. The only people who really make any money out of this are the people who got in at the top, like the guy giving the talk. Most people who get into this have very high hopes that are never realized. By the way, the products in multi-level marketing are generally of poor quality, no matter what they tell you. I bet you are required to buy a certain amount of "inventory," too.     I would advise you NOT to have anything to do with these  people, since you have more to loose than to gain.    Good Luck!

Unless you are in the business of buying homes that are in need of repair, fixing them and selling them for a higher price.  In that case, you would ask the real estate group of your local bank for a construction loan to cover the cost of the house plus the cost of the repairs that will be needed.

d8933d0b428012ff805f44f6da437b2baa	You are more than accurate on this regard.    Infosys performance since 7/4/06 is +25.16%   TCS performance since 7/4/06 is +32.63%   Wipro's performance since 7/4/06 is +00.50% (up POINT 5 percent, not 5%)    So as a whole, Wipro has underperformed against Infosys and TCS by a margin of 25%.  This is a HUGE difference considering the profit growth are not all that different.    As to why Wipro is underperforming, well my hypothesis is that TCS has undergone a rerating, therefore now commands a premium over Infosys and Wipro.  As for Infosys, I hope the valuation gap between Wipro and Infosys is only temporary.  If you look at the ADR prices, you would see that Wipro ADR has been trading at a 20% premium valuation against Infy ADR as compared to Wipro NSE vs Infosys NSE.  This premium has been there since Aug 2006.  Therefore it is more than likely a temporary anamoly that would get corrected in the near future.    If you hold Wipro shares for the long term, please do not worry.  The shares should touch upwards of Rs 800 in less than a year's time.|`|UuVwBOKKaa	There is nobody so lonely as a minority shareholder....

The reason for Wipro's poor  discounting may be due to [1] floating stocks are  less and hence  absence of speculative activity [2] even the public who are holding  them are long term investors and [3] I think it would be out of place to compare Wipro with Infosys & TCS since the former is a company with widespread interest in FMCG, electricals &of course, IT. While Infosys & TCS get IT rating, Wipro is classified as a well  diversified company.

d8933d0b428012ff805f44f6da437b2baa	As stated earlier, the best option to choose a MF is through the secondary offer.    Several reasons can be attributed towards this reasoning:    (a) The Fund Manager and his history to survive in bear markets can be easily determined in a secondary offer fund.    e.g., HDFC Prudence is managed by one of the best managers in India for a period of 13 years or so.  This fund performs extremely well in both good and bad markets.  This kind of history is hard to fathom in a new NFO fund offer.    (b) Some fund companies strive to make certain funds extremely popular.    e.g., Reliance Growth, SBI Magnum Contrafund, HDFC Equity, Franklin Prima, etc    In all of these funds, there has been management changes.  However the fund performance did not skip a beat even after the managers took a hike.    (c) Thirdly, the odds of success with a NFO is 50/50, but with a well chosen existing fund, the success rate can be as high as 95%    I have invested in NFO offers myself.  I enrolled in    (a) Reliance Equity - I enrolled in this fund in last April, because the market was frothy and this Fund was India's first ever fund to hedge itself against F&O positions.  Therefore, this fund promised to protect in a bear market.    I subscribed out of this fund very recently because the Fund did not match upto my expectations.    (b) Franklin Flexicap - When I subscribed to this NFO, I guessed this fund to be a balance between Franklin Blue Chip fund and Franklin Prima.  I still hold this fund as its performance has been superlative and upto my lofty expectations.    Therefore you can see it is hard to second guess on a NFO.  It may or may not work.  And if it does not work, you better make sure that there are atleast 1 or 2 good funds in that Fund family that you can switch into without paying any load.|`|384399ec8f9051dbf8ccafb9621f25edaa	it's better to go with the ones that has been in business the longest and know what their doing.  this will save you money and time invested

Per se posso permettermi..se vuoi mantenerti gli studi ci sono tanti altri lavori che si possono fare, non dire che "HAI BISOGNO DI FARLO"..di piuttosto che ti piace!  Non c' niente di male nel voler fare la cubista..non vai mica a darla in giro al primo che passa! E se hai un bel corpo e vuoi metterlo in mostra fai solo bene!|`|ZvHtlCwRaa	perch non provi a camuffarla con brillantini....tatoo o semplicemente usa qualcosa di trasparente cos puoi mostrarti senza apparire del tutto e comunque a mio modesto parere se ti dai da fare qualcosaltro riesci a trovare di lavoro,,,cameriera,,,,colf,,,,|`|7tQS27Hjaa	Guarda questa cubista:  http://img65.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...    E' vestitissima ma sexy da paura.    Secondo me potresti proprio sfruttare la cosa per apparire molto pi misteriosa e sexy.  Vai tranquilla e rilassata e in bocca la lupo. :-)|`|cqXHToaLaa	Ti dir che se il resto  bello, non penso che i discotecari si accorgano di una cicatrice sul fianco!!!!!  Se possono fare le cubiste quelle con dei visi pessimi o con la cellulite perch non dovresti farlo per un cicatrice.  E poi ci sono un sacco di modi per coprirla:  -vestitini iperscollati, ma che coprano l,  -tenere il lato "sano" verso la pista,  -non tenerne conto e fare il tuo lavoro con professionalit, e nessuno se ne accorger  -farti un bel tatuaggio che fa eccitare ancora di pi gli uomini delle notti in discoteca|`|841fdbf09ecfa50c6587a626566a8eeeaa	Potresti trovare la soluzione applicando sulla cicatrice un adesivo con un fiore.|`|dvCAseWxaa	sognatore sei un bigottone!|`|GTdNGRPKaa	Guarda che ci sono lavori pi dignitosi per pagarsi gli studi    Cibrac, tu invece sei tro.......ppo gentile!|`|380ce7dbee13c00081ff8d746fceb51eaa	non credo sia un problema una cicatrice dipende da com' il resto a meno che non sei come frankestain sherzo ciao

E non perch siamo sfigati o altro ma per il semplice fatto che il Lotto paga in maniera inferiore alle probabilit di vincita. Certo, si pu avere la fortuna di vincere qualche volta ma, giocando sempre e in modo continuato, alla lunga il gioco  matematicamente perdente. Del resto il "banco" deve vincere altrimenti non esisterebbe il Lotto.    Per il Superenalotto invece la storia  diversa, nel senso che non vengono stabilite a priori delle cifre moltiplicatrici della puntata ma, pi semplicemente si vincono i soldi stessi (meno l'agio e le tasse) che hanno versato tutti i partecipanti. Perci pi alto  il montepremi e meglio . Tuttavia, c' un altro problema: le combinazioni possibili sono cos tante (centinaia di milioni) che  davvero arduo indovinare la combinazione vincente. Perci, anche in questo caso si tratta di fattore C.

f47d7a7cfd58ae992b06f3f80d339c0daa	It depends on ur background. I'm assuming that u are an engineer.  A good software developer needs not only good coding skills but ideally good domain knowledge in the area in which he/she is developing the software because the idea is to understand the core of the business of the customer.  If u r a mechanical engineer, well look for a company that needs expertise in this particular domain. For example, TCS does a lot of business in Engineering vertical. They will certainly be able to impart software coding skills to u  and leverage ur knowledge in ur field of expertise. Many companies like L&T which is an Engineering major do a lot of in-house software development, so u could try that too.

Though it is nice to be honest, interview is generally not the time to be completely honest.   For example if you are going for an interview for a sales job, u can probably say that "sitting at the desk doing paper work is not what I am good at, I'd rather be on the field interacting and meeting new people. Ofcourse I had learnt the importance of filing papers regularly when I was working at xyz, but that's not what really interests me".  For a sales manager this might be music to ears.  Basically try and point out a weakness that is not related to your job. Not being able to play the guitar may be irrelevant for someone in finance but the same weakness may be highly undesirable if u are looking for a job as a musician. So play to the field!|`|8d0e8debe3a45fb4fba3f00298f7338faa	while answering such questions mostly in an interview you should always try to base it on some stands since the next question will surely be based on this one. also it is not good to say that u don have any negatives since this signifies that ur trying to hide something and not truthful. also when ur giving out ur failures u should make it a point to say that ur working towards eliminating ur failures. these questions r mostly asked to test how much u know about urself and to find out whether ull fit in basically in a team or good to work independently. and always when u introduce urself such as hobbies make sure that u know something about the hobby which ur mentioning since the next question will be based on this. for eg if ur hobby is music, then u should know something about music to answer the next question. the same holds good for anyother question. and if u dont know say u dont know. all the best.|`|9d93c1704c59446c72a3b8a4102598e9aa	Introduce Yourself - Just tell your name what you do and a lil bit of info abt ur parents nd siblings, your ambition and list your hobbies nd interests  Strengths - You can say your best qualities like you're good in a team, easy to get along with ppl, can handle any situation easily, funny to be along with n stuff u can also include ur organising abilites  Weakness - you need to be careful regarding this...nothing should contradict with your strengths and should be a safe answer like sometimes i get too much involved in work to find time for others or you dont do regular exercise to keep urself fit nd stuff....dont be too honest in this question which may cost your job!!  All the Best :)
