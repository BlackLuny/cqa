20071106180610AACEcDc	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Reflexion numero 15: despues de un tiempo....?	Después de un tiempo, uno aprende la sutil diferencia entre sostener una mano y encadenar un alma, y uno aprende que el amor no significa acostarse y una compa?ía no significa seguridad, y uno empieza a aprender...       Que los besos no son contratos y los regalos no son promesas, y uno empieza a aceptar sus derrotas con la cabeza alta y los ojos abiertos, y uno aprende a construir todos sus caminos en el hoy, porque el terreno de ma?ana es demasiado inseguro para planes... y los futuros tienen una forma de caerse en la mitad.      Y después de un tiempo uno aprende que si es demasiado, hasta el calor del sol quema. Así que uno planta su propio jardín y decora su propia alma, en lugar de esperar a que alguien le traiga flores.      Y uno aprende que realmente puede aguantar, que uno realmente es fuerte, que uno realmente vale, y uno aprende y aprende... y con cada día uno aprende.       Con el tiempo aprendes que estar con alguien porque te ofrece un buen futuro significa que tarde o temprano querrás volver a tu pasado.      Con el tiempo comprendes que sólo quien es capaz de amarte con tus defectos, sin pretender cambiarte, puede brindarte toda la felicidad que deseas.      Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que si estás al lado de esa persona sólo por acompa?ar tu soledad, irremediablemente acabarás no deseando volver a verla.      Con el tiempo entiendes que los verdaderos amigos son contados, y que el que no lucha por ellos tarde o temprano se verá rodeado sólo de amistades falsas. Sorry, your browser doesn't support Java(tm).         Con el tiempo aprendes que las palabras dichas en un momento de ira pueden seguir lastimando a quien heriste, durante toda la vida.      Con el tiempo aprendes que disculpar cualquiera lo hace, pero perdonar es sólo de almas grandes.      Con el tiempo comprendes que si has herido a un amigo duramente, muy probablemente la amistad jamás volverá a ser igual.      Con el tiempo te das cuenta que aunque seas feliz con tus amigos, algún día llorarás por aquellos que dejaste ir.       Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que cada experiencia vivida con cada persona es irrepetible.      Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que el que humilla o desprecia a un ser humano, tarde o temprano sufrirá las mismas humillaciones o desprecios multiplicados al cuadrado.      Con el tiempo aprendes a construir todos tus caminos en el hoy, porque el terreno del ma?ana es demasiado incierto para hacer planes.      Con el tiempo comprendes que apresurar las cosas o forzarlas a que pasen ocasionará que al final no sean como esperabas.       Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que en realidad lo mejor no era el futuro, sino el momento que estabas viviendo justo en ese instante.      Con el tiempo verás que aunque seas feliz con los que están a tu lado, a?orarás terriblemente a los que ayer estaban contigo y ahora se han marchado.      Con el tiempo aprenderás que intentar perdonar o pedir perdón, decir que amas, decir que extra?as, decir que necesitas, decir que quieres ser amigo, ante una tumba, ya no tiene ningún sentido.      Pero desafortunadamente, solo con el tiempo...

Lycurgus Lacedaemoniorum civitatem opyimis legibus et institutis temperavit ut ominibus Graecis pluris quam ceteri legum auctores duceretur.Administrationem rei publicae ordinatissime distribuit:regibus bellorum potestatem,senioribus legum custodiam,multitudini magistartuum creationem commisit.Magnificentissimos honores senibus truìibuit,nec in aliis civitatibus senectus honoratior quam in Lacedaemoniorum urbe fuit.Agros inter omnes aeque divisit ne civitas discordia divitum et pauperum turbaretur.Iussit virgines sine dote in matrimonium duci ut viri uxores diligentiore quam ditiores eligerent et severiore auctoritate coercerent.Ad maximam parsimoniam cives induxit nec sumptuosiora convivia fieri permisit,quia existimabat militiam propter assiduam frugalitatis consuetudinem multo gratiorem esse
20080103001236AAtPXu3	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Your opinion...this is a poem, not a song, and it is the very first draft. Please tell me what you think.?	I felt safe, there with you,    your finger tips against my skin,   and though i knew it couldn't last,   I felt myself falling in love again.   You held me close, held me tight,   and your sweet smile lit up my day,   you told me just what I needed,   and your words swept my doubt away.      never though you'd leave me lonely.   never thought you'd go away.   never thought you'd want to hurt me,   never thought you'd bring me heartache.      And now I'm standing in the dark    as the tears run down my face   I'm falling to the ground,   feeling so out of place.   I'm building up m walls    and blocking it all out.   I'm giving in to misery,    overcome with doubt.      I should have seen this coming,   Nothing ever turns out right.   I should have looked ahead,   But I was blinded by your lies.   I should have used my head,   But I wanted so much more,   I should have shut you out,   instead I'm left lying on the floor.      I know that I have only myself to blame.   And I know I'll never be the same.

Deeper and deeper,   Thought you were a keeper,   I fell in love with the wrong kind of guy.   Was it all a big fat lie?      You held me in your arms that night   I felt so loved and safe and tight.   I thought you loved me and wanted me then.   But now I’ve been dumped in the garbage bin.      I watch you kiss her and hold her and love her,   And I wonder if that had been me, would things be better?   I sit and I wonder, I wonder a lot,   Was I supposed to be part of the plot?      The restless nights I sit and think.   Your heart is as cold as an ice-skating rink.   Do you hate me, or like me?   Did you ever love me?      And I cannot rest,   Though I try my best,    Until I know.    Why you had to go.      But deep down inside I know that it’s true.   If only, if only, I were with you,   I would rest well again,   Until the sad end.

I just can't seem to get the ideas off the ground.  The sins that are after the character is a certain sin stone that there are only seven of and there is someone that hunts down those who have the stones (just to make things moer complicated)

20090131083942AAlvcsS	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	I need to put on a great show for my school's talent show. Help?	Okay, so my school is putting on a talent show. I auditioned, but the song I picked had to be changed. [According to the judges, it was too dark.]   Because of that, I'm not in the main talent show, but the "Mini-Talent Show" where other auditioner's have to compete to be in the real talent show.   The theme is "Make it BIG!" Madre Gras style. I'm singing, but I have to put on a real show to really impress. It's not just about singing, but stage presence and entertainment quality. Just singing a song isn't going to cut it.   I'm an alto, so I can't sing high notes well. I usually pick songs originally done by men because it shows off my voice a lot more. Let me make this clear: NO Ashanti. NO Beyonce. NO Rhianna.   I'm a bit of a punk, so I prefer rock songs.   Again, the song has to be enough to show off my voice as well as put on a good show.   The song I originally auditioned with was "Love Me Dead" by Ludo.   Link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCU1JYmGx...       Okay.   GO! ^_^

20090131100127AAlzetY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	It is Saturday.. A poem about last night... "Were You There?"?	Crawling along the moons sharp, crusty crest   I nimbly escaped, with aid from a loon,   Who mournfully crooned while I slipped away,   Into my mind to vivaciously play   I soon encountered, to my startled eyes   Ma and Dahha, I blinked twice in surprise!   What were they doing, on the crest of crust?   On moons rocky surface, covered in dust…   I had a thermos, I hoped they had cups   Contents of thermos would give you hiccups…   Sitting and talking when out of the blue   Appeared Mek and Cilla and bluebell, too   Mek brought some Whiskey Cilla brought some chips   Bluebell not to be left out had brought dip   Ron brought some critters, I knew that he would   I had said ‘fritters’ He misunderstood…..   In the distance a green toque approaching   Mixtli and Semper a medley singing   One of their voices was quite out of key   But that did not matter at all to me     Crowd was growing to massive proportions    I was aglow with my endomorphins   The moon, alive; the party was shaking!   A massive hangover, in the making   I danced with everyone, one at a time   Forgot the difficult tedious climb   When I heard the loon cry and slipped away   Never expected to see this display   I hope all those with me there on the moon   Will give their reports of the party soon   With that, I must go now, must get some rest   Who’s coming with me? I will not protest.

Yeah well i'm going to this dance at my school, and I want to dance with guys and stuff, but i'm not sure HOW i would dance with them without like grinding or anything.. I really really hate grinding. It reminds me of an animalistic mating ritual and is basically just a girl letting a guy hump her butt repeatedly until he gets bored (also pretty sexist too, i mean you never see a GIRL all up in a guys ***) but the point is, i want to actually DANCE with a guy so how do you do it? Obviously you are in front of each other, but do you look them directly in the eyes? Where do you put your arms? Surly you don't leave them wobbling around at your sides, but wouldn't it be too direct to put them around the guy????       yeah so i am obviously clueless and really need some help here.    thankss =]

I have a quiz coming up and I need to thoroughly understand the following questions. Please Answer in more than one sentence if possible. Your help is appreciated.      1. McCandless thinks his Datsun is a "piece of junk" when he abandons it. In reality, it was fine. What was wrong with it and how did it get that way?      2. In Mexico, McCandless runs into trouble as he is canoeing. Explain his troubles in Mexico.      3. Many people were immediately drawn to Chris and became good friends with him. One such person was Franz, who helped Chris on a number of occasions, including taking him to Grand Junction, Colorado, so that Chris could get to South Dakota. What did Franz do when he got the news that Chris had died in Alaska?      4. Often times we can have strong similarities and strong differences with the same person. This is the case with Chris and his dad. Give two ways they were similar and two ways they were different.      5. Chris was a naturally talented athlete but almost impossible to coach because he always wanted to do it "his way." Give one example of this when he competed in sports.      6. What terrible truth did Chris discover about his father?      7. No doubt there are many vocal critics of McCandless and the decisions he made and the life he lived, yet the author keeps coming to McCandless' defense. Explain one point of criticism and explain how Krakauer comes to McCandless' defense.      8. According to Krakauer, what were the two pivotal mistakes for Chandless that led to his death?

20090131110856AAhbcmF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	New moon, book, film?	I've just finished reading the book for new moon in 2 days, It was awesome, and I'm going to start reading eclipse soon, I just wanted to know if they'll begin filming it soon, and if so, when will the film be out in cinemas ?? Also, When will the DVD of Twilight be out, I absolutely loved it after reading the book, will it be out for April, because I want it for my birthday.      One more thing, I just wanted to know if anyone else is really disliking Jacob in new moon ?? I know I haven't started reading eclipse yet, and that he might change, but i still want to know what you think..      Last thing, do you think Bella should become a vampire ? I'm really not sure of my opinion, I don't want her to become a vampire because I think it might ruin her character, and the books might not be the same with her being able to defend herself, but I do want her to become one because I'd hate the books to end her mortal and me having an awful picture in my head of her 80 and Edward 17 .. Uuugh *shivers*

20090131124823AAxcLkE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Um. First Chapter in my book, im thinking about writing.?	Does it sound good? It would be for younger readers, 11-15.   I want to know if it's worth it to keep writing..      "Are you really nearly thirteen?" laughed Dimitri, a sixteen year old boy that was instructing my dance lessons. I turned away so he couldnt see the tears buring at my eyelids.     He was right, of course. I was nowhere near looking as old as i was. I was twelve, going on thirteen in a couple of weeks. Nobody ever thought of me as attractive. My best feature was my eyes. They were a stunning light blue that always took people's breath away.    Doing dance lessons were never my idea of fun, but my mother, Karen, insisted that i take them.  She had a husband, my dad, named Tim Harrison, known for making on screen movies.    Dimitri continued laughing, and i turned around after i had wiped my eyes and glared at him.  "Yes, i'm nearly thirteen," i said with a crack in my voice.    He looked at me seriously and stopped laughing. "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Grayson."    I shook my head and began doing the 24 step routine i was working on completing.    "No no no!" He shouted, staring down at me with a smug expression. "You do it like this!" He began demonstrating.     I just stared and looked away. I was looking forward to getting away this weekend, especially because my mother was becoming more naggy by the minute, and i couldnt one more day of it! I was visiting my cousin, Karol, who was my age, just a smidge younger by a petty three months. My cousin lived in a huge, ranch styled home in Mexico. I had to take a plane there, considering we were way far away in Los Angeles, California. My adoptive father was flying down with me. Although my cousin lived in Mexico, she nor i had any Mexican heritage.    The week days flashed by like a sufficient lightning  bolt. Soon I was on a beuatiful plane from LA to Mexico. The smiling waiters with the whitest teeth i've ever seen served us gourmet food. I didn't know plane traveling could be so extravagent.    My father leaned over and kissed me lightly on my forehead. "We'll be there in about 9 hours.."    I found myself lightly falling asleep. My head spun and the world seemed as if it was shutting down for a little while. I leaned against Tim, my father, and fell asleep.    The next thing I knew, we arrived in Mexico. We hopped out of the plane, gathering our suitcases.     "We'll be taking a car down to the home," my father told me.     I just nodded and walked down the busy airport and finally exiting through big gold shiny doors. I looked around Mexico. Some of my spanish friends from school had told me that Mexico was a dump. Some told me it was amazing. This must of been the beautiful and amazing part of Mexico; It didn't look anything close to a dump.    "Where are we?" I asked blankly.    He turned to stare at me. "Well, we're in Mexico, I was sure you knew..?"    "No. I meant as in, what city?"    He straightened up. "Oh." We're in aguascalientes, I think."    I chuckled nervously. My cousin and I hadn't seen eachother in years. Probably since we were eight or nine..    He looked at me and smiled. "I hope you'll be all right, on the ride." I didn't know what he meant, exactly. Why wouldn't I be alright?    A large green jeep that looked as if it had been sitting under the sun for twenty years, stood waiting for us. It was rusted, and the color looked so faded, I could hardly even tell what color it was. A man hopped out and smiled. He gave a casual wave and approached us.    I noticed he was very, very tan. He had sweat dripping from the side of his head and he had a  bushy brown mustache. He was wearing a large and unflattering cowboy hat. His overalls were stained from old age and years of work.  He smiled. His teeth were white.    I waved, and my dad smiled apologetically. "Are we a little late?"    "No, you're perfectly on time," he said and chuckled. "I'm Bill White."     "Timothy Harrison." They extended hands and shook.    "And, this, is my little girl! Her name is Grayson. She's coming here visiting her cousin," my dad said proudly. I smiled sheepishly.    "Well," Bill said and smiled. "How old are you? Nine, ten?"    I frowned. "I'm twelve, very nearly thirteen."    "Oh well, my mistake, you look awfully young for ya age."   He patted me on the back and laughed. My dad joined in. I just glared.    "Well, lets get this show on da road!" Bill shouted. He ran over to the faded and rusted jeep and hopped in. My dad followed and climbed into the passenger seat. When I got in the back, i noticed there was no seat belt, just a thick rope thing that was probably being used for the seatbelt. I frowned.    "Sorra about that, kiddo," he said and chuckled. "Dunt have a lot of money dese days." He chuckled, my dad too. I frowned again. The seat was hard as wood. I looked down and noticed it was wood, with a small sheet of carpeting over it. There was garbage everywhere. It took me awhile to get used to the rotten smell. My dad looked weird compared to the jeep and to Bill, in

20090131115315AAmRaHh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What does this passage mean?	I'm reading Charles Lamb's Essays of Elia and want to make sure I catch all the references so I understand what he's saying. He writes in antiquated speak and references many things. In the beginning of "The South-Sea House" he writes, "Reader, in thy passage from the bank--where thou hast been receiving thy half-yearly dividends (supposing thou art a lean annuitant like myself)--to the Flower Pot, to secure a place for Dalston, or Shacklewell, or some other thy suburban retreat northerly,--      I'm trying to decide if the last part, about securing a place, is alluding back to the money? Perhaps in your passage from the bank, to pick up the money, to secure a Northern retreat--? If that's not what's being said, I cannot figure it out. I cannot tell what the "Flower Pot" is also. First instinct says florist, but I'm not sure that makes sense. Some Googling got me to the thought that perhaps it is a pub, but does that contribute to the "secure a place for..."? I just want to make sense of this, and if anyone has any knowledge on the matter, I'd love to hear it.      Thanks.

20090131140352AA5YIEg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How can I add one or two twists to my story?	The basic outline of the story is as follows:      A single man, aged around thirty, lives on his own in an apartment in New York City. His occupation involves him working in an office in Manhattan for a large corporation.      On one sunning summer afternoon during the man’s lunch break, he goes out to get something to eat while walking through Central Park. He comes across a charity event involving orphanages. He puts some of his change in the collection box and sits in the stands while eating his lunch. While the children are playing, a ball goes into the crowd and the man catches it. A little girl aged around six goes up to him and he gives her the ball back. He smiles and winks and she smiles back. He then continues to watch the match before returning to work.      Later that evening, he meets up with friends in a local bar and tells them about the little girl. He opens up his feelings and tells them that he is thinking about adoption being a possibility seeing as he has been unable to find the right woman to marry and have kids with.      A few days later he tracks down where the little girl is located and visits the orphanage. He talks to the adoption agency about wanting to adopt the little girl. However, they say that it’s illegal for a single man to adopt a young girl. The man is distraught that he is unable to give the girl a better life and decides to take the matter to court in order to get the law changed. Despite being a genuinely nice guy, people have their doubts and with the world now more wary of paedophiles, winning the case is virtually impossible without a female companion.      The man refuses to back down and fights for the opportunity to give the young girl a home. He takes the adoption agency to court and explains his reasons for adoption. Even though the girl really wants the man to be her daddy, everyone is extremely concerned for the wellbeing of young girls and fear that if the law is changed then it could send out the wrong message to the public. However, the court finally reaches an agreement seeing as though he has no criminal record and after a long battle, he finally wins the case.      How can I make the story a little more dramatic? And what do you think of it? A good story idea?

20090131134144AAplzTY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help! Can someone please recommend me a good book about werewolves? Possible 10 points up for grabs?	Because I am thirsty for one xD   I might prefer one about people who can turn into wolves rather than actual half-man half-wolf creatures but I don't mind either way so long as it's good.       Also, if the werewolves are Native American and the story includes a bit of fictional history based on actual myth that would be great!      I don't mind what genre it is. If it's horror or whatever else, please tell me that this is so! I don't want any 'adult' scenes. In the sense that I don't want to be reading something that is quite perverse and makes me wonder if the author is a bit of a creep. I was reading these reviews online for werewolf books and a lot of them concerned sexual scenes and scenes of rape =/      Anyway if you recommend a book tell me what it's about, the genre and anything else. Thanks!!

20081019141059AA34yRs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Romantic book suggestions, passionate, DEEP, absorbing, worth my time?	So I'm looking for a new romance book to read...I'm a romantic...and I really can't find one that seems worth reading. I'm SO over the cliche, trashy ones in the "romance" isle of the bookstore. I want something absorbing, that'll keep me reading practically non-stop (you know, hard to put down, you want to talk about it, you think about it, etc). I also want something with passion (lust as well as love), preferably, and definitely original characters. And--this is really important--something that is not shallow. I'm fed up with books that say, "Oh, I love him, he's beautiful, he's smart, he's nice..." I'm thinking something along the lines of Phantom of the Opera (the movie version) with more of a Phantom-type guy than a Raoul. Ew.    I REALLY hope someone can give me a suggestion?   I mostly enjoy romance novels that have historical settings...even as recently as 40 or 50 years back...because it's hard to find something with the passion and confusion I'm looking for when it's in the times of e-mail and MySpace.      Some examples of books like this (with romances) that I loved: A Great and Terrible Beauty (romance wasn't the biggest component, but what it had was exactly what I'm looking for), Twilight, The Notebook (and others by Nicholas Sparks), Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights,  Romeo & Juliet, Bloom, To Catch a Pirate, A Company of Swans, etc. Also Sarah Dessen and Meg Cabot books, and even Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (book, not movie).      So...I hope someone has a suggestion for me? Anyone? I'd really appreciate it :)

Chapter 1-   “Could you please stop moping around like this, Lex? It’s not as bad as you think.”    I looked toward the voice, an irritated look on my face. For a moment, I had forgotten she had been in the car; bigger things were on my mind. Looking away, I shifted my mind back to her question. “No!” I wanted to shout at her. “Not when you’re doing this to me.” Another part of me, the smarter part, reminded me to seal my lips and keep pretending she didn’t exist. All I needed right now is to get punished for talking back, on top of all the other trouble I was in. I pressed my lips together tightly and stared out the foggy window, making it clear I didn’t want to talk to her. I just focused on counting the rain drops that landed on my window. Crossing my arms, I scooted closer to the door, trying to get as far away from her as I could.   “This will be good for you!” My overly enthusiastic mother said, seeing my reaction. It was the first thing she said to me since we left home. Of course, that wasn’t my home anymore. “You know, you wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place if you would just learn to behave.”   Right, my “situation”. Being sent to my aunt’s house was the only “situation” I could see. It was more like being sent to a prison, a prison on the other side of the country. From California to Maine, hot to cold, friends to strangers, happiness to hell. What could be worse than this? Regardless of how many times I brought to up to her, she just laughed, making it clear it without saying it that it was my fault anyway. Oh yes, it was completely my fault that I attract more arguments and fights than any normal girl my age. It wasn’t even that I picked fights, contrary to what my mother believed. I just stood up for those who, for whatever reason, wouldn’t stick up for themselves.    “Me, behave, right.”  I mumbled. Maybe if I showed some signs of life she’d leave me alone.   I side-glanced at my mother. Her dark auburn hair was messed up from the wind blowing through her cracked-open window, but she didn’t seem to notice. Her emerald eyes, focused on the road, were wet with tears, although her voice never hinted that she was crying. Her grip on the steering wheel looked deadly. Seeing her like this, I felt my own hot tears sneak up behind my eyes. I blinked them away furiously, not wanting her to see me cry.     “Where is the house again?” I asked, hoping to distract her, though fake interest hovered over my voice.   I looked back and forth from the window to her as I spoke, looking discreetly for her reaction. Her eyes narrowed, not what I had expected, obviously hoping to avoid the question.   “Your Aunt Helen lives in Franklin, Maine, dear.” She said her voice broke, despite her efforts.   I tried to act nonchalantly, but I knew it was obvious to both of us she was hiding something.  “What about her house?” I asked, still not knowing what I’d be dealing with for the next who knows how many months. If it was that bad, hotels weren’t too expensive, were they…?      She sighed, her eyes glancing from the road to me for a brief second. “Your aunt has a beautiful house. It must have at least twenty-five rooms in it.”    My jaw dropped lightly as I popped out of my seat. I had heard a lot of stories about my great-aunt, but never about her being rich. I closed my mouth and slumped back down, hoping she hadn’t noticed. But of course she did.   “I thought you would act like that.” She smirked, “You’ll have fun cleaning it.”    “What?” I squealed, popping right back out of the seat. That would be impossible; I hardly cleaned my room, let alone an entire house.   My mother chuckled. “We talked to your aunt and her maid just quit. So congratulations, you have your first job.” She explained smugly, the smirk remaining on her face as I glared at her. I knew she was enjoying this.   I considered saying, “I quit,” but decided against it. Instead I sighed and changed the subject. “Does she have any kids?”    If I had to move against my will, I at least needed to know if I would need a lock for my room.    “Your aunt has three kids. Tanner, he’s twenty three, moved out a few years ago. Abby, she’s about your age. And then…” She paused as she seemed to rack her memory for the name. “Kayla. She is about thirteen. You won’t have to worry about her much though, from what I hear, she’s never home. Helen mentioned she was into parties…” I heard a change in her voice as she spoke of Kayla. It was almost like she had a hushed hatred (or was it pity?) of her. I could tell she was playing stupid, hiding something big. What a surprise.   Finally, we reached airport. As we walked toward the large building, I had the urge to look at mom; these would be the last moments I spent with her for months. But I decided against it.  I didn’t need to burst out crying in front of these strangers, but the tough act was getting old. Look where it’s gotten me this far.   Though it took hours, so it seemed, to get through s

Unfortunately for me, no matter how much I yell, the pain never stops. My mother rushes into the room with a worried face; she knows exactly what is happening. She holds me tight and tries to comfort me through yet another one of my episodes. I have no idea why my mother puts up with me. I don't even know  why I put up with myself. I let out another scream. The pain has gotten even worse. My veins are thirsty, my heart is beating with need.I feel something crawling through my skin. My breathing becomes uneasy, I begin to drown in my tears. I try to yell again, but nothing comes out. I grab the pillow with an undeniable rage. You have no idea how hard it is to resist the only thing in the world that makes you happy, the one thing that makes you feel...loved. Suddenly, my tears stop, my breathing goes back to normal, I feel numb. I just sit still, thinking. I am Manny, and I'm a drug addict. Who are you?      Okay, this is my update.  1. Any title ideas, yet?  2. Is it better now?  3. Any more ideas?

Come live with me and be my love,   And we will all the pleasures prove   That valleys, groves, hills, and fields,   Woods, or steepy mountain yields.      And we will sit upon rocks,   Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,   By shallow rivers to whose falls   Melodious birds sing madrigals.      And I will make thee beds of roses   And a thousand fragrant poises,   A cap of flowers, and a kirtle   Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;      A gown made of the finest wool   Which from our pretty lambs we pull;   Fair lined slippers for the cold,   With buckles of the purest gold;      A belt of straw and ivy buds,   With coral clasps and amber studs;   And if these pleasures may thee move,   Come live with me, and be my love.      The shepherds's swains shall dance and sing   For thy delight each May morning:   If these delights thy mind may move,   Then live with me and be my love.

Tyler had trapped me in this abandoned place and there was no way out. He wanted to kill me, and he usually got what he wanted. The cuts that he had given me already burned like a fire and stinged like needles jabbing into my skin. I don't know why Tyler couldn't give up his power thirst and witch hunting like Kyle did. I guess it was just fate for me. Not even my powers were good enough to protect myself from Tyler. "Poor little Nikki. Afraid, cold, and hurting and no one to help you. I would kill you now but I will save it for Kyle to see." "No..." i tried to make out. "I don't want you hurting Kyle. Get away from him! Dont even do anything to him. Or..Or.. I will kill you myself!" I finally got the strength to yell out. I couldn't kill him though, he would kill me instantly. It was just what I wanted now though. "Now now little Nikki. You should try to save your energy for protecting yourself." He used his special power to hurt me. I feel to the ground doubled over in pain.      <srry i also posted this b4)

20090131110255AA0DsoG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is there somewhere where I can send something I wrote, like a short story, to get it critiqued?	I'm asking this because I'm only 17 years old so a) I'm not that serious about it that I would actually go to a publishing agency or whatnot and b) it's not like they would take me seriously either.  But it would be nice to see how professional people think about my writing.      It doesn't matter if I have to send money with it or anything like that, but if it costs a lot of money I wouldn't do it.      It can be in the mail, or e-mail would be fabulous.      Thanks!
20090131103712AA2YiQ6	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you be too young to write a book?	I'm 14 and i started to write this book when I was 13. Am I too young to write books? i've gotten people to read what i have so far and they think its good and very mature. I love to read and write and i write songs and poems so I thought well why not just write a book. So am I too young or does age not matter? And I don't know about the editing, publishing, and copywrite stuff, but if I do want to publish it how would I find an editor and publisher? thank you.

20090131105112AAR6rIk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I've lost my muse. Can anyone help?	As a teen I would draw all the time. I painted and also sculpted from time to time. When adulthood, then parenthood hit me, I eventually stopped all these things I enjoyed. Now, I look back at how much I enjoyed my past hobby but now that I have time to pick it back up, I can't create. I attempt to just draw anything,,, paint anything... but I feel nothing. Nothing of value  Can anyone relate? How did you overcome this?
