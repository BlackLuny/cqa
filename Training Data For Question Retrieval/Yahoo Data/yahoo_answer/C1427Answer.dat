uy6sBhipaa	Whatever your question is about, call the related science department at the nearest college or university near you  i.e. the "college of biology" and when the receptionist answers the phone ask her if there is any biology (or whatever, physics, astronomy, etc. )  professor around who can answer a question?  The receptionist knows who has 'office hours' at the time you call and can transfer you to them. If you get their name you can look up their campus address and send them a thank you note. If you're really resourceful you can get the number of the 'biology tutor room' or 'math tutor room' and use them anytime. That's how you do it by phone. The campus phone book might have their university email address which you can use. Don't over use the professors. The TA's can be worked to death, though. 8~)|`|13hOkQ2naa	No Idea >.>

If you are not happy with how people think about you or you cannot keep friends or jobs for very long then yes, you suffer from something and it may be narcissism. For that, seek counseling first.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I don't think it is possible that a person with narcissistic personality disorder would know it.  Their ego would be too grand to admit it.  In their mind they are right and the world is all wrong, they don't have a problem, you do.  They don't admit to having a problem, so they can't get cured from it.  There is no cure for narcissistic personality disorder, no meds would help.  Even if you went to therapy for several years, you would not get better because in your mind you are not the one with the problem.|`|9c7a3bd67fbfe6f08d3a5f7e9144b19caa	If you like the way you are and nobody else seems to have a problem with it, then why would you feel the need to be on medication?|`|oL7he2DAaa	Well, only if it bothers you.

For example, we can determine what level or type of threat will induce us to manifest such behavior as winching, freezing or jumping backward, and how our thinking processes are affected by these automatic responses.
LvXT82wbaa	self control|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	I'll admit it was MUCH easier to keep it squelched before my brother died.  It's been 5 years and it's much harder to restrain tears about anything than it used to be.   But basically it boils down to what another poster said.      Progressive relaxation exercise - breathe in, breathe out. Nice and deep and slow.  Firmly turn your thoughts, repeatedly if necessary, to some neutral image or mildly happy.  Thinking about something riotously funny can actually make control harder because it's just adding another emotion to the existing one.  If you can gracefully exit go the restroom and either let er rip or wash your face in cold water to constrict the blood vessels in your face; they dilate when you are about to cry - that's why your face flushes red.   So really it's control of the physical and the mental.   It helps me a lot to promise myself I can cut loose later if I keep a lid on it now.    Once you can get to a place where you can cry and nobody will bother you, go ahead.  It's actually quite a stressbuster.  You are eliminating the hormones secreted into your bloodstream when you are stressed - cortisol, adrenaline, etc.  These are secreted in your tears and out of your bloodstream.  There is a physiological REASON we feel better after a cry.  We've literally cleared our bloodstreams of a lot of stress related chemicals.   Tears from mechanical irritation like peeling onions contain none of these chemicals - they're pretty much just salt water.|`|DEacde81aa	Pull your eyes out.|`|6UKd0Gedaa	self control|`|IqqaA2wIaa	say to yourself ....im waiting till im in the bathroom....then let it out..|`|skJihSWSaa	when i was little i was told that crying was selfish, cos when you cry you only cry for yourself.

Despite her grave illness and her lost health-battle, she was with you and she gave you a lot good glowing memories for your own future.    You miss her concrete presence. Therefore her presence with you is unfinished. Therefore she is so much present in your own soul, and repeatedly in your own dreams.    You might try and make of her your own loving Guardian Angel, thus listening to her when you are lonesome and in need of advice,    thus talking to her, thus treasuring her presence in your own dreamy life for as much, for as long, as she, her soul, may want to stay in the loving nearby of you.|`|RcAofGkIaa	You need to be happy that you are still able to summon up such clear memories of your nana.

PhPOLgHGaa	i myself am not a doctor nor would i ever say i am,  but i am someone who has helped a few others in such situations a little bit.    you have the right to your privacy--patient/doctor thing..they do not have to really report anything period. it is their duty yes to try and help you and keep you from harm but not to share what you tell them in anyway.     ( look at some of the pshycho cases where the phychologists knew their paitents may have been killers an such but not at liberty to share wht they have said in confidencee)    as far as the one asking to "see" the cutting areas...they may want to see out of concern...to see just how bad it is and to what degree you are cutting...OR.. even perhaps to make sure you are treating the cuts well as to avoid infection an so on that would only cause other issues for you.    as to prove to her you are not attempting suicide, just keep up with your sessions. tell her that is not the point ofthe cutting, that it is just a release a way to forget..not die...you are here for a reason ...that is to get help to get past this. if you were tryin to kill yourself you never wuld have made attempt to gain  help from her or anyone else.    while i myself never cut...i can understand to a degree that it is a release its a pain no one else can understand except you...its an outlet a way to forget what is truely going on inside your mind. to help you forget and focus else where. its kinda like why some ppl are alcholics or drug users...everyone has their own outlet. some are just not as destructive.    i do wish there was an alternative for you not to cut, but only you can chose not to do it anymore. no one can make you, no one can force you or tell you not to. well yes they can tell you not to but you are the only one who can stop you. thoough i do wish you can or would, as not to, you can progress to get worse into worse cutting and then as you get older if by then you have stopped (even if you hadnt) you hve to live with those scares you create for the rest of your life. you deserve better then that.    i know everyone is different and everyone handles things in their own way as well, but there are others out there that can help you, perhaps seek solace at a local church...not saying you need to get all holy roller, but sometimes it may help...Also, maybe meetings with others who have been through sexual abuse as well, it does seem to help many to gain that sort of help. w ll wnt to forget tht horrid experiece and burry it forever deep within us, and sometimes we can, we have BUT eventualy somewhere down the line it comes back to haunt us and bite us in the *** even worse.    you seeking counseling from either of the ppl you have and even coming here is a step in the right direction.       maybe to try an avoid the cutting get yourself a journal book....and write down how you feel at that given time and why you want to cut....and let lose any rampant feelngs and emotions...scream/cry/whatever just let your emotins flow to the paper....maybe this too can be an alternative for you. to just try an avoid it ...to find peace in a different way....if it even helps one out of 5 times its a start..    take care of you huni...i hope you can find the solace you need.    if you ever wana you can drop me a email. not perfect but i maybe can lend an ear once in a while thru there.    ~et~|`|IqqaA2wIaa	answer all her questions....dont lie and keep going to appointments that she says you need....pray for salvation and assistance in Jesus' name|`|Q5gG3R0Saa	You should see someone else. If they're asking to see them and if they don't understand that people cut without trying to commit suicide, they're not very good at what they do.    Can you answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|DsEEATKSaa	Begin by informing your psychologist that you are officially rescinding any release of information form you may have signed which would allow her to contact the college counselor. It is your right to change those release forms or rescind them or put limitations on them at any time you want. Put it in writing (yes, I'm serious). That will take care of the problem of her talking with your college counselor. Drop the phrase "HIPAA related privacy rights" if your psychologist threatens in any way to inform the college. It's inappropriate for her to do so. She should know that.    Next, you need to decide whether or not it is worth it to you to continue with the college counselor. It is quite possible that you will make only very limited progress if you feel compelled to avoid the cutting topic.     It is EXTREMELY UNUSUAL to have a "policy" of informing ANYONE about a student's treatment in the counseling center. Some VERY LIMITED exceptions involve IMMINENT HARM TO SELF OR OTHERS (i.e., suicide/homicidal ideation with means and intent). "Cutting" does not qualify as "imminent danger", unless your cutting is seriously intended to end your life (most cutting is not).    If your college does, indeed, have a "policy" of informing ANYONE regarding students' treatment, they are most assuredly in peril of ethical violations. The vast majority of college students are technically adults. If you are over 18, you have HIPAA related privacy rights.    Your best plan might be to start over with a different psychologist OUTSIDE THE COLLEGE SYSTEM. That way, you can be wholly honest and wholly invested in your treatment without fear of being punished for it in some way by the college.    Hang in there,  ~Dr. B.~|`|tuc0zw7yaa	Actually, it sounds like you really should talk to her about it.  The fact that you hesitate to talk about it tends to indicate a subconscious guilt about doing it, that acknowledges that while this may help you relieve stress, it is a VERY DANGEROUS road to go down.    It is a good idea to have ways to reduce the stress in your life.  It sounds like you are working on being healthy (by losing weight and talking about what is hurting you), but just as it is important to lose weight in a healthy manner and not by starving yourself or using chemical means, it's important that you approach your mental wellness from a healthy perspective.    I would suggest opening up about what you are doing.  The fact that different people do different things to relieve stress supports that what makes and relieves stress is an individual thing.  What stresses me may not stress you, and vice versa.  By the same token, what relieves your stress may not work for me, and vice versa.  The difference between us?  Our mind is the single biggest difference.  What goes on in the mind is a mysterious thing, and is clearly a result of our cumulative past experiences.    By talking to someone about the WHOLE circumstance of what you are doing and why, may very well help you understand it yourself, beyond the simple result that it helps you feel better by relieving your stress.  And hopefully in the end, helps you to find a more healthy way to relieve your stress.    In the meantime, find the beauty in the small things, and have a WONDERFUL day!|`|JTrWRUBiaa	In all honesty, I think part of the solution is to stop cutting yourself.    A professional counselor would be an idiot not to be worried about her patient cutting herself (or himself in the case of male patients).  You may not agree with the counselors actions, but these actions are happening because she is concerned about you.    If she really thought you were suicidal right now, shed be doing more than just asking to see your cuts. Shes looking ahead to potential danger because youre already intentionally hurting yourself.    As long as you continue to hurt yourself, youre proving to others (that know about it) that you are having some legitimate problems (suicidal or not).    So  1) Stop cutting yourself  and/or  2) Try to open up and let the counselor help you  or  3) Someone else suggested that you break of contact with this counselor to seek another that you like better. This is an option too. But no matter which counselor you talk to, youre going to have them concerned about you. Perhaps another counselor will be more tactful than the people youve talked to so far.    I hope you succeed in overcoming this difficult time.    Final note: I'm not a professional. I am honestly trying to help, but my help will only take you so far.

phJfL2wTaa	I think it's more bull, a way to make discrimination suits more inclusive and profitable.  Nice for the lawyers and people who can claim discrimination, bad for business and those special people who have no chance of ever claiming discrimination, based on their race and gender.    Have anyone answering actually read the Act?    Here it is:  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/...    The Act allows people to sue for pay discrimination going back for years instead of allowing the courts to decide.    It is designed to extend suing for pay discrimination extends farther back in time than The Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Good 4 year Tire & Rubber Co., No. 051074 (May 29, 5 2007) had allowed for, the Court ruled that an employee loses her right to sue for pay discrimination if she does not bring her claim within 180 days of her employer's pay decision even if the employee has no reason to believe that that decision is discriminatory. The Court specifically refused to adopt the legal standard urged by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in an amicus brief submitted by a coalition of employees' and women's rights groups, including Legal Momentum: that each unequal paycheck "starts the clock" for a new discrimination claim.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	The Lilly Bedwetter Fair Pay Act sounds frigging awesome to me !

I know Obama supports affirmative action and positive discrimination.    Note: I do not support affirmative action or positive discrimination. It is just another form of prejudice and discrimination. And I might get shot down for this, but Obama has socialist tendencies and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is a reflection of that. Wanting equal outcomes no matter if people work different hours, different jobs or have different levels of responsibility. Women may be paid less but that is because they often take time off from work for family/children, they choose to work at jobs that pay less, and they don't ask for pay raises as much as men do. The workplace should be an enviornment where competence, hard work and responsibility are rewarded, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, creed, etc. This new federal law is a step backwards, not forwards. It is just another form of discrimination. It is infantilizing women and being chivalrous and even chauvinist to women..."Here little lady, you couldn't ask for a raise on your own so we did it for you." No ambitious, talented woman would want affirmative action or positive discrimination as her stepping stone.    I agree with Know It All, this new law will be great for lawyers but for the average woman or even for society? I'm very skeptical.

159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	1. The fossil record clearly demonstrates in an unambiguous way that animals have been changing over time.  It clearly shows speciation and evolution.  The dating of rocks is verified by several different methods.  We would have to throw out the book on nuclear physics, chemistry, and geology to deny the ages.  2.  There are several types of evidence involving genetics beyond the ones I listed.    a.  Humans have a different number of chromosomes than the other great apes but the evidence is very compelling that one of our chromosomes is the result of fusion of two ape chromosomes.  It is beyond difficult to explain the fused chromosome without admitting that humans and apes share a common ancestor. http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome...    b. Mitochondrial DNA studies have been done on thousands of different species.  There is a section of DNA on the mitochondria that doesn't code for proteins and is free to randomly accumulate mutations.  It is used as a sort of clock to show evolutionary relationships.  When they sequence a few hundred base-pairs as is common, the odds of one of those sequences occurring randomly is one over a number with hundreds of zeros.  The sequences show humans are 91% similar to chimps.  We are less closely related to gorillas.  They are not just randomly different.  They are different in a way that suggests a common ancestor of humans and chimps.  Chimps and humans share many of the differences between themselves and gorillas but have had enough time to accumulate many separate differences.  That pattern is consistent with all other animals.  It is powerful mathematical proof of evolution.       c.  Many genes and genetic markers are shared by closely related animals.  Some genes are maintained by virtually all animals but the number of genes that are similar or the same increases as they are more closely related.  That also applies to non-coding regions so the argument that a similar animal will have similar genes is just distortion of actual data.    3.  The logic in the writings of Darwin was so persuasive that it is impossible to ignore without just ignoring the evidence.  We can see it in our domesticated animals and it is silly to think that nature can't select desirable characteristics.  We know the time frames involved and we see how animals, including people, are adapted with regional differences.  If there are persuasive arguments about errors in Darwin's simple logic, I haven't heard them.|`|4HoVVCenaa	The evidence is huge.

In this study it was obvious that each bird species had developed uniquely in a way that suited its environment/its food. It wasn't that eating berries caused a berry picking beak, or catching flies caused a fly catching beak, rather, the birds that 'worked' ( had the right stuff, had that extra exceptional point in their beak) survived to produce offspring and then generations followed, through hundreds of years, gradually creating the new species. And this, I think, is the definition of natural selection.|`|t8f3uvr5aa	The kind of dumb questions that creationists ask here....    proof beyond all doubt that that the evolution of the human brain - and its capacity for rational  thought has ceased developing in a one sub group|`|iuRzYFQ5aa	the cromagnon man|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	http://evolution.berkeley.edu/    There's a link there to the various kinds of evidence.

AA10958272	Do you?    The reference is to the 60s song "Fortunate One" by Credence Clearwater Revival about silver-spoon sons that don't have to go to war, or work (like George Bush, Jr. and Al Gore, Jr.) in the 60s. Rich, coddled, paved way before them. It was one of the more powerful & popular, anti-war songs and was re-done by Bob Seeger in the late-70s or early 80s, at that.

sR7jM0UCaa	Tell someone. Talk to someone about this. Someone you trust. A friend, a teacher or your parents.    It's a serious matter and I doubt that anyone would think you're joking or making things up so you can cause drama. Anyone who cares about you would not think about the situation that way. But if they do then don't let them get you down. Look for someone else you can talk to. Keep looking for help, don't give up.    Listen. You're not alone in this. A lot of people out there, somewhere in this world, are going through the same thing. But there's always hope. I know you're scared, but you have to be brave right now. It's hard but you can do it. No one is stopping you to get help except your fear. So gather up your courage and turn your life around. You can do it, it's time to put yourself first. Right now, it's you that matter.    It wasn't your fault. You didn't know what was going on. You did nothing wrong. He did. But don't let him ruin your life. Don't let him ruin you. He does't have the right to do so. It's your life not his.    My best friend used to cut because of this. But she finally told me about it because she wanted help. A help from someone she can relates to. We talked and she made a promise to stop, for me and for herself. She has not cut herself ever since and now she's happy. See how much change someone can make by getting help?     You can't forget it. Even if you try to forget it, it will find its own way back to you, with more pain. Getting help is not bad. I bet you have some questions that you would like someone to answer. Maybe someone can help you find the answer.    Believe it, you can get help. Be brave. Be strong. You're not alone. You're never alone.    Best Wishes    =]|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes tell your parents....|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	You were a victim. And that has nothing to do with you, you can still be a good person and it does sound like you want your life to move on in a positive way.  You should tell your parents. Yes, it will be hard, but it needs to be done, and we're all behind you.|`|C5ZWclIzaa	Yes, you were definitely abused. The experiences may have attributed to the actions you've stated also. You should really tell your parents about what your brother-in-law did and you could get some form of therapy to help you cope with what you went through.|`|TgUOMBIKaa	Yes, you should tell your parents. And also, go to counseling. It will help you to deal with the anger and helpless feelings that you might be having. You deserve to be able to confront this human. That likes to refer to himself as a man. If  you don't it could effect you later in life.|`|yl0CZsy2aa	sounds like you were.  i'm really sorry about it. speak with your parents.

z99EZvCNaa	I think it's kind of a power trip.  Most men like being in control, having the secretary look, makes them look more subordinate to the man's wishes.      On the converse, you may be right that if it is more of a business woman they are looking for, the power may be the key, either way, the biggest difference will be the attitude given.      Either power trip, or powerful woman, it's still a sexy look.|`|0c7ff2733514381d048fdc22049ffd46aa	They don't they like the confident look.|`|xB9KkAPNaa	Powerful women, naughty but nice maybe?|`|Ae1HcrdCaa	I know my male chauvinist ego is showing here but I really don't care.    Women are much more feminine when they wear a dress. So many male fantasies have to do with being the boss and she comes in... well you get the pic im sure.
q2SzkuaXaa	You mean make demand for it more inelastic?    You need to think up ways to make it so that everyone needs it every day, so it's an essential good. Like food, basic clothing, or housing.    A good example is the mobile phone. Once it was only an accessory for rich City boys, but now almost everyone has one, and they consider it a *necessity of life* (although personally I don't!).    How it's come to be regarded as a necessity I don't know, but it's certainly reached the point where you're expected to have one and people look at you pityingly if you don't. I don't think marketing has had much to do with it though.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	i dont know if you can make it inelastic, it just has to be inelastic already. Maybe you convince that they need it. Or maybe you make the product more addicting?....
PRCfCSDxaa	Rape    A dream about a rape (whether it was you or someone else being attacked in the dream) suggests that you are feeling violated in some way. Something or someone is jeopardizing your self-esteem and emotional well-being. Dreams of rape are also common for those who were actually raped in their waking life.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	you are scared cause there IS someone in ur life who has said they would rape u so ur subconscious mind is warning u
p3AbTmbfaa	Dear Psychology Student,    If you're looking for a system, developed by professionals in psychology, and proven to help psychology sudents get better grades with half the effort, this may be one of the most important messages you read in your college career.    My name is Dr. Doug Kaufman and I'm the creator of AlleyDog.com and the Guide To Better Grades. When Im not doing what my wife calls my real job, I like to spend my time figuring out new ways to help psychology students learn and enjoy psychology... seriously, I really do like to help students succeed!    Before I go on, let me ask you some questions...    Do you feel like you spend a lot of time studying but not getting the grades you really want?    Do you find psychology and all those psychology  definitions easy to understand or confusing?    I have a PhD in psychology and taught psychology for more than 5 years. During that time I saw so many students struggle to learn basic psychological principles and all those psychology terms, definitions, and jargon.    I cant tell you how many times students came up to me and said, I went to class, but none of that stuff made sense. I looked it up the information in my textbook and now Im more confused than ever. I'm studying a lot, but I'm still not getting good grades. Can you please explain this stuff to me?    Is psychology really that difficult to learn?    In my opinion, the problem isnt that psychology is so hard to understand, its that the material used to teach it and learn it is not written in simple, clear, concide ways.    I dont claim to have all the answers but one thing I am confident about is that most educational materials and tools are really confusing!!! This includes textbooks, glossaries, workbooks, study guidesall of them. It seems like all of these things are written for experts who already know the material and not for students trying to learn and understand the material. Why isnt all of this information written for the students?    This seems ridiculous to me, so when I wrote the Guide To Better Grades, I made a checklist of what I wanted it to be...        * I wanted the guide to make complex concepts EASY TO UNDERSTAND.      * I wanted the guide to contain information students actually NEED to succeed.      * I wanted the guide to REDUCE CONFUSION, not increase it.      * I wanted the guide to teach students to study SMARTER, not harder.      * I wanted the guide to teach students how to learn more in LESS TIME. After all, school is about a lot more than classes, so you need time to do other things.    And that's exactly what I created with The Guide to Better Grades. And you dont have to take my word for it. Thousands of students have told me how great it is and how much it helped them. The quotes on the right are real quotes from real students.    Dont get me wrong, Im not saying this is a way out of doing work. Success doesnt come without workif you want to succeed you have to study and work hard (of course this allows you to also play hard!). But the reality is that learning and understanding psychology doesnt have to be as hard as people make it.    OK, so what does all this come down to? What am I saying? I'm saying that The AlleyDog.com Guide to Better Grades: How to Ace your Psychology Classes is the one book you need to be a better student and get better grades in all of your psychology classes! If you want something to really help you do better, then you need the guide.    It doesn't matter at type of student you are right now--the Guide to Better Grades can help you improve. Thousands of students have already benefited from the guide and you can too.    Forget the confusing texts and the worthless workbooks--If you want specific steps for getting better grades while studying fewer hours, and with less aggravation, then this guide is for you!    I know that if you just try it, it will absolutely help you do better in your psychology classes. Just try it and if you don't believe it's helping you get better grades I'll give you a full refund with no questions asked. There is zero risk to you and tons of benefit.    Just Imagine...        * Not getting stressed out about grades, tests, or assignments anymore.      * No more all-night cram sessions.      * No more feeling guilty for not learning the material.      * No more making up excuses for not getting A's on your exams.      * Not spending any more time asking your teachers why you're not getting better grades.      * No more wondering why you're spending so much time studying but not getting good grades.      * No more wondering why students half as smart as you are getting better grades than you.      * Spending half the time studying and getting better grades!         With The Guide to Better Grades, You Will...        * Learn more in less time.      * Be a more effective and efficient student.      * GET BETTER GRADES.      * Learn strategies for answering true/false, multiple choice, and essay|`|IqqaA2wIaa	google it and go to the copshop to ask if you can talk to someone who does that for their job...|`|Z4lSscNVaa	Take some courses the first year or two in college and you'll get an idea of what you really want to do.
1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	I would think it may have to do with endorphins, kind of like "runner's high". I can also see it as a stress reliever, much like a lot of physical activity.
rLP9wjPtaa	No. It takes money to make money, the more you make, the less you trickle down.|`|c1379040fcc5c4a581798d49a39f2446aa	ever pee into a urnial?   then you see how gravity works
DVuWsb2raa	Yes I have heard, and I have also experienced.     Upon meeting one of my best friends when I started college-- we would pass each other in the dorm halls-- and give each other this look. I looked at her because she was so familiar-- though I had never met her in my life-- grew up in different parts of the country bla bla bla.. But I was drawn to her. And she was drawn to me.. so finally one night we were out on the roof (in Chicago rooftops are aplenty) and we smoked the same brand of clove.. (who smokes clove cigarettes anyway) and I could smell it-- so I walked over to her.. and she asked me "I know  you from somewhere-- where could it be?" 2-3 years went by.. and I called her telling her I had this wild dream where the two of us were living in the 60's and I died-- and she stopped me and said-- "OH man-- me too.." and she completed the dream for me almost exactly how it was while i was sleeping. The only explanation we have to this.. a past life memory.. about a year after this happened.. I went to a "psychic" and she told me that the few people I am good friends with, all died really young in their most recent past life, around the same time i did.. and that I died in the 60's-- born in the 40's and she described my good friend Carly who shared this memory with me-- with advise for her-- which was really fitting at the time.     There are 3 people I can confirm (well.. as much as you can confirm something like this) Who also believe we have known each other in a past life and have experienced "memories" with then.. My boyfriend(he use to be my best friend--started dating 9 months ago after a 5 year friendship), and 2 best friends.     I also know a woman who guides in past life regression.. she is not "psychic" but she understands the meditation process.. I am only aware of 2-3 other past lives I may have had, but not in detail.     I do not think that every person is able to experience "past lives" just like not everyone can reach the proper level of meditation. Ever since this experience.. I have tried to put pieces together-- and I use meditation to "learn" about past lives. Tarot also helps with this.. but not everyone is into tarot, or meditation.. or past lives. But those encounters I have had with past lives are about as real as the can be.. there is nothing like that feeling of.. "Wow.. this is tooo familiar."|`|jSBtdhf0aa	yea  but i dont belive in that .  i think they are just recalling dreams they cant understand.|`|vmv1rP76aa	Personally, I believe in the possibility of reincarnation, given my beliefs lean towards the New Age-y type.     You may want to read up on some books, such as Past Lives, Future Healing, and about past life regressions in general. There's a doctor who specializes in past life regressions, he has a few books out (don't remember the name) It seems possible.|`|BM7g41IBaa	Those people are schizophrenic, just like the people on the subway who claim that Jesus touched them or something.|`|ICpgOCQaaa	Yes, I have had a past life as a woman called Mary.  Most of the details of my life as mary are completely verifiable, and are known in detail by the surgeon who completed my gender reassignment.|`|KQ9co341aa	no, but i think it is perfectly plausible. think about it, if you believe in heaven and hell why not? there is no right answer to weather reincarnation, Ghosts, heaven, hell or any other beliefs are correct.

Not so much worry about the future.|`|SUR1MHqWaa	Omg yes!|`|pWA3gybAaa	yes it would. I would buy a million acres and raise Zebras|`|e4984fff739610fd75449d66ba5516a1aa	It would sure take the sting out of being poor!|`|z5M8xfhXaa	Not exactly|`|hat60KYXaa	It would make me less worried about bills and such.|`|QTxdNavKaa	Yes - just remember to take it easy. Just because your rich it doesn't mean there's more to worry about - see it as making life a little bit smoother for you and resist splashing out too much :)    The secret to happiness is simplicity, money is just a tool, not a part of your life.|`|fb5ac5faab424efb3d1e35f8fd315050aa	Oh yeah.|`|QB3dXwsDaa	Nah.  Look at all these messed up crazy rich people.  I don't need any of that stuff.|`|skJihSWSaa	without a doubt yes|`|O15my3olaa	If you have it but misuse it, you can become poorer and unhappy.    And having too much of it, would likely give you more troubles and stress, which you cant imagine right now. Be happy with what you have and what you are is a good motto.|`|ALidyPnXaa	Temporarily, yes.|`|BNhLWBEqaa	Yes, but I agree that the there would be still many things that money can`t resolve, so maybe I would be just balanced with good&bad|`|bDPU6qWiaa	like YEA|`|35BLOIgOaa	yes|`|Kil7sZUSaa	Happier yes but not necessarily fulfilled.|`|bNa2IXCraa	NO,Money does not buy HAPPINESS nor does it BUY you LOVE!!!!xxx|`|sbsbCTZGaa	yes but not if i had to do something to someone i love to get it|`|9c34c7a7ad663d73b2aa40d6cd0868d7aa	Yes. I can pay off my debt faster, be able to start school again, and just have an easier life if I earned more money. By relieving some of that stress, money can make ppl happier.|`|SxT4kIbnaa	They say not having money can make you unhappy...but unfortunately having money doesn't make you happier!......strange but true...|`|dazBEG9waa	A little bit.|`|LCIaikPlaa	Yes, for as long as it took me to spend it.|`|6S8BaJkuaa	i can't see how people can say money doesn't make you happy because honestly it DOES.. its just how you use the money if it makes you happy or not.x|`|QivKZLcUaa	no. because if u had lodz ov money people will neva be genuine around u. it will certainly make ur life more comfortable but happiness you cant buy x
QJwOhM0qaa	I would treat it like my wallet getting stolen and change/ cancel EVERYTHING!  I would change my e-mail address, credit cards, put a block on access to my credit...  You can e-mail everyone from the former address and let them know you are changing and why.   Other than that you really should pursue a restraining order. Nowadays I believe they do include internet related things as well.    good luck!!|`|2FtkHC2vaa	If you ask me this story sounds bogus to me. If you knew who took your stuff, than why didn't you have this guy locked up? If this is true, than you need to change all your passwords, That's no brainier. CHANGE ALL OF YOUR PASSWORDS!!!|`|Z9gu0vMlaa	Are you saying the intruder broke your door down stole your computer,   Then he came back to fix the door?   I am unclear on this..   This is a very sick situation if I am reading it correctly and you need to involve the police with a restraining order and beef up your security as well as cancel all your data.   Beefing up the security is very important as restraining orders do not always work especially when you are dealing with a deranged mind.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	cancel or delete the email account|`|wjCJhxPZaa	Change all your details, Get new email accounts, and keep your new passwords in a secure place.    Then, hire some computer hackers to empty his bank accounts, sign him up to the armed forces, frame him for fraud and treason, add his details to the pedophile watch lists, and link him with Osama Bin Laden. Then sit back and watch him receive the consequences of making you feel the way you do...    Either that or wait for Karma to do the exact same thing.|`|iaDKzFVHaa	restraining Order TODAY!
edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	Yeah I do believe that too and in both directions.  If someone isn't very physically attractive and they are nice, funny and real they get better looking.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well smoking does effect your physical  appearance and yellows your teeth.  Drinking ages you also.  If you notice people on shows like Judge Judy, you will notice people seem older than their actual age because of drug and alcohol abuse.  It can make you look 10 years older.  Just because someone is pretty, doesn't make them a nice person, or a good wife, or a good mother, or a good citizen, it just makes them pretty.  Pretty people get divorced and know pain and sorrow just like the rest of us.|`|9bcCsZbPaa	well smoking damages your skin, so maybe your seeing the effects of that.  i kinda agree with you, but i guess it really depends on that person.|`|96wixYvMaa	Well, smoking CAN effect you physically.
rLP9wjPtaa	I would disagree.   Americans eat more bananas per capita than any other nation.|`|bc1202e9aa15ed85d573b1219c69b9cdaa	Wrong. Trading with others makes us richer. It allows us to concentrate on those things we do well. We can then use the benefits of that, financially, to purchase the goods and services we desire. That is true of a person, a family, a state, or a nation.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Your statement is true, but America is not the most self sustainable country considering we dont even have a manufacturing base anymore and we export everything from other countries, mostly China.
S8onSHvoaa	I can tell you the stereotype of the United States is an arrogant, obese, McDonald's guzzling and selfish jerk.    France is usually cowards and very hairy people. Who like wine and bread and cheese.    Other then that, I don't know about the others.|`|T1i54bPVaa	ur a wierdo|`|71mE0r7kaa	Stereo types are false and a way of gaining negative energy. Not a good thing to do.
WwXrTQgaaa	Because when the first time fails, you are FORCED to do it again. The first time, nobody is forcing you to 'do it right'.    It's all in laziness and procrastination.    Excellent question!|`|4c7QomPoaa	If you've never done something before, it tends to take more time to complete.  Often we don't allocate enough time to not only do something but to learn as we work on it.  After the first time we're more knowledgeable, and we can use the time allocated more efficiently.  It's related to "learning from your mistakes".|`|ICpgOCQaaa	Look, check what you write next time you write a sentence, then you can get it right first time.  'Why IS there IS never time...' - if you are thorough first time, you won't have to do it again!|`|BNhLWBEqaa	Great question !  Well, this isn`t really true  You can do things RIGHT in the first time too  I think is only on your Luck

rLP9wjPtaa	This is difficult to determine.  a. would be true in a nation where capital funds are cheap and plentiful, like say the US now.  b. would be true in a nation where capital is expensive and scarce  so c. might be the case as well  and d. could also be true, where 401(k) type things could be involved.|`|N9XEvwQLaa	The Correct Answer is A.  This is what the paradox of thrift is all about.  Saving more is generally a good thing for most individuals.  But if everyone does it all at once, then demand for goods and service takes a dive.  Subsequently, less goods and services are produced and national GDP goes down.  As a result, people in the economy are less well off if everyone dramatically increases their savings rate all at once.    Pauly
AA11824688	Firstly, you must diagnose WHAT it is you feel that you are lacking.   A new way of life might change things for you - and that 'way' can be whatever you choose.  Always remember - Life is no HAPPY story (the way we all wish it is). It has its ups and downs. Being optimistic is very vital - but this doesn't mean everything for you will be happy, life is hard and everyone experiences life's roller-coaster (not wholly a joyful ride might i say).    Nevertheless, search your innerself, discover your innerself. That way, you won't feel 'LOST' because you'll know you and you'll also know what you want/are missing/need etc.    It's a very complex thing trying to help someone 'get out of the dark' because we all hold different torches which light diferent pathways. And i as an individual, do not 'know' you, so my advice would only be that 'placebo' to make you feel like 'YOU'RE BOSS OF YOURSELF - YOU CHOOSE'.    Hope that helps!|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|4c7QomPoaa	Perhaps you've come to realize that being a "party girl" doesn't really constitute a healthy and productive life.  It sounds like you're ready for more change.  Living in the moment is good, but not doing anything with that life isn't.  If you don't want to go to school, don't.  But do yourself a favor and reconsider it.  AND, whether or not you continue your education, you need to decide what you want to do with your life.|`|AA11288692	Your looking to belong. You've changed because the people you hung with are someplace else now.  So, either find something that you feel like your going to make a difference in, or stop wasting my air and become someone elses HOSTEL experiment.|`|AA11309179	Its Simple... Kill tHe bAtmaN!!!    no seriously...  after having a nice "out of your bubble" experience, you expanded your social network, and now you need to purge it.. pay attention to your personal needs and desires, give yourself a break on life, go on vacations, something but you must do it on yourslef or with your most close friends only...     think about what you want in life and stuff like that.

I like other people to take me in hand from time to time, but I am more than capable of holding my own.  I am best at taking it like a man.  However, I always come to a very big conclusion.
wgZVeLZPaa	Yes, you should wear a sign that says you have a small wiener. Or better yet, how about a neon sign that blinks and points to it and it just says "SMALL, REALLY SMALL".|`|OI7eeIreaa	Wear a skirt and blouse.  Then when they find out you do have a d1ck, they'll be totally surprised.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	No that's ok, you keep your wiener to yourself thanks|`|62ZBofvPaa	Um no...do you have a humiliation fetish or something?  Haha...|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Many women who have small breasts receive similar treatment, though it doesn't make it right.   So, no.|`|HltEZkvQaa	DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS!|`|71mE0r7kaa	No, don't do that. Sounds outrageous. Just be you!|`|dYwvTj5Caa	I'm sure ladies do not want to know about your wiener, anyways. :)|`|6S8BaJkuaa	a small wiener does not matter at all!! .. remember darling its how you use it not how big it is!!!! (;|`|AXNowGPyaa	There is actually a bill (expected to pass next week) before the legislature as we speak which will require all men with small wienies to register with their local "Board of Single Women." Small wienie men will be issued a card that they will be required to produce upon first contact with any single female. At that point it is her decision whether or not further verbal or physical humiliation should be required of you.     It's true that a vocal minority of the bill's original sponsers wanted to require such men to sew a tag that says "small wienie" on all of their shirts, but this was rejected as an "unfunded mandate."
BCWa81Ygaa	When I was your age I loved to walk/sprint around on my street. I also loved to write short stories based on some of the things I was going through at that time. Do you like to cook?

It all depends on the individual situation of the child. A male child will most likely be more affected than a female child, but the most important aspect is a positive environment. Fathers are not the only male role models in children's lives and those men can show them how men act and respond in relationships and in situations. Different people can react differently in differing situations, both positive and negative. One man who did not have a father in his life may end up not being in the lives of his own children while another man who grew up in the same way may be a great father while another may over indulge his kids trying to make up what his father did not do for him.|`|2ZYZr0sJaa	I can only tell you how this relates to me in my life, all people are different so reactions to this type of situation can vary. I grew up without my father and although it was hard sometimes I did learn a very important lesson from it, I knew early on exactly how I wasn't going to act as an adult so even though he wasn't around I still learned an important lesson from him and I am grateful for it, it all depends on how a person chooses to view the situation, early on I had a lot of resentment towards my father but my mother was there to set me straight and slowly I let all of that anger and resentment go, if a young person has a good mother and a stable home life then I cant see why you wouldn't grow up to be great girlfriend/wife.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	only if you let it effect you  that way.
UjTX851faa	Well it seems to me that you have a lot of strange encounters in your dreams. Some that may even come true... This seems to me like the dreams where you are dreaming what you really are feeling on the outside. Strangely it is flipped for you so what your feeling in your dreams happens to you in real life. It just means that you are association things into your dreams from outside. I would have to know more about your actual dream cycles to say exactly what it is, but I think I may have a good idea. Dont worry though this is normal truthfully. For this type of dreaming anyway do not worry about it to much. Im sure your just wondering...   Hope that helps.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Choke / Choking    To dream that you are choking on an object, suggests that you may find it difficult to believe some advice, or accept what someone is telling you. If you are choking on food, then it may be an expression of your guilt about something. To dream that someone is choking you, means you are suppressing your feelings - you have difficulties in showing your fear, anger, or love. Alternatively, you may feel that you are being prevented or restricted from freely expressing yourself. If you dream that you are choking a person, you have feelings of aggression towards someone. You may also be trying to prevent something from being said or revealed. Also see "Heimlich Maneuver."|`|cP6uWIhHaa	I don't know why people have certain dreams but after reading your question I just thought you MAY want to read these websites below.

I dont know if you ever had a dream that came from a connection to someone elses problems but think back to the other dream and try to remember if anything happened soon after that.  As far as the fighting evil goes, I had a dream once about a black abis and felt so much evil and fear in my dream I was actually crying when I woke up....a few days later a family friend died who had been strugling to get right with God before he passed. Good luck .

Neophobia - Fear of anything new.  Somniphobia - Fear of sleep.  Topophobia - Fear of certain places or situations, such as stage fright.  Tropophobia - Fear of moving or making changes.    And this one for the next time you didn't do your homework:  Didaskaleinophobia - Fear of going to school.    Or you don't want to go to church  Homilophobia - Fear of sermons.

Well I met people at work and at the library and I met people who had similar interest in crafts that I shared or gardening.  I have dogs, and so I meet people while I am training or walking my dogs.  It is easier to meet people if you are accessible to them.  I met people in school clubs, not bars, and in church groups.  Figure out what your best interest are in and do things that surround that.  Ask people about themselves, people like to talk about themselves.  Ask "What's on your mind?" and then let them talk.  You can talk about music, or books, or sports, or whatever you are interested in, or what is going on in the news where you live.  If you never go out, you never meet people, and even if you try to make a friend and fail, try again with someone else.

dstvm3zRaa	one advantage is that you can be more free, in that if you were in a relationship, you wouldn't be bogged down by the other person's morals and things of that nature. one disadvantage is that you can't have a personal friendship or trusting bond with a person outside your family.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The advantages of being single....less cooking, cleaning, laundry, ironing, grocery shopping, you can decorate anything, people accept you for who you are, you can travel and go anywhere and do anything when ever and where ever you want to.  Mainly you don't have to put up with in laws.  If I had any idea how bad in laws were going to be I would never have gotten married.    Disadvantages of being single..... you have to put gas in your car all by yourself.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think it is mostly a disadvantage. Married people have more social support (companionship), more income, better benefits at work (like only one of the couple has to get a job with health benefits & the other one can go on that plan too, so you're much less likely to go without health insurance), and pay lower income taxes in most cases. They can share expenses on housing and other things. Also, they tend to eat better I'm sure, since a person can cook a healthy meal for two people, whereas if it was just themselves, they wouldn't bother, since it is kind of time consuming. Food is cheaper when you buy it in bigger batches too - single people have to buy the expensive small size of everything, or it spoils. It is well-proven that married people enjoy more frequent sex, and it is usually safe sex (unless one partner is cheating).  Married people on average, would have a larger social network as well, since they have their spouses family to interact with too. Usually there are a few people they like in their spouse's family.  For introverts, this is a HUGE advantage.  Also, if you are sick, your spouse can pick up the slack for you while you are recuperating. If you have surgery or a serious illness, this is a big advantage.    Advantage of being single? You can do whatever you want, whenever you want to do it.  You don't have to answer to anyone. That freedom is really nice.  If you want to move, move.  If you want to stay up all night and play the guitar or piano, fine. Or just watch TV all night. If you are married, your spouse wouldn't like that!|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Only one advantage stands out over ALL others, no one blames me for leaving the toilet seat up. Each time I did, it was simply because I forgot, not that I had some harmful intent, HONEST. Yet, I got the worst harangues from my now ex when her bottom ended up on cold porcelain. My question for the women in my life who were an occasional victim of my forgetfulness is, why don't you simply LOOK before you leap, so to speak? EVERY woman I was married to or lived with at one time or another over the past 40 years has not looked at one time or another and blamed ME. I feel this is UNFAIR to me, but it IS an advantage of living alone. The one thing I REALLY miss is the company, the waking late at night, and knowing there is a nice warm body next to me. I miss the sound of her breathing. It can get very quiet at 3 AM when I awake and am all alone except for the ticking clocks in the living room. That said, I tolerate living alone very well. I am not lonely nor do I feel sorry for myself that my marriages each ended after about 10 years each. I have a son, 35 on his last birthday who lives half a continent away and is doing well. On between marriages and after the last one came apart, I have lived on and off with a number of women. I enjoy the company of women. I find women to be fascinating creatures, all the same, yet at the same time all so beautifully unique. I LOVE women. I LOVE interacting with women. I LOVE making love with a woman. Yes, I miss the company sometimes, but as I said, I do not get lonely, I just live alone for the moment... You wouldn't happen to know a sweet young thing, 60ish, HWP, 2-X chromosomes, (transgender need not apply until ALL the surgery is completed!) AND unencumbered by such trivial inconveniences as a husband or toddlers, would you? I'm in the market...

14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	First of all the person who is really insecure has no idea that he/she is insecure.  Their MINDs cause them to see people, places, and things around themselves as "causing" their discomfort.    What you are describing are the symptoms of diverting ones attention from oneself by engaging in things external to oneself, and yes, people who have a fear of their Yang energy nature ["male" out-going nature of the MIND] do tend to identify themselves by the things around themselves and the people they "know".    Look at the term itself "insecure" which means lacking security.  The typical person who is insecure is lacking a sense of being secure because this person had parents who were fearful of intimacy.    This taught the person that it is not OK to reach out for hugs, or to receive affection.  Being cut off from this natural way of reinforcing ones OKness, one tends to pull within more and more, and what lies within oneself?  A misperceived monster.  At least this  is what ones MIND believes, and of course with this within oneself, one is insecure!    Peace|`|cOsDlKhWaa	are clingy people more loyal, and those that are not, more disposable?    I do not intend to marry. one reason being that at a younger age i was criticized for wanting a relationship (clingy). now that i am promiscuous i obviously 'only' want, 'or will get' one thing. ironic in a way.    For the insecure complainer that i am, i have the comfort of being complained too for lack of communication. for which I MUST thank!     Materialistic capitalism is continual instant gratification predominantly in my eyes. those that remain loyal with no feed of this gratification are your true friends. I would give my all to be sure of continual cheep travel in receipt of a little culture.     To me it appears to often that the house is never quite good enough, the car is the old model, the mp3 the wrong fashion. lets hope there is somthing else lerking within the mind set that is 'freedom'.|`|DOWwk7Gfaa	I think insecure people do tend to be more materialistic, because they feel the need to say "Look at me, I have all this stuff, I'm so cool." I find that insecure people also tend to be clingy. Very, very clingy. They feel that if this person doesent like you, there must be something wrong with them, and that that particular person or group of people's opinion defines who they are. So, in short, yes. THey surround themselves with poeple, tend to be materialistic and even put others down to make them feel better.

gmaCvh00aa	A good therapist will either not want to put you on a/d's, or if they do, it should be just as a temporary aid to advance the therapy.    It's not like the movies.  What a therapist does is listen to what you say and watch your body language to see what you are really saying unconsciously and then identify areas that may be a problem for you.  We are all pretty simple to figure out in certain ways, and there are human characteristics we all share so the problems are identifiable, whether you are Bill Gates or some cannibal in South America.  The therapist can see certain ways in which you may be psychologically harming yourself because of beliefs (not meaning religious beliefs, just overall ways of viewing life) you may hold and not even realize you hold.  He or she can then ask questions, say things, etc., to get you to examine how and why you think something. They do NOT tell you what to do, which oddly, many people seem to think.  What happens is something called transference--you begin to see the therapist the same way you see other people in your life, especially the people with whom you have the most difficult relationships.  You might get angry at your therapist at some point--this is good.  It's pretty interesting--often when you say two seemingly unrelated things right next to each other, there IS a connection, even though it's not obvious at first.    It helped me a lot, but you must remember to work with them--they are blank slates for you to reflect yourself onto.    If you are interested in reading about psychotherapy, the two books below are really good.    I am sorry about the loss of your step-dad.

cWxwHMQWaa	Yeah, boys are more vicious physically, but don't seem to be as emotionally cruel.     I've always wondered why, since as adults we tend to be more alike than not (men and women), meanwhile children/teens can be pretty different.    That said, there were always boys who tortured other boys verbally/emotionally too...makes me lean more toward how they're raised.     I've always had a mean/violent streak. With age I get better at controlling it though, maybe most of us do. Never understood why I was this way really. Was always grateful though that I was raised well and taught to know how severe it is to hurt someone's feelings badly, so I always worked to do my best not to. When I get really upset though, this can go out the window and I do hurt people, feel horrible for it afterward =o(    Maybe they never learned that until they were adults?    Interesting, yeah the more I think of it the more it defies logic, no idea beyond maybe since girls are taught 'hitting' is wrong, all we have is our words and other actions that aren't violent?     Dig the new avatar btw, rockin'! If you ever have an album, that should be the cover art! =o)    ** Maybe because I was physically violent I got the release and didn't feel compelled to be so emotionally cruel?

And the truth is, I really dont know.|`|096b7gBHaa	girls often feel insecured, which makes them think that a single act of mercy would make them a loser/servant, thus they would choose to be cruel.     because being cruel is the easiest way to make you believe that you have put others down and make your own self superior, although you end up looking stupid to people with good head on their shoulders.     the best thing is when they think that their cruel acts work as a monster although in fact they're just like some soft pitch cry babies to people with strong heart.     the thing is that you can always be a giver without being a loser, for as long you have enough sources to give to others, so there's nothing to lose. "enough" here isn't about financially, but the confidence which comes from gratitude. of course it takes effort to built it, like money where you can't get them in a second.    and why must you be a giver? -because people are your mirrors, and what you're giving to them is what you're giving to yourself, for as long you can believe strong enough that they're your mirrors, not you're their mirrors.    but since girl like to get themselves influenced with the surroundings, this has made them the mirror of others. so that's where the confidence issue is

If they asked where I work I'd say, "I'm in *insert field*," but I wouldn't give the specific company name, location, etc. Then I'd ask a question like, "How about you? What do you do?"|`|VL0FwgaOaa	You can always just say what the job is, but not the name of it, like Oh I work at a distribution center, or a small company in town, or a restaraunt.. or tell them your not comfortable disclosing that.. or lie lol!|`|nY2hZrUMaa	just say....  oh just some new company that no ones heard of|`|wJ45gsyZaa	I'd go with, "I just work in town." or "sorry if it offends you, but I just want to keep that personal."  Most people are pretty understanding because we all want to stay safe.|`|L1QldjDuaa	WHEN A STRANGER ASK YOU ANY KIND OF QUESTION JUST RESPOND WITH SOME OUT OF THE ORDINARY ANSWER LIKE I'M A BUFFER IN THE PORN INDUSRTY { JUST AN EXAMPLE}|`|79c050086b45622e955e8f2668a40387aa	say you're an international worker, so you don't work at the same place all the time!|`|HGw9CGjWaa	You are definitly not paranoid. I would not give away personal information to anyone i didnt trust. Either make up a place where you work, ignore the question by saying "where do you work" , or tell them that you hardly know them and dont think it is any of their business. If they ever do anything else, stalk you, threaten you, etc, go directly to the police.|`|LkKVHdWhaa	If you really want to build a friendly relationship with the person, don't lie. Just respond with asking him where he works. If he answers then ask him something else that's not to personal. Just try to avoid that question.  Hope this helps!|`|5BmnSiqUaa	No harm in giving out a generalized answer such as "Manhattan," "Boston," "Los Angeles," or "uptown/downtown (provided that would be a major metropolitan area)."  Similarly, you may respond by just mentioning the industry (health care, manufacturing, government, clown tossing).    You're not super paranoid, you're super sensible.  Note that security professionals place a very high value in one's instincts and gut feel in any given situation.  You found yourself thrust into one where your gut warned you, you followed and 'lived to tell the tale.'    Good luck and stay safe.|`|AA10880720	Tell what you do, not where though.

PERV!|`|qm6l1HXvaa	just say why the hell do you care you creepppppp !|`|oK0dVX6eaa	No not paranoid at all, just tell them what you do and leave it at that.    Me: Where do you work?  You: I am a cashier at a local dept store!  Me: Which one?  You: I'd rather not say!    and be done with it....if your not comfortable than your not comfortable!|`|JSPTHPv2aa	don't give them any information just say u don't work or lie what u work as! hope this helped!|`|M0SLQimtaa	You may be a little paranoid, it's not like they asked for your address.  However, if the looked shady...|`|AlZPIAtmaa	I punch them in the throat.    Or, I tell them    I think you're being super paranoid.    Maybe you have your reasons, though.  Where DO you work?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Don't tell them the company name, tell them the business.    I work for a large software company.  Isntead of, I work for IBM.|`|zhk8o514aa	I would be as vague as possible. "At a retail store" , "at a food store",or "I answer phone calls"    That way you kinda sorta answer the strangers question and yet kept your privacy.|`|tae4IGumaa	I would ask if they had candy in their car|`|AA12203329	Tell them the IRS...nobody messes with them!!|`|AA12107422	I don't ever give out specifics, especially to strangers. I just tell them I do accounts payable for a local contractor & in Southern Louisiana -- they will never figure that one out!|`|K6KeN7sgaa	If they were strangers, I'd have no problem whatsoever simply saying, "Sorry, that goes under the category of "personal info."    And NO, you are NOT "super paranoid" you're just being cautious. Which, in this day and age -- is SMART. Good for you!|`|ShLuWq1Eaa	Your super paranoid, but thats not a bad thing at all. At least you know that your not going to get stalked now.    Next time someone asks you that just straight out lie and say you work at the mall. Don't say which store but just say at the mall. And if they ask which store say Gap or something.    Lie lie and lie some more|`|hz7oaQeqaa	Typically if someone asks me that, I hand them my business card.  Before I had cards, i'd let them know.  If someone wants to stalk me, wth, at least i know i'm loved....ha|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	"I'm not at liberty to say"  Sounds mysterious, and will bug the heck out of them|`|967a4775c02dc2dd40b45608b213d540aa	well maybe you could mention the company name.  Maybe you work at a place someone can't really locate.  Like i work for a flood company BUT we are in a major name bank building.  there are 8 floors and the bank building houses different companies.  so if i mentioned to someone what I did or where I worked, they really wouldn't know unless they looked it up.  And who would go through the trouble.      Either that or be completely honest.  Not everyone likes divulging personal info.  I probably wouldn't tell a complete stranger where I worked.  I'd probably put it more in the format of what I do.|`|AUsvrW8faa	I think you are a little on the paranoid side.    You can always say - "I work for a company in (name the town)"  Or I work for a (name the industry) company.  Or you can just say the name of the company.  I don't think there is anything they can do with that info.|`|0udjgaoBaa	Im a computer developer for a small company in pakistan, near germany.|`|sG7E4vDgaa	Say, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."|`|hFQa24wOaa	Lie.

GSDpwfymaa	First let me say sorry you are going through this I am sure it makes it hard for you to focus on your future. What you do in high school has such a huge outcome in what kind of career and life you will have later on so as much as possible try to stay focused of why you are there daily and know the time will fly by and soon hopefully you will be on your way to college while most of the goof offs who were to busy watching you will be on there way to a series of dead ends.    Also do all that you can to build your self esteem. The best way to do this is in setting goals and achieving them. Start small and each time you accomplish something you will feel and be better and stronger.     Good luck and remember high school soon passes and than the world is free fun and open to fulfill your every dream!|`|34HQietTaa	The most important thing is, do you like the way you look?  It does not matter what others think of you but what you think of yourself is most important.  No matter what, it is the inside of a person that should count and not what they are like on the outside.  There are good people in every size and shape.  Those who are calling you names don't like themselves much so they decided to mess with you.  Be a better person than they are and ignore them.|`|WId3UikRaa	Look in the mirror,  see that beautiful face?  Think you could loose a few?  Don't be afraid, let the adventure begin.  Walk, no sodas, less sugar.  Come on smile, you know you can do it, and look whats waiting for you, go on, look in the mirror.  That's what I'm talking about..|`|AA12324252	Don't listen too that BS about fat is beautiful, God loves you just the way you are. be happy of the way you are,It's all B.u.l.l.s.h.i.t. Do what I did. I had this fool who kept doing and saying the same stuff you had to put up with. Here is what I did. I knew I was going to be confronted at lunch by this creep so it was time for revenge. I put a small dusting of pepper in the palm of my hand and as soon as he started I put my palm up to my nose and really sucked it  up my nose.Boy did that make the tears come. A teacher witness the whole thing. Well I started to bawl really loudly until I had snot all over my face. Everyone was looking at him like he was crap. He was all red in the face when teacher told him too apologize. He did. That's when I got my revenge. I thanked him and put my arms around him and wiped my snot all over his neck. AWWWW Sweet revenge. He never bothered me again !|`|PhPOLgHGaa	its very difficult to deal with when ppl make fun of you i know...but for the most part as hard as it is, the best thing to do is ignore them and move on...it does tend to make them tire of doing it when they gain no reaction from you.    if you can avoid them do so as well.    and for you, if you yourself feel you need to lose some weight.NOT because someone else said so...then do it for you and only you. if not only for your self esteem but for your health.    take care huni.    ~et~|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Ignore them. Makes them madder!|`|GLDXjJfaaa	honestly kids are so stupid..dont even give it a second thought, unless you would like to loose weight, if you want to then you can, just do it.    if you dont, like omg who the **** gives a **** anyway!!    hope all is good anyway xx|`|X1NVjZEKaa	People are so mean, you are ok and beautiful as you are. It may be hard but do not listen to them.     Just give them a simple "F*ck you" and walk away :)|`|W76VDFKCaa	Work out and eat healthy to loose weight for healthy reasons, not because of how you look.  Then when you go back to your reunion, you can call those same people the same names.  Believe me, I just attended my 10 yr reunion last year and to see all those people who have gained weight.  And remember, the people who call you names and make fun of you are insecure and unhappy with themselves.  They have to put others down to make themselves feel better.|`|3zuM02pJaa	Ignore whomever is calling you that!|`|4gytoih8aa	people are jerks like ^ that person,  just ignore them  ill pray that everything gets better for you  Jesus loves you.|`|524665b6755edcb7830e49f9690bd570aa	diet
YiY9Yd2Jaa	Vain? Don't you have to have something to focus vanity on?     She is an opportunist, her opinions are based on "profitable" contention. She used to be a deliberately self styled sex object when she was at Sydney Uni, always bra-less with see through clothing and was involved with a rather sleazy sex magazine. Do a little research and see where her first efforts at writing were published - many feminists would be flabbergasted. But then Gloria Steinem was a Playboy Bunny.      Still, Greer is an amusing old tart, always good for a laugh. I have an uncle who was at Uni with her. Said she went through a radical change as she lost her looks and figure.|`|F1mIcFoTaa	And an eloquent mind does not equal vanity. We love Germaine Greer and your words mean nothing to us.    Edit - "She says things like " big breasts are the result of a hyper active petuitary gland and small hands are a malformation""    Germaine Greer has never said that. You're silly!|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	I completely agree - I feel so sorry for the 1st wavers who fought for equal rights, whose name is now being used to support whatever some radicals want. People like her and other extremists should not be associated with those who actually fought for equality. I can't believe some of the things people can get away with so long as they pretend that it is equality they are fighting for - even when it is clearly not.|`|HltEZkvQaa	TROLL!|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Yes. She is and will be the Feminist ICON.    "Professor Lisa Jardine, who was at Newnham at the same time, recalled the first time she met Greer, at a formal dinner in college:        The principal called us to order for the speeches. As a hush descended, one person continued to speak, too engrossed in her conversation to notice, her strong Australian accent reverberating around the room. At the graduates' table, Germaine was explaining that there could be no liberation for women, no matter how highly educated, as long as we were required to cram our breasts into bras constructed like mini-Vesuviuses, two stitched white cantilevered cones which bore no resemblance to the female anatomy. The willingly suffered discomfort of the Sixties bra, she opined vigorously, was a hideous symbol of male oppression ... [W]e were ... astonished at the very idea that a woman could speak so loudly and out of turn and that words such as "bra" and "breasts'  or maybe she said "****"  could be uttered amid the pseudo-masculine solemnity of a college dinner."|`|dGwa8sFPaa	I think she is a creepy pedophile. She seems out of her mind. And don't get me started on that beast Andrea Dworkin.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	It wouldn't be saying much for all other feminists out there now would it? And yes, I think 1st wavers would be deeply ashamed of feminists like herself.|`|3862H0WVaa	Being the horrible brute of a man that I am Stars, I quite like her.    I don't like her views but I like her personality and will admit she is an extremely clever women.    If she came up and gave you a kiss you'd like her wouldn't you?  knowing you Stars....; )|`|YwE5kIB8aa	I think she is, all I have to do is read some of her hate, see that all the feminists will clap their hands like trained seals and that justifies how I despise and am enemy of the lie of feminism.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't know, I never read her book though I think I skimmed through it once. She's a crazy bitter old attention-seeking bat at the moment now and I doubt she was much better back in her day. Those quotes you write don't surprise me, maybe I will read the book to see what I think.    Harriet|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I really don't know anything about her except by quotes posted here to "prove" how awful feminism is.    IMO the greatest feminists aren't the ones who wrote books but those who taught their daughters that they are equal to men and can do whatever they like.

T7Mb8deyaa	It sounds like you are a human being. We all have voices inside our heads that tell us to do stupid things that would harm or not be good for us at that time. I follow those voices a lot, too. You are not alone.   The good news is that you can stand up for yourself by declaring that your health and your life are worthy of being cared of.   what has happened is, once you listen to these voices in any way, they start multiplying, and soon they are all around you. But you don't have to listen to them. Nothing is wrong with you. It is simply your own self- destructive 'tape' going through your head, which was learned from the world. You were not born with it. It is not part of you. Yet, it does seem to be attacking you, doesn't it? WHy don't you go ahead and read some in the Bible, where there is a whole book on this, the battle between good and evil in your mind, in the book of Psalms. The peotry is very beautiful and inspiring and here you will see that you are not alone, but these voices have 'plagued' men for ages.

5k9NWD0aaa	You are feeling empty because upon careful examination of the entire situation...it is very sterile.  Every decision made was made using machine logic.  It calls into question the foundation of every bond that you have in life.  The woman you "love" doesn't trust you enough to let you in on a choice as important as that.  What is the nature of love at all if not trust, sacrifice and a sort of devotional irrationality?  Could it be that all the bonds that tie people..man to woman...woman to child, are artificial manifestations?  You are mourning these bonds.  The bond you will never feel with your child.  The bond that has been broken between you and the woman you love.  The bonds of humanity...you are morning the loss of your humanity.  For if all value is determined in dollars, if all bonds are disposable...where is the humanity that you speak of?  Where is the love?  Where is the shared experience of man?  Where is the light?      I wish you luck on your journey my friend...I have no answers for you from this stage on.  How does one regain their humanity once lost?  It is a question that has kept my eyes glued to the ceiling many nights.

Regardless of if it would be the responsible thing to do in their current financial situation or not.|`|ndopqX6Taa	Whether the reasons were right or not this was a decision that should have been talked about before it was done. I would be mad as hell and it would be hard to ever have trust in her again.|`|FL67UPPHaa	A feeling of emptiness is understandable -- you just lost a child. Don't let her casualness stop you from being honest with yourself about the way you're feeling.    Regardless of whether it was the right choice to make (in my opinion, she gave you a poor excuse -- finances can always be worked out) you had a right to be part of the decision, as her husband and as the father of the baby. If she knew you really wanted a child, yet she aborted it anyway without consulting you, then that seems like a very selfish thing to do. As a married couple it was a choice you should have discussed and worked out together. She had no right to do what she did.     If I was you, I would very angry and I would be filing for divorce. But, if you want to make your relationship work, then the trust issues need to be sorted out. How would you feel if, in two years time, she did the same thing, again without consulting you? Wouldn't you like to have a say over your own parental status? I would recommend counselling because clearly there are a lot of issues here.

It could be because she didn't talk to you before she went ahead and did it. Even if you feel she made the right decision, it was your baby too; didn't you have a right to know beforehand? What does this say about your relationship? That she doesn't trust you? That she doesn't value your opinion? Personally, if I was a man and my woman did this, I'd be very pissed off.

j0SozMmzaa	It would make the rate lower if it came to the surface with the rest of the economy. The underground economy AKA the black market deals in things to avoid taxes. It is simply commerce to avoid taxes for various reasons such as the products are illegal, banned or otherwise not in the tax base.  There is much commerce for example selling pot. Growing, imports and distribution and has no taxes on it. A lot of people are "employed" but not reflected in any stats anywhere.  Arguably  the black market could have no impact on the subject at hand.There are several types of employment classical, structural, seasonal etc. but most have to do with wages, numbers of people seeking work.  The premise of unemployment and the rate is that you had a job you lost. I am sure the local drug dealer would not have a FED Tax ID and couldn't claim any rights if the Mexican drug Lords went belly up. A good example is prohibition in the 1920's. When it was over a people set up shops to sell the liquor and cut the government a % in taxes.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	it would exaggerate the unemployment rate because these people are working but claiming they are not.

ZOXoPgJbaa	There are a few reasons why we are in this mess.   I will try to not get into much detail because it would take forever for me to explain.     As far as things affecting Africa, I dont know if they would. You guys might not get as much foreign aid considering America wont have as much money, but that could be a good thing because maybe the inhabitants of Africa could stand up agaisnt their corrupt leaders. Also since there is much mining of silver and gold, that might help because these are usually safe havens in times when the economy is unstable. The one problem could be the cost of food if our government  and other governments inflate the money supply too much, food costs would go much higher, as they already have been.     ok back to the recession in America.     1 SEC allowed leveraging to go from 12/1 to 40/1 which means that you could lend out a dollar 40 times, creating a mountain of debt.   2 Credit default swaps allowed you to buy insurance contracts and not be forced to keep much of the money as reserves which helped blow the housing bubble.    3 the federal reserve kept interest rates artificially low which got people to mal-invest because the lending rates were just as low as the rate of inflation so it was almost like free money.   4 Alan Greenspan and Bill Clinton Created CRA which allowed banks to loan money to people who wanted to purchase homes, which had no business owning one. Our government guaranteed that if these people defaulted, that the taxpayer would pay for the defaults, hence the bailouts. In so many words if they won, they privatized the profits, when they lost, they socialized the losses.    5. Because of the change of lending standards, and artificially low interest rates, housing prices went on the rise, and investors realized this and either bought property themselves as speculative buyers, or started building new houses.    6. People that already owned homes started noticing their equities jumping through the roof, refinanced their loans, and started using their homes as ATM machines and started taking on much more debt than they should have thinking that prices would keep getting higher and higher.    7. When the people who were only allowed to lend through CRA started defaulting, all these speculative buyers turned into speculative sellers, and no one could get out of the door fast enough. Many foreclosed and banks started becoming insolvent, and didnt have cash. Because of so many foreclosures, speculative sellers, and new homes built, the supply of houses was much higher than demand, and so prices dropped, and are still dropping considerably. Those people that had refinanced and spent all their equity money on material things are all now living in homes with negative equity.    8.This hit the commercial sector, and since many businesses rely on credit, they could not get that credit any more since many banks are either insolvent or afraid to loan because of bad economic conditions and so they defaulted as well.   9. Because many homeowners have been hit with this negative equity, etc. There is much lower demand for goods other than necessities. Since companies have lower demand for goods, they start laying off people. This in turn lowers demand more because of less people who have disposable incomes, and more companies have to lay off more people. You can see where this could be headed.....    Now to address the stimulus package, it is horrible because we are only going to get a few hundred dollars, but the bill for the stimulus package is over $6700 for every man, woman, and child, and also many of the programs in it are wasteful spending.

iUzSlmSbaa	If it really bothers you a lot, there is a group out there for people who suffer from all kinds of phobias..they can help you overcome the fear. I am not scared of spiders but I have a big phobia against moths.. I can't be in the same room... I have to ask someone to kill the moth... I am living with the phobia..No spiders can't hurt you unless they are tarantulas or ''black widows''..which are poisonous but there are not many of them around.. the normal spider just looks ugly.. same as a moth. it looks ugly.. what annoys me most about it and makes me cringe about moths is the beating of their wings against a window pane...and their ugly dark bodies...it makes me itch everytime I even think about it.. but there are worse phobias.. A phobia that would affect your everyday life.. that definitely should be treated if your life quality suffered. You are not that likely to come across spiders every day... and most people have one phobia or another.. if it's a strong phobia... there is help out there... one is made to confront the fear...In your case you would first be shown a spider in a book.. then you would have to touch a spider in a glass case.. and eventually .. the moment of ''courage would come'' when someone who was trying to help you get over the phobia put the spider on his or her hand and ask you to touch the real spider...once you managed that.. the last step would be to place the spider in the palm of your hand and touch it.. if you can manage to learn that in a phobia support group you have conquered your fear of spiders.. arachnaphobia... I can't imagine being locked in a room with 20 moths buzzing around my head... I might get cured of my moth phobia or I may die of fear.. it's an irrational fear but if I am frightened of one.. and know it can't possibly harm me.. what can 20 do..? Bats would be worse I suppose..|`|GHjPLWq7aa	usually get my husband to get them hate them also dragon flys and moths|`|ae8131ba6ad572abbd48ff2e7abe883faa	It IS perfectly normal to fear spiders.

We are born with a fear of heights and loud noises, all other fears are learned.   These type of fears are called phobias.  Phobias are best treated with desensitization. You can do it yourself or you could see a therapist who specializes in treating phobias.     Desensitization is gradually exposing the person the the feared object or situation and then working through the feelings of anxiety and learning to relax. The worst thing to do with a phobia is avoidance as it only reinforces the fear by creating a feeling of relief by avoiding the object. The goal is to create a feeling of calmness when faced with the feared object or situation.     Phobia treatments often have the highest success rate.|`|jHVd9l1naa	As has been mentioned, desensitization is a very useful technique for overcoming phobias.  It is important to back this up with a technique for relaxation, so you can put yourself into a comfortable and relaxed state of mind before you begin each step of the desensitization.  There are lots of relaxation techniques, and some will work better than others depending on the individual.  Instead of trying to feel differently about spiders, work on dealing with anxiety.  If you can dispense with feeling the anxiety, then you'll be more likely to be indifferent to the spider.|`|wtrVyiNdaa	I share your fear and feelings, I cry, sweat, shake and get physically sick.

I was married once and before we started dating she had a Tarantula that would climb her walls at night while she slept. lol It kinda freaked me out at first but I just got use to it.

28RK2hKBaa	I was recently diagnosed with BPD as well, and very sad to say that yes many Doctors do turn away BPD patients because the stigma behind BPD is that it people with the diagnosis are difficult to treat. I have yet to find a good Doctor as I am also on meds for Bipolar Disorder and need them. I suggest to try for now to at least find a good therapist, counselor or psychologist. Good luck.    Feel free to add me on myspace, I have a lot of info and support on there for BPD and Bipolar as well, and some support resources under friends as well.    www.myspace.com/beatuspandora|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Everybody has problems : ) you are not alone|`|6kUx7fwcaa	Personality disorders in general are seen by many people, but most importantly by insurance companies, as a lifelong condition with no therapeutic cure with a good chance of working.  It really does depend on you.  Marcia Linehan had developed the most effective therapy, but it was implemented by being committed to an institution largely dedicated to BPD in the short-term and out patient longterm.  Her methods were called Dialectic Behavior Therapy (DBT).  A more modern approach employing DBT is ACT, Action and Commitment Therapy.  It involved developing mindfulness.  You can see my blog http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-IeUS6eQye... for more instructions in general for good mental health, but I suggest Linehan's workbook which you can get through Amazon.com.  BPD has been treated on an outpatient basis, more so lately.  It is very difficult and hard on both patients and therapists.  I have not been successful in many cases, except with people with developmental disabilities, because their ability to scuttle a program is less and their chances of switching therapists are less (treating people with developmental disabilities requires certain qualities).  Even the people with developmental disabilities are still in therapy.  Most BPD patients run through a large number of therapists in their life because of an inability to commit to a treatment and mistrust.  In the end, each person must go through life on their own.  If you want more information, well, you can contact me.|`|Gvvn84q6aa	Borderline personality disorder is extremely serious and can really hurt you and people you care about. I suggest you seek a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist. They may help you come to terms with the cognitive issues you are having with more success than a psychiatrist. As you recall, psychiatrists will prescribe medication, a psychologist will counsel. Both can be effective depending on the situation, and I suggest you try the counsel.|`|3WIDdkaGaa	I don't know what you know about Borderline personality Disorder but I think it would be very important to see a psychologist, or at least a counselor. I would also suggest a doctor, since sometimes there are medicines they can try. I think it is ridiculous your psychiatrist let you go and I hope you find someone better.   The best definition (criteria, symptoms) is in the DSM-IV which is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This is what is used to diagnose, this shows the prognosis, statistics, etc. I hope you have a great deal of support because this will not be easy but I do believe, with almost any mental disorder, you can make some sort of recovery or at least get in a place in your life that is comfortable and works for you.  The best of luck to you.|`|8gU0pBEJaa	Here's the deal: My wife was diagnosed with BPD and the prescriptions sent her in to a spiral of dispair and Mainia. Adderall was one of them. He diagnosed her in 20 minutes and damn near destroyed both our lives. The reason I say this is that her new Psyc guy told her she wasn't at all BPD but Bi-Polar and these look the same but are not. Her new guy and a psychologist both told her it takes years of therapy t even come close to diagnosing BPD! YEARS!    This guy did it in 20 minutes and then had to run off to have lucnh with a pharmaceutical Rep?     BPD is a major deal. It's a very serious condition so you need to be VERY serious about the diagnosis!! I can not strees that enough!! Please please please get a second and then a third opinion. BPD is really rare and is commonly misdiagnosed. It just so happens that some of the meds used to treat BPD cause people with deppresion or mania (or both in the case of Bi-Polar) to really go bonkers So be deadly sure of this.    Like I said, if you have the money please go talk to at least two other mental health proffesionals before you decide to agree that you have BPD. I know it's expensive but the ramifications can be more so if you have been misdiagnosed.
6aVtiTKiaa	I don't know a great deal about this topic.  And I'm not entirely sure what you're asking.  But I do know it doesn't require everyone to be rich.  Good economies have a large and stable middle class ... our middle class is shrinking.  There is now a larger divide between the wealthy and the poor and it's getting bigger.|`|5b81d6b881aa08e55896386627160825aa	I don't quite understand your question. Economic growth does not require everyone to be rich. Rather, economic growth produces resources, so on average people become richer.    You might be confused by the fact that the economic slowdown has been driven by a drop in consumer demand. In other words, as people decide to buy less stuff, companies react by producing less stuff, and then the lay people off.    It is true that without consumer demand, the economy slumps. But that doesn't mean that people have to consume like Donald Trump.  What it means is that we should not have a sharp decline in demand.  In fact, it's better in the long term - after the economy recovers - if we don't spend too much but instead save and invest.|`|y9CgveCGaa	The business cycle started way before modern commercialization.

Just because you can afford to move the labor force of your company overseas where the labor is much cheaper does not mean its a good idea for the country you reside in. With more money comes the need for more responsibility. Greed has taken over, the what at one time was, a good heart. If you play a game of monopoly on board "A"and everytime you receive compensation for a player landing on your property you take the money and buy up property on a completely different board "B" eventually the money of board "A" wil be drained and when a player lands on your property on board "A" he will not be able to come up with the money. Because you the CEO invest your money not in your own country or your own fellowman you invested in making the billions you already had into even more billions.|`|fGE7hL12aa	Actually, the economy needs us to be middle to upper middle class.     Rich people don't spend a lot of money. If a person has a million dollar income, they might spend 10 % of it.     If you have 10 people with a $100,000 income each, they will each spend 90% of it.    The secret to maintaining a consumer driven economy is to keep a higher percentage of our wealth in the middle class.

e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	One suggestion:    Don't study one subject for more than forty five minutes at a time.  Instead, take fifteen minute breaks every hour.    The brain needs time to process and filter information.  If our study sessions are too long, we will tend to remember only the highlights or high level generalities, rather than the details which need to be retained for successful test taking.    And, don't mix two or more subjects in one session.  Instead, take at least a fifteen minute break before switching to another subject.

5Eb8Zlqmaa	You look at what you're wanting closure of and you see it in it's entirety. Don't try to work around the kinks and doll it up. The main problem one runs into with finding complete closure is that they try to make something of a situation that isn't really there. Look at every aspect, pros and cons. Don't try to be one that only tries to see the good in everything - really look and see what is there. Does the positive outweigh the negative, like you'd want it to? Or does reality show you more negatives than positives?|`|R0NZNqupaa	It's the zipper just below your belt.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	You need to get over nightmares and bad negative thoughts about what happened.. until that day comes, you need to talk to your councellor as a backup.. support.. <br>  <br>  In your case..  don't go where you see this guy again.. ever so that you can find closure or else you would have to find the courage to go to the police and go through the whole process of what happened again, then with him locked up it might be closure,, otherwise .. don't go near there again and be able to move forward and leave the past behind.. step for step.. it won't happen over night.. there will be flashbacks and setbacks but you can do it.. look towards the future and not back and always know that you did nothing wrong. That you are totally blameless and try to let the memories fade... what bothers you a lot.. talk about it to your councellor.. that is a way towards finding closure.. and once you manage to do that.. after a lenght of time you will be able to trust guys again and not believe all are like this one.. that's important to not think that all men are the same.. <br>  <br>  Take normal precautions which make sense for every woman.. don't take shortcuts, especially not when it's dark.. don't go out alone when it's dark.. don't go with anyone you don't know, have your cellphone with you if you walk or go by car.. Always walk in a street full of houses and where there are people. If you feel you are being followed, walk up to the nearest lit house and ring the doorbell and tell them the situation and ask them if they can call a taxi for you.. if you go out to a club or a bar.. make sure if you didn't drink much, and you have a car, that someone you trust escorts you to the car.. and if you are there alone.. ask someone to pick you up or get a taxi back home.. and ask the driver to wait until you are indoors...Don't let this make you paranoid, but just take precautions to prevent this from ever happening again.. which can happen to anyone... but less likely to if you watch out and also never accept a drink in a bar from anyone.. don't leave your drink unattended.. Don't let a stranger chat you up if you are not with friends who will stay and you all leave as a group.. and the other guy..  you meet at a bar or a club .. on a first date, he goes off alone..so make sure you have your friends near, then nothing can happen if you stay there..<br>  <br>  If all this does not help.. there are still support groups for women and girls who have experienced the same.. and maybe if one hears their stories.. one knows they have been victims also, then it's easier to find closure, because the whole group has are victims of the same crime and all look for closure.. so one talk to them and exchange thoughts and ideas how one each and everyone handles ''to find closure'' one can support each other... that's why I believe a lot in support groups for girls and women in such a case instead of one on one talk to a councellor.. they have a councellor there as well but all of them are victims.. so there are a group of them.. and I believe if you have trouble finding closure.. you can always look and check out such a support group near you.. and you may make friends with some of the women or girls you meet there... that helps to be able to talk to someone who has been through the same...  one can be a rock for each other.. or a beacon of light ..<br>  <br>  PS. In the meantime the important thing is to work well with your councellor.. don't hold anything back from her. Let all emotions out, even if that means crying anything it takes.. and it may take all of that to find closure.. but to open up gives her a chance to help you, if she knows what's going on in your mind. Your thoughts, your fears, if you talk about it it is possible to find closure.. by taking babysteps toward finding it. Meaning a scar will remain but this will not be not be in the forefront of your thoughts. One day it will be a faint memory of some bad event but it won't be able to wreck your futre life and happiness.<br>  I hope these links help to overcome and find a step for step way towards closure after your traumatic experience with sexual abuse. xxx<br>  <a href="http://www.ezilon.com/articles/articles/317/1/OVERCOME-SEXUAL-ABUSE" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezilon.com/articles/articles/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fortheabused.ca/recovery.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fortheabused.ca/recovery.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://dancinginthedarkness.com/articles.php?show=45&arc=200" rel="nofollow">http://dancinginthedarkness.com/articles...</a>|`|uy6sBhipaa	Look in the dictionary under 'C.'

phJfL2wTaa	Good manners = treating all people well  Chivalry = treating women well    Chivalrous defined:    (adj) chivalrous, gallant, knightly (being attentive to women like an ideal knight)    EDIT: Because of the thumbs down:      Main Entry:  chivalrous   Pronunciation:  \?shi-v?l-r?s\  Function:  adjective  Date:  14th century  1: valiant  2: of, relating to, or characteristic of chivalry and knight-errantry  3 a: marked by honor, generosity, and courtesy b: marked by gracious courtesy and high-minded consideration especially to women    http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...    chiv?al?rous?   ?[shiv-uhl-ruhs] Show IPA Pronunciation    adjective  1.having the qualities of chivalry, as courage, courtesy, and loyalty.  2.considerate and courteous to women; gallant.  3.gracious and honorable toward an enemy, esp. a defeated one, and toward the weak or poor.    http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/c...    Chivalry is a term relating to the medieval institution of knighthood. It is usually associated with ideals of knightly virtues, honor and courtly love. Today, the terms chivalry and chivalrous are used to describe courteous behavior, especially that of men towards women.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalry    chivalrous  (shvl-rs)  adj.  1. Having the qualities of gallantry and honor attributed to an ideal knight.  2. Of or relating to chivalry.  3. Characterized by consideration and courtesy, especially toward women.  chivalrously adv.  chivalrousness n.    http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chivalr...    Women are mentioned in every definition.  Is this somehow sexist?  I do not understand why people want words to mean something different than their definition, Political Correctness run wild I guess.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	Growing up I lacked a lot of attention in the home so I looked for it elsewhere. I found that if you're polite to people they're a lot more willing to talk to you, as well as smiling and eye contact and a lot of that other stuff that's commonplace.     So when I started getting to those years where women became important I started developing my own code for respect to keep up that politeness level (at the time I suppose I think I was expected to have some sort of special rules for how to treat women). I did some research into Chivalry codes and took most of it to heart but kept some restraint on the ones that don't suit my culture.      Opening doors: I'll keep a door open as a common courtesy for other people, male or female. The difference is I'll wait long if someone is carrying something, and I'll spring ahead to grab a door for a lady, especially if she is dressed nicely.    Standing when a lady enters: This is too archaic and makes me look weird, so I don't do it. I will try to specifically greet someone when they enter though, no matter who it is. Again, another common courtesy. I'd only pull the chair for my current interest.    Other parts of Chivalry are to never lie, always be polite, don't spread gossip, along with a number of other important relationship based guidelines (how to love being important as it is a noble trait). See the attached Chivalry website for more information.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Thank you Vlad.    Those who are confused simply need to be educated.    Good manners are appreciated everywhere.  Chivalry is an archaic, classist practice that offends a great many people.|`|GvF6hcyCaa	Rewrite this, it makes no sense!|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Chivalry to me just means plain courtesy and politeness. I don't look at someone's gender to be polite/courtesy to them. But hey, that's just me.    "I need the standard meaning of chivalry, not what you feel it should be." - That's all I got. Besides, why would/should I be polite/courteous to women and be rude to men? That's where my thought process begins.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Agree, chivalry would just be men who are doing nice things for women only, doubt there's many, you basically have polite well mannered people, and people who aren't, in both genders.     Men I know who are 'chivalrous' to some, are actually just gentlemen and are courteous and polite and over all nice to everyone, not just women =o)|`|A7r8xX7saa	Sorry, but chivalry isn't just a code of conduct which applies to men. A woman declining an offer by a man which would sorely inconvenience him, but doing so in a manner which would save his honour, is an example of a chivalrous act on her part. Etiquette is the act of doing unto others as you would have done to you. It is done as a courtesy as recognition that others are as important as yourself. Chivalry is the act of extending yourself beyond mere etiquette by purposefully giving of yourself to make another more comfortable.    The reason you likely believe chivalry to be gender specific is that, despite propaganda to the opposite, women aren't the unselfish creatures they are made out to be. Women expect men to be chivalrous but make no such demands upon themselves. So they see themselves as receivers and not givers in this respect, and play it out to the general public as being natural.

BhumxInEaa	I assume that by "improvement" you mean export more and import less.<br>  <br>  Assume that initially country A's unit of currency, the argentium, is worth exactly the same as country B's unit of currency, the berrylium.<br>  <br>  Further assume that country A exports apples to country B, and imports bananas from country B and that A's apples now cost the country B importer 1 argentium each, while country B's bananas now cost 1 berrylium each.<br>  <br>  And we have assumed that country A imports more than it exports.<br>  <br>  Now suppose that country A's currency becomes worth less. That is, instead of the exchange rate of 1:1, 1 berrylium is worth 2 argentium on the foreign exchange markets.<br>  <br>  From the point of view of the apple importer in country B, apples, which used to cost 1 berrylium each, still cost 1 argentium each but that is now only half a berrylium. That means the importer can sell apples at a lower price (up to half a berrylium lower) while still making the same profit per apple. But with a lower price, more people in country B will buy country A apples, so the importer will end up buying more apples from country A. <br>  <br>  At the same time, the banana importer in country A still has to pay 1 beryllium per banana, but now that translates to two argentia. So the importer has to raise the price of bananas in country A's stores. That means that people in country A will buy fewer bananas. <br>  <br>  So in terms of real goods, it is clear that country A is exporting more and importing less.<br>  <br>  In terms of money, it is less clear. Country A is still getting 1 argentium for each apple so it is clearly exporting more when the measure is argentia. But even though it is importing fewer bananas, it is paying more for each, so it is not clear whether it is paying country B less than before.<br>  <br>  But the switch from a 1:1 argentium to beryllium ratio to a 2:1 ratio was arbitrary. In fact, there is a feedback network involved.  If apples and bananas are the only goods ever traded, and neither government tries to intervene, etc., then the exchange ratio will move to that value at which the monetary of balance of trade is balanced.<br>  <br>  Similarly, with more goods and more countries, all the exchange rates should move in the direction that balances  all countries' trade. <br>  <br>  In reality, of course, the world is not so simple. Trade is not the only factor in the foreign exchange ration: interest rates, government stability, growth rates, etc. all affect the exchange rate.<br>  <br>  But the basic idea is still there: making your currency cheaper makes your exports cheaper so others buy more from you, and makes imports more expensive so your people buy less from other countries.

EaurpLufaa	I certainly would.  Male rape is not impossible.  It is a serious issue that is not discussed nearly enough by the media.  People seem to be under the illusion that a male cannot be sexually assaulted unless he secretly "wanted it."  That couldn't be any further from the truth, however!    Rape of a child is a form of child sexual abuse.  When committed by a parent or other close relatives such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, it is a form of incest and when commited by another child (usually older or stronger), it is a form of child-on-child sexual abuse.  When a child is raped by a family member, especially a parent, it can result in serious and long-term psychological trauma.  When a child is raped by an adult who is not a family member but it a caregiver or in a position of authority over the child, such as school teachers, religious authorities, or therapists, to name a few, on whom the child is dependent, the effects can be similar to incestual rape.    Psychologists estimate that 40 million adults, 15 million of those being men (Adams 1991), in the United States were sexually abused in childhood often by parents, close relatives and other elders on whom they were dependent.  According to the National Center for Victims of Crime 46% of rape committed in the United States is perpetrated by a family member.    Effects of child rape include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, propensity to re-victimization in adulthood, and physical injury to the child, among other problems.  Children, including but not limited to adolescents, raped by their parents and other close elders are often called 'secret survivors' by psychologists, as they often are unable or unwilling to tell anyone about these rapes due to implicit or explicit threats by the adult rapist, fear of abandonment by the rapist, and/or overwhelming shame.  Since the signs of these rapes are usually invisible except to trained professionals, these children often suffer ongoing offenses in silence until independence from the adult rapist is attained.  By that time, the statute of limitations is often long-expired, the adult victim's repressed memories are often considered inadmissible as evidence and the child-rapist is able to avoid punishment.|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	At the time, maybe not. Does a child who is beaten consider himself a victim at the time?   But who knows what negative psychological effect this experience will have on him in the future. He will probably distrust women, or have repressed anger at them. Or he may abuse them as a result.  She is a pedophile, just the same as if the genders were reversed. Would you ask the same question if a 40 year old handsome man had sex with his 14 year old students?  Furthermore, she betrayed a position of trust. It's very common for schoolkids to have crushes on their teachers. Imagine if we let them get away with taking sexual advantage of them!  This is a common problem and seems to be getting worse since women often only get a slap on the wrist.  http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.as...

Simple little things that you do can guide your attention back to yourself and you won't notice others so much.    Examples.     Slowly trace your pen or pencil across the paper until you are completely engulfed in the size and shape of the line you just made.     Count pages of a book, feeling the texture of each page as you count.     Look around the room, pick a color, and name (silently) all the things you find of that color.       These seem like really simple things but what they do is reestablish your point of focus to your own mind and what you are perceiving.

xHq5jfNtaa	Hello! I turned eighteen a month ago,so I am around your age, and I have Asperger Syndrome too. I can really empathise with you, because I went through a period of depression when I started high school. I  never had any real friends at primary school and when I started high school, I realised how different I was, and how difficult it can be for people with our condition to socialise and make friends. The other kids teased me and put cigarette lighters in my bag, and I always ended up standing alone waiting for classes to start. I am also an endomorph, so I, like you, felt self-concious about my body shape when changing for games, as the other boys were getting muscly. I got so depressed I contemplated sucide, and had to see a psychiatrist and be put on medication, which made me start to feel better. I gradually realised that the best way to cope with having Asperger's was to adopt a positive viewpoint towards it. I realised that the condition is actually something to be proud of rather than feel depressed about, because having it is a challenge which can be won, as impossible as it may seem. For example, I have been learning social skills and how to behave appropriately in social situations, and, when a teacher I was talking to told me that I was making good eye contact (something that is difficult) it was such a boost and made me feel overjoyed - I now knew that learning to socialise was not an impossible challenge. Once the other kids learnt that I was being positive, they realised that my condition was no longer a weakness with which they could torment me. Over the years, I have become more and more positive, and am now in Sixth Form and am accepted by my peers. Telling people about the condition also helped - once they understood me and understood that I was not a weirdo, just had trouble with socialising, they accepted me. I am now a popular member of my school and was recently asked to teach a new kid with Asperger's to be more positive about the condition. The best advice I can give you is to be positive about your condition - remember that you are not alone - there are 'aspies' all over the world, many who are famous (Bill Gates of Microsoft has Aspergers), and who have learnt to live with the condition.|`|415c606df37f68bb26defe6afc4268d9aa	I'm not certain what asperger is, however it is important that you speak to your doctor and share what you have here.  Your doctor will be the best resource and place to start in addition to what you've just done here. You are not satisfied with your current situation and acknowledging this is the very first step to allow change. Congratulations in taking that first step forward. Secondly, I'd encourage you to look at the features and character of yourself that you do like and acknowledge them everyday. At 17 yrs, your body is still growing and changing therefore I'd encourage you to enjoy what you have at the moment and embrace where you will be going.  Each day, although most aspects are the same embrace them that you are there to live and thrive in it and have the freedom to include other facets when it works.  Plan at least one new item a week, even if it's as simple as taken a different route to school and back. You never know you might discover something you wouldn't of otherwise so be open to it.  <br>  Still, please share with your doctor.<br>  Good luck .. keep your chin up.|`|2AZoJJgDaa	Your going through dpression.

It's a phase no matter how 'deep' the empty feeling is.    You're going to find your self soon and be a really happy person. Again, no matter how far-fetched that sounds.    You just have to wait it out, find some new friends and new hobbies to pass your time by. Maybe something could actually set off your recovery.      Trust me, sometimes life isn't so surprising.

You are ruminating about past passions like the drawings you created as a child, and may be hoping that you can find another job which will ignite those previous feelings.    But, this line of thinking will not tend to lead to a job or career change.  You are really only day dreaming and will eventually succumb to the realities of your life's path.    I suggest that you channel your enjoyment of drawing into a diversion from work or a hobby which will give you pleasure during your leisure time.

Actually the best relationship I was ever in was with a guy that didn't have much money at all!

But that has nothing to do with money. I dated a guy from a very wealthy family. He too was going to go to medical school. But I could tell he was just doing it because he was expected to. He took no joy from his classes. He had no personal ambition. I gradually found out that we had nothing in common.    It doesn't take money, it takes a goal and the drive to see it through. It also take the pure enjoyment of that goal, and the love of what you do that goes beyond a good paycheck.

Generally speaking-just generally speaking-you will get from a lady one of the excuses you mentioned if you're broke because generally they will follow money-what can get her hair done, or that mall run, or that "trophy guy" riding in this or that to brag about, though many will try to deny it on the surface; that's plain reality. Men are equally as guilty but the specifics are different.  2. Attractiveness-lies in the beholder-but when dealing with a lady in society, the more people who trip in front of her for her attention, again generally the personality heads in the opposite direction because when they are more "chased" they can get away with so so much. A good deal of that attention again will come from a "heavy wallet" and generally they can't resist that until they find a higher bidder.  Many ladies are decent but many, if only so many, follow exactly the trend above. Men are just as guilty though the specifics are somewhat different. The western society, and the rest of the world is catching on, is getting more materialistic with time. Number one cause of divorce-finances.   Remember though, there are many good, conscience-filled ladies who will take you for you and those ones are hard to find but if you get one, keep her.  Good luck.        PS: I wish all the seemingly morally upright stuff people are saying here added up. Passionate Burger flippers with a goal to flip more burgers being happily married for a lifetime...Rich guys who married rich and remained married after becoming poor...if such things happened most of the time...  Divorce statistics would be very low...Not where you're more likely to win a coin toss than correctly predict a marriage/union that would last a lifetime...Both men and women are guilty.

You become capable of doing things you would not normally could do. Even animals have this ability its so they stay alive.      You were not scared judging that you were able to think about the situation rather than fight or run. When you are scared your more base instincts take over such as running or fighting.

Number one, women allow men to penetrate them. Men are at a advantage based off of the "mechanics" of sex.  Not only do they enter our body, but parts of their DNA survive up to 3 days later....    For me sex is extremely intimate and sensual, very private, and very beautiful.  For those who have seen me in that light.....they have truly seen me in rare form, vulnerable.  Love making is an exchange of spirit.  Breathing patterns seem to match up.      That being said, I can't have a one night stand.  I would not degrade what beauty I have at all .....by doing such things.  Honestly, if I simply crave a "feeling", I can give that to myself.    I know that some women will say  "I don't mind, it feels good, we can just be friends..."    Really one of 2 things has happened to them....    1. they have been sexually and or physically abused at some point which has led them to believe that casual sex is normal and ok.  When you have had some one force something like that on you, mentally you begin to shield yourself from ever feeling that kind of pain again.  So casual sex is ok, that way they FEEL in control.    2. They have had any one  to ever tell them their worth.  They did not have a good example as a child.  Either their mother was that way, or they had no mother at all.  Some times lack of a male role model plays a factor. Bottom line.  If you did not recieve positive affirmation or love from a father figure as a child then as a teen or young woman, you seek that approval from men through sex.  Even though it is meaningless and unsatisfying.  ** I know some women may disagree with what I have said, but really, take time and think about the "fast" women that you know or have delt with.....They fit into one of these categories usually.   Some how using sex as a replacement for validation and appreciation.  ** just because he has sex with you, doesnt mean he loves you...or needs you...some times it means you were there when the thought crossed his mind, and really I dont see anything "special" about that.    Once a relationship is established, it is different, there is a foundation based on more than just sex, so as often as you choose to be together or where you choose to do it,  is ok in my eyes.....|`|FRjgnCHPaa	i think that this should only be shared with people that you love what is the point of giving it up if u probably will never see them again i am a virgin and still havent choose the right one|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I view it easily through a strategically placed mirror's reflection.

Real love lasts, but nothing says that you'd actually be with that person except spiritually.  The situation needs to be viewed impersonally..why we are alive, the purpose, the meaning, the objective.  Having partners is a diversion in most cases, having a dog or a car or stamp collection is pretty much the same thing.  The trouble is that negativity is brought out by the love, and that wrecks it unless the other can be aware enough to see it, and the negative one be ready to overcome their negativity. That's all rather unlikely!  Men and women in the egoic condition do love differently, left and right are the same but not.  Enlightened men and women love the same, they just love...simple.

g8EfleRXaa	Please be careful when you speak of people in such a broad manner.  Not everyone in America falls into this category.  There are too many to mention.      Usually when one migrates to another country, he or she does so with the intention of making a better life for themselves.  If one left their country of origin for financial reasons it is common sense that he or she would be "hungry" as you phrase it, to achieve.  If someone works for twenty years labeling them as lazy can be debated.  While that might not be your idea of being productive, everyone is entitled to make their own choices.  Consider if an American migrated to another country.  Do you think he or she would have to work just as hard as immigrants who migrate to America?  I gather that when one is not residing in their country of origin they must work twice as hard in order to prove themselves to obtain better opportunities.  In no way do I condone one not pulling their own weight.  At the same time, it is just as bad to view a whole nation of individuals from such a small window.|`|Jo8HXGu1aa	Becuase man...its like the liberal way man....I wanna do what I wanna do which is nothing and expect you to do it for me and I also dont want anyone telling me I'm wrong becuase your violating my rights...:P|`|cXtEx98Haa	It's pretty clear from your spelling and word usage that you didn't go to college, so what is your complaint?|`|8klN6Fokaa	many people are not career oriented because life is not all about working. you have to enjoy your life too. yes, you must work to have money and to keep up with the costs of living. but people can live their lives however they want.

The implication of the saying is also that you need someone to teach you to fish -- you can't always do it on your own.

And to answer your question: make a spear like the ancients did.|`|UhumMVBnaa	It is possible to fish without those, but that is not the point. It is true only as long as the man being taught decides that the teachings are worth learning. If you teach a man who has eaten well all his life at the cost of another how to fish, it will be lost because he will not see a point in fishing for himself.  But if a man has had to fend for himself, the information has a purpose at the time it is taught and it is taken into the subconsious knowledge of the man, similar to the way that breathing is purposeful and recognized as such so you will always remember how to do it (excepting under extenuating circumstances).    LSS(long story short):  a man can only be taught to fish( or whatever you are trying to teach him) if he can recognize that it is necessary or purposeful.

gW0nD5cEaa	I guess you mean Native Americans, or American Indians. They were all over North and South America and the islands of the Caribbean and the Bahamas before the time of Columbus. Many were wiped out by slavery or disease, especially in the Caribbean. There were great civilizations in Peru, Mexico and even in North America with the mound builders in what is now Illinois and other midwestern states.     After the Europeans came, many died of diseases unknown to them before; many thousands were killed in wars, others died because a major source of food and blankets in the plains states, the buffalo, or Bison was nearly wiped out, mostly by White hunters.     In the US, many whites and blacks are actually part Native American, but the numbers of actual Native Americans are much lower.Now some tribes have found a lucrative market with gambling casinoes. Often, however, many Native Americans are very poor.   In parts of Latin America, such as Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia, the Native Population is not only still around, in some cases forms a majority, or in Mexico and other countries, Mestizos, or people of mixed heritage are the largest group.

DCSfx5coaa	We can't have this because it will never work due to the ever growing human ego. As long as people live in their ego and only think of themselves communism will never work. Communism as was implemented in Russia was forced on people, that is the reason for why it failed. Because some people worked hard and others knowing this sat around just waiting to be fed by others. In order for a communistic kind of society to work, people have to realize themselves that the egoistic way of living is evil and detrimental to society. People have to reach a point where they CHOOSE to want to live in an mutual guarantee, altruistic society. Until then, we will continue to suffer whether its in communistic, or capitalistic, or socialistic societies.

AA10894849	Everyone dreams (blind people included) and in general, people's dream experience is similar to their waking experience. For those that were blind from birth, they do not have a lot of visual stimuli to draw on for their dreams, so they have dreams that are primarily auditory, tactile (touch) or even involve taste and smell. People who lose their sight very early (before age five) apparently experience no visual imagery in their dreams. Visual imagery is a variable for those who lose their sight between ages five and seven. People who lose their sight after age seven almost always have some level of visual imagery present in their dreams. They've done extensive studies and have also found that REM sleep is disturbed in blind people, so they may actually dream less.|`|C3WFLfpOaa	Most researchers believe that people who are blind from birth or who become blind when there young don't see in their dreams. They do not retain visual imagery because it was never acquired in the first place.    However, those blinded in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, or afterwards usually do see in their dreams. "They often retain visual imagery in their waking life and in their dreams," according to Drs Nancy Kerr of the Department of Psychology at Oglethorpe University and G. William Domhoff of the Department of Psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz.|`|XFvV9dEHaa	Well yes; I don't believe sight has anything to do with the sleeping process (stages of sleeping) which is when people dream.

Most severe depressions aren't caused by an outside event, but by brain chemistry going awry. Of course there are times when you know what caused a depression something like a death, divorce, loss of a job, a break up with a significant other.  There are other times when depression just hits out of the blue which makes it worse because then you don't' have a reason for feeling so bad and you can't explain it to yourself much less others. This makes it a lot harder to deal with both for yourself and others. What do you do you do the same thing that everyone else with depression does, Get help, depression is depression no matter the reason that you have it. It won't go away with out help from professionals either with talk therapy or medications or a combination of both.  There is help out there but you have to reach out for it.

oM1uzuSdaa	There is nothing wrong with having a good cry and it may just help you feel better. Is it a continuing depression (more than a month?) or is it just something that happened and you feel depressed about it? Everyone gets depressed from time to time. The best thing to do is to figure out why you are depressed and do something to change it (if possible) or learn how to deal with it. Discuss why you are depressed with a good friend, parent, or sibling. They may help you see your problem differently, sometimes just someone listening makes it better and you don't feel so alone. Sometimes just using a box of tissues, talking the problem out in your head, and a good night sleep might make it better. You can wake up to a new day and decide what needs to be done.

AA11231339	Oh my gosh - I totally relate!    With the Law of Attraction it goes like this... since like attracts like... that means two different emotions (energies) can't be in the same place at the same time.    So if you are happy and your downer mom comes into the room - whoever has the dominant emotional set-point will win.    So if she is MORE downer than you are up, eventually if you stay in the same room long enough you will meet her down there in icky-feeling land.    If, however, you are totally UP and you are MORE up than she is down... she either has to meet you up there or she and her negative emotions will get bounced out of your space.    Like this:    (You are in a great mood.)    *ding dong*  "Oh, hi, Mom!"    "I came to tell you the economy is getting worse and you are really in for it now.."    "Oh, really?  I made some pie, want a piece? It's really, really good!"    "No.  And how come you are making pie when you should be looking for a job?"    "I love pie!  Speaking of which, I have to take this extra pie I made over to a friend.  Want to go?"    "No, I can't go see a stranger, I haven't washed my hair."    "Ok, well, I'll walk you to the door.  Have a great day!"    And off you go, still in a good mood.    Don't be hard on yourself when your mom is there.  Trying to practice Law of Attraction while your mom is there and you are already frustrated isn't the time.    Best to practice Law of Attraction when she isn't there.    The goal is that you need to be MORE practiced at being happy no matter what so that her practiced negative stuff can't shake you.  So that her negativity doesn't even bother you.    Eventually you won't even notice it.    Or she won't show up or call for a while.    I know it works.  I did it with my own mom.  :)    Great question!  Thanks for asking!|`|AA11767291	When repeatedly exposed to negativity it affects us adversely,but nobody else can doom or jinx anyone else. If I were you I would politely tell her that you prefer not to dwell on doom and gloom.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	This isn't about the laws of attraction,whatever they may be,this is about Projection.Your family member is projecting her fears and insecurities on to you and you are taking on her negativity.You need to stop allowing her to make you feel down.I can't say why she is like this because I don't know her,but you can do something about it,when she starts her whinning tell her you're not interested in her negative views,tell her you don't share her opinions and if all she's going to do is moan you'd rather she didn't drop in as often.You don't have to listen to others constant pessimism,so do something about it!|`|vnSskmVRaa	The first thing that comes to mind is the movie The Secret - the part where Abraham-Hicks (if you saw that version) talks about "If you focus on what is, then you get more of what is, and then if you get more of what is, you focus on what is, and if you focus on what is, you get more of what is, etc."  Your family member is constantly inviting you to focus on what is, which is basically guaranteeing more of what is.  It may be difficult to focus only on what you want in her presence.  Also, energy can be palpable.  It might be impossible to not feel her negative vibes.  Clearly identifying what you want and focusing only on that, even when she's around, will be your best bet.  Good luck!

SeUHFnSmaa	"is it ok if a woman engages in drinking and casual sex?" Sure, but it's frowned upon by many.    Rape is forced, unwanted sexual intercourse|`|YQOT68xFaa	It isn't okay for anyone to behave like that. Yes, it's their choice, but it's not a good choice. It's risky and foolish and immoral. People usually grow up and realize that and stop carrying on that way.    No, it isn't rape.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I have come to the conclusion that you are a troll.    Carry on.  You're fun to watch.|`|GXM74MGPaa	Its absolutely disgusting. I never have done that , never will. Theres tons of sluts and im sure 70% of women do this.|`|0MunIx8raa	I don't call that rape.  Now if a woman is so drunk she can't walk and hasn't a clue what's going on and someone takes advantage of that, then that is rape.  I myself like to have a bit of a buzz and have wild sex.  Loosens me up and I do things I normally wouldn't do, well, that's not a lot, but there are a few things.  Drinking and sex is fun.  I'm not a college girl either.|`|2esGKO2Caa	I some what confused by your question. A woman can do and act however she wants to that's her right. If she's drunk and has sex with a guy that's not rape. And woman and guys do it all the time most grow out of it some never do.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I had a lot of casual sex when I was young, but I didn't drink.  I think the idea that a girl can call it rape just because she was drunk is absolutely preposterous.|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	You can't rape the willing.    It's fun.|`|AA11773731	Don't put yourself in that situation. I would never drink so much where I didn't know what was happening around me. Also, I would have my friends around to help just like I would protect them.|`|ShhqK8fhaa	That's between her and God.|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	Whether or not it is ok for a woman to do that is a question of morality to some, to others just a question of equality. to me, my answer is "yes", if that's what she want to do. It is accepted/expected for guys to do this, In my single days plenty of girls have done this with me. It certainly wouldn't be rape. Most of the time they are not even drunk, they only acted to be, i guess it gives them a sense that they can feel partially unresponciable for their actions. Women are expected to behave, and be good girls, but lets face it, this has been going on for a long time, it is just more out in the open now.    The reason why so many young women are doing this is because it gives them the same pleasure that men have been getting for years before them, it gives some a feeling of liberation, and others 'im sure are wanting to try any, and all things while they are young, with the thought in mind that when they are older they will be monogamous with a single partner.|`|AXNowGPyaa	Yes, but they should practice good judgement.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	i don't think that's rape unless she said no!       it was her choice to drink no his!|`|ky58dS2yaa	I don't think it's rape unless it's against her will.    Whether it's okay or not for a woman to engage in said activities isn't any of my business, but hopefully she's at least okay with the emotional pain that it'll inevitably cause her.
BOA8nq4iaa	You're missing the point, Choopa. It's not that Sweden and the UK are highly feminist- it's that they're EQUAL. Feminism isn't about doing better than a man, it's about creating a level playing field and equal opportunities for all. That's why feminists in America get a bad rap- they went from being about equality to trying to get ahead/get over on their male counterparts. True, pure feminism is for women AND men.    Case in point- most European countries provide an average of 6 months paid maternity AND paternity leave. Both the father and mother can stay home, bond with their infant, and share the responsibilty together. The feminist movement in the US fought for women's maternity leave only, and got a paltry 6 weeks. Men can get 6 week, too, but it's typically unpaid.    It's not about advantages- it's about EQUALITY.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I thought UK was OK unless I read about H. Harman. Sweden is an entirely different case. Looks like they want a land of ONLY women out there.    Feminism in the west isn't about equality anymore since equality has been achieved. Modern Feminism and Equality can't co-exist.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	In the Uk we don't have any of that feminist stuff anymore. Things are equakl, we've moved on.|`|skJihSWSaa	i don't know about sweden but i don't think the uk is particularly feminist. I think men and women are treated equally.|`|GvF6hcyCaa	There is always someone out there better than yourself.

YzoLa5Uuaa	I cannot help you find a place in New York. As well I would suggest that you not waste your time nor money on past life regression. <br>  <br>  I am well versed in memory, memory flaws, and techniques that can create false memories and after reading about past life regression it is very, very, very clear to me that is all that happens. It is pseudoscience and a waste of time. <br>  <br>  If you would like a more detailed explanation why it is false, feel free to email me and I will explain in more depth. <br>  <br>  If you are determined to find "past life memories", I'm sure you will find them (or something YOU think are past life memories...), but recognize that they are only an incarnation of THIS mind that you have now, not any past lives. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.
KTNqah9eaa	I guess the use of idiom is meant to add clarity, familiarity and directness to the message conveyed. However of course idiom can do the opposite or have a neutral effect. <br>  For example when I first heard the expression, 'He blew off the meeting,' from a US colleague, it confused me because it wasn't an expression I was familiar with in my culture. When he explained the meaning to me, I gained understanding but it didn't really add or subtract from the meaning. However if I had come from the same culture as him, I would have picked up nuances, such as annoyance, which I would otherwise have missed. <br>  So, in the end, at best idiom is a way of cultural bonding, at worst a way of sowing confusion. :)
GNbWybU7aa	I don't believe you can want to make yourself wake up while you're in a dream. Because you're too busy focusing ON THAT DREAM to worry about waking up. You'll wake up on your own time simply because it is ONLY A DREAM and it's not real.    I'd say it's nothing to worry about when you wake up, but some dreams have lasting effects and it's actually quite amusing to me:)    Also, i beg to differ that people say they can wake themselves up from a dream. There are levels of sleep to where you can dream. Once you are in deep sleep, you're officially dreaming. They have monitors to prove this.      So for the 'light sleepers', don't pinch yourself too hard tonight when Freddy Kreuger is about to eat your face off.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	Yes, I am working on a dream machine that is hooked up to my computer. The electrodes applied to your head are sensitive to muscular changes and perspiration which indicate a particularly bad dream. When triggered by these negative emotion indicators; the computer sends a signal to the alarm clock thus waking you up. I am also working on caputuring dream images and downloading them on the computer so I can burn a disc called. "Best of wet Dreams".|`|eHUJOD0daa	Its very hard to wake up. Hard to explain but what i do is i try to realize that im dreaming and figure out where i am in reality and i wake up|`|AA10063059	yes if i know i am dreaming i pinch myself and i cant feel it so i then fall forwards and i wake up,i have been able to do this since i was very young|`|6k2lmVChaa	You can move your arms even if your dreaming. As a child I would try and hit my head on the head board or try to scoot to the edge of the bed. This should work for you too.
HPGMRrUAaa	The only dreams I have ever had more than once have unfortunately been bad and scary ones. Maybe it is only those ones because they stick inside your head due to being frightened. Think really hard about it before you go to sleep. If there is a film or drink or something which may remind you of it before you sleep, use that-which may help. Dreams are mysterious things, I hope you get your dream back!|`|hAqPziGzaa	Jesus I wish I knew a way to do that! However, there is a chance you can do that, but it's slim. When you go to bed, have a glass of warm water and think of a small clip of that dream. Over and over until you fall asleep. It's only worked for me like once or twice. I think there is more to this. Try googling it!|`|OY44h6Qbaa	go bang your head on some wall, maybe that could help.  or try smelling your undergarments....you will definitely get good sleep, maybe that dream could come as well.|`|SD0dIDCKaa	That would be neat, I hope so.|`|Ftg5P9Skaa	no.

KK5nbzGuaa	A very good question. The self that is at war is hatred and selfishness. Our senses say "me first", my pleasure, me mine and deludes us to see the self as different from others. Conquering nature ( me, mine, selfishness ) means loving all , unity and peace.   No why this happens? We are born in nature. Yet find ourselves struggling to get free from the selfishness, hatred, divisions--from that which binds us to our senses. If there wasn't any struggle, we all would have been content, but this does not happen. Happiness peace and love are not confined to senses, but beyond that, beyond nature.|`|vownHW75aa	Everyone sees it in everyone else and it's almost this force of nature that happens to all of us when certain instances arrise....it's normal, may not be good, but in order to survive in this world u have to use these forces to keep up!

I write poetry, usually when I am trying to go to sleep!  I make tiny nostalgic shoes with my clay.  I made figurine of Jesus, that took me six months to make, just to give it to someone I barely knew.  I have three sewing machines, enough yardage and miscellaneous, yarns embroidery thread, needles to open a store  I usually think of all these ideas to make jewelry, just weeks or days before Christmas.

It's not about a quiet mind or any of that. It's about inspiration. You need to find something, someone, or somewhere to get ideas from. Have a friend that's into the same stuff?

Good luck.|`|eXaI4xnsaa	I'm sure you already know this but the reason why you cant focus on one thing is because your putting too much on your plate yes you sound very talented but in order to accomplish anything in life you have to take one step at a time i know it sounds so easy when i say it and i know its hard to do but one thing at a time...get one of those desires done and wowowowwow the feeling of knowing you accomplished it and starting on the next goal is the best feeling ever!!!! good luck xoxoxoxoxo

The open field is you feeling alone and isolated if hes not in your life and the suicide thing may be that you feel life would not be worth living without him. Dont take the dream as something horrible is going to happen to him and yourself. Its just a manifestation of your feelings for him. Maybe you need to focus not so much on him and make your own happiness and then two of you share the good things in both your lives.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Maybe your worried about your boyfriend|`|rDsKB0uXaa	keep your eyes on your boyfriend !|`|36b7abc7345f1a981e84c530a9048778aa	I had a dream similar to this but it was about my brother.

AA11962654	It could be that you feel guilty that you and your bother aren't closer and you want to be. Its the fear of loosing him and not even really knowing him. Yes you should make that connection the friend is only there to show you that you should have your brother as close to you as you do your friends. Go ahead make that call and start a relationship with him. And no I dont mean a romantic relationship! Good luck.|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	Pray for him, because prayer is powerful, it could mean that you are going to hear that he got in an accident, so if you talk on the phone tell him to be very careful this month when he gets in a car, train , or bus.|`|708855e3c5c0d364ce8b5feabfc1233caa	i'm thinking this is about..   since you and you're brother aren't so close.. this dream is saying to start getting close to him before you lose him.
u25R7XIGaa	Yeah, a couple were jokingly asking me out. Then starting making comments on how unattractive I am. I wanted to punch them but I wouldn't have gotten away with it, and I would have had to explain WHY I did it to the teacher.|`|AVxYA6Heaa	Yes, but I'm not attractive so that was the reason.|`|iqqQLSDDaa	Not really. The only thing that ever came close was a miscommunication. He was coming in from out of town for an appointment and we were going to meet up for coffee after. But he forgot the time I'd said and arrived an hour early...and left after a half hour thinking I'd stood him up.    We've been together 2 years now so it worked out.    Add: Why I haven't been? I really don't know.    Oh wait there was one time a guy accused me of lying about why I couldn't go out with him that day (I wasn't).|`|71mE0r7kaa	Actually no I haven't. I am trying to sit here and come up with a reason why they haven't and the truth is I don't know. Maybe because I am smart, funny, attractive and work? But then again I don't go up to guys they come up to me. So that could be it too.|`|BMIW36XFaa	Yea...in high school. My boyfriend dumped me for my slutTy best friend that "put out".

I've been dissed plenty of times but mostly when I was a kid or a teen. The only time I've really been dissed by a man as an adult has been online. It's not the end of the world. I've done my fair share of dissing too.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Nice angle dude.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Yes, once I got stood up to see a play.  When the perfomance was over I came out of the theatre and was talking to PAUL NEWMAN who happen to see the same play (starring Uta Hagan).  I didn't personally know him but....* heart flutter*...I had to talk to him. So we talked about the show as we walked out of the theatre.  (Yes even in his 70's Paul Newman was a hunk).      The one that stood me up was outside the theatre at the end, with some VERY LAME  excuse. (a lie).   I said to the guy, "oh, don't worry, it doesn't matter."      Then I strolled down the street with Paul Newman and his friend whom hailed a taxi for me.  I felt sooo good!  It was such good luck.    Later the guy who stood me up called and was like "how did you end up with Paul Newman?"   I lied this time and I said   "I called Paul from my cell phone when you didn't show up and told him I had an extra ticket."    tee hee.  One of my life's greatest moments.    *sigh*.....Paul Newman...xo|`|62ZBofvPaa	There were 3 guys in Junior High...when I was 12-13 years old, who were so mean to me...I can't even remember exactly what they said, but they used to follow me around in the cafeteria and call out random stupid stuff.

2f4qTCciaa	When someone is well known, he or she will have a better chance at making friends.    It's like this, if you are popular in work, most people will already know you, some will be curious and eventually go find out.  Same thing with school, if you are popular, more people will reach out to you, but if you are bitter and anti-social, then you'll have to be a bit more social if you want to make friends.     Famous people got to where they are today because of something we or someone want.  We are likely to give back to them something if they given us something, like a high five back or money for pizza.|`|UD93qolxaa	they're kiss a.sses|`|c2b69802ef9d960e8e16708b4ecfdc15aa	"Why do people like to support the famous person?"  Since I DON'T, I have always wondered about that, too.    I am purely guessing that by "touching" a famous person's awareness with their answers, they think they are somehow sharintg the celebrity's special status.  I guess it gives some common, everyday people the illusion that some of the special celebrity status will rub off on them in the contact - however tenuous it might be.|`|QR1ZCIP9aa	because famous people have the most peer pressure and are watched by everyone, we support them because we are a supportive people, wouldn't you want the same support?|`|0s190C7Zaa	Everyone needs a role model. And famous people happen to be the one everyone pics due to seeing them in magazines, on tv, radio, and internet. We see them more and idolize them and want to be them!|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	because some people look up to them the famous!    it's like a role model@!  most of my role models are not famoous but my friends and family are my role models ... but i'm not the typical human either!|`|QGsYPJoKaa	I think its partly to do with people, unconsicously feeling like there trying to earn brownie points and say ' I helped Hilary Clinton'. And its also to do with people sort of sucking up to the popular person, type thing, and thinking it will make them well liked and help them out.
6qPTQDdZaa	I don't really see why I wouldn't be offended at people who blame every single problem in the world on me, or what has become more common now, simply denying I have any serious problems just because of my sex.    I'm not saying all feminists do this, or even the majority, but many, many of them do.    Wright Stuff- Whites don't like affirmative action because it is legalized racism.|`|asYc2Khfaa	because those sore losers are blaming men for their shortcomings      edit to daisy. i read your post. its not fear of losing power. men can easily overpower women any time since we are the stronger sex. just look around. all rulers are men|`|SwojYmvdaa	a lot of it is to do with the fear of losing power and status in society, it's the same reason why the white male is so scared of affirmitive action. They are just sour because they've been forced to make a few concessions. By the same token some feminist arguments have been hijacked by extremists which gives the impression that women are seeking dominance over men as opposed to equality.  However this happens in most revolutions, an extremist minority will hijack the movement and unfortunately these are the ones who get a lot of air time amongst detractors|`|GvF6hcyCaa	Equality, Just because someone thinks they are equal in ability, does not make it true! There is always someone better out there. That is a fact of life men or women.|`|4pKpg757aa	Some men are scared that they will loose the power that they have had over women in previous generations. Some men don't see women as people, but just as objects to use. If someone has power equal to yours they can't control you anymore. I think they don't understand the benefits of sharing power with women. It wasn't very long ago that men got away with beating their wives, now they go to jail. That is a good thing isn't it?|`|Lc6AnV6aaa	This is because they do not know that Feminism is a theory, not a gender. To me, Feminism is the right for quality of both men AND women. Feminism was base don gaining Women's Rights. Some men think we're just angry women, or even as far as for them to say that we're all lesbians.     I am going to guess it is a bitterness because they think women have everything they have. Yes, we do, but little do some people know that our rights are abused on a daily basis. Yeah, theres a law for equal pay, but some employers dont follow it mainly for women. They don't see it as much with themselves, as i guess. I shall also gues it's an attack on them because they think women want to be superior to them, they htink we wask too much now But we're not. If theycould understand, I'm sure we could all get along equally =]|`|aX73hS2Daa	Feminism just means equality for women.  I don't know why people get all worked up about this... everyone should support equality for women, because it's HALF of the human race.  And what's good for half of us is good for everyone!    Sometimes people feel in order to counteract the unequality we need to give concessions or breaks to women to make up for this (and then men think this is reverse sexism).  It's a sticky issue.  On the one hand, in a perfectly equal world no one should get breaks or advances that others can't get.  But guess what?  Our world isn't perfect or equal!  So sometimes you gotta help those who are already disadvantaged, and that's hard.  Hard to measure and hard to know if it's really working.  So not all programs are going to be perfect... but at least we're trying, and that's what's important.  Those who consider it reverse sexism (or reverse racism like in the case of affirmative action) forget that THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.    Nowadays in most modern cultures overt sexism is hard to find and is generally frowned upon.  But it's the insidious sneaky sexism that's still around.  Also, the younger you are and the lower your position at work the less the likely you are to see real sexism, because you're not hitting the glass ceiling yet... a secretary is not going to see as much sexism as a female executive or CEO, for example.  Because the higher up you get the higher the stakes are, and the more men feel threatened and want to protect their territory.    Sexism is harder to combat nowadays because there's less of it.  Same goes for racism, etc.  The closer you get to perfect equality the tougher it is to winnow out what exactly is so sexist/racist about that?  Are women in general worse at math because of biological reasons or cultural ones?  (That's a dumb example, it's been proven women really aren't worse at math.)  If it's cultural, how do we change that perception?  As long as your sexist grandpa is around he's gonna pass his sexist views onto someone... so changing perception takes generations.  But we've come a long way!  ;)    Anyway my point is since sexism is lessened today and we've progressed so far that it's harder to see overt examples of, men think we (women) should just shut up and be happy.  Men of course enjoy their superiority and decision-making roles and don't like new challengers and competition.  They feel entitled to what they have (side note: entitlement is just about the worst trait anyone can have!) and see no reason to give it up just because some girls are whining.  It can be hard to empathize with things that are hard to articulate, and they'll never truly understand what it's like to be the "sex gender".  So we gotta do our best to share our experiences with them and show them what exactly is unfair.  Also, they have their own gender limitations like "machoness" that inhibit their expression of emotions and empathy and anything remotely feminine... not only does that hold them back, but it makes them doubly less empathatic towards us.    But I find the empathatic men are always the best in bed.  ;)|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I will speak high of Feminism when it becomes about equality indeed. Please google Harriet Harman to know what I am talking about. We all know the history of Feminism and such, but as of now, it isn't what it used to be.    Not offended/upset.

Why aren't more men offended by feminism ?|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	my thoughts and i haven't been in this section long!    some of the views on the feminists are way out in left field!  and i even side with men at that point!    example someone posted a question to not have men be in high power positions in the work place!  WTF how is that fair!  only because one is fearful!  I don't think that's a good thing to be siding with on feminism!     the basic concept of Feminism as well.. the lines on it are sooooo blurry that one can not tell if they are just man hatters or feminist.. so i can see why some men are offended!|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Not really, I'm more disgusted by radical feminists and certain feminist organizations that represent the forefront of feminism.|`|itC6iSgzaa	Without being a part of a struggle, it is hard to understand the cause and the troubles of those in the fighting party. Feminism is the movement to help women break free of their suppression, and great measures must be taken to achieve this. If group B is suppressed by group A and wants group A to see them as their equals, group B must make themselves out to be superior to group A in order to be seen as equals. Feminism is a movement that must generalise groups in order to make points about them. It is not about hating men, but about hating the stereotypical views of women CREATED BY men. That is not to say that everyone is the same. It is similar to making points about religion, etc. You don't have to believe that all religions are corrupt to suggest that they can be very excluding by nature. I dont hate Jews (I am one, in fact) but I also believe that some things in Judaism are taken too literally./ A man being offended by feminism is like a Jew being offended by my saying what I just did. Men often feel attcked by feminism, when really it isnt about degrading men, but aiding women in their struggle.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	If you really don't know why so many people have a problem with feminism, you really need to check out this website http://www.freewebs.com/feminism-evaluat...|`|PNwr3JgBaa	Because they harass us. They don't want equality they want superiority.|`|9RgjqTeuaa	Fear of losing power.    hero: You just proved my point.  TY for using yourself as an example.|`|phJfL2wTaa	For me it is the lies.  Feminism is full of lies and half truths.    The issue I have is that feminism is lobby group that uses lies to recruit young minds and force government to finance their causes, causes that are based on lies, thus forcing every American (man and women) to financially support through taxes programs based on lies.    I would have no problem if feminism furthered their cause through private Donation or Volunteerism, but apparently feminists do not want to actually help anyone, they want to force the government to do the work for them (and get the tax payer to foot the bill).      Or, could it be that feminism's ideas would not be financed by the private sector?    EDIT:  Dr. Advisor, have you read any Orwell?    "Men of course enjoy their superiority and decision-making roles and don't like new challengers and competition."    Really? ... you believe this to be true?    "So sometimes you gotta help those who are already disadvantaged, and that's hard. Hard to measure and hard to know if it's really working. So not all programs are going to be perfect... but at least we're trying, and that's what's important. Those who consider it reverse sexism (or reverse racism like in the case of affirmative action) forget that THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE."    You scare me, very well written answer and totally insane.    Hidden sexism, unmeasurable programs results, "but at least we're trying, and that's what's important."    This is the most interesting, "we're trying".  Trying to do what exactly?    Can you please try to pay for the "programs that are not going to be perfect" yourself?|`|BkleL3F4aa	its not just men its women too    and children    this children's rights site brings up all the same issues that mens rights groups and so called "anti feminists" are concerned with your group has brought attitudes and laws that put yourselves above others.    http://www.canadiancrc.com/    you see when one group in society is putting their rights before all other we are obliged to point it out. Demonising all men wasn't a good idea either.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	It is because feminists try to impose on men everything of which they say that is unfair if women are targeted by it. Feminists are sexists play and simple. They will say men and women are equal and then turn around and say a goverment needs a high percentage of women, because apparently women can do something men cant.    Oh yah and also the lies half truths and slander.|`|62ZBofvPaa	They feel like feminism is secretly trying to attack them and gain "supremacy".  They never give any examples of this "supremacy", but as far as I can tell, they think everything that goes wrong in their lives is the result of feminists.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	Because feminism really isn't about equality, it's mostly about pushing for more special privileges for women at the expense of others (mostly men).  Not that difficult to understand once a person actually look at the actions of the movement instead of just the dictionary definition alone.

Second  I had a dream some one got my number said they found it online. and i was like oh okay whatever and told them i had to go. when i hung up i saw someone outside my window (first floor) and freaked out. i ran outside while tellin gmy parents that someone was in the backyard. right outside my window, someone had drew a pentagram, lined up candles on the stars points and made a mock grave in the part of the yard beside it. one candle was still lit and i remember specifically leaning downa nd blowing it out because it bothered me. on the grave was written "finish it"|`|uaIUBYTcaa	When i was little the most disturbing dream i had was of my mom getting pushed down the stairs by her boyfriend...

When I woke up, I saw the same show on, same sounds, same EXACT room, only to see a picture of my dead dog on my nightstand. I then pinched myself and realized I was numb, and told myself I was in a dream, except everthing was so vivid, a lucid dream. I managed to get up, and I had the blanket still over my head, and everyhting was spinning and blurry, and next thing I knew I ended up back in my bed. That's when the paralysis started. I couldnt scream or move. Laying in my bed how I went to sleep. I managed to finally jerk myself and wake up. I was so relieved, just to pinch myself and feel I was still numb. I got back up, and went to my parents room. My mom said honey just slide in behind dad. Next thing I know, back in my bed, limited to looking and breathing again. I was in a sideway position when I fell asleep. I tried to scream again, nothing. I could then clap, no sound, then I couldnt move again. I managed to get back up after awhile, and went back to my parents room, to find it was my responding to reading classroom. Then I was immediately back in bed. I couldnt move again, and I saw that picture of lucy, my dead dog again. I woke up 2 times more sleeping, then woke up forreal, and was REALLY dizzy. I was too tired to get up, so I fell back asleep. I then saw a screen that said "To stay in thiss dream click here." another button said "to wake up click here" and I forget the third one. I clicked on the stay in this dream button like it was a computer, and went back into the lucid dream. I woke up a few times in the dream, then woke up forreal, and got up and went to my moms room. I was soooo dizzy and had an extreme sensation of vertigo. I pinched myself and no numbness. I was finally up! Then I had like a few other scarey nightmares like regular dreams. This was my first experience like this. I am thirteen years old.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	When I was 6 I dreamt I was being chopped up    o_O|`|6GmtcZteaa	Man why did you have to bring that up ?

My dad killed himself when i was 7 but in my dream he made contact with me and said he didn't actually die and that he was in witness protection.

4Z5T98pKaa	I think you might have to go to therapy to work through some issues, including ones you didn't want to discuss. I wouldn't try to become a social butterfly overnight. instead, i would take one or two problems you might have in life, small difficulties, and work on them. for example, how to first meet a girl, or how to relate better to a boss.    i don't think you'll be able to do a 360 on yourself. and you don't need to. there are plenty of people out there that are less social, withdrawn, etc. and they are ok people.|`|AA10447831	Soon you will be out of HS and off to college I presume. Life is different there in so many ways. You will find friends there, Just wait it out and try not to be so critical. Most people are trying their best.|`|gxGOwHC0aa	Hey let me start by saying that  ihave a bf and hes on his 20s now.. almost done with college.  He was just like you!  in high school he didnthave much friends.. growing up he was a loner and didnt really want to talk to anyone untill he was in high school.   what helped him was joining a sport (football)    I understand what you mean about not wanting to talk to other ppl because they piss you off.  When I was in high school i only had ONE good friend because everyone else was involved with the wrong thing and into materialist things and soooo not like me.     I always tell my bfs that we are just ahead of them  So im telling you the samething. You are more mature then the rest of your classmates and thats why you feel the way you do. Eventually you will fine someone who is in the same level as you.     For now some of the things you can do is join a group like my bf did. There you will meet many new people who you will have to interact with. Join something you are interested in.. music, sports, writing club, whatever it is. Because those people will have similar taste to you and that will help.    Keep in mind that there is someone out there who you will like to hang out with and talk to.. but in order to find that person you need to be able to talk to a lot of ppl. So just do it one step at a time.   Try not to judge someone... so many times ive met girls in college which i never talked to because they looked snobby and just ughh and after a while when i actually talked to them and got to know them we hit it off right away and they were awsome.     Being depressed is not a good thing. Try to fix that. My bf suffers from depression as well and this are somethings that worked for him and hopefully it can work for you too =]  1. excersise.. its a good way to let it alllll out  join a gym. try the classes, lift weights, dont have money? just go jogging everyday, do push ups stuff like that.  2. drink tea.. i know it sounds silly but trust me drink chamomile tea is a great remedy for depression!  3. TALK if you dont have someone to talk to thats fine.. write me an e-mail lol you just have to let it out some way it doesnt matter who u talk to, what it is about the point is to let it out of your system and not to just keep it in there. my email is mind_bodyandsoul@hotmail.com just in case lol    i hope this all helped   good luck!!|`|6Iwg5TDNaa	You clearly seem like an introvert, what I would suggest is that you stop trying to fit in with everyone. Just be yourself. You say that you are going to finish soon then hold on, you can get through this. If you like you can sent me emails and you can chat with me. I also experience the same thing here at my high school. Hope this helped you. My email is israelgawiseb@yahoo.com|`|AA10779521	Examine what kinds of interest you have.  Find a group that has these similar interests and join these people with the idea in mind to reach your inner self and associate with all the folks in your group.    It sounds like you really want to be excepted by your piers as well as those you come into contact with during your everyday activities.    You must learn to LET GO of those situations where someone insulted you or made your self worth suffer.  Realize that you will never like everyone you meet, but, there are people who want to know you as much as you wish to know them and by all means give them a chance and let them be themselves.    Try to understand why your criticizing most everyone you meet.    There is something in your message that tells me you could be a very happy and popular young lady if you would give yourself a chance.    I used to be very insecure when I was about your age.  I made a conscious decision to improve my attitude and work at getting along with others by getting involved in activities at school and church.  It was amazing when I would have fellow students come up to me and say they really didn't know me before we got aquainted during the activities I joined.  I must tell you there is an inner warmth that surrounds you when this happens as everyone of these people would walk up to me with a smile and happy greetings.   Believe me its worth all the effort you put into changing yourself.    I believe you will be very successful if you will only give yourself a chance.    Blessing  jerry

RMuER7UWaa	Go to dreammoods.com they have a lot of dream definitions there assorted by letter.... You could also just google it...  I would think that maybe you want kids at sometime or that soon you will have one (surprise!). I used to have a lot of pregnancy dreams and then I ended up pregnant without planning it. Or if your dreaming about a guy that your not with being the father then maybe its just showing that you have feelings for somebody else and are not with who you really want to be with. Just my guess...     Heres what I got from dream moods... :)    Pregnant    To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.     To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating. Nothing is working out the way you want it to.      If you are really pregnant and having this dream, then it represents your anxieties about the pregnancy.  Women in the first  trimester of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second trimester, dreams will reflect your anxieties about being a good mother and concerns about possible complications with the birth. Dreams of giving birth to a non-human baby are also common during this period of the pregnancy. Finally, in the third trimester, dreams consists of your own mother. As your body changes and grows, dreams of whales, elephants and dinosaurs and other larger animals may also start appearing at this stage.     *Please see also Birth or Belly.  See The Meaning In Action: "Pregnant Mother"     Pregnancy Test    To dream that you are taking a pregnancy test, may be a metaphor for a new phase you are entering in your life (a new job, relationship, etc.) You may feel that you are being put to the test as to whether you are prepared or ready for these changes.  Alternatively, this dream may be literal in meaning and address your anxieties/fears of getting pregnant.|`|0uMLrKAbaa	don't think too much about babies or pregnancy|`|ZU7rn7RHaa	Dreams are usually about something in our life's situation.

You may not know what it is and may not be able to even act upon it.       It could also represent a new idea, direction, project or goal.    If you are actually pregnant in real life, (although you've said that you aren't) then this dream could just show you the worries and anxieties that you are having over the pregnancy. Like women in the first part of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second part of the pregnancy the dreams will reflect your anxieties about the pain of birth, the becoming a mother, and a suitably good one too! As your body changes and grows, dreams of whales, elephants and dinosaurs and other larger animals may also start appearing.    To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating. Nothing is working out the way you want it to.    Hope that this helps.|`|4tynRVpzaa	It's cause you are pregnant.

Much like the way if you were organizing a pile of messy photos you've collected on your recent trip.  As you go through each photo, you see the images you experienced at that moment flash through your mind.  Your brain ends up slapping together so many memories, from thoughts you had while awake to quick visuals of billboards as you drive to work, to create a story while asleep.  To put it in perspective, you must have had a recent memory, maybe t.v., about pregnancy.  You then sleep and dream about being pregnant.  It bothers you, so you think about it more.  Thus, everytime you dream you keep dreaming about pregnancy.|`|2HZX4FHjaa	Wow. I Had a dream I was pregnant when I knew I wasn't. A few times. I was with this guy and kept dreaming of my baby. Well things went bad and I started seeing this other guy and I got pregnant. For some reason I feel like I knew because of the dream. I just didn't realize it would be sooner than later. So, it does depend on exactly what happened in your dream. Try to remember other things that might have stood out. It could mean a lot of different things. In my dream, all I could see or hear was my baby and myself. I had him above my head in my arms spinning around in the water. The focus was only on us and how happy we were. Although things aren't perfect in my life, that dream did come true. I have a very happy life with my kiddo, and it is just us.|`|sT8romFoaa	cause u migh get preganet soom|`|UbqFw9dKaa	I think it's cause you keep thinking about it all the time and in your sleep, try to forget about it! :-D|`|2QyAMsrfaa	wow... this means that ur time will be soon... use protection!|`|87dtsFLUaa	it could end up happening 2 u|`|Zx7yr4zjaa	Maybe you have something big on the horizon? or you're keeping a big secret?|`|5VkK1wc9aa	maybe u want to be pregnant OR u fear being pregnant.|`|HQsriUihaa	This dream is obvious it means that you are going o someday become pregnant.|`|8YPJsS9yaa	Are you eating before bed?

Just releasing all the thoughts you've been having recently.  Dreams take all your past experiences and everything you know and feel, and think about the future and mix it all up and give you a slice of it.    So maybe you're afraid you're going to get pregnant? Or simply have been thinking about pregnancy a lot lately?     They are probably recurring because you've been stressing about the dreams so much, so you're thinking about them a lot, so your mind gives them back to you since it's the freshest material you've been thinking a lot about available, does that make sense?  And they're so vivid because dreams can be that way sometimes. Some nights I'll hardly be able to remember my dreams at all, other nights I'll remember all the details of like 8 dreams in one night. It's crazy.    it doesn't mean you are or will get pregnant, dreams have to effect on real life except to affect your emotions when the dream upsets or confuses you.   Just don't have sex without protection.|`|AA11962654	Most dreams of birth actually mean a new phase of your life. It's to represent a new beginning .|`|cb4HEkGhaa	it means something in your Future will happen that includes you or somebody close to you getting pregnant
EeThBc3Zaa	As a wild guess, I would say it's because courts tend to give custody to the mother, all other things being equal.  Therefore, I'd guess that the percentage of women who don't get custody who are addicts/crazy/felons/complete flakes is higher than the percentage of men who don't get custody who are addicts/crazy/felons/complete flakes.   Addicts/crazy people/felons/complete flakes may not be super reliable about paying child support.|`|AA10023809	women earn less for same job, it is a statistical fact.|`|isxNUJlZaa	Deadbeat parents can be of any gender, unfortunately. There are plenty of men who don't pay their child support, so it's only logical that there will be plenty of women who don't, either.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Of course you don't provide any sources to back up your assertions.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Really? I looked it up - in one case, the figures were 30% fathers and 31% mothers not paying. Given the bias in who gets awarded custody (a separate but important issue) this means that there are still more men not paying in terms of pure numbers (I'm also concerned about the reasons women don't get granted custody, in a system even you admit is biased towards women normally - this suggests a discrepancy in the sample, the woman sample would be less typical than the male as typically women get custody, due to this silly stereotype as women as child rearers. So your conclusion is utterly unfounded, you realise)    I agree there is a unjust stereotype towards divorced fathers, and as a separate issue I wish child custody could be fairer (this would men men giving up careers more, you realise - courts have to see evidence of sacrifice for the welfare of the child). And the Child Support system does need an overhaul. But mothers do not love less than fathers, you are now seriously verging on a phobia of women, you realise?|`|phJfL2wTaa	Link please, I have not read this anywhere.  It does make me wonder, who are the women who have to pay child support?      With what little I know of the family courts in the US, women who are ordered to pay child support must have done something pretty awful for their children to be taken away.      It would not surprise me if they default on child support at a higher rate then men, considering that a man rarely needs to commit an awful act to have his children taken away and be ordered to pay child support.|`|Dfe8oKmpaa	Men have a stronger sense of responsibility % wise. Women have a stronger sense of victimhood and someone else will foot the bill (a sense that someone else will look after them).|`|IWWZdZRpaa	I'm venturing a guess here.    In order for a woman to be ordered to pay child support, she cannot be the custodial parent.  In the majority of cases where the mother is not the cusotdial parent, it is usually due to something that makes her unfit (i.e. drug use, chronic unemployment, criminal activity)    Therefore, since a woman who pays child support is more likely to be involved in criminal activity, be chronically unemployed, or a drug user, the likelihood that she would be responsible enough to make child support payments is lower.|`|d20c758729ff5fc1bce5eab1c9b36379aa	Once again you are making inaccurate statements without providing any proof whatsoever.  Maybe the husband spends all the money on himself and withhold visitation from her.  (Actually that is the answer men always give when questioned about this).|`|zkH8eUfgaa	Sorry, but I am going to answer any 'question' that interests me.   I only block people to keep them from emailing me.   I really don't care if they answer a question.      You are just annoyed that I am able to refute your rants or ask for proof, when I am a mere woman!!   Would you like me to post your emails?|`|BMIW36XFaa	Wow...that's pretty interesting.  Have you got any links?      If you're talking percentages, being that there are fewer women that pay child support, than there are men that pay child support, a larger sum of women not paying would equal a higher percentage.    EDIT:  Fewer women ordered to pay child support...    EDIT AGAIN: If there were 10 women ordered to pay child support and they all defaulted, that would be 100% of women not paying child support...    If there are 500 men ordered to pay child support and 250 men weren't paying, that would be 50% of men...    And, since there are fewer women that aren't court ordered to pay child support, that would mean that the possibility may exist that the percentage his higher, not the number...|`|oFR4yvHaaa	Because men are more responsible on average.|`|H55nCLqPaa	Here as with everything else men are just more responsible. That is precisely why children are placed with their mothers.    It is understood that if a child is placed with it's father then the mother will contribute little or nothing to it's upkeep from that point on. Most men on the other hand can be relied upon to keep writing that cheque.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I'd love to see a link to that, if you please.  But here's one guess - most mothers get custody of the children, with children going to the fathers if the mother is deemed "unfit".  Maybe they're "unfit" because they're on drugs, alcohol - who knows?|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	Shes a dead beat who is stuck in the past thinking its only a mans responsibility to pay the bills. But see even that brings up an important point, there are many women out there who get too much money in child support that is more than what the child needs. For instance say its one child and the father has to cough up $1,000 per month, then by the same logic the mother should also have to cough up 1,000 and if it does not cost $2,000 dollars a month to take care of that child then the father is being screwed.     Women think they can harass and play victim enough to bring up false charges on their exes and weasel out of child support payments.

InkQ02Qvaa	I usually find it threatening because I don't like being approached by strangers. I don't mind if it's a guy I meet through a friend introducing me, or if I'm in some group setting. But if I'm alone and a stranger comes up to hit on me, no matter how nice looking or kind they are, I feel threatened. Ted Bundy was nice and good looking, and he raped and murdered lots of women. I guess that's always in the back my mind.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	It reflects the poor presentation skills of certain men and the poor social skills of certain women.

How else would they show interest to find out if it is reciprocated?    Typically, a guy "hitting on" a woman isn't any more threatening than someone saying "hello, how are you today?"|`|mCAWxobNaa	I think it depends on the woman in question, how the man goes about approaching her and whether she's a modern feminist.  In the case of a modern Feminists, it's just a sad truth that the man is choosing the wrong woman to court; the results would be better if he courted a normal woman.  For this reason, I wish there were some agreement that modern Feminists wear a badge such than men know to steer clear of them.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Sometimes it IS threatening.    Especially when they become aggressive in persisting and won't back off.  That isn't flattering that rude and disrespectful.  I had a guy think he was cute saying he was going to "follow me around town" till I said "yes".  That was threatening and creepy.      Other times it is flattering and complimentary if a man lets you know he is interested and says something kind or asks you out.  Example: I was in a public restraunt and a cute guy approached the table just as I pushed a mouthful of lettuce in my mouth.  He said 'Hi my name is....' and then he apologized and said "Oh I'm sorry, you have your mouth full"  He looked away embarrassed and waited, and then said, well just shake your head "yes or no" if you want to go out sometime.  I shook my head "yes" and he said, "is that a yes, or are you choking?"  I Can give you the heimlick or just go away. I laughed and said yes.    Had he just plowed through and not noticed my reactions and taken cue than I wouldn't have liked him.      It just depends on the guys style.|`|62ZBofvPaa	The same reason that when men hit on men it is taken as a threat--a lot of men who run around hitting on women are unattractive and awkward and women don't really want to be seen like that by those people.

If you LIKE those dreams there isn't a problem so why bother us on answers? It happens people dream about all kinds of different people and you're dreaming about your crush because she's on your mind 24/7 therefore when you sleep your sub-conscience deals with all the stuff that goes on during the day and so the thoughts about her are formed into images and simulations of different events.
izLEVnKIaa	It means that GDP has increased. Gross Domestic Product is the value of Public investment (government - like building roads) + Private investment (industry - like building factories) + Consumer spending (high street shopping and such) + the difference between value of Imports and value of exports.    Therefore if last year the government spent $100, private sector spent $100 consumers spent $100 and exports were $200 and imports $100 then the GDP would be $400.   If this year it was $110 + $110 + $110 + ($200 - $90) then the GDP would be $440 and the economy would have grown by 10%.    At the moment there is much less Consumer spending and Private investment than last year which would mean that the economy is contracting. The idea behind a stimulus package is both to increase government spending on infrastructure and to give people money to boost consumer spending, thus making up the shortfall.|`|H55nCLqPaa	It means that the amount of goods of services available in the country is more than it was the last time you checked.
4Z5T98pKaa	I think the popularity of the word "survivor" in American culture is a little misleading. As you're getting at, what do you have to do to be a survivor?    If you're a young person being molested or abused by an adult, you are a victim, for example. But if you become an adult, and are not being molested (probably because you have lost your youthful appeal), you are no longer a victim. What should people call you that will still retain some connection to being a victim?    ah! a survivor!!!     it does not imply that you have become healed or anything. it just means that you are a previous victim. (i don't think you ever totally heal from being a victim of these various experiences.)    i think the "survivor" label is important, if you want to wear it. "i was a victim. i am working on getting on with my life."    all of this is just my educated opinion.|`|9mBUqSZhaa	strong. emotionally strong.|`|oojO4WAraa	Just means you got through it.|`|96HaY6l4aa	as a "victim"|`|GwXJpZWKaa	child abuse victim|`|2BEMSGPdaa	It's  a kid who had the phone number of the child hotline..|`|qO2slhk4aa	I am a survivor of abuse, I've begun to come to terms with it, I haven't had it interfering with my life, and I am living a pretty normal life.

8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	1) I think this one may have to do with your school.  Perhaps, in the back of your mind, you may feel that school is a battle field, or a war zone--that is not too uncommon to feel that way. As far as everyone freaking out when they see you, perhaps you have been bullied, or someone said someone unkinds to you, or maybe you just feel alienated or that you don't "fit in" as much as like.    2) I don't know about the flying part, but I think the part about the monsters possbily being your older brother and sister, may mean that you harbor some bad feelings about them not living there with you.
IS7Xubkfaa	The US had become a consumer based economy that does not make the products. We have become a service oriented country. Too much money flows out and not enough money flows back into the US.

It is wealth on paper that can go down.  Market forces set values on homes.  When the demand for homes drops, the values go down accordingly.  If a person has a home for sale for $150,000 but can get only $125, 000 for it, he does not lose anything.  He just does not have as much as he had in the past...on paper.

Certainly, there have been no layoffs in government.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	What makes you think things are so bad, and what money do you think vanished?|`|MR4I1bnLaa	The economy is bad because Americans produce few things that are consumed either by Americans or the rest of the world. We import much more than we export. The reasons for this and the problems it causes are discussed in a series of articles  and   Gas prices went up all at once, instead of in small increments like other products. Once gas prices went up two to three times the amount they were this caused everything else to inflate causing an economy crisis.

"Love" encompasses a lot of things... love between mother and child and two lovers is completely different.  Also, "love" is used between friends casually.

DO IT  i dk how you sing but if you sing good you will feel awsome!  if you sing bad and you still did it at the end of the day.. yeah your going to feel upseet.. but inside.. deep inside you will feel relieved about the fact that you stood up there and sang infront of your teacher and people.    Try small if you want. Gather your closest friends and give them a show... then ask more ppl to come.. your parents maybe their parents.. you know stuff like that untill you feel comfortable enough to try out for that show.     keep in mind that if you do not do this forever you will be wondering what if.. what if i had tryed out.. what if i was really good!     but if you do it no matter what the results are you will be ok.  even if it goes bad and you dont make it.. at least you know you got up there and you did it and now you can move on without thinking what if..    good luckkk|`|myG2hhaKaa	It takes alot of courage to sing in front of others - and I am sure famous singers were nervous about it, too, when they were younger. And you can't really go by what these boys say, because boys can often be cruel for alot of reasons: they like you, they want to be cool in front of their friends, etc.    If you have the passion to sing, then build up. Maybe sing in front of family friends, etc. Or visit your choir teacher and tell him/her that you want to sing, but are nervous about it. Perhaps she'll be willing to help you out and give you ideas to feel more comfortable. You can do it - step by step - slowly but surely. You will feel good about yourself for even attempting and accomplishing the small goals first!|`|pWLbxW7Maa	If you don't try then you'll never know if you're good or not.

Sounds like you feel like you're watching chaos aruond you and you can't do anything about it, things happen in life and you can't control them.

It's just a dream, but if there's something troubling you thats bugging your friend its taking a huge toll on you too    if not, just worried that something could happen
k4f7HG8waa	I think the key to this dream is the fact that you were napping before you went to the gym.    You may go to the gym for your health's sake, but the huge mirror suggests  that you're extremely aware or even critical of your looks. Perhaps you think others judge you by your looks. And that's a (subconscious) burden you to carry.  As it would be for any of us.     Because you mention a nap in the morning, it leads me to think that you work nights, or have such a hectic schedule, that you need to take naps whenever you can catch them. Yet, instead of sleeping a couple hours, you chose to sleep less and get to the gym. Your dream could further represent what YOU think would happen if you don't keep your fitness regimen -your looks could fall apart.  (Symbolized by the shattered mirror.)    I'm betting that you're a beautiful person, inside and out, and I'll also bet if you didn't drive yourself so hard nobody would love or respect you less. And at the very least, you'd get a bit more sleep. :)    I wish you happiness and sweet dreams.|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	Unfortunately it is not a good dream, anything with broken glass is not good.

The mirror is a reflection of ourselves. The fact that you carried one around in your dream represents your feelings of self consciousness. I may be wrong - but it may mean that you are the type of person who doesn't take a lot of risks and that you really are careful about what you do because you are afraid to offend or you don't have a lot of self confidence. You hold the mirror in front of you to make sure you look good to others and so others can't see the real you. I think you feel that if people really get to know the real you they will not like you.    Dropping the mirror is releasing the burden. It is a good thing. It is scary for you because it means you will have to take more risks and be more spontaneous and not worry about what others are thinking and how they see you. It is time for you to be true to your real feelings and not sell yourself out for the sake of looking good to others.|`|AA11962654	Wow...I totally agree with Charley...Thank you charley now i dont have to type all that out.

5M0FBU89aa	Are you married?  Did he promise to remain faithful to you?  Is the relationship basically the same (no drastic changes)?  Did he cheat on someone BEFORE you were in a relationship with him?    If any or all of the above are true, then he's either an ******, or mentally ill somehow (what you describe as chemical-imbalance).    I would get out- I know, because my ex cheated on me.  I Lost the house and 1/2 of my retirement too;   Sometimes you have to gnaw a leg off to get out of a trap.    In my case my Dad cheated on my mom and it destroyed both of us- so I would never, EVER cheat on my partner.    It can have horrible destructive power (which is one reason they do it - i believe).     Although I made the mistake of falling in love with a married woman, and having a marriage-relationship with her- which eventually led to divorce, because she cheated on me.   Therefore leading to my conclusion:   Once a cheater, always a cheater.    I'm sorry to say, but If you choose to stay in the relationship, Even though HE cheated on you, there is work you both have to do, but statistics show that in the majority of cases, it still leads to divorce.      Good Luck,    KC|`|AA10447831	Doesn't really care for you?  Very selfish!|`|RQ9xB0i8aa	Well, if they cheated on you in the first place, then they have no feelings towards you.

Temptation occurs and it overwhelms conscious awareness of actions and the consequences.  Also, we can look at how there are no causes, only effects. Like dominoes falling, it's the first that is the cause, the rest are effects.  People do lots of crazy stuff...they are controlled by the past, what people said, tv, teachers, the whole life experience...and without a person getting in touch with their true self, they'll continue doing crazy stuff.  This effects you, why are you so interested?You are losing the magic of the present moment being concerned with someone else's dis-functional mind.  And, why should he feel remorse..it is other people and fears etc that JUDGE the actions as CHEATING. If we all cheated there would be no cheating.  Let go of this problem and there is no problem.  You analyse the "devil" in men, they are weak to sexual advance. They "can't help it" through this weakness.  Be strong in your own presence, find/attract a similar partner and you'll be ok.  Or, realise that we are truly alone, be content with that and all else will be a bonus.  And breathe|`|levE5VCpaa	I think that if someone cheats and gets away with it they lose respect for you because you allowed them to treat you badly and then once they've lost respect for you they won't care about your feelings or about treating you badly again.
ngxw9waWaa	Blogs are a form of self expression, in forming sentences with correct grammar and gesticulating ideas in a readily understandable way we are able not only to convey our thoughts but occasionally read the outpourings of others. The exchange of ideas increases creativity, producing blogs that are interesting, make scintillating reading whilst portraying ideas and theories in a concise and accurate fashion allows one to perfect ones articulation in the art of communication through writing. Whether the writing is informal blog speak or a well written thesis, the mere ability to outline the thought processes occurring within our mind, structuring a beginning, argument for and against and surmising what we have concluded on a given topic or subject inspires the mind to master the gift of expressive well thought out debate in writing form.     As a journal blogs allow the tracking of the way mood affects thoughts, feelings and expression of words. There are many blogs, each will ultimately find its target audience, others equally interested in the topic of discussion. Blogs are the new age form of sharing ideas with specific groups and thinkers. A decrease in formal interaction and socialising is replaced by online blog spotting, affording others the opportunity to respond with any differing or contrary views. The mode of communication of the moment.    With regard to the formation and layout it is generally accepted most articles are based upon a standard formula.  A topic, an explanation or introduction of the subject, argument for and against, your own opinion and a concluding summary. Sections are allocated in depth enquiries to specific issues and elaborations upon the general theme. A writing style is applied whether informal, net speak, formal or eloquent prose and other factors applied according to targeted audience and readers. The subject is made interesting with anecdotal insertions and references of sources and matter detailing specific particles of the topic in question. One persons off the cuff mutterings are better received than an overly formalised and rigid thesis devoid of any emotive assertations or points, appearing as a sequence of factual data than a well written article.    Why do we write, what are words, sentences, they have a quiet power, each word activates a thought sequence of associated data, the brain is stimulated and embarks upon a path determined by emotional factors, environment, target of focus and aim. Blogs are written to offer ones ideas for critique or simply for information purposes only. If the musings gain attention and are heeded they incite a negative force shadowing the positive will to change and war ensues as one reinforces and encourages whilst its oppressive negative seeks to silence or engineer towards its own gain and enhancement.     Many have agendas and if contributors wield influence in opinions contrary to their own agenda, manipulation ensues to curtail the correspondent or defame in some manner if the opinions are valid and indominatably sound. The blogger then withdraws, or battles these forces if he has discerned their true face as such mislead by deceptions of facades with masks of the good. Historical study shows the best renowned scholars of literature were those who were balanced in outlook and view and took into account all views and their reasoning prior to writing a study upon any topic. This therapeutic advance in proprietary sense ensures not only the prevailing of sense but appeasement of any counter reactory responses hence creating an atmosphere of peace as all feel heard, understood.      Were this to become the norm, people would cease to rant, write offer opinions and be roused in passionate anger and guile to speak on issues. The arbiters of negative energy would then become disempowered as peace created an atmospheric equilibrium roused love through peace and sensibility. War continues...    Thank you for affording me this opportunity to rant ....
NYU37jfGaa	There seems to be a common misaprehension that most women did not work outside the home until quite recently.  In fact, most single women and some married women have always had to work for a living.  For instance, in the 19th century, huge numbers of women worked in domestic service, and in factories,and during the later part of the century, in offices. And large numbers of women were teachers. Women have always had to work in order to survive.    A huge difference in perception of working women though came about in the 1960s, as a result of the writings of Betty Friedan and her cronies.  For the first time, work was presented as something that women should want to do above all else, and that life without a career (just a job wasn't good enough) was meaningless. To give up work on marriage (which most single women who could afford to would do), was seen as a bad thing.  To be a wife and mother was simply not an adequate for a woman to spend her life.    The old idea, that work was something you only did if you had to, flew out the window and was replaced with the idea of work as a 'right' for women, something that they should want to do, above all else.  And so it seems they do.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	I think your opening paragraph should acknowledge that being a good mother is the most important job in the world, because the future of the human race depends on it.     Then you can go on to explain how women who don't want children have managed to have a huge influence over people in the West and convinced us that it makes no difference to families if the mother works full time and gives the child over to a stranger to do the job of mothering.    Then outline the many problems that result e.g. developmental disorders, that have a massively detrimental impact on society.     Then you can ask why the second most powerful politician in the UK wants women to be given greater access to work than men.    Then you can ask your teacher why you got an E, considering that your essay was well written, structured, and properly referenced. Her answer will imply that you are not allowed to voice opinions like the ones in your essay.|`|BkleL3F4aa	in recent times it was domestic mod cons, technology and birth control that allowed the ruling class to move the female half of the population out of the supporting a tax payer role into the role of tax payer/borrower.consumer.    the method used was an ideology that was already in existence called feminism.

I8Tahe4Jaa	You should only have sex when you want to, so if anything makes you not want to have sex, then don't. If what is making you not want  to is the fact that she is unprotected, then don't have sex.    You can use condoms, too, you know. If you are worried about pregnancy, be proactive and remember it's not solely her responsibility to keep the two of you baby-free. Pills and anything hormone related comes with the risk of blood clots, stroke, and death. Jellies and foam spermicides come with the risk of infections. Internal devices like IUD and Depro run the risk of infertility and reaction. Perhaps these are the reasons she doesn't want to use them. Condoms are the safest, as far as side effects go, and protect you pretty well, too.  You can talk to her about possibly getting a diaphragm as a back up in case the condom fails, or using spermicidal condoms- treated with nonoxydil 9 if she is not prone to infection.    Of course, you can and should talk to her about various methods and reach a happy medium that suits you both and not have sex until you do. If the two of you can swap bodily fluids with each other, you should be able to swap thoughts and ideas, too. I suggest you either reach that medium or abstain from sex until you can deal with all the consequences, including unplanned pregnancy.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	No, you're good. You have every right to expect your girl to be on contraceptives when she's repeating like a parrot 'you should keep it in your pants if you aren't willing to pay'.    Hey Equality !    What? TD's for advocating responsibilities ?|`|oFR4yvHaaa	NO you would not be wrong. You don't have to have sex if you don't want to. This is what women always say. Right?    Make sure you always use protection. You'd be a madman not to. I think the female condom might be going too far. You won't even enjoy the sex if you're both hooked up like machines with plastic and rubber everywhere.|`|UspK4SQBaa	You'd be absolutely right.  One or both of you should be using some kind of birth control/STD protection.  Just don't try to use two condoms together.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Well, how about you both use birth control.  You wear a rubber and she can be on the pill.  I think consentual adults should share responsibility.|`|flqAr30laa	of course not.  remember  C.Y.A.!!|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I think it would be a little TOO cautious if you wanted to use absolutely everything. But if you just wanted to use a condom, you'd just be playing safe.|`|AA10023809	No, it's your right to set the rules.    But it is peculiar that you do not want to use a condom yourself.|`|62ZBofvPaa	No, it means you are being more safety-conscious...you don't have to have sex with anybody if you don't want to.  There is no possible way to be "in the wrong" when it comes to choosing who you want to have sex with.    I know 2 people who won't have sex unless their partner is tested for STDs first.  One one hand, they are being safe, on the other hand, they have sex a lot less.  So that's the trade you have to  make.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	No you wouldn't be wrong.  But if you expect her to use BC and you aren't willing to use a condom yourself, you are a hypocrite.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Not at all, though it is unfair that you think she should be the only one using birth control. You should protect yourself from unwanted pregnancies, as well, instead of leaving it entirely in her hands.     But I agree that anyone, male or female, who does not want to have children (or STDs) should not have sex unless BOTH are willing to protect themselves, so you're doing the right thing.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Smart man the last thing you want to end up with is a STD and getting her pregnant|`|pzLDXL6gaa	You'd be in the wrong if you did that and then turned around when she got pregnant and blamed it entirely on her and tried to run away.

A condom with a spermicide is pretty foolproof.  Or you might try honey, which I understand has very good spermicidal properties.|`|isxNUJlZaa	As long as you're willing to help dish out money for it and/or use male protection, I wouldn't see the problem.     And yes, you would have to help pay for it. If her insurance doesn't cover it, the birth control can add up over time and cut into her personal expenses. It's only common courtesy :)|`|phJfL2wTaa	You would not be wrong.  Also, do not believe her without proof that she is using birth control.    And Most Important!    Protect yourself, either condoms or a vasectomy (your only two options).    Refusing her sex is never wrong, because it is never wrong for her to refuse sex from you, that's rape right?|`|W1VqOP83aa	Why would a guy dish out money for a girls birth control? She saw HER doctor who gave HER a prescription for HER body which has other positive effects like regulating HER cycle, lower HER risk of uterine cancer, lessening HER acne. The law says its HER bill, and you should too. When you have any legal control over her reproductive system, such as deciding whether or not she can abort the fetus you both created, then you can start paying for it.  Feminists=self entitled hypocrites. They want all the choices and non of the financial burden. Buy condoms, not birth control pills.|`|kmPGZGjtaa	What ever happened to abstaining from sex before marriage? Are young people really that slutty?|`|71mE0r7kaa	Your lose son! HA HA. Oh well looks like you won't be getting any. You know all that crap that you just mentioned causes women to get cancer. I say go all natural. If you are going to have sex even with some sort of preventive measures there are chances you can still get pregnant. So learn how to pull out good ;)|`|u25R7XIGaa	Not at all. That's actually pretty smart. Both of you should. Why the heck would she refuse to use birth control, does she WANT to get pregnant?|`|m89kGXBnaa	No, you both absolutely have the right to insist on protection.    Types of protection could be discussed though - i.e. if it's an issue of her buying the condoms, which remain probably the easiest and most popular form of protection. Diaphragms don't protect against stds, and female condoms used to be noisy, but are apparntly improving in design; although tests show they are less effective than male condoms (i.e. 5% perfect use failure rate, compared to 2%). But otherwise yes, both of you share responsibility for providing and using contraception.|`|AA11615514	It's not wrong to want to protect her and you from an unwanted pregnancy. I don't see why you expect her to do it all though. If you want to be really sure she doesn't get pregnant there is no better birth control than a male condom used correctly. A male condom used along with another method is best.You should at least contribute to her costs is she is paying out of pocket for birth control. Female methods are much more expensive than condoms for you.
r3gh7ho7aa	The answer is $710 - $575 because marginal cost means the "additional" cost.  Therefore, we need to find the additional amount of money it will cost to go from a 1 bedroom to 2 bedroom apartment.  So the MC is $135.
AA11305474	I live in the state of CA where the governator is considering raising personal income tax across the board by 5% and increasing sales tax to 10%.  Both of these will create an abrupt decline in consumer spending.  Also, increased debt, job loss, inflation, and as we have seen, liquidity squeeze.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	The stock market falling, loss of job,that's about all I can think of.|`|lxnzcO4Paa	an abrupt decline in their source of money.  like being laid off.      if the price shot up way high and it was not a necessity.    if the supply of product X ran out,  that would cause the price to go up.|`|ymU9QGlUaa	Usually price increases cause an abrupt decline in consumer spending.  Lack of confidence in the monetary system, fear of future financial difficulties, loss of equity in possessions will also cause a decline in spending.
ymU9QGlUaa	Not soon.  All the money that the fed printed up will eventually cause hyper-inflation.  Things are going to get much, much worse before they get better. Food and energy prices will soar at several hundred percent inflation. Things are not going to be good for a few years.|`|5Snex2peaa	Nobody knows.    It's 40 years after the Moon landing and economists don't talk about the planned obsolescence of automobiles or how much Americans lose on that junk every year.    Would you believe $300,000,000,000.  I challenge any economist to come up with a better number.|`|SHsIybhhaa	My Economics teacher was on about this yesterday. His prediction is job losses will continue and peak in maybe 2010, when the economy will start to pick up again.  Whether we're fixed in the long term with national debt and rising international competition from Asia and that - nobody knows.
EnyhoOmTaa	Dreaming that you are proud of your nakedness and show no embarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted freedom. You have nothing to hide and are proud of who you are. The dream is about a new sense of honesty, openness, and a carefree nature.     Maybe you're trying to tell yourself to be more carefree around him? Or to let your feelings show more?|`|JyvG8dFcaa	because of your attraction you are feeling vulnerable...
0PVp8Okoaa	haha! well i don't know how many that have turned ugly, but i know how many is still their gorgeous self.     1.,... AND THAT'S YOU ;)|`|AA10287830	Probably about twice as many as you'd like:)|`|UwiGwDGdaa	What does this have to do with psychology?     It's sad that you're so shallow at 37 years old.
e88862626d5369dd487c7f4e8374547faa	Freud hypothesized that we humans are innately and inherently evil, and thus must continually attempt to suppress our primitive behavior which always lies just below the surface of consciousness.
