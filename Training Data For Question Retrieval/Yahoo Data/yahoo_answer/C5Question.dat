We accuse iraq of mass weapons of destruction, we then invaded them immediately. We don't however don't do anything about the soviet union in the past and north korea currently. Why?

Finally, Obama argues against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act as an Illinois Senator in 2002.      Americans of good faith are divided on this issue. Many are pro-life, and many are pro-choice. Obama’s extreme record should horrify the former group, and should even give significant pause to the latter.

20090202195807AAc6VB6	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What incentives would there be to Northern Ireland if it was apart of the Republic of Ireland?	I'm happy this section is for both British and Irish citizens, so I can get to here the responses from both. To start out though, I'm an American (and not a stupid one lol), so I hold no bias towards either argument.    What benefit could there be to people in Northern Ireland if northern Ireland were to become apart of Ireland? Realistically, I don't see this happening and it's actually against the interests (especially economic interests) of the residents there, but for argument sake, how may it help them? This is why when I hear things about the ''IRA'', I kind of laugh a little. Here's some reasons why.    1) I'm not sure if this is true in all EU country's, but I'm aware that it is in Britain. You're college education is completely pay for. Your taxes may be higher for it, but hey, I can tell you how much it sucks paying a student loan. I'm in a community college right now, barely being able to balance my part time Home Depot paychecks with it to avoid getting a student loan. I don't know what the case is for Ireland, but if they don't fund college education (or fully), than this would be a disadvantage.    2) Lots of Northern Ireland residents would move to England's mainland, because they wouldn't want to give up their citizenship, nor gain a new one.    3) The whole basis of why radicals wanted Northern Ireland to be apart of Ireland has withered. Northern Ireland, which was actually historically Protestant, no longer dignifies itself by religion, but religion has become much less important in Europe over the past few decades. Although Ireland's no where near as Atheist as England, it's rising in Ireland and the religion just doesn't seem important anymore.    Besides religion getting less significant, it's probably even become more encouraging to leave Catholicism, because people, particularly those who are educated, show resentment towards the church. I doubt the pope reinstating a Holocaust-denying pope helped. Media portrayals with movies like ''Doubt'' don't help much either. I was born Catholic, but don't associate myself with religion really, so I can tell you first hand. So if religion was the base towards kinship, you'd have to think that had to contribute to the reason why the idea of this movement has died, or gotten less violent if it minimally exists.    4) Would you rather run on the Pound or the Euro? Trust me, if you're British, and you leave England to another EU country, whether it be for business or leisure, you're happy your currency is above their's. Who would want to give up that perk?    I think the reason why some people think the Northern Irish's angst about this is because they think they're getting screwed economically. That's apparently not the case though.    The question has floated out there about if they should or could become their own country too, but that's another (and more) complicated story.

20090201220254AArwN4D	Politics & Government;Military	Why are women in military not as appreciated as the men by some people?	Record Number of Injuries, Fatalities   According to U.S. military records, 33 female soldiers--three in Afghanistan and 30 in Iraq--have been killed since operations started in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.      In addition, 240 women have sustained combat-related wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan. Left with permanent injuries that have sometimes required amputation, most of these women--like those killed--were struck by bombs that hit transport units or camps with no warning.      "We don't track the number of women soldiers wounded by U.S. forces in friendly fire," said Army spokesperson Lt. Colonel Bryan Hilferty. "But these accidents don't happen often."          The death and injury toll for female soldiers in the current conflicts shatters previous records for women serving in positions that are also shared by men. In the Gulf War--the first major conflict where women soldiers served alongside male soldiers--216,000 women were enlisted and 16 were killed. In Iraq and Afghanistan, only 17,000 female soldiers are enlisted. But their deaths account for 33 of the 1,000 estimated fatalities among servicewomen in U.S. history. To date, nearly all of these fatalities have been among female nurses and support staff.      "Having this many female casualties in uniform is certainly new," said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst for The Brookings Institution in Washington. "It has made this policy debate more visible and more visceral."      Women More Active in Military   Historians estimate that only 20,000 American women have fought in battle since Margaret Corbin hoisted her petticoats and took charge of a canon after her husband fell in the Revolutionary War.      Since the creation of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901, women have been employed directly by the military. But until recent decades, most have served as nurses and support staff. That started to change in the Korean War during the early 1950s, when the military began accepting women for active duty.      In 1992 the Air Force began allowing female pilots to fly in some combat missions. In 1993 the Navy started allowing women to serve on combat ships. In 1994 the Army dropped a rule prohibiting women from filling positions with a "substantial risk of capture." These changes opened up 90 percent of military jobs to women for the first time.      "From this point onward, women were not only trained to use arms, but could also fire them on the job," said retired Air Force Capt. Barbara Wilson, founder of Military Women Veterans in St. Augustine, Fla.      Today, female soldiers take infantry training alongside their male companions, learning how to fire assault weapons and move under direct and indirect fire. Accounting for 15 percent of all service people and 10 percent of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, women work as engineers, truck drivers, pilots and weapons experts.      Two prohibitions hold female troops back from full parity. They are barred from positions that involve direct combat (such as serving on submarines, in the Special Forces and in infantry, armor and artillery positions). They are also barred from "collocated units" that support combat troops. A woman can serve as a medic, for instance, but not as a medic in a unit that "collocates" or supports a unit on the front line.      Sounds to me like they pay just as important of a role over there and deserve recognition by the public...... Some of them too have paid the ultimate sacrifice in combat..... THANK YOU WOMEN IN THE ARMED SERVICES!!!

20081008040415AAUyebF	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do you think making marijuana illegal was a mistake?	I don't know the facts, but marijuana is several times stronger than a couple of decades ago, due to hydroponics, genetic modification etc.   Thus making it easy to smuggle (stronger weed = less needed for same potency) But if it wasn't illegal, then there wouldn't been any call for this sneaky goings ons. Then every joe blow and his dog was still growing it in his back yard it would still be the same seed used decades ago thus it wouldn't be as harmful.      My second argument is that marijuana is a sedative and it doesn't cause users to get violent. (like alcohol which incidental is still legal) honestly even if a pothead wanted to fight someone he would probably just say. "ehh I wouldn't mind hitting that bloke but im too high.. ooo i've got the munchies."        Finally I'd like to address the criminal element, a lot of drug dealer i've read about made there start peddling pot at college or uni. If it were legal they wouldn't have the market to make there start, maybe they would just stick at their studies and become and respectably doctor or lawyer.      I'll just like to add that I don't condone drug use, neither am I trying to get a rise out of any particular group or persons. This is a genuine debate and i'll be interested in your serious opinions.

20081015231644AAgrc1h	Politics & Government;Elections	Why can't Obama supporters see that raising taxes on "the rich" hurts a lot of people who are NOT rich?	Nina is a self-employed interior decorator.        She makes WAY LESS than $250,000 -- the income above which Obama says he will raise taxes.        She lives in an apartment, has no maid, and drives a regular midsized car.       Nina just met a prospective married client, whose husband works in the entertainment industry.       The client may have to pull the job, though,  because of Obama's impending tax plans.       That's because Nina's prospective clients -- who do make more than $250,000 -- face an increased tax rate of 39.5 percent.       And increased Social Security taxes.       AND higher taxes for capital gains and dividends.       Here's one of MANY examples where Obama's tax hikes on "the rich" will not hurt "the rich" in any significant way.      But they will hurt lots of regular working people like Nina.     .

Now Hilliary supporter have a legitimate reason to vote for McCain.      Home Plan   John McCain believes there is nothing more important than keeping alive the American dream of owning a home. Priority number one is to keep well-meaning, deserving home owners who are facing foreclosure in their homes.       John McCain's approach to helping sub-prime or other financially strapped mortgage borrowers is built on sound principles:       No taxpayer money should bail out real estate speculators or financial market participants who failed to perform due diligence in assessing credit risks. Any assistance for borrowers should be focused solely on homeowners and any government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk.          Any policy of financial assistance should be accompanied by reforms that promote greater transparency and accountability to ensure we never face this problem again.    John McCain has proposed a new "HOME Plan" to provide robust, timely and targeted help to those hurt by the housing crisis. Under his HOME Plan, every deserving American family or homeowner will be afforded the opportunity to trade a burdensome mortgage for a manageable loan that reflects their home's market value.       Eligibility: Holders of a sub-prime mortgage taken after 2005 who live in their home (primary residence only); can prove creditworthiness at the time of the original loan; are either delinquent, in arrears on payments, facing a reset or otherwise demonstrate that they will be unable to continue to meet their mortgage obligations; and can meet the terms of a new 30 year fixed-rate mortgage on the existing home.             John McCain's HOME Plan Will Keep 200,000 To 400,000 Families From Losing Their Homes. "But at the same time, McCain is calling for aggressive federal action to help keep 200,000 to 400,000 families from losing their homes. That plan has many of the elements of a proposal by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., requiring participating lenders to forgive part of the loan principal and then write a new loan that would be backed by the federal government through the Federal Housing Administration." (Tom Raum, "Everyone's Invited: McCain Economic Plan Draws From Both Parties," Tucson Citizen, 4/17/08)             How It Works: Individuals pick up a form at any Post Office or download the form over the Internet and apply for a HOME loan. The FHA HOME Office certifies that the individual is qualified, and contacts the individual's mortgage servicer. The mortgage servicer writes down and retires the existing loan, which is replaced by an FHA guaranteed HOME loan from a lender.          John McCain will bolster groups like Neighborworks America that provide mortgage assistance to homeowners in their communities.

It's not something that goes away.      A child has an even worse time- children aren't born hating others, or being angry. They are born knowing nothing of the world, and when an adult takes advantage of them like that and scars them, it just makes me sick.      There is a registered sex offender in this town, and I don't think he should be allowed to be around children. It doesn't matter if he's "sorry," the fact is WE don't know that, and he might do it again.       Don't you think these people should just be eliminated for their crimes?

20081015122849AASNHm9	Politics & Government;Politics	What will be the best tactic to use when McCain mention Ayers tonight?	McCain has all but assured the public that he will bring up William Ayers in the third and final debate tomorrow. How should Obama counter act the Ayers attack?       1.    Move On: John, we are in the midst of a financial crisis and two wars. Why are we concerning ourselves with a man who did some despicable things when I was 8 years old and who I barely know today. John if you spent as much time trying to work on an economic plan as you have trying to tie me to Ayers, you might still have some credibility.      2.    Defend Ayers: John, 40 years ago we were in the midst of racial injustice, and an unjust war. William Ayers tried to combat that using sabotage to protest those things. He never harmed, hurt or killed another human being and believed that what he was doing was helping this country. While I don’t agree the tactics he used 40 years ago, he since has been a champion for education and poverty. If Ayers was such a bad evil man, why was he a professor at an esteemed university? Why did Walter Annenberg, a former ambassador under Nixon, whose wife recently endorsed you, put Ayers on the board for his Chicago Annenberg Challenge?      3.    Counter Attack AKIP: John, its funny you keep on bringing up my supposed radical ties, when your running mate and her husband were members and or strongly affiliated with the Radical Alaskan Secessionist group, AKIP. They saw America as imperfect enough to want to secede from the union, not exactly Country First, John. And John can we talk about the AKIP’s founder Joe Vogler, who said ‘The fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government.’ And who died in a plastic explosives deal gone wrong.      4.   Counter Attack Bin Laden: John, why are we talking about a man who is a college professor who has changed his ideology many years ago. Why aren’t we talking about Bin Laden, the real terrorist who is responsible or 9/11? In the past two debates, why did you call Bin Laden and his Mujahideen ‘Freedom Fighters,’ who drove the Russians out of Afghanistan? Do you still believe Bin Laden is a freedom fighter?      5.    Counter Attack G Gordon Liddy: John in politics you meet a lot of different people from lots of different backgrounds with a lot of different views. I’ve gone into great length explaining to the American people my relationship with Ayers. Can you explain your relationship with G. Gordon Liddy. Liddy was convicted for conspiracy, burglary and illegal wiretapping in the Watergate investigation, and was a  man who concocted plans to firebomb the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. and to kidnap anti-war protesters. This is the same Liddy who advised his listeners to shoot at ATF officers after the WACO incident,  saying “Now if the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms comes to disarm you and they are bearing arms, resist them with arms. Go for a head shot; they’re going to be wearing bulletproof vests. ..Kill the sons of bitches.” Why do you continue to go on this man’s radio show why did you tell him “I’m proud of you, I’m proud of your family… It’s always a pleasure for me to come on your program, Gordon, and congratulations on your continued success and adherence to the principles and philosophies that keep our nation great.’ Why do you call this man a friend?

20081015124500AAhwKLz	Politics & Government;Elections	How many people would be willing to support a revised and fair draft to win both Iraq and Afghanistan?	I have posted this twice and Republicans keep trying to delete it when the answers run against them. How many people agree this is a valid question? I am going to add extra facts now. Recruitment is down, retirements in the military up. The need for extra troops is the number one priority of both wars. I do not support the concept of a draft myself. I am from the generation that can recall the last one. The only way I will ever support another draft is if loopholes that allowed so much avoiding of it before are closed. I have said I would want it to be more like universal military service on the model of Switzerland. and people like Dick Cheney not being able to evade service again. I doubt very much we would get a draft with no loopholes, where the rich and privileged can't avoid service. But I have asked again and again how the Republicans plan to get the added numbers to fight both Iraq and Afghanistan if they win next month. I get no detailed and thought out numbers. My private opinion is if McCain wins there will be a military draft no matter what they are saying at the moment. And that it will not be a fair one. I don't support that just to stay in Iraq. Our safety is not involved in Iraq. And our terrorist enemies are in the mountains of the Pakistan/Afghanistan border. I will not support a draft just to stay in Iraq. If there is an alternative plan from the GOP I want to see someone who supports McCain/Palin put it out in a reasoned answer. I want to see how many Republicans would be willing to see a children and grandchildren and even themselves drafted to win the war they support. Who agrees this is a valid question?

John Mc Cain has no education at all. Obama is a lawyer with a Harvard Degree and has a degree in political science.       McCain and Palin are not even qualified to manage at any retail store.

Even by Republican standards, his credentials are unassailable and pristine (4-star general, chief of staff, national security advisor, secretary of state, vietnam vet).  He even went to bat for his commander-in-chief by going to the U.N. to back Bush's ill-advised invasion (being the consummate loyal soldier) and he's still being viciously criticized and attacked by his party because he's voting his conscience.  You have to be a pretty scummy piece of trash to go after someone with Powell's integrity, character, and record.  If you can't put your trust in a fellow Republican of Powell's stature then you might as well fold up the GOP tent and go home.

He says he fights and will fight for what he believs no matter what the turn out is in the name of the middle class yet his excuse for voting for the Bush failure economy package is: I was obligated because the law was going to pass? What? If you were against the package then you would have done anything to prevent it and even if it was inevitable then still vote agianst it to physically show you dissaproval. That kills me.

20081030173945AAcsrFu	Politics & Government;Elections	What will YOU be voting on prop 5...?!?	   Proposition 5 will cut state costs. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst estimates those savings at $2.5 billion or more. Prop. 5 safely eases prison overcrowding by investing in drug treatment - which costs much less than prison - for youth and nonviolent offenders. Prop. 5 provides treatment with strict accountability.      Prop. 5 is supported by the League of Women Voters of California, Consumer Federation of California, California Nurses Association, California Society of Addiction Medicine, California Federation of Teachers - and many others.      Prop. 5 is opposed by the state prison guards' union, which has contributed almost $2 million for deceptive TV ads. Prison guards benefit from prison overcrowding and new prison building, but California loses.          http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5BZxIFkeu_...       So are you gonna vote on it?

First of all we pay rent monthly and have to give you one month written notice before moving out, you must also do this if you want us out.  An exact quote from the “renting a home” pamphlet provided by the Rentals man stating The Residential Tenancies Act is “the landlord must give you one month's notice to move out”.  I also have to give one month written notice so here is mine, I will be moving out as of the end of July.         It is also apparent that I will need to pay $275 for this month rent, but it appears as follows.  Again out of The Residential Tenancies Act it states that “Your rent may be increased if the landlord gives you three months notice

20090203002354AA7I1O8	Politics & Government;Politics	Who really benefited from the 700 Billion $$$ Bailout?	American tax payers where told that their hard earned money was going to help stabilize the failing American banking system.  Okay, and now tax payers are paying the banks 700 Billion dollars and in doing so are losing 700 Billion dollars.  Additionally, many of these same Tax payers are also losing their homes that the banks now own (an additional benefit for the banks).  To top all this off most American tax payers are going to pay off this "so called" loan of 700 Billion Dollars.  Has anyone stopped and questioned where the Banks get their money to pay off this loan?  You got it, the American tax payer who has to go to the banks for loans.  So who really got the shaft, a triple whammy and who really benefited?  Would you vote for the politician(s) who voted for this bailout again?

20090203014813AAGlRdK	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do you share my opinion that the shoe thrower at Mr Wen was at least a man of principles?	I’m Italian and most of the times a feel like throwing more than a shoe to Mr Berlusconi for his way to manipulate facts and law at his advantage, anyway his government is not as bad as the Chinese one; I forgot Italy is democracy. But GOOD LORD we are sick and tired of preachers than with a devil-like-smile pretends to work in favour of the people when as a matter of fact they stamp over human rights to maintain power and wealth. If I had been the shoe thrower I would have asked the audience to abandon the place and leave that Mr Wen alone. As the throwing of the shoes was not intended to harm that man, but was just a symbolic act, then also the students that applauded  should be charged, besides if the shoe thrower had had a loud speaker he would have acted in a different way. England is a “democracy” too and I respect all the opinions of the people who attended the conference whether they applauded or not.   Thank you

DID YOU KNOW?      As you enter the Supreme Court courtroom, the two huge oak doors have the Ten Commandments engraved on each lower portion of each door.      DID YOU KNOW?      As you sit inside the courtroom, you can see the wall, right above where the Supreme Court judges sit, a display of the Ten Commandments!      DID YOU KNOW?      There are Bible verses etched in stone all over the Federal Buildings and Monuments in Washington, D.C.                  DID YOU KNOW?      Patrick Henry, that patriot and Founding Father of our country said, "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by Christians, not on religions but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ".      DID YOU KNOW?      Every session of Congress begins with a prayer by a paid preacher, whose salary has been paid by the taxpayer since 1777.              SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE??      How, then, have we gotten to the point that everything we have done for 220 years in this country is now suddenly wrong and unconstitutional?

Of course, now everyone that has seen this evidence of the truth claims that these weapons are old weapons, but the age of the weapons was not a question.

I am as guilty as the next guy, probably more so, of being a very outspoken advocate for immigration, but against illegal immigration. I received an email from my mother today, and it only included this site. No note or anything. So I HAD to see what it was she so obviously wanted me to see. I went, and read every word, and realized that after all of my posturing, and all of my financial losses due to the illegal immigration problem (And we're speaking well over 6 figures here, people), I am still one of the most priveledged people on the face of the Earth, and anyone lucky enough to read this post, can probably join me in rejoicing in that fact. I wish to change no one's opinion. I only wish you to go to this site, read this, and take a second to thank your God that you were able to do so, and maybe come away just a little humbled from the experience. Those in here that know me, know I don't humble easily.   Semper Fidelis

Friday August 11, 2006   Guardian Unlimited:   "The Israeli government has been facing growing discontent at home over its handling of the war, with polls revealing plummeting support for the government and members of the rightwing Likud party calling for new elections. Anti-war elements of the Israeli left have also voiced their opposition over recent days."   A poll published in Israel's Ha'aretz newspaper showed approval ratings for Mr Olmert's government had fallen to 48% from 75% in the opening stages of the war.Opinion polls also showed signs of growing anti-war feeling."
20060811114247AAk5u5y	Politics & Government;Immigration	We the people of America are beyond OUTRAGED that two US Border Patrol Agents - HEROES - are being wronged by?	their own government.      This wrong has been broadcasted to the American people over national radio shows - such as the John and Ken Show, George Putnam, Laura Ingraham and many more.      And we the people are fighting mad!      I called the White House - the woman who answered the phone knew of the U.S. Border Patrols' case because she is getting phone calls from furious American citizens. In fact, the woman who answered the phone AGREED - this case is just plain WRONG.      I am writing to express my revulsion that a hero like U.S. Border Patrol Agent Ignacio Ramos is being convicted of a crime on TRUMPED UP CHARGES!!!!      Ramos has protected our nation from drug smugglers! He should be celebrated and showered in awards and accolades!      Since when did the U.S. Government base cases against our own law enforcement hinging on the testimony of a foreign national drug smuggler? Since when did foreign drug smugglers get to put U.S. law enforcement behind bars? Utterly outrageous.      The case that I read in the newspaper states that the drug smuggler changed his story YET that evidence was not presented to the jury - WHY? Below is the quote from the article:         "The Ramoses also contend Aldrete-Davila's story changed several times.      According to the memo, Aldrete-Davila told investigators the agents shot him in the buttocks when he was trying to enter the country illegally from Mexico. But according to Aldrete-Davila's later testimony and that of the agents, he was shot after trying to evade the agents upon his re-entry into Mexico.      The memo never was disclosed to the jury."      In addition, Ramos clearly states that supervisors were onsite - with him on the ground - and for that reason he did not contact them officially - SUPERVISORS WERE THERE!      US Attorney Debra Knof of El Paso, said that the drug smuggler did not have a weapon. How can you trust a drug smuggler to tell the truth??? WHY WOULD A DRUG SMUGGLER NOT HAVE A WEAPON???      There are so many holes in this OUTRAGEOUS case that is reads like a Twighlight Zone episode.      If the two brave US Border Patrol Agents broke with protocol during this dangerous and courageous pursuit - that should merely be handled internally. Period.      We the people are stepping forward to say to the US GOVERNMENT FREE OUR HEROES - heroes saving our nation from criminals and drug smugglers - FREE RAMOS AND COMPEAN!      signed      We the People.      Here is the telephone number for Assistant US Attorney Debra Kanof Phone: (915) 534-6884 - quoted in the article by Sara Carter, below.

Como recurso para refor?ar a tese, exibe, numa maquete do interior do Palácio do Planalto, a proximidade do gabinete de Lula com os principais nomes da "quadrilha" denunciada pelo procurador-geral da República, Antonio Fernando Souza, por corrup??o ativa e desvios de verbas públicas. "Ent?o, Lula é incapaz de controlar até mesmo seu ambiente de trabalho?", questiona um ator.       A programa mostra ainda os afagos do presidente a três dos principais integrantes do esquema: o ex-ministro chefe da Casa Civil José Dirceu; o ex-tesoureiro Delúbio Soares e o ex-ministro da Fazenda Antonio Palocci. O presidente aparece elogiando cada um deles, após eles terem deixado os cargos no governo e no partido por n?o conseguirem se defender de denúncias.Sobre o ex-chefe da Casa Civil, o programaSobre o ex-chefe da Casa Civil, o programa mostra a afirma??o de Lula que "feliz do País que tem um político da magnitude de José Dirceu". Lula aparece, igualmente enfático, chamando o ex-tesoureiro de "nosso Delúbio" e quando afirma ter com Palocci "uma rela??o de companheiro, possivelmente mais do que a rela??o de irm?o". "O presidente diz que n?o via nada, mas a seu lado os amigos construíram uma organiza??o criminosa sem precedente no nosso País", afirma o programa do PFL.      Posando diante de manchetes da imprensa e de outros jornais sobre os crimes atribuídos a petistas, o apresentador avisa no início programa que o que o assunto "é de interesse de todos os brasileiros". Faz, em seguida, um apanhado das denúncias iniciadas com o flagrante do ex-servidor dos Correios Maurício Marinho recebendo propina.       A próxima tomada é do ex-deputado Roberto Jefferson (PTB-RJ) contando parte do que sabia sobre o esquema patrocinado por petistas de peso no governo.       Além de Lula e das acusa??es contra seus ex e atuais auxiliares, s?o exibidas a entrevista do procurador-geral denunciando a "quadrilha", da notícia crime protocolada no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) contra o presidente pela Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil (OAB), além de cenas do quebra-quebra do MLST na Camara dos Deputados, seguido do apelo: "N?o dá mais para deixar o País nas m?os dele."      Nas cenas finais, o partido insiste na liga??o do presidente com os integrantes da "quadrilha". Eles s?o chamados um a um e aparecem como bonequinhos de papel, de m?os dadas. Primeiro Lula, seguido de José Dirceu, Gushiken, Delúbio Soares, Silvio Pereira, Marcos Valério, Paulo Okamotto e, por último, o líder do MLST, Bruno Maranh?o.

20060906152625AAlBFUg	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do college grants provided by the federal government actually hurt those who want to succeed?	I'm in college now, and it seems like a doghouse out there. See I go to a community college, and I have been in college for a while since I have been going part time. I am seeing a change in college education. I used to believe that if government gave grants ($you don’t have to pay back) to people who could not afford college then more people would be educated and have more knowledgeable. I feel that i'm wrong now. See when I went to college they were playing loud music and I could not understand the words cause it was in Spanish. People were all over the place yelling and carrying on and dancing to this ethnic music. I thought college was supposed to be for learning and studying, not all this crap. I also think that college may be easier now because it has to be to pass these people and to get more money from the government. Am I right about this? Is our federal government ruining college education?If the government stays out of college education, would it benefit hard working people?

Barring the Constitutional amendment regarding the "right to bear arms," because its meaning is debatable, why should your right to own a gun be more important than my right to life?  It seems the right to hunt pales in comparison to the number of lives banning guns would save.  Perhaps I'm wrong, however.        I realize my phrasing shows my bias, but I can't very much hide it, because I believe gun ownership to be completely unnecessary.  Does anyone have any logical arguments otherwise?  I'm interested to hear them.
