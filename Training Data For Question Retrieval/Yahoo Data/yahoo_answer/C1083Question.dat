I dyed my hair red in December for a Christmas play but a week later the directors told me to dye it a "natural" color cuz they said I'd "draw attention". So I ended up dying it brown and it completely fried my hair thanks to them... Anyway, I got it cut a couple days ago and the color has faded a lot since the play.  I wanna get it back to my natural hair color and not dye it anymore.  Right now its this really weird dark brassy color that doesn't look too good cuz the red and brown got mixed together.  Is there anyway to have the color wash out quicker so i can have my natural color back? Or do i just have to wait til it fades?

20061105100117AAPByaC	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is there a product(shampoo/conditioner) that is specifically to prevent fading of dyed black hair?	i have dyed my hair black for about a year now and i love it, but after about 2 weeks with the color, it looks like i've dyed it a reddish brown because all of the black color has completely faded out. this is annoying on another level as well because everytime i dye my hair, i cannot just dye my roots because the whole head of hair has faded. this makes me hair very dry. i really need to find product specifically formulated for dyed black hair, to keep the color. thanks!

20061129163713AAAxIB9	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Why do a lot of the tattoo artist refuse to teach someone that lives near them?	I have been learning to tattoo for about 5 months now from someone that use to work out of a tattoo shop but does it out of his house now.  When I was looking for someone to learn from every tattoo artist around here did not want to help out.  They fear that if you work under them and they teach you what they know you will go off and take some of their buisness.  Don't get me wrong I really do like the artist around here.  They do really good work and would love to learn from them but they are not willing to teach.  I have done 10 tattoo's so far and they keep getting better every time I do them.  The ones I have done I barely charged anything and they were my friends that were willing to let me tattoo them.  So I figure just as long as you know the dangers of tattooing and how to properly protect yourself and the costumers there is nothing wrong with doing them out of a house and not a shop.

I have side bangs with black underneath and black underneath at the bottom of my head and I have a red patch streak underneath my left side but you can still see it and I have layers but they have outgrown a bit and I'm usually too lazy to back comb unless I go out..lol...hopefully that'll help. Thanks.      I want a different hairstyle now. I had the side bangs with alot of layers and now I want to change and made it into something else. So tell me what you think.

I've read up, but the thing I haven't seen is how light do you need it before I'm ready to color it with pillarbox red (directions dye) and get the maximum color from it?      Will it take to just gold/yellowy lightened hair? or does it have to be lighter still? I'm just not sure how light you have to be before applying a color such as red.      I'm going from dark brown/black hair.      Also no stupid remarks, no quotes of snobbery telling me to go to a salon, I think if everybody had the money and better still salons were cheaper then everybody would go.      Also no answers from people who just guess, or think they know what they're talking about. I just want a straight answer without all the rubbish about the effects it'll do to my hair, I'm using 40 volume and I know full well of the damage it can cause.      So, just the answer please?      Thanks alot.

But my sis is lookin for a new one and whener I reserch new straighteners, always ppl that are hair stylists comment that u shouldnt buy conair, vidal sassoon , etc. Why is this so? Are they claiming that if u use expensive straighteners, u hair will not be damaged? Ofcousrse they cant be making this claim right?   Then why are hairstylists interested in makng us spend a ton of money?   (I have had my hair professionally straightened once and the results were only slightly better...)   and when will we as consumers stop falling into their pits?   They claim that it will damage ur hair and such. But I almost see no damage on my hair...ofcourse I use a heat protect serum and take care of my hair with mask, deep conditioning, etc.

I consider myself to be above average attraction and I have a pretty nice build, so I don't have issues with girls or the whole social scene.  My front teeth a slightly turned in though and I am developing a slight gap at the bottom.  Many friends say it's not that serious or they never really noticed, but who knows if they're just being polite.  Anyways, I'm pretty self conscious about it and would like to get it taken care of, but it's just not good timing considering the massive cost of orthodontic work.

I'm wondering what to wear...I was thinking about this black skirt I have (mini, but not REALLY tiny), a black tank top with sparkles in the shape of an eagle on it, and fishnet tights with my turquoise converses.       I'll be in the mosh pit, so I wanted something nice and cool, that won't get me too hot. I'm not afraid of the sparkles falling off my top, it's old, and I'm trying to get the sparkles off anyway.       Please, only answer if you are really giving me proper advice. No FOB haters!

20090202210539AAhMI3F	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	I am upset at my dad, because he did not allow me to get a pair of women's shorts at the department store.?	Ok the story was like this. I'm a 19 year old guy. I'm 100% straight in my sexual orientation ever since i reached sexual maturity, neither homosexual nor bisexual. I live in a capital city in one of the nations in South East Asia.      Yesterday, Sunday, at about 5pm, I, my dad, mum n sis went on a family outing to the department store. Coz my dad had this complimentary shopping vouchers at that store, given to him by American Express Credit Card company. So we went there for some shopping before we had dinner.      My dad allowed me to get an piece of clothing, i decided to buy a pair of shorts.... casual walkshorts. I went to Billabong section, n decided to try on this pair of men's walkshorts. I asked the retail staff if they had waist size 28 shorts, since i wear about a size 28 waist.       She told me size 30 is the smallest they have for these walkshorts, since size 30 is the smallest size they stock here.       So i tried on size 30 anyway, it was a bit loose. I went back to her n asked her if there is any other type of similar walkshorts, but in a smaller size. She showed me the young men's collection, but i didn't like their color/design.       I asked her if the women's range had something similar. So she showed me this pair of shorts...it looks really great. The material is a bit glossy since the fabric had some shimmery threads woven in it.       This is the pair -  http://i42.tinypic.com/2nlqlfn.jpg    back view -  http://i44.tinypic.com/34efblj.jpg       I tried on a size 8, n it fit me perfectly, on my slim waist. It was a bit of a tight fit on my rear, n crotch area, n slightly on my thighs. The shorts ended slightly above my knee, therefore it didn't look too revealing, such that others could immediately tell that i was wearing feminine clothing.      I looked into the mirror n admired it, n said to myself...hey i really like the look of it, especially the the slim cutting. As for the low rise of the shorts, i can deal with it, coz i normally wear low rise hipster women's jeans, which normally has a front rise of 7 inches. N I don;t find them uncomfortable at all. (By the way, i prefer to wear female jeans since it has a slimmer cutting n sexier than the men's baggy jeans.)      I decided to get that pair, n i asked the retail staff, a young lady, if it was ok for a guy to wear female shorts. Apart from the slighty glossy material n tight fit, it didn't look too feminine at all. She said "it's ok i guess, if u like it"      So i decided on that pair, n i met up with my parents n sis, since my dad is holding on to the vouchers, n those vouchers require his signature n presentation of his credit card in order for it to be usable at the cashier.       They had some stuffs with them which were unpaid...so my is dad gonna pay for all the items all at one shot with the stack of shopping vouchers. My mum looked at the shorts which i chose n asked if it was a mens or womens shorts?      Coz she somehow suspected i would select a feminine bottom since i often wear tight low waist female jeans. I lied to my parents n said it was a men's shorts, but my dad didn't buy my story, n he decided to approach the Billabong retail staff to clarify.      I n him went there, n when i saw the lady, i quickly told her "These shorts r unisex, right?" (hoping she would tell a white lie for me)      Then my dad demanded to know if these shorts r for male or female, n she kinda looked scared since he had a menacing look. She then said yes, it is actually for females, but nowadays guys also do wear such slim fit shorts as its the new trend.      My dad was pissed n he said 'no, i object to u getting this pair...please choose a men's shorts!'      I argued back n told him that the men's shorts smallest size was 30, they're kinda loose for me, n so i had no choice but to get the womens shorts.
