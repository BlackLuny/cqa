You're paying your guy big bucks to have this thing under control. I can hardly believe you are represented by counsel. &, in addition, you didn't mention being represented by a lawyer in your previous post. Now I think you're jerking our chains. I believe you're someone who has gotten in way over your head, did a FSBO, and now you're scrambling to clean up a mess you did on your own.

This is just one of the problems that real estate professionals deal with every day.|`|06GNExjDaa	I would contact the first buyer and let them know what is up and let her know your objective is to get this home sold. And inf her you need to get things rolling. You can request a pre-approval statement from the second one. The banks to give out signed paperwork w/an exp date on it when something is pre approved. If the first one gets you the contract drawn up on monday go with it. It is really your choice until you have a written contract.|`|ZcrDcvgBaa	First if you have an agent they should ask for a pre-qualification letter from the the buyers mortgage broker ( or you can ask for it yourself). secondly you as the owner of the property have the right to write a back up contract with another buyer. In selling real property it is always wise to request a non-refundable deposit, to be kept in escrow at your local title office (non-refundable meaning if there financing falls though due to know fault of there own they would then be given it back by the title office). I would not let anyone view your property to inspect it without a contract and deposit to be lodged at the title office......good luck
AA10007793	The President had the ability to influence economic policies.  And when he says something that may influence those policies, the market listens.|`|AA11639059	It is mostly a psychological thing. If there are specific matters that the president is announcing his decision on that are "actionable" in the market, then that is closer to a tangible benefit. Otherwise, if the leader produces a stirring string of words, then it becomes one of those things akin to comfort foods or a security blanket that affects the mindset. The market may perceive, through the aggregation of its constituents that a more contented and comfortable people will then do more, not less, of the things that build economic value. That is where any positive, or negative, presidential speeches tend to affect the stock market. <br>  <br>  Now if he had said, "we will put solar power panels on the roofs of every federal building before the end of the year", that would be a specific that would move a specific stock and related sectors. If he said they were going to be buying a whole new fleet of government vehicles, and all of them using a specific new fuel or propulsion system, then that too would affect certain areas of the market. If he said that the federal government was going to guarantee every single mortgage loan, then that would drive two entirely different actions, banks and finance companies might soar in value, while more reasoned and reasonable people will be shopping for residences abroad because the tax burden necessary to pay these, plus implications of things like wholesale modification of loan agreements mean an enormous change that will affect their wealth. As a result, there will be a temporary spike, followed by a drop more precipitous than lately.<br>  <br>  The market has to ferret out the real or imagined consequences of his words, which again is mostly a psychological exercise.|`|OOsht5eiaa	If the Presidential speeches really had the ability to affect the stock market then past Presidents would have been pumping the market in downturns for all they were worth.  I think the little boy had his thumb in the dike last night though the market may prove me wrong.<br>  As I've seen in the past, anything that is made public is already priced into the market by the time the announcement is made.  Nothing happens in a vacuum.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	It's more because banks won't be getting nationalized that the markets are starting to improve.  Obama's speech probably had only a minor influence.<br>  <br>  If banks were to be nationalized their shares would have become worthless which would have wiped value off the Dow Jones and S&P 500.  This is why some people were selling over the past few weeks.  If these indexes go back up it's because investors now have to factor back in the banks values in the indexes.

Pretty boring to be honest...|`|Q4VwhcbXaa	Accountants track the finances of people and companies.  To do this job you have to not just be very good with numbers but really love numbers and excel spreadsheets; you need to be very thorough, detail oriented, inquisitive and generally ba a "color within the lines" kind of person (accountants are typified as boring for a reason).<br>  <br>  Bookkeepers do the day to day financial entries for a company and an accountants look over this data and makes sure it was done right, so you must know all the rules for accounting for asset classes and business proceedures (was the proper method used for calculating depreciation?  Was the sale recorded properly, if you agree today to sell something in the future, is this a sale, how would you account for it i?)  Then you will compile the data to prepare financial statments, listing the assets, liabilities, etc.  <br>  <br>  You can also be a personal accountant but usually you need to be a CPA first and to be certified you usually need to work for a company.  If you work for a big accounting firm, it is a lot of hours but you can also work for a company directly or eventually for a small firm or for yourself.  As a personal accountant you will do taxes and also become advisors for people on finances.<br>  <br>  The bad news is it can be a lot of tedious number crunching and you need to understand and keep up with all the rules and regs and you need to get your CPA to really have a market value.  The pay will never be fabulous but the good news is the work will be steady as everyone needs accountants and you can specialize in tax accounting or in a field that might interest you such as medical or media companies.<br>  <br>  I started as an accounting major (many moons ago) and thought it was too boring, so I went into banking and now, being unemployed and seeing all the accounting and finance jobs listed, I regret not going into accounting.  But it is not for everybody.  You need a college degree for this and some accounting training is good for everybody, you can always start as an accounting major and take classes and if it is not for you then switch majors to business or some other field without losing a lot of credits.   <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WSJzj6lRaa	please see the below web site<br>  Regards <br>  Sargon Odisho<br>  Cross Accountancy Services<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.castax.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.castax.com.au</a>

If you're serious about starting a home-based business on the Internet  do with the right way. <br>  <br>  There are millions of sites on the Internet, there floating around making no money.10 to 15 million people a day submit there sites to the Internet,at the same time 10 million drop off the Internet. If someone tells you it's free and it's too good to be true. Most likely it's to good to be true. <br>  There are millions of people out there that get sucked into these quick money schemes. Because they're looking for a  shortcut and an easy way to make a dollar.  <br>  <br>  There is no easy way. If you're serious about starting a business on the Internet do with the right away take your time and stay away from the spammers and shortcuts. I know I wasted thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars. Because I believe what they said I was looking for the quick money. I was also one of those guys who had a web site. With one of those six dollar A month hosts. Before it was over I ended up selling my product on eBay and dropping my site off the Internet. what a waste. I learned the hard way. A little over a year ago I found the perfect host who taught me everything at first I was very skeptical. After all I've been burned a couple of times. But when I saw they had a thirty-day money back guarantee.  No questions asked. I had to try them and I'm glad I did. <br>  Now I spend less than a dollars a day for my web site. I've spent no money on advertising. I have over 100 competitors and I'm ranked right up on top with them. I'm making more money now than I was at the job I got laid off of. <br>  <br>  Hears the best part. My web site is only 50 %  finished. How much do you think I'll be making make when I finish It? There's only one way to start an Internet business and that's the right way it takes time and dedication.<br>  Remember you have choices.

Have a duplicate, and get a signature on your copy.<br>  If the landlord refuses to sign receipt of the notice, you will require a disinterested witness to be present to sign as witness that you have provided that notice.  The point of this is to assure the landlord that it would not serve interest to sue on the basis that no notice was given.<br>  <br>  The date you propose to vacate can be less than 30 days in the future, or more than 30 days in the future. The 30 days rule applies to how long you must pay the rent.

Pre-qualification is conditional; property under contract, appraisal, credit, etc.  After a house is under contract, the loan approval process begins and if the loan isn't granted the house will be placed back on the market.

So when you file your 2008 income tax return, hopefully you will have no tax liability due to this amount of income.  Also you could qualify for certain credits, such as earned income credit and child tax credit that will allow you to receive a refund much larger than the $99 withheld.  <br>  <br>  For 2009 you can change your W-4 with your employer to claim less exemptions to allow more federal income tax to be withheld, if you wish.

With the new stimulus program we might expect more will be able and willing, but you will have to read it carefully to see how you qualify.|`|DCixOqsnaa	Your best bet would be to call the lender and see if they can refer you to a loan specialist/loan officer. THey can quickly determine if you would qualify for another mortgage. If you are buying a new home, its likely that if you are applying now, your rate would be lower because rates are at an all time low.  There are many variables that go into the mortgage decision such as your credit score, income, mortgage pay history and value of the home you are buying.  keep in mind that most lenders now are stuck having to meet fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage guidelines and the process is not very pleasant to go through because of all the red tape.

yDP9xHNnaa	True, managers should be focused on the long term health of the company.  Focus on the sock price can push managers to make decisions that will improve the stock price now but two years from now the company is no long competitive.  Here is an example, given the choice of a large investment to improve the production process but force the company to take on debt in the short term may be shunned by managers focused on the stock price.  In reality the investment may make the company far more profitable and competitive over the long term.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes that is true. It was the biggest lesson learned from the crash of 2008..

If this is school loans your in trouble.

I'm sure there are other areas of the country where this is the case also<br>  Individual buyers may not may need or want to get their investment back on their house and be unwilling to let their house go for less than a set price.  <br>  Banks do loose money the longer a house sits but imagine if they have $100,000 tied up in loans on a house they are going to be willing to shell out some amount of cash before they write off even half of the initial loan amount.<br>  That being said there are some people that are unwilling to accept that there home is worth less than they think, but this is the case in any market.|`|E8RlvSbcaa	In Detroit houses are selling for under $1000, but who wants to live in Detroit?|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Some sellers will sell for less than market.

NcFWcO3Laa	The addedum that all REO banks require will have a closing date and penalties if you do not close by that date.  If you don't sign that addedum you will not get the house.<br>  <br>  The bank will try and hold you to the $150 per day penalty but if its the bank or the banks agent's fault then they will probably waive those charges.  Just make sure that your agent documented the banks screw-ups.  For instance if the escrow doesn't get you the escrow instructions to sign in the time stated in the contract, document that.  If you don't get the preliminary title report on time document that...etc.<br>  <br>  You getting your loan on time is your responsibility.  If it looks like its going to take longer that you thought ask for an extension well in advance.  Most times the lender will give you a week or two advance, one time.  Both you and your agent should be checking with your lender at least twice a week making sure that progress is being made on your file and that it just isn't sitting on someones desk because it's missing something and nobody has bothered to tell you or your agent.<br>  <br>  These are reasons that you need an experience RE agent and an experienced lender that has experience dealing with REO's.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	That depends.

It is better to discuss money after a job is offered not before.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	It depends on the store.  Many retailers start people out at more than minimum wage, including Target and Dillards.  If you think your store might pay more than min wage, put something higher on your application.  If not, I would still probably put $8.  They can always offer you less than that.

LpVwWJVsaa	An eviction will stay on your record for a very, very long time but so will a balance due with a landlord.  Take the lesser of two evils and talk to your landlord.  Explain the situation to your LL and tell him/her that you are willing to give up possession of the apartment if they will let you out of your lease.  Also, try and work out a repayment plan for the past due balance (if any) and also any expenses that you might incur from breaking your lease early.  The landlord doesn't have to agree on a settlement, however given these bad economic times, they might agree to it.<br>  <br>  I manage an apartment community and have had several people in this situation.  The residents were charged for breaking their lease early but avoided collections and a judgment on their record as long as they made the payments as agreed.|`|RZzMse3Haa	NO!

060Xd3Xwaa	<a href="http://cashcratereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://cashcratereview.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

But if you’re undecided on what to do or how to do it, there is one idea that’s a proven winner: starting an online affiliate marketing business.<br>  <br>  This is a business where a person (an “affiliate”) is able to earn extra income by listing other companies’ websites on his own. If a visitor comes to the affiliate’s website and follows a link to a merchant’s site, then makes a purchase there within a certain period of time, the affiliate earns a commission for doing the referral work.

Something is seriously wrong with the corporate system. Where is the money they made in all those years? Why did they need to operate on so much debt? I think it was so they could steal the profits.

y4SUDnpaaa	The interest rate on that cc was probably much less when you first took it out. Credit card companies have all kinds of new practices like there being no more grace period, not even one day, if your payment  does not reach them on or before the due date it gives the cc company the right to raise your interest rate. Also the cc companies  don't reward you if  you do make more then the minimum payment, if fact they prefer you pay the minimum that allows them to collect more interest. Yours is the highest rate I have ever heard of and with no usury laws your rate could keep escalating.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	It depends on which state you live in. Different states have different caps. That seems awfully high though!|`|QdtppqFPaa	The state you live in definately makes a difference on interest rates.  But, don't cancel the credit card after you pay it off.  For some reason, this will actually lower your credit score.  Just don't use the card once it is paid off.

There are several types of treasury securities, bills, notes, and bonds as well as TIPS and STRIPS (exp on wikipedia).  You can buy them through your broker or bank, they are low commission and easy to understand what you own that's the good side.<br>  <br>  On the bad side US treasury securities have a rather low yield right now, this is because interest rates are very low.  This investment is also very crowded trade meaning that many investors have fled most other investments and bought Treasuries, I worry when everyone is doing the same thing because if everyone is buying then price is typically high, look at housing or stocks just recently.  Returns are typically low but very safe in a normal environment, but this environment is not typical.  Your broker can help you with other questions they are paid to do that, you can even get help if you have a discount broker online just don't be afraid to ask.

It might just be the type of account you have.|`|70d867ec0ce9c05d098a7efb66f7d809aa	Yeah, u are right, Abbey is very slowing when it comes to transferring money.  Other banks as, Alliance & Leicester, the slowest bank in our investigation, told us that 'only if the request comes in after 8pm does it take five days'. However, we made all 17 online transfer requests with Alliance & Leicester before 3.30pm, and not one reached its destination before the fifth day.<br>  <br>  The Co-op told us that all its online transfers should arrive on the third day, unless they're set up as standing orders, in which case they would take an extra day to arrive. It couldn't explain why some transfers didn't reach the recipient until day five.<br>  <br>  Alliance & Leicester did admit that 'the vast majority of transfers made by phone or internet take four days'. So why is it slower than other banks? It told us it's because their system monitors transactions before forwarding details to BACS (the banks' clearing house) to make sure there's enough money in customers' accounts. In fact, these checks should happen automatically as part of the transfer process, and certainly shouldn't take a whole day.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	Its the same with any bank when you transfer online, when i lived with my parents i used to pay my board money that way with hsbc lol.

Criminal Identity Theft and Medical are problems, not as common but enough and they are devasting.  Imagine someone steal your records to get an operation or medications that one day if you were in the hospital your history is wrong and you could be treated wrong that could make you sick or worse.  Criminal Identity Theft the person commits more common crimes that puts a warrant out for your arrest, sometimes less monetary than financial identity theft such as a mortgage loan, but bad parking tickets and missed court appearances that are not yours or petty theft could put you in jail for a few days until you prove you are you, and it can affect background checks for jobs.  <br>  <br>  There is a id program at the state level where you go infront of a judge get fingerprinted and this is supposed to help identify you if you are wrongly arrested with a special code into this database.<br>  <br>  I agree with the other person, I stopped using checks (yep), or credit cards, as I worked in the identity theft and fraud prevention industry.  I question the security of where records are locked up.  I made an urgent care show me where they kept records, they had no lock up and no security when gone at night, so I refused to give my son's social and the manager finally agreed to use only mine (children's socials are stolen all the time with no one realizing it, run credit checks on them).  My real name is on nothing unless needed. I leave all personal info blank unless someone needs it for a verifiable reason. In most cases driver's license and social is used for collections if you don't pay. If you are paying a bill up front cash, etc. they don't need it.  I finance nothing.  Since looking for work, I again ensure that agencies have secured lock up for files, and they do not keep files open on desks during the day.  Socials are often stolen by public with quick eye-glancing access.  <br>  <br>  Composite people are made, it is not always your complete id that is used.  I saw an older woman's social, white being used by a younger male asian, and the work information was from a man in another state and the home addresses and billing addresses were from other sources as well. It is more difficult for legal agencies to catch up to composites.  So, beware.  If you get even just a mail order magazine to your address, rip off the back cover if it has your name connected to your address on it and shred it.  Shred everything.  Those guys searching apartment dumpsters and trash for cans, are more than likely not searching for cans!<br>  <br>  To date that largest source of identity and financial theft is from hard copy paperwork, not the internet, which is safer.  Mail theft.  Do you have a locking mail box that does not have outside street access?  If not, you are asking them to come get your information.  Did you ever have a missing electric bill or statement?  Check your credit report not only for wrong account information, but for inquiries.  If there is inquiries and many of them in a short period of time and you know you are not applying for any financing, then someone DOES have your social and running it.  Put a fraud alert with a code and phone number in with the credit bureaus, then they have to call you before approving.  Or a freeze if you are not doing any financial transactions, but you have to remember to take the freeze off.

uWA0D2zAaa	The reason they can't rent to you is because you are a full time student.  You said this property had an income requirement - that means it is on the LIHTC program (Low Income Housing Tax Credit).  This program was put in place by the IRS and the US government is the one that sets the rules.  This community was given money by the government to either improve or renovate the property and in exchange, the community has to set aside either a portion or 100% of it's units as an "affordable" community for a set number of years.<br>  <br>  To qualify for this program, you cannot be a full time student unless you are married filing a joint tax return.  The reasoning behind this is that this program is meant to help people live in areas they could not normally live in due to the median income of the area.  Students do not qualify because the government believes you are already recieving help in some way by being a student, whether it be by student loans, student discounts, etc.  So it's the government that will not let the community lease to you, not the community itself.<br>  <br>  The VA has nothing to do with this, nor does Fair Housing.

HCPuMIeSaa	<a href="http://www.pondiuni.org/DDE/HRM_1_Compensation%20Management-FINE.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pondiuni.org/DDE/HRM_1_Compen...</a><br>  <br>  or study:<br>  The increasing competitiveness of the labour market and turnover of employees had resulted in nightmare in compensation planning. Apart from this, the growing demands of the employees and competitive salaries offered by multinational companies had almost resulted in a compensation war in certain industries.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the human resources managers and tax experts have to evolve proper compensation planning for High end and  qualified employees. The components of compensation have to be devised in such a way that, it focuses on the growing demands of employees while retaining the competitiveness and  profitability of the company. <br>  <br>  Industry driven factors:-<br>  <br>  There are also certain driven factors that are influencing the compensation planning. The compensation Packages of knowledge workers are different from that of manufacturing sector. The employees working in call centers are compensated differently (vs) employees of technology driven companies.<br>  <br>  Some notable examples are.,<br>  <br>  a) Compensation paid in IT/ITES,<br>  b) Investment banking/Equity research,<br>  c) Software companies,<br>  d) High-end industries having high technology content like Bio/Nano technology.<br>  e) Private research and related fields.<br>  <br>  Compensation Oval:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Components of compensation:-<br>  <br>  Basic wages/Salaries:-<br>  <br>  These refers to the cash component of the wage structure based on which other elements of compensation may be structured. It is normally a fixed amount which is subject to changes based on annual increments or subject to periodical pay hikes. It is structured based on the position of an individual in the organization and differs from grades to grades.<br>  <br>  Dearness allowance:-<br>  <br>  The payment of dearness allowance facilitates employees and workers to face the price increase or inflation of  prices of goods and services consumed by him. The onslaught of price increase has a major bearing on the living conditions of the labour. The increasing prices reduce the compensation to nothing and the money's worth is  coming down based on the level of inflation.<br>  <br>  The payment of dearness allowance, which may be a fixed percentage on the basic wage, enables the employees to face the increasing prices.<br>  <br>  Bonus:-<br>  <br>  The bonus can be paid in different ways. It can be fixed percentage on the basic wage paid annually or in proportion to the profitability. The Government also prescribes a minimum statutory bonus for all employees and workers.<br>  <br>  There is also a bonus plan which compensates the Managers and employees based on the sales revenue or Profit margin achieved. Bonus plans can also be based on piece wages but depends upon the productivity of labour.<br>  <br>  Commissions:-<br>  <br>  Commission to Managers and employees may be based on the sales revenue or profits of the company. It is always a fixed percentage on the target achieved. For taxation purposes, commission is again a taxable component of compensation.<br>  <br>  The payment of commission as a component of commission is practised heavily on target based sales. Depending upon the targets achieved, companies may pay a commission on a monthly or periodical basis.<br>  <br>  Mixed plans:-<br>  <br>  Companies may also pay employees and others a combination of pay as well as commissions. This plan is called combination or mixed plan. Apart from the salaries paid, the employees may be eligible for a fixed percentage of  commission upon achievement of fixed target of sales or profits or Performance objectives.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, most of the corporate sector is following this practice. This is also termed as variable component of compensation.<br>  <br>  Piece rate wages:-<br>  <br>  Piece rate wages are prevalent in the manufacturing wages. The laborers are paid wages for each of the Quantity  produced by them. The gross earnings of the labour would be equivalent to number of goods produced by them.<br>  <br>  Piece rate wages improves productivity and is an absolute measurement of productivity to wage structure. The fairness of compensation is totally based on the productivity and not by other qualitative factors.<br>  <br>  The GANTT productivity planning and Taylor's plan of wages are examples of piece rate wages and the related consequences.<br>  <br>  Sign on Bonuses:-<br>  <br>  The latest trend in the compensation planning is the lump sum bonus for the incoming employee. A person who accepts the offer, is paid a lump sum as a bonus.<br>  <br>  Even though this practice is not prevelant in most of the industries, Equity research and investment banking companies are paying this to attract the scarce talent. <br>  <br>  Profit sharing payments:-<br>  <br>  Profit sharing is again a novel concept nowadays. This can be paid through payment of cash or through ESOPS. The structuring of wages may be done in such a way that, it attracts competitiveness and improved productivity.<br>  <br>  Profit sharing can also be in the form of deferred compensation at the time of retirement. At the time of retirement the employees

The problem you will almost certainly face is NOT even being able to get a mortage in the first place. <br>  <br>  Why? because of the banking crisis nobody is lending (that's because credit has literally dried up) and mortgages are basically a form of credit i.e. mortgages are loans and the banks & building societies havent got the cash flow themselves to lend out any more on house purchases. The banks themselves have exceeded their own overdraft facility and now they have no funds available to lend to anyone esle. This is why the government has had to step in & pump extra funds into the system i.e. into the UK economy.<br>  <br>  **NOT only havent the banks got the funds to lend the banks almost went bankrupt themselves and so its worth bearing this in mind. And of course the government cannot allow the banks to go bust as that would have taken down the entire ship with all life on board. i.e. the good ship UK,etc. We would have literally ended up like Iceland has with no money, we would have been 100% stuffed if that had happened.

They can photograph and document the scene.  They can take a recorded interview from you nailing down the facts in a permanent record.  The statute of limitations in these cases can be 2-5 years.  So she could conceivably come back against you far into the future.  If you wait to turn it in until months or years later, your insurance company may balk at coverage.  <br>  <br>  I wrote a detailed article on eHow titled:  How to Respond to a Slip and Fall Claim.  It gives good advice on how to handle these situations.  I hope it helps.  Good luck and don't worry your carrier is trained to deal with these situations.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Since you have no identity information on her, I see no point in contacting your insurer.

BoAEgaAGaa	If you are married you normally will file a joint income tax return and then you both will be claiming the children on the return.  You do have the option to file as married filing separately, but you lose most credits and deductions when filing this way.  When married filing separately either of you can claim the children, or they can be split between the two of you.  Under no circumstances are you both allowed to claim the children.  <br>  <br>  You can figure your taxes both ways, MFJ and MFS, to see which gives you the best bottom line tax.  Be sure and take the state return into consideration too.  <br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	Well, if you are married and live together, you should file "married filing jointly".

They showed that on average, couples in the Bay Area - and they excluded Napa, Sonoma and Silicon Valley - needed to bring in $130k per couple just to stay afloat of our highest tax rate, highest housing costs and highest food and fuel costs.

I would also report him to the better business beareau, and if needed the attorney general office. He was given multiple opportunites to fix your heater and did not perform services as expected.
AEZ75dJ7aa	I suggest you put together a resume and email it to construction companies in Vegas.  Go to the online phone book and get the names.  If they don't have a website call and ask for an email address to send them your resume.  I would also mention that you are locating to the area and when you would be arriving.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Organize neighbors' garages for $10 apiece.

What I would do is this, The next time she acts out at you, ask her what her problem is with you. And if she just walks away without answering, then she ain't worth the emotion of getting upset. It only means that she is upset with herself not you. Are you doing her job? If not, then don't worry about it and simple ignore her attitude problem. If so, then that is why she is acting out towards you. Probably because she already gave her notice and she is upset that the company isn't asking her to stay. Maybe her attitude is the whole problem in the first place. <br>  So, sweetheart, don't sweat the small stuff. She will get over it. So simplely, just confront her with attitude problem and she might back off.<br>  Good Luck!

tU5NJVL3aa	No sweat -- same age as I was when I moved in with my gf.  For the appartment you will usually need to have 1st and last months rent, plus a security deposit, plus a non-refundable cleaning deposit just to move in.  Furnished or unfurnished?  You at least need the basics -- fridge, stove/microwave, and something to sleep on.  Generally speaking, it's also a good idea to have AT LEAST 3 months living expenses saved up "just in case".  Add it up -- basics:  rent, utilities, food, transportation; others (phone/internet, and minimum miscellaneous other stuff).  Either of you medicated?  Add doctors visits and perscriptions in as well.

Still interested ???|`|lLm5uIuDaa	At minimum wages and also still in college, living in the city in SF is a bit over the top.  An $800 apartment in SF won't be much bigger than a studio.  It would be better to look in Oakland or Alameda where you have excellent access to BART and other public transportation and better options for jobs.  San Francisco isn't for the under-financed and while the uniqueness of the city is appealing, there are many bad areas.  If you want to get a good start, pick smart.  The city isn't really right for you at this time but it doesn't mean there aren't options within BART's range that would give you the option of playing in the city, but not paying the exorbitant prices for an apartment.  Widen your search and think responsibly.

They would probably require him to buy out your half or for it to be sold if he can't afford to buy you out.  In some states such as CA, it doesn't even matter if you are joint owners of an asset or not, they consider it 50/50 ownership for married couples. Ask your lawyer.|`|4bb15f9f15ea537a33f65db853d456e1aa	maybe you can sell your 50% to the other woman. hardly anyone wants to buy a share hold house nowadays when there are so many bargins out there. beautiful time to buy houses and you dont have to keep outbidding another buyer.|`|b39KmBzoaa	Hire an attorney.

It is the management's.  If you attempt to repair or replace something on your own and something goes wrong, you will be responsible.  Contact your manager, alert them to the problem and have maintenance take care of it.|`|RZzMse3Haa	The owners are typically responsible for general repairs unless you did something to damage it.<br>  <br>  Let them know what is going on and see what they say.|`|Bso2vRYjaa	You can do it, but ultimately, it is the owner's responsibility.

KnCcEfBpaa	A combination of greedy venture capitalists jacking up real estate values and the government's ill conceived solution of making a bank make a loan for these ridiculously high selling prices rather than just curb the price gouging. The market prices started to spike in the 80's when "investment properties" were in vogue... they never came back down.<br>  Now let's look at the home buyers. NAFTA was the single worst idea ever unleashed on the working population of the United States in it's history. The number of companies that exported jobs in all salary ranges is well into the hundreds of thousands. politicians always point to unemployment but they will never dare go near the term "under employment" which is where you have people who invested in MBAs and doctorates fighting over $10/hr jobs. Now the majority of people can not really afford a mortgage at the overpriced asking prices but banks had to make them a loan anyway. <br>  <br>  There you have it, a combination of unchecked greed and a customer base crippled financially by stupid public policies caused the housing market nosedive. And they only bailed out the rich... go figure.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	There is a show this month on CNBC called House of Cards that goes through the entire rise and fall.  You should check it out.  I found it really interesting<br>  - The reason in a nut = traditionally people have had to put 20% down which means people had to have money to buy a house.  In the early 2000s this was no longer a requirement, the loan rates were extermely low, and there was barely a credit check.  However, most of these loans were ARMS meaning the interest rate would increase overtime.  When that started happening the people couldn't afford the homes they got.  <br>  - the root of the problem is the bankers who allowed the change to minimal down payments and the subprime loans (minimal credit).|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Interest rates had dropped several years back, which drove home prices up because people could borrow more money cheaper and expected home prices to keep going up.  The government encouraged loans for low income people (anyone with a heartbeat) and speculators bought property on borrowed money for a quick gain.  Interest rates started climbing as homes became less affordable due to inflated prices and high interest rates, and whoosh.<br>  <br>  Everybody knew it would happen, just not when or how bad.  Unfortunately the people who pushed for and voted for change are getting a far different kind of change than they expected, because the people who caused it are still in office (congress).|`|wW9tGzJEaa	the reason prices kept going up was because there was a demand for housing. because of laws enacted by govt, obtaining credit was relatively easy. because obtaining a home loan was easy -- and to that effect, getting a home -- there was a demand for homes and therefore prices skyrocketed. <br>  <br>  but as interest rates started to go up, adjustable rate mortgages began to adjust at higher rates leading to increased monthly mortgage payments. companys started laying off people, they couldnt pay their mortgage and...POP...the buble burst.
