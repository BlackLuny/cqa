FYNqBIryaa	I know what you mean, I grew up in SCV...most salons here in Valencia you're looking at 90+ for a full weave. The good news is the salons usually give you a free cut with color service :/  My sis Amy works at Priscilla's and she does a great job (and I'm not just sayin that cuz she's my sis). The other gals there are pretty rockin too. Here is their site where you can check the prices and services offered http://www.priscillasalon.com/  I also loved Tranquility Salon. I used to go to Bonni but I don't think she is there anymore, but most of the women there do an awsome job.   And then when I was low on cash I would go to Natashas Salon? on Soledad in Canyon Country. The girl I went to was Letty and she was good for the price, never over 80 bucks. But that was about 2 years ago since I've been there so I'm not sure how it is now or how the other girls are that work there.   Hope this helped.

Even at 16, the hours are limited to  20 or less per week, and not later than 9 P.M. on school nights, or 10 P.M. on weekends.  I do wish you luck, and commend your eagerness to join the workforce, but for now, take advantage of being a kid while you can.  You will be grown too soon as it is.

0wTjvEW4aa	My answers are based on a late 30s, SAHM. I've been shopping Target for over 20 years.  :-) <br>  <br>  Aesthetics of the store:<br>  1. Wide aisles so that people generally don't have to wait or maneuver around each other with their carts. <br>  2. Bright lights. <br>  3. Stores are usually very clean by comparison to other similar stores.<br>  4. Laid out in a logical manner. <br>  <br>  Prices:<br>  1. Similar or lower in price than other stores. <br>  2. A few items are higher priced but because the aesthetics are better, I don't mind paying a slightly higher price for a clean, bright store. <br>  3. When looking  around for newborn items Target consistently had the lowest price for, to me, high quality and versatile items. <br>  <br>  Brands & Selection:<br>  1. Target offers a variety of brands that other stores (local to me) do not carry such as Method and Seventh Generation. <br>  2. Their generic brand of items seem to be equal to if not better than the national brands for a fraction of the cost. <br>  3. The micro book store inside Target always gets me. <br>  4. Their furnishings and decorator items seem to appeal to the "champagne tastes on a beer budget," mentality. <br>  5. Higher quality than what you'd expect. I've bought clothing for my family that has lasted longer than more expensive clothes at designer stores.<br>  <br>  Target.com<br>  1. If my local store is out of an item, such as a specific diaper pail when I was shopping for one, I can order from Target.com for the same in-store price and low shipping. <br>  2. Special online deals. I ended up getting a Wii bundled with the Wii Fit and some accessories for a good price. When I mentioned what I got, other people asked what time I camped out in front of the store. I never left my home, and the package was delivered to me. <br>  3. I can  see if an item  is at my local store before I go shopping, which saves me time. <br>  <br>  Community Support.<br>  Per Target's web site they give back to the community they are in.<br>  <br>  The only con for Target, for me, is no yarn or fabric. :-( Add that and Target would be my perfect store to shop.|`|Sb93dIXbaa	I'm scared to answer your question with so many restrictions, So I am just going to wish you the best on your purchases at Target.

Its impossible to prove to these Sceptical MORONS that you're not a scammer. Try to help people and you are destined to be reported by these people and lose your account on these types of questions because these idiots find it hard to believe people actually earn a living online from websites and videos and what not, so only the true scammers survive these conditions and most honest people would give up after losing their account a few times.<br>  <br>  Heres the facts:<br>  -The days of ebay are gone, with the economy and the way they have been managing the site and running off sellers, there are very few buyers there now so fat chance that will work out for the best. At Alexa.com you can see how much visitors a website gets. Ebay's visitors have decreased while Craigslist has increased, they are almost equal now and craigslist are free so if you must sell, theres other sites out there.<br>  -Surveys dont pay CRAP, youre an idiot if you take surveys. The smart people make their own survey sites and have the idiots take the surveys for them and break them off crumbs for doing it.<br>  -Work From Home jobs are lies. The people who make money online make it from ads or customers, none of them get paid by a company. I get paid by google, but thats because I refer people to them, not because I work for them. <br>  <br>  Check my profile <br>  OR<br>  Go to: www Keafy DOT com|`|mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They donâ€™t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.|`|V4rvHvI9aa	**** on your girlfriends sweet ***
