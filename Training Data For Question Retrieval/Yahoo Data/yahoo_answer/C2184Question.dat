20090220135423AAFrLzv	Games & Recreation;Toys	Need help with the name of this doll house and doll toy from the 1980's!!!?	I keep remembering this toy I got from my Mom Mom for Christmas sometime in the 1980's. It was a dollhouse in the shape of half an egg. The little doll, probably the size of the current Barbie Peek-a-boo dolls, sat on top of the doll house wearing a dress that covered the entire doll house. When you took the doll/dress off, underneath were 2-3 compartments that were the different rooms of the doll's house. It also came with little accessories like clothes, shoes, a phone, etc... I really loved that toy, but can't recall what it was called or what company made it. Does anyone know? Thanks.

But I've always been for the Sony Playstation 3 mainly because it has FREE Online play and Blu-Ray. But I came across an add for an used Xbox 360 Elite 120GB for $250, I know XBOX Live is good so that's what I would be looking forward to but I hate paying for it. What do you guys think?

Hi,      I'm thinking of buying Left 4 Dead, one of the Steam games, second hand from play.com, but what I was wondering whether Steam games could be uninstalled so that they could be sold on to another user - if not then it seems to be the case that they're ruining the whole second hand market.      Any help on whether second hand steam games work is of great help, I asked the guy I was thinking of buying it off and he gave the reply "To be honest, I'm not entirely sure. I've uninstalled it from my computer and from my Steam account but I'm not sure, sorry." if this helps.      Thanks.

20090220154503AA2PKay	Games & Recreation;Other - Games & Recreation	Really Important question?	Ok so the question should be "really important social question". Ok so here is the real question. I want to be an actor Like when I am like 14. And want to go on disney channel. But I don't find myself very.....ummm...like...my face isnt really what I would call "hot'.Even though all the girls like me at school like me. But I am very funny. there is something else, Sometimes I look in the mirror and call myself ugly but at other times when I put on some decent clothes and neaten my hair i look fine. Ok back to the question part, Demi Lovato I guess stared out like me ( She wasn't what I would call "hot" when she was younger) But look at her now! So my question is do you think I could become an actor and go onto a small show and into movies? And please don't say " Its your decision" I just want your opinion            and I know this question is kinda confusing

20090220153713AAQrYlB	Games & Recreation;Hobbies & Crafts	Recently finished knitting a bag - how to knit the handle?	Hey there.       I asked a question a while ago about "circular-needle" patterns for a bag, and was given good advice on just winging it and using a magic cast on, which worked perfectly! Anyhow, I've finished the bag. It's gray, with a purple-ribbed top. The bag itself does not stretch much vertically, but horizontally it stretches a lot more, which is what I was after.       Anyhow, I'm wondering what the least stretchy knitting stitch would be (ie. garter, stockinette, moss, seed or any others I could learn) because I'd rather that the handle didn't stretch a lot.       Thanks a lot!       By the way, I'm only fifteen, but I'm quite capable of learning any new stitches. Oh, and I'm not felting the bag or the handle. Any suggestions, even if they aren't knitting (ie. braiding) are very appreciated! Please don't suggest buying wooden/leather handles though, because I've already looked into those and none of the colours really match gray and purple.      Thanks again!!

20090220160922AAb1WFG	Games & Recreation;Board Games	Nine Men's Morris Question?	In this game, you make sets of 3 and remove an opponent's piece when you make such a set.  Now, suppose a player gets his pieces arranged in such a way so that each turn he simply moves the middle piece of one set of three into the middle of a new set of three, and the next turn, moves it back to the first set of three.  In this way, he can make a set of three on every turn, removing one of his opponent's pieces each turn until he wins.        Is this how the game is meant to be played?  Or is this unfair?  Is it really supposed to be that you can't remove an opponent's piece unless you make a new set of three that hasn't been made before?  Or is this a legitimate strategy, and therefore, the point of the game is to prevent your opponent from being able to create such a position?

20090220141051AAL0gM6	Games & Recreation;Gambling	Are there any good sports betting websites for the United States? Or are none of them trustworthy?	I have tried a couple different ones and none of them seem trustworthy... is there actually a person out there who can answer this honestly without any kind of obviously copy and paste answer....... PLEASE. I hear bodog is good but that it takes forever to get your withdrawal and that you need to fax all this stuff which i do not want to do. Betus apparently takes forever and i hear stories about it just deleting peoples accounts because they withdraw money which is incredibly illegal. they also charge a 50$ withdrawal fee. Sportsbook needs a utility bill and i dont have any bills with my name on them because im 19 and still live with my parents. is there one site actually out there that i can trust? if not, TELL me that and i wont waste my time. If there is, give me some info!! I need a site that you can deposit and withdraw both with a credit card, and thats just the top site.       DO NOT SEND ME A SITE WITH BETTING SITE REVIEWS ON IT!!!!      If you cant help me, dont answer the question or tell me the site does not exist.   Thankyou

20090220154625AAoD9v2	Games & Recreation;Hobbies & Crafts	BEADWEAVING---how to add more/new thread?	So far I've learned "brick" & "square" stitch.  With both projects my thread ended before the project's end, so what I did was add more thread by tying a knot. But that was problematic for both projects.....     1) had a hard time pulling the knot through the beads while weaving (toho beads)   2) the knot did not ultimately land inside a bead and thus invisible.  Instead the knot always was showing which is quite ugly      So I have the following questions for the more experienced bead weavers.......      1) How do you add new thread to a beadweaving project?   2) Is your method the same for all stitches or is it different according to stitch?   3) Does your method ensure that the piece will not come undone later on?      Thank you for anyone who responds.  I really appreciate it.....
