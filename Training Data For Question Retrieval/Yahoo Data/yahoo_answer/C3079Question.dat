20090307023800AAd5zkB	Local Businesses;Canada;Vancouver	As time goes on, there will be no more safe cities?	My town has been known for its vast percentage of Mennonites and the churches on almost every corner. But as I get older, I see that despite all the bible-thumpers, gangs are growing in numbers. People are getting shot in their cars and in their homes during drive-by shootings. Most of the time, these shootings are in broad daylight. So Im just wondering as time goes on, and each small town changes into a booming city, will there be anywhere relatively safe to live...

20090227131453AAGxuY1	Local Businesses;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	We're going to Kenya in the school holiday of 2010... HELP NEEDED!?	Hi there      Me and my school are going to Kenya in the summer holidays of 2010 with Camps International, where we will be embarking on community projects such as building schools and waterwells etc... aswell as doing wildlife conservation and marine conservation. For this reason we need A LOT of money to get us there, and the funds needed include flights, all food and drink, transport etc..   For this reason we are going to be doing extensive fundraising for the next year or so.      Does anyone have any ideas as to what we could do to fundraise lots of money, aside from the obvious bag-packing, carboots, bake sales etc..?      And does anyone know any grant organisations or websites which could help us with funds?      If indeed you would like to donate not matter how big or small please contact me, as we will be setting up a website which will have the names of any people/business's which donate to us, and we will also be happy to wear a t-shirt or similar in Kenya for you, so you can get a picture for your company etc..      Many thanks for all you help and I'd love to hear back from you.
