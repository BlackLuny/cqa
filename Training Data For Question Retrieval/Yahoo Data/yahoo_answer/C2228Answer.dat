It's a really addicting game that's fun to play when you're bored. It can be boring though if you don't have any furniture in your room. You have to buy the furniture with habbo coins, which unfortunately you have to pay for with real life money. It's also boring when you don't have any friend's on, but it's not very hard to make friends with people. Just follow the rules and be yourself and you'll be fine if you join. After a few years habbo might get boring to you, but for a while you have a really great game to play.

You will need to register your console's Serial Number, then proceed to file a request for system repair. You will need to fill out an application form with what kind of error(s) you receive, and your Billing Information for shipping purposes. If approved, they will send you an empty box and a return sticker for you to place your system in.

j6MvCr6Naa	1. Fallout 3<br>  Out of all those games you want the best game is definitely Fallout 3 and probably the only game that really deserves your money. It's got a an amazing free roaming world for you to explore full of quests and stuff to discover and do. It could easily take you more than 100 hours to do everything there is to do in that game.<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from different reviews for Fallout 3:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/fallout3?q=fallout%203" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 93%, this is certainly the best choice.<br>  <br>  Also these 3 games below are also not bad, but if you can only get one game make sure it's Fallout 3. Have Fun.<br>  <br>  Mirror's Egde has an average score of 79% so it's above average.<br>  <br>  Saints Row 2 has an average score of 81%, so it's pretty good.<br>  <br>  Halo Wars has an average score of 82% so it's a good game.|`|4LtszRxEaa	Saints Row 2 is awesome so much customization, vehicles, weapons, stroyline. Everything is awesome i Hghly suggest it|`|lkxFy681aa	Games you shouldnt get:<br>  Sonic unleashed (boring, repetative and you can beat it in a few hours)<br>  <br>  Mirrors Edge (crappy storyline, bad lighting, and because the idiots made it first person, judging a jump is hard. Also finishable in a few hours)<br>  <br>  Disney's bolt (same problem with sonic, it's too damn easy)<br>  <br>  Gaves you should consider:<br>  Saints row 2: (pathetic physics, and the main story is really easy, but there's online play, and loads of other stuff to do)<br>  <br>  Fallout 3: Can get boring if you don't like RPG's. Not bad a game.<br>   <br>  Battlefield: BC: Campaign is fairly repetative, but online playlasts for ages, it doesn't seem to get boring.<br>  <br>  I don't like singing games, so I can't say anything about them.<br>  I've not played the other games.|`|mh0mO2jZaa	dude half of those games suck no offense i mean really sonic unleashed bolt dude get call of duty world at war or get call of duty modern warfare and if you don't want those get halo wars or fallout 3|`|xyOcnQjpaa	Looking at your list and the games you own I would recommend Afro Samurai and Fallout 3.|`|Phbadn6laa	halo wars or sonic unleashed both games are good|`|m2eHPeciaa	For Sure: <br>  <br>  -Halo Wars<br>  -Fallout 3<br>  <br>  i dont like ne of the others tho. look into Gears Of War (if u like shoooter game)|`|gvguk8deaa	If you want one that's not too easy to beat I'd go with Fallout 3. That game is so long and will take plenty of hours.

SApZ3x5waa	No, unfortunately you have to obey the card. It has to be in your library.
HzSfDevkaa	okay well some good green white creatures are:<br>  <br>  Elven Riders (although this isnt flying, it can only be blocked by walls, and flying creatures so its virtually the same xD)<br>  <br>  Cloudchaser Kestrel (when it comes into play, u can destroy target enchantment, and it also has the ability: W:Target permanent becoems white until end of turn, if thats any help xD)<br>  <br>  Jungle Weaver (although not flying, it has reach, [it can block as though it had flying], which can make it a good blocker against other flying decks, as it is 5/6)<br>  <br>  Court Archers (also have reach, but they also have exalted, which gives a +1/+1 bonus to any creature u control that attacks alone)<br>  <br>  Thunder Totem (a artifact, taht transforms into a 2/2 white flying spirit with first strike until end of turn for 1WW, or if u tap it, fives u W to ur mana pool)<br>  <br>  Teneb, the Harvester (this is a white an green, as well as black dragon, that is 6/6 and flying... if u evr decide to go tri coloured netime soon, than u shud find a use for this card... Whenevr it deals combat damage to a player, u can pay 2BL, an then u can put a creautre from ANY graveyard into play under ur control :D)<br>  <br>  Divinity of Pride (this card can be paid with 5 of either swamps or plains, or a mixture of both, so u can play this black/white card with only plains if u want... its a 4/4 sprit avatar with flying and lifelink (damage dealt to other players give u that much health) it also has an ability that gives it +4/+4 making it an +8/+8 if u have 25 or more health)<br>  <br>  Qasali Ambusher (has reach, is a 2/3 cat warrior, and if its in ur hand, and some1 is attacking u while u have both a plains an forest in play, u can play it as if it had flash)<br>  <br>  Lush Growth (an enchantment where the enchanted land is a mountain, forest and plains as well as its original mana type)<br>  <br>  Mourning Thrull (1/1 flying thrull, can be paid with either 1 plains or 1 swamp, also has lifelink)<br>   <br>  Duskrider Peregrine (3/3 flying bird, with protection from black)<br>  <br>  Razorfoot Griffin (Flying, First Strike)<br>  <br>  Cockatrice (2/4 flyer, with the ability, Whenever Cockatrice blocks or becomes blocked by a non-Wall creature, destroy that creature at end of combat.)<br>  <br>  Angel of Mercy (3/3 flying angel and gives u 3 life when it comes into play)<br>  <br>  Akroma, Angel of Wrath (awesome card.... but pretty rare :D... for 5WWW, u get a 6/6 angel with flying, first strike, vigilance, trample, haste, protection from black, and protection from red... awesome card that has saved my *** many a time :D)<br>  <br>  Archon of Justice (3WW, 4/4, flying, when Archon of Justice is put into the graveyard from play, remove target permanent from the game :D)<br>  <br>  Opal Guardian (when an opponent plays a creature spell, if Opal guardian is still an enchantment, it becomes a 3/4 flying gargoyle an prot. from red)<br>  <br>  Flameblast Dragon (not green or white, but if u evr make a red deck, GET THIS CARD :D....5/5, flying, and the ability to pay XR when it attacks... the card then deals X damage to target creature OR player BEFORE it deals its normal combat damage.)<br>  <br>  alright well those are some good cards with flying, or that wud benefit a flying deck... Secondly, about the kind of strategy works well. Well ur strat. isnt bad, and it can work with the right cards, but i myself use more of a high damage/back from the grave deck (black,red and green). So if ur looking for massing huge amounts of creatures, then green is the colout for u ^^ (i suggest getting an artifact card taht enables u to pump out a 1/1 creature token of any colour u want per turn called Sarpadian Empires Vol. 7) Green cards are also good for their huge beasts and the spells that pump up ur card till end of turn, like explosive growth, and monstrify... and finally, about u waiting until the next edition of cards. well i honestly cant answer taht, as its more up to u... i think its more of a thing to be made up by urself, not others lol... i personally wud keep getting cards until the next edition comes out, as ive got cards from alot of difrent editions. but thats me... hope i helped, gl :P
AA10726404	It usually clearly written on the machine.  Of course, that's not the whole answer.  A 1c machine does not necessarily cost 1c per spin.  Usually there are options for covering more than one win line at a cost of one credit per line.  Then there is often an option to bet multiple credits per win line.  So it is not uncommon for a 1c machine to cost over a dollar a spin if you play maximum credits.<br>  <br>  If you are beginner you might want to consider a nice simple 25c machine with two or three win lines.  This makes is 50c or 75c per spin, and it easy to figure out.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that you always want to play maximum credits because there is usually a special bonus if you do and win the jackpot.  Often the big progressive jackpots are not available unless you are playing maximum credits.  It would be a shame to hit it, and then only qualify for a much smaller prize.

227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	He is 21 in the game born August 19, 1976 and appeared as a 21 year old in FF7 in 1997.<br>  16 (Crisis Core, Before Crisis) <br>  21 (Final Fantasy VII) <br>  23 (Advent Children) <br>  24 (Dirge of Cerberus)<br>  He was also in Kingdom Hearts forgot the year.<br>  Based on that he would be a ripe age of 33 come August 19, 2009. Hmmmm interesting because it means I'm getting old. LOL<br>  In FF7 it says Cloud was born in the sleepy mountain village of Nibelheim and he was 21, thus meaning he was born 21 years before the game was released. I agree he could be in the future, past, different universe. I'm relating it to our time and age. It's a fantasy game so he could age 7 years to our 1 so in that game IDK. I'm relating it to our time which is the most logical answer for those who can think logically.<br>  The Japanese guy that did his voice, forgot his name, is the same age.<br>  <br>  In Before Crisis - 15 becomes 16 most of the game (it takes place during the 6 years prior to FF7) 21FF7 - 6 years = 15 years old<br>  Crisis Core -  there was flasbacks to an earler age may have been 10 but he was 14 at the beginning, 15- 16 most of the game of the game, and 19 when Zack dies|`|uctxzjIIaa	He doesn't have a "birth year" becuase no FF7 game ever references a calendar, and they don't take place in our universe.<br>  <br>  He was 21 when the original game occurs, but the chronological gap between the earliest portion of Crisis Core (the first game he appears in) and Dirge of Cerberus (the last game he appears in) is 10 years.|`|aRx2so9Jaa	There is no year, he is infact 21 years old<br>  Born on August 19th<br>  <br>  hope this helped, i was confused aswell =]

uu6JYenAaa	First, pick up a "Play Card" at the casino.  It suggests whether you should draw, hold or fold, depending on what your hand is compared to the dealwer.<br>  <br>  The one thing you must keep in mind is that you are only trying to beat the dealer.  So, depending on what he shows depends on what you should do to increase your odds.<br>  <br>  Most Casinos have switched from 6 deck games to 8 deck games, in order to deter "card counters" even more.  I have been quite lucky with the 8 deck game.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember is to be consistent.  I usually will not draw a card if I have 16 or more, but again, it depends on what the dealer is showing.  You should always "assume" that his hidden card is a Ten.  If he has a "Ten" card showing, I must assume that he has a ten card down and has 20.<br>  <br>  If the dealer has an A or a 2 showing, be wary.  Can be dangerous.  But if he is showing a 3, 4, 5, or 6, he may be holding a "Bust" card.  The most popular "Bust" card is the 6, so I will double down or  split cards if the dealer has a 6 up.  But never split a winning hand, such as two tens, just because the dealer has a 6 up.<br>  <br>  I have a habit of counting only the Aces that have been thrown.  8 deck game, with 4 Aces per deck comes to 32 Aces.  A small form of counting but it's worked for me.<br>  <br>  Always split 8's and A's.<br>  <br>  Now find a free site on your computer, practice and good luck, you'll need it.  The odds favor the house and it's a lucky night when a player wins.|`|y822j5h5aa	Use a system called Binomial Blackjack. <br>  <br>  It is an all encompassing approach to the game that uses a holistic concept to maximize your ability to win money in the game in every aspect, from before you even enter the casino to when how and where you cash out. <br>  <br>  Makes for interesting reading, and contains many tips to help you out.

eD7qRBKHaa	Magic Kingdom for sure.  You might even want to spend both days here, especially if you have younger children with you.  The top rides are Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, Haunted Mansion, and watching the amazing fireworks, Wishes.<br>  <br>  I would pick Hollywood Studios if it were up to me - see Tower of Terror, Rock N Roller Coaster, Muppets 3D, Toy Story Midway Mania, Great Movie Ride, Star Tours, and several of the shows.<br>  <br>  You might want to get a guidebook and/or check out <a href="http://www.allearsnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allearsnet.com</a> to see all the attractions at each park to help you pick where you want to go!|`|d66b14246f6c82b37aff79920386767aaa	<a href="http://www.disneyworldvacations.info/WALT_DISNEY_WO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.disneyworldvacations.info/WAL...</a><br>  <br>  This explains a little about the parks.  Hope you have a great time.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	Depends on whether you like thrill rides and whether you have kids with you.  I would do Hollywood Studios for the thrill rides and Magic Kingdom.  However, the Expedition Everest coaster in Animal Kingdom is pretty awesome...but I wouldn't want to go to that park just for that since you don't have park hopper.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	Definatley visit Magic Kingdom because this whole entire park's theme is just about everything. There's different sections of the park that have their own theme which relate to most of the Disney movies. Every day the park has about two or three parades that float around the park from Frontierland to Main Street U.S.A. The main icon that represents Magic Kingdom is Cinderella's Castle.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Main Strret U.S.A:<br>  This is the the theme of just shopping and Disney. Here is where the entrance of the park is and there are tons of shops and food stands in this area, but no rides or attractions. Most characters are found in Main Street U.S.A.<br>  <br>  -Adventureland:<br>  This theme is all about jungles, animals, and adventure. There are really popular rides here such as The Magic Carpets of Aladdin and Pirates of the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  -Frontierland:<br>  This section of the park is themed western and outdoors. Here is the place where two of the park's most noticable and most popular rides are: Splash Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. These two rides are extremely recomended to go on when in the Magic Kingdom.<br>  <br>  -Liberty Square:<br>  This is the place of history and early presidents of our country. Liberty Square Riverboat is an attarction to see and also the Haunted Mansion ride.<br>  <br>  -Fantasyland:<br>  This part of the park is all about magic, fantasy, and many disney movies and characters. There are a lot of small rides and attrations here that are based on Disney characters. This section of the park is located directly behind Cinderella Castle.<br>  <br>  -Mickey's Toontown Fair:<br>  Here is the area to find Mickey and all of his friends and to enjoy small rides for small children. A really popular ride to be on here is The Barnstormer at Goofy's Wiseacre, a small crazy kiddie roller coaster.<br>  <br>  -Tomorrowland:<br>  Tomorrowland is all about the future and technology. There are really popular rides here that a lot of people enjoy: Tomorrowland Indy Speedway and Space Mountain.<br>  <br>  <Note>: This park is way too much to handle in just one day. You can do everything here in two days and won't be so tired throughout the trip.<br>  <br>  Here's more information on Magic Kingdom:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingd...</a><br>  <br>  Here's the official website:<br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/magic-kingdom/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/m...</a>|`|vZaLptZWaa	Magic Kingdom, and Epcot.AK and HS are small and I think you would feel you wasted an entire day there. I made it through AK in about 2 hrs! Epcot is gigantic with lots of things to do.Have fun!|`|KImktMtXaa	depends, if you have young kids then animal/magic kingdom, are thouse together?????? IDk and also Epcot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... MGM is not good for little kids, but fun for adults and teens|`|iUIGOvElaa	If you have not visited previously, then I would definitely say Magic Kingdom and Epcot.<br>  <br>  The Magic Kingdom is the flagship of Disney World and it has the best parades and an excellent nighttime fireworks display.  It would be considered a must see if you have never visited Disney World.<br>  <br>  For the other day I would recommend Epcot.  Like the Magic Kingdom, you can easily spend two days just at Epcot in order to see everything.  Epcot has a nice combination of rides and live entertainment that can appeal to a wide variety of age groups.<br>  <br>  Since you are visiting in April, remember that the parks will be crowded and you should plan to be there at park opening each day in order to minimize the wait times for the most popular attractions.<br>  <br>  Also remember that a large part of the appeal of the Disney World parks are the shows, parades, and various live entertainment.  Make sure you take the time to check these out during your visit.<br>  <br>  Take the time to visit some Disney World based websites, like mine, to help in your pre-trip planning.<br>  <br>  Helpful sites are:<br>  www.OnlyWDWorld.com<br>  www.AllEars.net<br>  www.WDWInfo.com<br>  <br>  also don't forget the official Disney World site: www.DisneyWorld.com<br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|S2BpLHCVaa	The Magic Kingdom is a must, but anything more depends on your situation. Are these two full days? Are there young children involved? How big is your group? If there are no young children, you are spending two full days, and your group is a reasonable size, I would recommend going to Epcot on whatever the shorter day is. It is the most adult oriented park, and most adults find it the most fun. Otherwise, I would just spend both days at the Magic Kingdom.|`|E0BtZIhzaa	Magic Kingdom has all of the Cinderella type stuff. Bunches of rides, personally its my favorite. Epcot is more of the electronic spage age theme. Also fun. Animal Kingdom is wildlife, and Hollywood Studios is kind of all of it together, personally I would suggest Magic Kingdom definatly and Animal Kingdom. Those two are the best to me.|`|YFH51aghaa	If you have younger children, your best bet would actually be to spend 2 days in the Magic Kingdom.  Otherwise, I would do a day at the Magic Kingdom (there is no way you could skip that- its what you think of when you think Disney!) and EPCOT.  EPCOT has a huge variety of things to do.|`|uihC5j6Laa	If you like animals and dark, mysterious nooks and crannies, then definitely Animal Kingdom. Did I mention it has lots of SHADE? Of course, you can't miss Magic Kingdom. Check out more DW tips at my blog.

6GIrW5eWaa	any of the Tool Songs should get you over that as well as trapped under ice. Also try stranglehold and pull me under. that should give you at least 6 songs that should score over 100,000 on med. Rock On!
6GIrW5eWaa	If this helps in making your decision. I like Rock Band better manly because it has more down loadable content over 500 songs currently. What makes my advice difficult is this although I live RB better the Guitar for RB is not compatible with any of the other GH games except GHWT. So if you have other GH games 2, 3 Aerosmith then you have to use the GH guitar. If you have the GHWT guitar it is completely compatible with all the RB games. In all I prefer the Rock Band platform and already had GH guitars so it did not make a difference to me personally but might be a consideration for others. Good luck|`|YCDS4Am8aa	i have both i prefer playing guitar hero world tour  you can make your own music and download other peoples music but i feel rock band 2 has better variety of songs and its more difficult even on easy<br>  <br>  i recommend guitar hero the most! you can always buy the rock band 2 cd seperately because the guitar hero set is compatible with the rock band disc although they have many similar songs|`|rmobOzLxaa	i tried both and rock band is pretty awsome but quitar heroe world tour is better, u get to make your own songs and cooler graphics so i would recemend quitar heroe wrld tour
2Q2ltt1Saa	First, they'd have to take all 6.  Some of those are older games that have newer sequels/editions out, and the originals won't sell as often, meaning they may not take them all (the original Motorstorm was bundled with the PS3 for a while, and now there's a sequel, so they probably have way too many copies)... and that means no discount for the whole collection.<br>  <br>  Call your local store and ask them; they'll be able to say how much for each and whether they've got too much supply already.|`|433014ca11e50dcab591055134a420adaa	Im not sure how much you'll actually get since the cash/credit changes on a weekly basis at Gamestop. However, I do know you'll get sort of a good amount from Resistance 2 since its a good game and isnt that old. Also, you wont get alot if not anything back from motorstorm since it does come with some PS3's and states that it isnt for resale.

dLsx3fKuaa	I would like to see a few more guns added... and I think that after you prestige you should have the option to use two gun accessories at once (I.E. Being able to use red dot and a suppressor at the same time)<br>  <br>  Me and my friends also think that when you spawn with Juggernaut that you should be able to get it shot off... like you spawn with extra health, and then you can survive an extra shotgun blast or two, and when your health goes back up you'll just have regular health..<br>   I think that this would make the game so much more fair.<br>  <br>  I also would like to see bigger maps that hold more people.. at least so you could have an 8 vs. 8 person game. and yes, I did think out the scoring. You would only get +5 per kill. and it would only be an 8 vs. 8 death match.<br>  <br>  As for vehicles.. I personally don't like tanks in call of duty 5.. so I'm hoping they won't add them in, or i hope they at least change the physics of the tanks and make them more easily destroyable (like after 2 rpg shots directly on the tank)..<br>  <br>  I also think they should have more destruct-able environments.. I might be the only one suggesting this, but I thought that it was lame that you couldn't shoot a vase of flowers off of a table or much less shoot out a street light.<br>  <br>  One last thing, I would like to see some kind of a theater / replay mode where you could take screen shots or record moments in your gameplay that you wish to share with your friends.. and no, It's not satisfying enough to scream into your mic with your friends "OH MY GOD I JUST GOT TWO KILLS IN ONE SNIPE LOLOLOL!11!"|`|VrBZovBMaa	Knives.

It's very possible a thick coat of lacquer paint could affect the tone or sustain of the guitar.

eJ97Qdooaa	The DSi will be $169 retail, but if you're going to get it, get it quick!  Retailers are taking pre-orders so those are the people that will get them first.  Everyone that waits will be SOL because the demand will probably be as high as the Wii.<br>  <br>  It's worth it.  If you can get someone to take your existing DS off your hands, then do it.  <br>  <br>  Here's some videos of what the DSi is capable of:<br>  <a href="http://www.wiilovemario.com/Nintendo-DSi-now-available-in-the-US" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiilovemario.com/Nintendo-DSi...</a>|`|lylTrAbEaa	$169.00 and it can be preordered now.|`|S96qrpGDaa	The DSi is $180 and it comes out on April 5. It has Internet and a built in camera. It has better sound, and more pictures on PictoChat. It doesn't have a GameBoy Advance slot though. Sounds awesome, but then if you have GBA games, and are planning to sell your DS if you buy it, you might want to either keep your DS or buy a GBA. Otherwise, the thing sounds cool. Hope this helped!|`|vfc18ZM5aa	The dsi is going to be 169.99 so about 180 dollars with tax...here are some things you might want to know...pictochat now has a rainbow drawing that you can work with...there are two cameras one on the inside and one on the outside one is .3 megabytes and the other is 1.3 megabytes! It can still play nintendo games but no longer anything that is GBA or that uses the GBA slot like guitar hero. There is a DSi store that you can buy and download games from with points, if you buy the Nintendo DSi before March of 2010 you get 1,000 free points. I hope this helps!!!|`|WL4CWO8Eaa	Approximately $180, I think it is only worth it if you are not a huge GBA fan.

AA12165015	check your game demo,see below.<br>  Yahoo games and rooms open with a pop up.  Turning  off the pop up blockers like Yahoo  says doesn't work very well!  Most tool bars like yahoo and Internet explorer have pop up blockers! When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker on yahoo tool bar. On the drop down list click on Always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light Yahoo.com then click allow. On Google  blocker click on blocker and  it will allow site.<br>  . IE browser settings to allow pop ups Right click on Tools, Internet options, privacy tab, cookie over ride. Type in www. Yahoo.com, allow then OK.  If your tool bar has a blue gear with tools beside it, Click on it and a drop down list will have pop up blocker listed.Type in www.yahoo.com, click allow.  It is rare but sometimes the demo can go bad. To check, click Tools, Internet Options, Click Browser settings ,Then view objects. If any are bad it will say corrupted instead of installed. If bad delete it  and load the new demo next time you play.<br>   This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker. I have never had a problem or had to hold  any keys down to get in.  1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box. Once in room make sure you expand it to see chat area. You only see top half of the cards but you can still play. This also gets rid of the big ads at the top of the rooms.

ZiMkydtHaa	It's got bigger screens. It comes equipped with a small camera to take pictures. It can play music files. It can store all that content on an SD memory card. But most importantly, it's fully equipped for the digital distribution revolution. Just as Nintendo sells Wii games through its own direct-download store, so too will it begin selling Nintendo DS titles directly to consumers.<br>  <br>  Some downloadable DSi software will be free, and some will be priced from $2 to $10, Nintendo said. The company is pursuing a gung-ho strategy to get DSi purchasers online with their handhelds and buying games -- it said it would give a free 1000 Nintendo Points (about $10 in online currency) to each DSi owner through the spring of 2010.<br>  <br>  One of the first free applications that users can download from the DSi Shop is a web browser.<br>  <br>   What the DSi is not is a brand-new gaming platform. It's a Nintendo DS with significant feature upgrades. While Nintendo has said that it will release software that is only playable on the DSi, it mostly just plays the same games as the current DS Lite.<br>  <br>  So if you're not into the upgrades, you don't need to buy one.<br>  <br>  There are actually two cameras on the device, one that faces outward (shown right) and one that faces inward, like a MacBook's camera. Nintendo says that the images the cameras snap are 300,000 pixels large, which works out to 640X480 resolution.<br>  <br>  DSi can also play back audio, and you can alter the pitch and playback speed of the sound files you're playing.<br>  <br>  An SD card slot sits on the right side of the machine, storing all the camera photos, music files, and games that you've added on to the system.<br>  <br>  The DSi brings Nintendo's product offering closer to what rival Sony has with its PSP portable system, which has an optional camera attachment, robust media playback functionality, and can download games to Memory Stick media.<br>  <br>  What it lacks is a Game Boy Advance game slot. So if you still want to play your old Pokemon games, you'll want to stick with the current DS Lite.|`|etdAmDPTaa	The DSi is coming out on April 3rd this year (so annoying that japan gets everything before we do they got it 1st November last year) it is a lot better than the previous DS models it has improved speakers which has a lot better sound quality, it has 2 cameras one on the outside of the shell which is 3MP and one on the inside which is VGA (you may think that VGA is bad quality but it looks ok on the DS screen) it has a memory card slot for you to store music photos and pictures, a new designed menu which looks similar to the Wiis, DS Store where you can buy or get free games and applications which can be stored on the memory card (the first application released in japan was a DS Web Browser which is free and can surf the web). The cameras are a lot of fun they take quite high quality pictures, they also can do special effects, some of these include been able to strech  and morph peoples faces with the stylus, the camera also has face tracking tecnology which can automaticly detect where you eyes nose mouth ears .etc are you can also add mustaches and lips in real time (they follow your face as you move it on the screen). The audio player is also quite fun you can speed up and slow down and alter the pitch of the song. The one disadvantage of the DSi that i can think of is that they have removed the GBA cartridge slot which means you cant play your old GBA games or play any DS games which require an extension used in the GBA slot (e.g. Guitar Hero) oh i have just remembered another 2 things the screen has been made slightly bigger than the DS lite and Original DS and has one more brightness setting than the DS lite and the DS is quite a bit slimmer than the DS lite.

This is because there is a BALANCE TO RANDOMNESS when multiple numbers are being picked from a pool of numbers.  If all you are trying to pick is one number out of 53 than yes, each individual one number has an equal chance of being chosen.  This all changes when you are trying to pick multiple random numbers out of the same pool of numbers. Out of, say, a pool of 53 numbers, you will see numbers somewhat spread out from 1 to 53 within the range of the numbers of the particular Lotto you are playing.  The major Lotto games have you choose five numbers with a separate mega number.   This being so, your 5 numbers should add up to around 150 to 165.  Add up the last 100 lotto results and see what the average totals are.  Pick your numbers to add up within that range.  As your mega number use the number that is the most frequent one picked from the stats given on the lotto website.  Or just use any mega number as this is the case where any one number is just as likely to be drawn as any other number.  Good luck.|`|AA11478846	Above answer is ridiculous.  Past drawing results have no effect on future drawings.  And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, have the same chance of coming up as any other combination.  Random balance?  C'mon?

A good one can produce a garment from a verbal description but a drawing always helps.  Hand tailored duds don't come cheap.  In this case you get what you pay for.  A good tailored suit will run $1000 + a dress probably more.  Multiple fittings are required.  If you're looking for a halloween suit  a craft store could probably help.

Guitar Hero?), or try something in the same line (Mass Effect)
3Hayya04aa	Start with a 55 degree incline raising to 250ft. have the car coast around on an even ground for a 180 degree turn into a 150ft drop to gain momentum. Use that momentum to pull through the first loop and send you up the next hill thats about 200ft then bursting into another insane drop followed by a smaller hill and pulley system to bring the passengers up the final hill at 350ft to a 300ft drop with shallow water covering the tracks for a splash. Call it WipeOut or SplashDown or something stellar.|`|Of2B85f1aa	You should add different inversions and stuff besides three hills and a loop.<br>  Try googling things like...<br>  Bolliger&Mallibard... You'll find good ideas with them, they make the amazing roller coasters and yeah.<br>  Or google things like S&S, Steel Coasters, and what not. =]|`|popRBGHUaa	A search for "roller coaster kit" turns up a lot of cool stuff, but it depends on how much your roller coaster project needs to be hand-made instead of store-bought.  Some of the kits aren't cheap.  If I were to build one from scratch, I wouldn't know where to start.

up6I8etaaa	Well, there's some formula that we don't know that the computer uses to figure out your points.  Basically, the higher up you are (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) you get more points.  If you have a pretty high ranking (6000 and up), you win, and are playing people with a low ranking, you won't get many points.  If the second place person has a 3000 ranking, though, he/she will get a lot more points than you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|27278449ec41d2bc430d6b609b7a5445aa	They're not for anything really. The VR points are just to show people how good you are. Best way to get a lot of points is to get first place.|`|XnfpK7Anaa	it decides the ranking. get 1st a lot to get a lot of points.

EUaIGX0Gaa	Not all games but in Diamond and Pearl the guy looks dumb, I am a boy myself (me) but in Diamond I choose the girl because she looked better. So I would choose the girl in D/P and Platimun<br>  <br>  Mip|`|jN1DqObraa	I don't think they all do, it depends on the trainer. Personally, i think that for normal trainers the girls do look cooler for the most part, but for important NPC trainers (ex:  rival, leaders, E4 etc...) the males have always looked cooler in the entire Pokemon series (with a few exceptions). As for playable characters, in DP, I don't think Lucas looks cool at all, whereas Dawn looks fairly decent. In RSE, Brendan and May were both just OK. In Crystal, I liked Gold better than Kris, and in FRLG, while i really like Leaf, NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE is cooler then Red, ever. So while i would say a Lass is cooler than a Bug Catcher any day,  over all I think the two genders are fairly equal in coolness.|`|cO10thlnaa	I'd have to agree for the most part. It's just the Japanese art style I guess. Though the new design of the male trainer for Platinum looks quite a bit better than the D/P design.
35KnMRrBaa	30. I suggest Stranglethorn Vale. You can get there from taking the Zepplin from Orgrimmar to Grom'gol. They have good grinding quests that will get you up there fast. As for the gold. I suggest getting a profession. Like skinning, herblism, mining. Mining is good, I use that. Sell your stuff you get on the Auction House. Don't get a crafting profession at your level it will take away your money, and you'll be waiting on crafts and etc. Not good for you.<br>  <br>         Desolace is also a good place for leveling from 30 and up. I don't suggest it though because the quests are very spread out and you waste time trying to find some and doing them. (Located by Stonetalon Mountains, which is by the Barrens.)<br>  <br>          Arathi Highlands is another place. (Located east of Hillsbrad Foothills) I leveled a couple of my characters through there.<br>  <br>         KEEP IN MIND: People will say not to go to STV, because of ganking, but STV is just too good to pass up.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Go to Arathi Highlands or Stranglethorn Vale. <br>  Instances don't really grant great xp unless they are plowed through very quickly. Instances are for item drops, or quest rewards. Period.<br>  For money, take up a gathering profession. Also, sell everything you get for drops unless it is a direct upgrade. You can sell your greens on the auction house, but that requires a trip back to town. If you wont be hitting an even number (thus meriting a return trip to gain new abilities) then just sell greens to vendors. Always sell blue BoEs to the auction house. Also, grey drops, especially grey weapons and armor, sells very well to vendors. Always try to make room for those in your inventory.<br>  You may want to consider an investment in larger bagspace, as more room yields more loot with grants more money to you.|`|djNeNEOuaa	As far as the gold is concerned take skinning and one other gathering proffesion (Mining or herbalism) and sell all the meterials on the Auction house. I made 890g by level 64 doing this (not including training and mount costs).<br>  <br>  As far as leveling goes you can try using carbonite its a mod that shows you where all your quests are turned in and what to kill for them.<br>  <a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/carbonite-quest.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addon...</a><br>  (mail me if you need help installing the addon)<br>  <br>  Or try one of these guides which free.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/james_horde_leveling_guide_chapter_i" rel="nofollow">http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/james_alliance_leveling_guide_-_chapter_i" rel="nofollow">http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/j...</a>|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	The best advice I can give is to quit WoW.<br>  <br>  But if you insist on playing that crappy game, www.gamefaqs.com|`|SNACHcceaa	If you were on my realm id power level you and give you about 500g cuz im really nice, im a level 80 on Exodar :D. Horde FTW! Now lets see... level 30 try Arathi +I might be streatching it but Hillsbrad. To earn gold, either go to my realm and ill give you soem goldy poo or just earn it ur self by questing at the places i gave you, using your professions when you come across the product it involves such as ores for mining/black smith, or a herb for herblore, animals for skinning and so on. Dont be a fraid to be a begger too btw cuz sometiems you may come across a really nice generous person... seriously in my realm i asked someone for some money when i was a level 65 ( 2 yrs ago ) for my epic flyer and training and he gave me 4000g, he was quitting WoW anyways so yeah.

X4Ot4OLmaa	i would play blackjack that is the easyer to play|`|9yj86j0Caa	craps.|`|85AoQYh8aa	None I dont get why people play games where they know that no matter what they do the best odds they can get are still under 50%.  But you dont go to the casino much i take it so your odds of walking away up money (in total) are still much better than the people who play everyday<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong im all for gambling but you have got to give me a 50% chance or better at winning or atleast make me believe im getting those odds. <br>  <br>  But you are going to the casino and i doubt your a poker player so dont go down that road, but i do like tri card poker if they offer it and let it ride and occasionally i just mess around a lil on video poker

nfb6VTK5aa	Here are the diffrences<br>  <br>  DSi: HARDWARE <br>  The Nintendo DSi is about 12% thinner (2.6 mm) than the Nintendo DS Lite. The new handheld has two VGA (0.3 megapixel)[24] digital cameras; one on the internal hinge pointed towards the user and the second one in the outer shell.[25][26] It also has larger screens (3.25 inches, instead of the previous 3 inches) and improved speakers.[8] Yui Ehara, the designer of DSi's outer shell, wanted to keep the unit "neat" and "simple" with its new features. The power switch has been replaced with a power button, as the original DS had, now located next to the bottom left side of the touchscreen. For DS software its power button also serves as a soft reset to return to the main menu. While for DSi software, Kentaro Mita who is responsible for relaying ideas from the company to the team commented "you can move around, return to the menu, or play a different game, without shutting down the power every time".[13] Once at the main menu, DS cards can be hotswapped.[27] The DSi has a matte surface to prevent fingerprints from showing up, as opposed to the glossier finish the DS Lite has. The speaker apertures were altered due to the redundancy of circular perforations on its shell and since the change can be noticeable while keeping the unit neat. Ehara pushed for this alteration to also make consumers see more of a distinction between the DSi and its predecessors.[13] Excluding North America, Nintendo will release the handheld in both matte black and matte white. Japan will receive pink, lime green and metallic blue colors on March 20, 2009.[28]<br>  The DSi has five brightness settings compared to the DS Lite's four; however, battery life is reduced to 9–14 hours on the lowest brightness setting compared to the 15–19 hours of its predecessor.[29]<br>  Nintendo stated that, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the front slot for Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridges has been removed.[8] Thus removing the unit's backward compatibility with GBA Game Paks[30] and its compatibility with accessories that require the GBA slot, such as the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak; as well as the Guitar Hero: On Tour and Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades grip, which is required for those games.[31]<br>  Technical specifications<br>  Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the DSi system. Nintendo has also improved some of the DSi's hardware (compared to the DS Lite), such as the main CPU and the RAM.[32][33]<br>  CPUs: The main CPU is an ARM processor clocked at 133 MHz.[34][35]<br>  RAM: 16 MB of RAM (four times more than previous models)[33]<br>  Storage: 256 MB of internal Flash memory[36]<br>  Wireless: 802.11 internal wireless connectivity[37]<br>  <br>  <br>  FEATURES:<br>  An SD card slot hides behind the cover on the right-side of the handheld. The SD card can be used for external storage of pictures, downloaded software and to play AAC audio.[38] The built-in audio player feature serves as a voice recorder and music player of AAC audio, but does not support MP3s. This media player can also adjust pitch, playback and add filters to the aforementioned audio. Using the handhelds' internal microphone, the audio player can save and modify up to eighteen ten-second sound clips from voice recordings then apply them to songs.[39][40] Photos taken using the DSi can be synced to the Wii's Photo Channel.[8]<br>  Similar to its competitor, the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo's own Wii console, the DSi has upgradable firmware; a first for a Nintendo handheld system. All existing homebrew flash cards for the Nintendo DS and DS Lite are incompatible with the DSi,[41] but cards that can run DS software on a DSi are now being produced – the first one was created by Acekard.[42]<br>  Nintendo has reported that the DSi uses region locking for DSi-specific software, since the handheld provides Internet services tailored individually for each region and it uses rating-based parental controls, which differ by country. However, certain elements are region-free: Internet browsing, photo sharing and Nintendo DS software.[43] The WPA and WPA2 support is not backward compatible with original DS games. Only DSi services can use WPA.[44]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PSP:<br>  <br>  HARDWARE<br>  The PSP Slim & Lite offers a 19% slimmer (reduced to 18.6 mm from 23 mm) and 33% lighter (reduced to 189 grams [6.66 ounces] from 280 grams [9.87 ounces]) system than the original PSP system.[3][5] Internal changes to achieve this include the removal of a metal chassis (used to reduce damage in the event of sudden trauma to the system resulting from the user dropping the system on a hard surface). However, users have complained from generally poor hardware assembly like misaligned faceplates[6] and loose/creaky battery covers,[7] unlike the highly praised original PSP hardware.[8]<br>  Other changes include improved WLAN modules and Micro-controller, and a thinner and much brighter LCD.[9] To target the original PSP generation's poor load times for UMD games,[10] the internal memory (RAM and Flash ROM|`|dhXCEumpaa	I would honestly prefer the DSi.

Crochet hooks are nice and cheap; you might as well get a set of different sizes.|`|PnFvNFicaa	you need crocheting hooks, there are many sizes of these and what you should do is go to the library and take a look and the knitting and crocheting section in hobbiesw. the books there will help you understand what you will need. also most clubs have a start up unit that will help you get started|`|154dzJ1Faa	They will tell you what you need.  But having a full set of needles is always helpful.  I prefer using circular needles, about 36" or so long.  You can do fingers of gloves with them as well.<br>  <br>  There are all sorts of other things you will find helpful in time.  Add them to your "toolbox" as you go along. (tape measures, stitch markers, scissors, large eye needles, etc)<br>  <br>  Crochet hooks come in all sizes as well, and you can add to your collection as you need them.<br>  <br>  I like to go to thrift shops.  You can often find needles and hooks of all sizes there are very reasonable prices.  But they are not always there, so go often.  Eventually, you will have all the needles and hooks you will ever use.
uctxzjIIaa	Sure. Being tapped just means that the creature cannot be chosen to attack, chosen to defend*, or use any of special abilities that require the creature to tap in order to use.<br>  <br>  * You can choose a creature to defend, then use an ability it has that taps it, and have it still perform its defnse normally.|`|X4Ot4OLmaa	YEAH THAT HAPPEN TO ME AND I WON THE GAME. SO IT WILL WORK FOR U|`|ZNeadVNXaa	It depends on the targeting condition, which is usually listed right after the word "target" on the spell or activated (creature/artifact) ability. Let's use 2 examples:<br>  <br>  Assassinate (Tenth Edition) 2B Sorcery- text: Destroy target tapped creature. <br>  <br>  This spell can only be used on a tapped creature. If there are no creatures in play, or if they are all untapped, you cannot cast/play this spell. Also, If that target becomes untapped after the spell is cast, but before it resolves, The target will become illegal and since all it's targets are gone, it FAILS and goes to the graveyard. <br>  <br>  Here's an oldie but a goodie:<br>  Maze of Ith: <br>  Non-Basic Land ("The Dark" Uncommon)<br>  (current Oracle text)<br>  T: Untap target attacking creature. Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to and dealt by that creature this turn.<br>  <br>  Now normally, every creature taps to attack, unless it has Vigilance (or says otherwise in it's text) But what if the attacking creature has Vigilance? Maze of Ith still works on it. All the Maze is looking for is an attacking creature, not whether it's tapped or not. The untap effect doesn't do anything, but the rest still does because the target is legal.
Of2B85f1aa	Ahh.<br>  Lucky you. =D <br>  I wanna go back there!<br>  On with the answer...<br>  <br>  I'd say yeah a Monday is great, because the kids are in school Monday and if you go anywhere before 3 o' clock, you'll probably only be around alot of adults, elders and toddlers, not a big crowd on Mondays.<br>  <br>  You most likely won't get rained out, since it's usually really sunny around Florida, you might have a grey sky but you more likely will be fine, we went when the sky was grey, and we went right after a big rain storm and everything was dry and running.<br>  <br>  The advantages of getting there early are the fact that if you go to the bigger coasters, there won't be as big of lines and you'll get to ride it over again twice before the lines start to fill up.<br>  <br>  The best rides I think are all of the major coasters, (Sheikra, Kuma, Montu, Gwazi)<br>  Gwazi is in the entrace of the park, Sheikra is near the back side, Kumba is in the back and Montu is on the back-east side.<br>  So, you pretty much start at one coaster and ride the rides and all that to the next, ect.<br>  <br>  Have fun on your trip! =]|`|popRBGHUaa	In general, weekdays at amusement parks are slower than weekends.  This is especially true before school lets out for the summer, with the exception of spring break.  Remember, kids need parents to take them, and parents usually work during the week.<br>  <br>  Most amusement parks don't worry too much about rain, but lightning can be an issue with some of the taller rides.  It's always a good idea to check the weather forecasts before going to an amusement park.<br>  <br>  Going to the park at opening time is the BEST way to avoid long lines for the rides.  We always try to arrive at opening time, head straight to the most thrilling rides, and work our way down to the less thrilling ones.  In general, 1 to 5 pm are the busiest times, so it might be an idea to enjoy all the rides you can early in the day, then take a break and come back later if you haven't had enough fun.<br>  <br>  I don't remember the best rides at Busch Gardens, but you can go to their web site and check it out.  My girlfriend and I do that as part of our trip planning no matter where we go.<br>  <br>  No idea about the temperature of the ocean this time of year.

ZMcPHP7Yaa	Always consider the overs, but consider them as just a pair and a potentially dangerout pair, and remember, in the case of AQ with a J, 10, 4 flop, there's a chance that the AK waiting for your over Q to hit to make -his- nut straight.<br>  <br>  You have to do a little quick calculation as you're playing to check for your odds. You are allowed time to think when it comes your turn to act, so use it. <br>  <br>  You're looking for the King in this instance, so you are indeed looking, AT BEST, at a 4 outer. Let's say for instance, you're playing six handed. 52 cards-12 cards in hand-1 burn- 3 community= 36 cards left in the deck, only a 9% draw. Now, the more players you have in the hand, the better that percentage gets, BUT, also take into consideration that with more players, the better the chance for one of them to have thrown away or even have one or more of your outs. That 9% calculation, 6 handed, is your BEST chance of hitting it. If someone holds/folded a King, those chances are even smaller.<br>  <br>  Just for a little bit of advice, in reguards to the hand, you're in a bad spot, and should almost always check/fold this kind of draw. With a J,10,4 board, you're really only looking for the King to hit the nut straight, because with AQ, you should have raised preflop, unless you were under the gun, and the hands you'll be against are going to be hands like AK, AQ, AJ, A10, KQ, QJ, or mid to high pocket pairs. You're in trouble against most of them. Remeber, you're 9%, 6 handed to his this kinda draw, AT BEST.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, you don't even need odds for these kind of situations, but if you need a quick way to do it, divide the number of cards remaining in the deck against the number of outs you have to give you your best chance of hitting it. Only way I'd ever advise calling a bet in this sort of situation is if you're getting 8:1 pot odds or better, and you almost never do.|`|p3tVyimaaa	Always calculate for the best hand but count all cards that can help improve your hand.<br>  <br>  You example: You have 4 outs (4 kings) for the best hand.<br>                                     3 more outs (3 aces) for top pair<br>  <br>  7 outs for 47 cards remaining for  7/47 or 15%<br>  <br>  Just keep track of how many cards have been played and how many outs you have remaining in your head just us fractions like the one above, the percent is fancier but is just another calculation to do. Stick with the fractional way to monitor your outs, you'll be fine.

I have one and it is good. Its good not only for gaming but for streaming videos, listening to music, watching DVDs and Blu-ray, surfing the internet and online is FREE!!!<br>  <br>  Plus there are a lot of good games coming out for PS3 this year, like Killzone 2 for instance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|B0zBwljiaa	well the ps3 has free online<br>  ps3 also have the blue ray player<br>  but i believe the x box is better if you keep it in a cool place|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	they are both good..look at the games each offer and make up ur mind that way..

Then you can start putting into points like Slash blast after HP increase is maxed.

nsVig475aa	I'm running Vista on my laptop and own every expansion pack and 3 stuff packs. Judging from that, I'd say all expansion packs are compatible with Vista. <br>  <br>  It never even crossed my mind that one of them might NOT be compatible with Vista. I've neber seen one to be labeled as to whether or not it runs with Vista. I can't see why one expansion Pack would run with Vista when another wouldn't.<br>  <br>  The thing about running them on Vista is that all the game requirements are higher, so It'll run slower.|`|e34fe10b551a455e23510d868cb71a7eaa	We have all but one expansion pack for Sims 2 (don't have Pets) and are using them on Vista successfully!

hxQmr6IGaa	After a game, there is a button saying, "Save Replay". Just click and you're game will be saved.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Make a replay? <br>  <br>  If you mean save a game so you can replay it later, then you just choose to save it in the menu during the game. If you stay until the end, it will save properly. You can also choose to save it at the end of the game.<br>  <br>  If you mean to veiw a replay, make sure the game file is saved in the proper folder and you will be able to access it via Single Player mode by Loading that scenario. If it isn't accessible through Loading the scenario, the game file is probably saved in the wrong folder.

Uy76tBIEaa	1. False, although that would be true if not for the in-game secret of adding Ryu's (and Ken's) Fireball in the Armored Armadillo stage.<br>  2. Chameleon Sting<br>  Not only can you power it up with the X-Buster to become invisible for a certain period of time, it's also the weapon of choice against mid-boss Storm Eagle and the boss at the end of the stage, although you might want to use the X-Buster against Storm Eagle in order to have more Chameleon Sting available when fighting the boss at the end of the stage.<br>  3. Serges, Violen, and Agile<br>  They obtained Zero's parts in between the end of Megaman X and the beginning of Megaman X2 on behalf of the surviving Sigma.<br>  Be prepared for a long battle against Serges, as his strength is in defense.<br>  Be prepared to use a Sub-Tank in order to survive against Violen.  His attacks hit hard and can be unpredictable.<br>  Agile is actually the easiest of the X-Hunters, although he gives you less than a second to react to his attacks.<br>  4. True, but only because of the addition of Ryu's (and Ken's) Dragon Punch midway through the stage.  Obtaining the Dragon Punch is a difficult task, but once acquired, it's by far the most important weapon X can use in the rest of the game.<br>  5. Conventional wisdom from my previous answer would suggest the Dragon Punch is best, but good luck finding an opening suitable enough in which to strike.  Next in line is the Speed Burner, as it's the only weapon acquired from a Maverick that Zero will allow to hit him.<br>  6. Near the end of the first Doppler stage, you can fall down a chasm.  Just make sure you're holding onto the left wall of said chasm so you can pass through the wall at the correct point because, if you fall too far, you'll lose a life and have to try all over again.  Your reward for properly executing this idea is the Gold Chip, which upgrades all of X's parts.<br>  7. Ray Splasher<br>  Oddly enough, even though it works against either possible boss, it's not the weapon I would recommend in either case.  If Bit and/or Byte survived through the Maverick stages, I recommend powering up the Parasitic Bomb and focusing all your efforts on evading the boss' attacks.  If both have been destroyed before entering the Doppler stages, I recommend the Tornado Fang because of its ability to deliver multiple hits with each use.  The Ray Splasher does, however, make a pretty good backup plan if the primary weapon runs out of energy before the boss is defeated, although this shouldn't be an issue against the modified version of Bit and/or Byte if you're using the Parasitic Bomb effectively.<br>  8. First off, you have to find Vile in one of the Maverick stages.  Once you've found him, you have to destroy him with either the Ray Splasher or the Spinning Blades.  After Vile has been destroyed, you have to reach the second Doppler stage.  Once there, you should reach a flooded area.  Navigate the flooded area with X successfully, and you should surface near a door.  Call in Zero before entering the door, and Zero will fight a creature called Mosquitus.  Defeat Mosquitus, and it will drop Zero's health to 1 bar, at which point X will reappear.  Zero explains what happened, and when the explanation is finished, he gives X the Z-Saber.<br>  9. Twin Slashers<br>  10. Dr. Wily<br>  Wily even went so far as to call Zero his masterpiece, and Zero was originally built to destroy Dr. Light.<br>  "After him.  He is my nemesis.  Our rivalry... is what gives me motivation in life.  Now go.  Destroy him."

GS0qqawqaa	May I know your server? Before, I was playing FrozenGlade Private Server. It's also a low-rate server.<br>  <br>  Here's my way of leveling up for all my characters that may help you.<br>  <br>  Novice -> 1-2 porings. Anywhere. Change Job.<br>  1st Job -> Lots of ants. Anthell. Change Job when reached JobLvl 50.<br>  2nd Job -> If ants still help, kill some ants. Then bongun and munak. Payon Cave. Nine tails. Payon Cave. Lvl 90-99, Orcs. gef_fild14. Warp to Orcs Dungeon, then walk southward and take the left portal. Rebirth, and there you have it.<br>  <br>  Also, it's best to get the Homunculus. Especially Vanilmirth. Though it's quite expensive, it will totally help you level up.<br>  <br>  * Don't forget autoloot if it's available. When you're overweight, just sell them. I got rich through this. :)<br>  <br>  * Another means of getting rich is by hunting Desert wolves.<br>  They drop stilettos that cost 12k if you have overprice and sometimes drop Mink Coat that's quite expensive if you vend it.<br>  <br>  * When you're done with your Creator, create a SinX if you don't have one. Then collect the ingredients needed for a poison bottle and create lots of these. Poison bottles are quite expensive and very popular to those who are lazy to make one.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!

By sending 1 card from your hand to the Graveyard, destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Armed_Dragon_LV10" rel="nofollow">http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Armed_Drago...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Pretty straight forward unless you are braindead. If you manage to get Armed Dragon LV7 on the field, you can then summon Armed LV10 from your hand by tributing LV7.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Jeremy is incorrect. Armed Dragon LV10 cannot be special summoned via Monster Reborn. Its text states CANNOT be special summoned, meaning only through the way on the card or by Level Modulation after it was properly summoned.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	okay ths is easy:<br>  you can summon him by tributing a armed dragon level 7<br>  example: you have an armed dragon lv 7 on the field and a lv 10 in your hand. you tribute the lv 7 for lv 10. <br>  you can also special summon him from the grave<br>  example: armed dragon lv 10 is in the graveyard. you activate level modualation and special summon him to the field. <br>  exaplmle 2: aremd dragon lv 10 is on the field and destroyed. your turn you play monster reborn to bring him back to the field<br>  <br>  i hope this helps :-)|`|dkCNV7gSaa	The effect of Armed Dragon Lv 10 states you need Armed Dragon Lv 7 to summon with. <br>  Example: Let's say I have Armed Dragon Lv 7 on the field and Armed Dragon Lv 10 in my hand.

He uses Tribute to the Doomed and destroys Armed Dragon Lv 10.

AA10248312	It might be the 10th time you've asked this, but it'll only be my second time answering it.  Previous is at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkK5l2dnn8Pz69ZEQNZbYdDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221231329AAnlvq4&show=7#profile-info-8D4AnMgjaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I'll just paste the info here:<br>  <br>  If you "gammon" someone (i.e. you remove all of your pieces before your opponent is able to remove ANY of theirs, your score is doubled....that is, you normally would get a point for a win, but if you gammon, you would get two points).<br>  <br>  If you "backgammon" your opponent (i.e. if you remove all of your pieces while your opponent still has one or more pieces left in your "home" area OR on the bar (your "home" area means the six pips from which you remove your pieces), then your score would be tripled.<br>  <br>  With the doubling cube, it works this way:<br>  <br>  1) Players must alternate doubling (you can not double twice in a row). Once you double, then the option to re-double passes to your opponent.<br>  <br>  2) When you double, your opponent has two options:<br>  a) Accept the double, in which case the stakes of the game are now doubled .<br>  b) Decline the double, in which case you would win the game and win the non-doubled stakes.<br>  <br>  For example, you're playing a game for a point... you think you're ahead, so you "double" your opponent. Your opponent can either accept the double, in which case the stakes are now two points, or decline the double, in which case you would win that game and win one point.<br>  <br>  If your opponent would accept your double, thereby agreeing to play a two-point game, then the option to re-double shifts to your opponent. If, later in the game, your opponent takes the lead in their mind, they can then re-double, asking you if you want to make it a FOUR point game... you would then have two options: a) Accept the double and agree that the game would then be worth four points or b) decline the double, in which case your opponent would win that game and win two points.<br>  <br>  <br>  Normally, you play for a point per game in backgammon... there's obviously no limit to how many "points" win the match, it's up to the two of you to set that goal.<br>  <br>  If the doubling cube is used and the game is won via a "gammon" or "backgammon", then you would multiply the number of game points won by the doubling cube number.... so if you double your opponent (play for two points) and gammon them, you would win four points (two for the double times two for the gammon). If you double and then "backgammon" your opponent, you would win SIX points (three for the backgammon times two for the double).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the rating, but you should have won 4 points for winning a doubled, gammoned game. If you're talking about a skill level rating, then winning such a game wouldn't necessarily add four points to your rating. In ratings systems, your rating is determined by a combination of your won/loss record and that of each of your opponents. That's not the same as a score of an individual game or match.<br>  <br>  ____________________________________<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the stupid ratings systems people!  Either play the games for fun or find something else to do.  Online ratings systems are not going to tell you anything about your abilities.

MCITbIlSaa	I was experiencing lots of problems, from lagging to complete system crashes. After doing a lot of reading online, I found out some things.<br>  The Sims is very graphics intensive (Duh!), and memory requirements can go up dramatically as you add expansion packs and custom content. The minimum requirements for the Sims 2 game are:<br>  <br>  * 1.8 GHz processor or higher (2.4 GHz for Vista)<br>  * 1 GB RAM (2 GB is better)<br>  * Windows Vista, XP, ME, 98 or 2000<br>  * 8x or faster CD/DVD drive for the physical version.<br>  * At least 1.0 GB of additional hard drive space.<br>  * A T&L-capable video card with at least 32 MB of video RAM.<br>  <br>  Of those 5 things, the RAM and the Video Card are the most important to Sims2 game play. My problem, it turns out, was that my Dell computer had an "integrated video card". That means that the video card was a part of the mother-board, and shared memory resources with it. It also turns out that my new Dell didn't have enough expansion slots in back to put in another video card, so I was stuck with what I had.<br>  <br>  My solution was/is a bit of a hassle, but it solved the issues I was having, and I'm able to play Sims 2 on this computer now without all the graphics and system problems.<br>  <br>  First, when I'm ready to play Sims 2, I close every single program I will not need to keep the computer and the game going (I use Task Manager > Processes tab for the programs that aren't visible, like some of the Google stuff). I tell my Firewall program (yeah, I do keep that running) to stop all Internet traffic, and then I suspend my virus scanner. THEN I start the game.<br>  <br>  During game play, when I'm going to be doing any work on the neighborhood lots, I will lower the graphics settings like Sim and Texture Detail, Screen Size and the like. When I'm done editing, I switch my in-game graphics setting back up to high to play the game.<br>  <br>  When I'm done playing the game, I save/exit, and then restart my computer to get all those other programs running again.<br>  <br>  That's it. Hope this helps. Happy Simming!|`|1pX0PaQsaa	I played sims the castaway stories with samll scrren cuz it would only become big when the graphic card was puten.

9a60bebad3ce0434f932bc9086d2dd7eaa	It's kinda complicated, but there's no certain amount you need to make your account last forever.<br>  Each Webkinz or Lil Kinz you purchase and activate is equal to a one year account; you can adopt more, but you need at least one to survive for one year. After the year, you will need to buy a new one to reactivate it.<br>  <br>  So basically, you need one new Webkinz for every year at the minimum. :)<br>  <br>  (your friend is wrong.)|`|WgJ2KlUNaa	It doesn't matter how many you have because, you can't make your account last for ever by buying four. your account will expire if you haven't bought a pet for a year. if you haven't bought a new webkinz in about a year then it will tell you that your account is about to expire and it will give you 30 days to buy a new one to make your account last longer and if you buy a new webkinz a lot then i wouldn't worry about your account getting expired. good luck and hope i helped :)

WuhIoS1laa	An ATI Radeon 4850, one of their newer desktop video cards, should be new enough to run the game, unless there is something specific about that card that is making it error out. <br>  <br>  Make sure that you have updated your card with the latest drivers for Vista 64. Drivers seem to be the number one issue under Vista 64. <br>  <br>  The second is memory. I wouldn't try to run the game on Vista with out 2GB of RAM. If you have only 1GB, that might be pushing it. <br>  <br>  If you have not downloaded the official patch for Pets, do that as well. <br>  <br>  If the error still occurs, try temporarily disabling your antivirus.  I had fits with two different products and eventually had to tell them to ignore all The Sims 2 files and directories.|`|sWKGUPziaa	It means that with expansion pack 4 there is an error. If you uninstall your games, you need to totally uninstall them. Make sure that when you uninstall your games go to Documents/EA Games\s folder and make sure there are no files left there before reinstalling your games. The free Revo uninstaller or any other free uninstaller that will completely take your Sims games out of your computer (off registry too) are the best uninstallers. It could be the expansion pack itself. Try installing your games and the expansion pack that is giving you the problem, try installing that one last.|`|ysiE6IDjaa	Check your specs again. The requirements for Vista are much higher than XP. To play Pets on Vista your graphics card needs to be ATI Radeon Series 9600 or greater , which includes the following cards: 9600, 9700, 9800 <br>  X300, X600, x700, X800, x850 <br>  X1300, X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950 <br>  <br>  If you have a Nvidia GeForce series it has to be one of these: GeForce 6200, 6600, 6800 <br>  GeForce 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950 <br>  S3 GammaChrome <br>  S18 Pro <br>  S18 Ultra<br>  <br>  Edit: that is a good card.

DfZsM0oEaa	Yes, you can upgrade any ticket to a higher level ticket for the difference.  There is no other fee for upgrading so you are fine there.  In your case, the charge would be $25.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	It sounds like you bought the Southern California 2-fer.  This is NOT a park hopper ticket. It allows you to go to one park on one day, and return within 30 days to go to the other park for free.  But it does not allow you to go to both parks on the same day.<br>  <br>  If the ticket is unused yes you can upgrade it to a 2-Day SoCal Park Hopper(as long as you are a SoCal Resident) by just paying the extra $25.  If you have already used one day you can still upgrade it to a Park Hopper but it would only be for 1-Day since you already used the first day.|`|43zXRpLYaa	Yes, you have to pay $25.

Xm5ab6F6aa	I would hand wash one at a time in woollite, rince well and see if the dirt came out, if it did not use some 409, rinse well let drip then fluff in the dryer.<br>  <br>  Beanies have had their rise in the resale market, their value are almost totally gone now. They are to have fun with do not worry about saving the tag at this point, You can buy 3 for a dollar on ebay, or at garage sales.  Just enjoy them!|`|AA11738671	You can, but since the value is determined in big part by the tag, it's not a good idea if you are collecting them or plan to sell them someday.
kkM8vFfKaa	There's no MMO that you can actually "beat"... but I assume this is why you put quotation marks around it.<br>  Diablo II is a quick leveling MMO. You have to buy the actual CD's to download it, but other than that there are no monthly payments (they are coming out with a Diablo III in 2010)<br>  Runescape is an online MMO (almost like WoW, not as good)... it costs to play monthly.<br>  World of Warcraft (not so fast of leveling, but tons of fun)... Costs to buy the expansion packs plus a monthly payment of $15 for online play.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I would personally recommend WoW, but since you want quick leveling I would say go with Diablo II if you don't mind going for an older game and buying the game itself.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind paying a monthly fee, then go for Runescape. It's an older game, also.<br>  <br>  Also,<br>  Fly For Fun is another downloadable online game, and it's free. It's an MMO as well... It's like WoW but has more anime-like characters. I'm not sure how quick the leveling goes, as I haven't played much. But it's completely free and you can interact with other players online.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|9wk2bIfTaa	City of Heros if u try it I suggest a scrapper or a tanker. you'll see what i mean if u havent played it yet

pfGP0HXHaa	ok ive used omniknight before and also seen pros use him. I strongly advice you reading this guide: <br>  <a href="http://forums.dota-allstars.com/index.php?showtopic=177943" rel="nofollow">http://forums.dota-allstars.com/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  It's a brief simple guide outlining his specs and methods of playing him and using his abilities.<br>  <br>  In general though, do u want to play him as support or do u want to play as a hero-killer? if hero killer then you would get degen and heal early game.If support u would get heal and repel early game.<br>  <br>  Item choices also depend on what playstyle you're going for. For example a hero-killing omni would go sange and yasha while a support omni may go with necrobook instead :).<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. Goodluck fellow dota player =P.|`|sre4rOK2aa	id practice on the game more seeking new stragetys for my kind of play or maybe its weapon you have Armour or stats it could be any one of them|`|26bf3fd35c715fb12b9f6a291892831eaa	i personally don't know how to use omniknight... but just experiment with some builds, timing and strategies, in the end, you could learn how to use it and dominate games!<br>  I think you must also learn and experiment with other characters, because some characters omniknight could defeat, but also some characters could defeat omniknight..
U1HqGfUEaa	You should really LOOK SOMETHING UP FOR YOURSELF instead of just hoping someone spoon feeds you the answer like I'm about to do. This has been asked on Yahoo Answers many, many, many times.<br>  <br>  Everything floating around the internet right now are all rumors. They were released with the Limited Edition version of Halo Wars(Sandbox, Orbital and Assembly), they will be released on the XBL marketplace sometime hopefully soon, probably within a few weeks or so.<br>  <br>  EVERY specific answer you see as of right now is complete and utter rumor.

GS0qqawqaa	It really depends on the type of build you want to make.<br>  If it's a Soul Destroyer type, it should have INT.<br>  If it's a Sonic Blow type, AGI and STR.<br>  If it's a critical assassin type, LUK.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of guides over the internet that would better help you. Just google it. Goodluck.

That way you have Grass/Ground, Fire/Flying, Water, Dragon/Ground, Electric, Fighting/Steel.|`|oxNQYK2saa	They are all strong ones and would make a strong team, but if you want, here's my winning team. NOTE: I use ones that I use EV training with so they are over powerful. <br>  <br>  Blastoise (or Torterra if it's D/P)<br>  Pidgyot<br>  Snorlax<br>  Gangar<br>  Butterfree<br>  Celebi<br>  <br>  I got Celebi from trading it from Silver all the way up. If you want to know what EV training is, it is where you train against a certain pokemon, and after killing it 5 times, I think it was, when you level up, you will get an additional stat point, so if I kill 5 magikarp, i will get 1 more stat point in what ever EV training that pokemon gives.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	They are all good choices depending on what kind of team you have.|`|4f2GaLhpaa	I don't play Pokemon anymore but here's what I think:<br>  <br>  Dragonite - Hell yeah when he's leveled<br>  Kingdra - Eh<br>  Blissey - Eh, it depends you have to get him good moves he's got high hp though<br>  Tyranitar - Hell yeah<br>  Dewgong - I don't even know him.<br>  Metagross - Not really<br>  Milotic - NO<br>  Snorlax - NO<br>  Gallade - I don't know.<br>  Lucario - Yeah<br>  <br>  I would get pidgy because he lvls fast and he's good because you can use him to fly. Machops a good starter if you have someone to trade with. And for the starter you might wanna get the water type, you know at the beginning of the game, you can teach him surf later in the game. Or if you're playing the one with Charzard you can teach him how to fly. And whalelord is really good if you don't have one to surf you around - you get him from catching a whalemer.<br>  <br>  Oh and if you ever get leftovers give it to someone who has low hp and high defence because they'll make better use of it every turn. Also if you're going to catch a starmie & if they're going to have recover go to the drugstore and buy him a bunch of defence things so then he'll be able to tank that will help you save money espically when you fight the ellite 4 because then you wont have to spend money on potions. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

Years before they came on the market they were already able to manufacture them, the gov nixed this as too many tvs, and spare parts were laying around, the tv industry as a whole starting slowing reg tvs and making flat panels before they came out.

The House of the Future was one of two free attractions sponsored by Monsanto. The other was the Hall of Chemistry, which closed in 1966. After Monsanto’s Adventure Thru Inner Space opened in 1967, the House of the Future was doomed.<br>  Legend has it that the planned one-day demolition of the House of Future ended up taking two weeks as the wrecking ball just bounced off the exterior. Workers painstakingly cut the house into pieces with hacksaws.<br>  <br>  After the House of the Future was removed, the house’s landscaping, waterfalls, and walkways remained. The area, named “Alpine Gardens,” became home to a souvenir stand. In 1995, Disneyland added the King Triton sculpture and delightful jumping fountains.<br>  <br>  The House of the Future hasn’t been forgotten. In fact, for an attraction that’s been gone since 1967 because it was outdated, it’s amazing that there continues to be homage to the House of the Future at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. <br>  <br>  Click this link for homage to house of future<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yesterland.com/homages.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yesterland.com/homages.html</a>|`|JWNzoksmaa	yes there was...i don't know about that. but everything was plastic in the house. b/c plastic was the newest and greatest thing since sliced bread back then...even the house itself was made of plastic.  they really thought we were gonna live in plastic houses lol.|`|s0edwYSmaa	actually there was a house of the future<br>  <br>  it was pod shaped but they closed a decade later<br>  <br>  disney's thinking about re-opening the house|`|SmFcDx4waa	yes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.ht...</a>|`|AA11511750	Yes, it's at Epcot.|`|O6x1CTd4aa	Yes|`|pNKCKccZaa	no just the past|`|LRCkSb42aa	It was called Yesterland, not tomorrowland here is the link of pictures and more information about it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yesterland.com/futurehouse.ht...</a>
GKJV2EBSaa	To have two or more different hair styles this is what you need to do.<br>  To do this with one computer open up two windows.On one of the windows, log in. Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now this is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can. So it will save both hairstyles.It is very tricky to do so you will have to try it a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps you!
1G3XPiq3aa	Rogue is better dps and a bit more straight forward to play. <br>  <br>  Feral druids still have healing spells and can tank or dps as they need to. They also get travel and flight form earlier than rogues get their mounts.|`|E8MUtC52aa	depends...rogues are great for leveling, they have high survivability with their abilities and do awesome damage, but they are not AS viable for end game content. <br>  <br>  they are awesome, but not the most desired for raid settings (in general).<br>  <br>  druids dont do AS MUCH damage, but thats because they can do other things, as they are pretty flexible if you want to heal or cast or tank later on...<br>  <br>  depends on your playstyle. (i prefer rogues, but i have mains that do other stuff, so i never needed to play a druid)|`|RJXDMFKyaa	Rogue pro you kill fast and can stealth through some stuff for a quest. Con for them against more then one enemy its hard and energy doesn't restore very fast.<br>  I can't say much about Feral Druid i only play melee classes. I hate to cast to many spells.
FthZ4hAIaa	when you put in the controllers for the gamecube go a little further then that on the top and there should be a flap that opens and it will have two slots (for your gamecube memory card.)|`|XX0ac9iRaa	Yes, open up the panel to the back of the one you place the gamecube controllers in. There are two slots there.|`|UFkbvGsPaa	Yes there are slots on the wii to insert the memory cards, I'm at work right now so I can't tell you exactly where, but you have to remove a lining of the wii. This accesses the areas to insert the gamecube controller as well as the memory cards.|`|VpWIQfXdaa	Yup! Theres a top part for the controlers, uv obviously figured that out. Just past that on the top is another little flap. open it, and there are two slots. it pops off ust like the other one, only its about half the size. Happy Gaming!

DtkLsetkaa	Have you checked to see if there is even a record that exists for this that is registered?  If not, then you could say you beat all of them and it wouldn't matter.  If there is, good luck, but 250 isn't all that much considering how many games there are and have been out there.  Are you dating back to intellivision,atari, and hell even Zork?|`|q6uyloYdaa	I think you should videotape yourself beating the games; that's a lot more reliable than just a screenshot. I think it's a good idea. I once thought about making a world record for number of times beating Sonic 2 in a row. But I didn't have any way to document it so I just ended up playing a bunch of Sonic 2 for nothing (but don't get me wrong, I love that game). I say go for it!!|`|eD687uffaa	thats amazing i think ive only beaten four at the most ... you should checkout Guinness|`|NGGZBCqVaa	So you want to break a gaming record – here’s what you need to do.<br>  Decide what record you’re going to break, and make sure you can do it. <br>  Do your research. There are some world record attempts that we don’t recognise for various reasons, so it’s worth going here to make sure we’ll accept your record. It’d be a shame to miss out on a Guinness World Record because of a technicality. <br>  Before you do anything else, tell us who you are here. Then login and tell us what you’re planning to do. We’ll send you an agreement to sign which sets out how we approve records and what happens if you’re successful. <br>  Send us the signed agreement (fax or scanned email is fine). Once that’s done, we’ll get in touch with you to let you know the guidelines for the attempt, and if there’s an existing record you need to beat. In some cases, we may have to reject your claim but we’ll always let you know why. <br>  Carry out your record attempt. For us to consider an attempt as valid, you’ll need to convince us that your claim is for real. We insist on the following as a minimum: <br>  An Audience<br>  Normally a record attempt needs to be carried out in front of an audience of 5 of more people (your friends are fine for this). <br>  Two Witnesses<br>  You’ll also need two witnesses who are prepared to testify that you’ve actually done what you claim. Both witnesses need to be over 18 and we’ll need some evidence of their integrity (for example, they may have some standing in the local community, or be associated with a profession). Also, at least one of them has to be considered an expert in video games - the manager of your local video games store is a good example, but we’ll also accept journalists, programmers, designers, or publishers. We find many video games stores are happy to host a world record attempt so don’t be afraid to ask! <br>  Send us the proof. Once the record attempt has taken place, you need to let us know how you did. For us to consider your record, you’ll need to send us hard copies of the following: <br>  The footage<br>  A video (DVD format) of the entire record attempt from start to finish. Make sure it’s as high-quality as possible - we may reject your claim if the footage isn’t clear enough. <br>  Witness statements<br>  We need a signed statement from each of your witnesses that details exactly what they saw you do, including times, scores, dates and the location where your attempt took place. Each statement needs to be on letterheaded paper from the witness’ company, and include their contact details. <br>  Photos<br>  You’ll need to include some photographs of the attempt in progress, and of the venue where it took place. <br>  Screenshots<br>  If your record is of an in-game achievement, you can support your entry with screenshots. While we don’t use these as evidence (they’re too easy to tamper with), we may use them to illustrate you achievement on our website or in the book if we approve it. <br>  Any other supporting evidence<br>  If there’s anything else that you’d like to submit that you think will help us determine that your claim is the real deal, feel free to include it, but bear in mind we can’t return anything you send us. <br>  Leave it to us, but remember that our word is final. In most cases, we’ll approve your record based on the evidence you send us, but sometimes we may ask for more info, or even invite you to attend an official Guinness World Records adjudication to verify your claim in person. <br>  We send you a certificate celebrating your achievement. You bask in the glory of being a Guinness World Record holder! <br>  <br>  i got that right off the site so if anyone wants to say thats wrong go ahead! =D
kjOrrLyraa	Lol ... Havent played the new one... But i love Alakazam he's my fave!... I remember on pokemon red lol, got a Kadabra and after a while he one hitted everything with psychic... He was kick ***, ended up getting him to lvl 100 and i wondered why he never evolved... Good times lol, then ofcourse i learnt the cheats xD. Anyways... Your team, I'd say call off the gengar, Alakazam has Shadow ball... And i think alakazam has better special attack... Salamance owns so does infernape. Staraptor and Lapras, The staraptors like the main flying type so i guess he has to stay, strange choice for your water type... I normally grab a Normal... Something like Blissey. High hp... Not bad stats... But i saw him Ko, like 2 legendary in a wifi match lol. I'd say about 8 / 10 ... Because they all have a more than decent move set... Lol, that's all i got for you man xD|`|ZIc7aGJTaa	You have a good selection of pokemon, but there is one basic rule you are unaware of: you should never have more than one of each type of move on each of your pokemon. Therefore, Staraptor should know EITHER fly, aerial ace, or brave bird, but never all three.  Other moves can be placed there for coverage.
