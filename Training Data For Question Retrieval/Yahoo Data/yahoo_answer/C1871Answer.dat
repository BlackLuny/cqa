Make sure your monitor is plugged in to the same socket as before,  (IE, a video card)<br>  otherwise  try to update the driver software on your video card <br>  and make sure you have the latest flash drivers from adobe.<br>  <br>  Another thing it could be is the amount of programs running at the same time.  or your internet connection.  the internet connection shouldn't make a difference in regular and full screen mode though.<br>  so if you have installed any other programs lately that run all of the tome you might disable them while you are doing u tube.|`|Z0lEv4Dzaa	How much video Ram do you have? Most video cards I've used since long ago freezes when ran in full screen because it cannot take the amount of memory a certain full-screened movie eats.<br>  <br>  Actually there are a lot of possibilities.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people suggest that you either install or "get" something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it's really YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" or "Flash" <br>  that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If, by the following day, YouTube is still stuck and showing<br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it'is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and can't take anymore -- the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are 1000s of tiny bits of websites<br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube and clear<br>  your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and<br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would<br>  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without <br>  having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send<br>  me a message/note with your YouTube username or email <br>  address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache" <br>  (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

Otherwise, you might have to pay for the root signing. It's been a while since I've looked, but some CA's were willing to do it for like $100.00. So, you'll just have to Google it.

vK53Hh8naa	If you are going to be studying Java, then will probably get ahead of the class if you understand what is know as Object Oriented Programming, or OPP.<br>  <br>  Imagine if you were designing a program to keep track of students in a new school. Each student has a name, a schedule, a grade record, a disciplinary record, and an administrative record. The school is small and it only has 100 students now....but its becoming very popular. All students are also first year students, but they will probably continue to study there for a few years. What would be the best way to create a program that can...grow? We can't add students directly into the program because there could be more of them...would you go back to the code and add all these students?<br>  <br>  So we create a general student. Let's call this the Students class. In this class, we will define containers for a student's information (grades, records, schedule) - these containers are called instance variables. We will also create function to add and remove students, these are class functions. The students will also have functions of his own...to add classes, change grades, etc - these are instance methods. The records, schedule, and grades will also need classes. Let's go ahead and create the Records class, Schedules class, and Grades class. <br>  <br>  When you create a variable, you are initializing an instance of a class.<br>  This instance is called an object. The object can have functions that can either modify or access information about an object. These functions, when talking about OPP, are referred to as Mutator and Accessor methods. In our example, changeClass or addGrade, would be mutator methods. Accessors would be getName or viewSchedule. The variables that are specific to an instance of an object are called instance variables. Keep in mind that you can have multiple instances of a class, or objects, yet they will all share the same class. The variables and functions that are shared by all instances of a class are called class variables and class functions. In our student example, a variable like school name would be considered a class variable because it would be shared by all instances and no instance would have an individual school.<br>  <br>  Variables can also be private or public. Information like students grades or SSNs should be kept in private variables that could only be modified by a legitimate methods defined within that object. This is to ensure that the variables will be kept protected from other functions that might want to change or view the variables. Public variables on the other hand can be viewed and modified externally. Variables can also be defined as constants, so that once defined, the value can't be changed. In our example, a public constant would be an ideal variable to store the school name. Functions can also be made private or public. A private function can only be called from the instance. In our example, no piece of code should be allowed to modify the grades of X students except the student itself.<br>  <br>  Well, that's a head start :)|`|o1r3A3Fiaa	If you would like to "think in Java" see this free 3rd edition by its author Bruce Eckel, "Thinking in Java".

j6MyoCluaa	No, you need to use a better Rainbow Table. The default table for Vista never works because it is dictionary based. You will need to find another table, but the problem is that the other tables on the Ophcrack site cost money.

This is the only real way to erase information off of magnetic media. This works by encrypting the data and deleting it many times over until its nothing more than unreadable code.

AUD1wZ5Kaa	No, it doesn't really take off the song from your CD so that you can't listen to the song again from your CD. It's just like copying. So when you go to Windows Media Player in your Library, or your My Music file, it will appear so you can listen to them and use them in videos.|`|LvixLNfoaa	ripping means that the information saved on CDs and DVDs will be copied to your computer.

It will copy the digital information about the tracks - that's how the tracks are stored on your computer. It will not remove the information from the CD though. And it can't find out information like album title and track names - Windows Media Player connects to the Internet to do that.|`|BlA60kDVaa	The term 'Ripping' or 'Rip' (when referring to a CD ROM) simply means copying all the data on it - or copying and converting the information on the CD.  The process is non-destructive. <br>  <br>  Hence the acronym of CD-ROM;<br>  <br>  CD stand for: Compact Disc<br>  ROM stands for: Read Only Memory<br>  <br>  Read Only means that information can not be changed, deleted nor re-written.  However if you are using Re-Writable CD's then information can be erased and re-written many times, like a Hard Disk Drive does.  But you would need a program to enable you to first erase the disc before re-writing any new data.<br>  <br>  Rest assured, this has nothing to do with "Ripping" a CD.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	What - like physically remove the data/tracks from the originating CD?<br>  No!!|`|Ez9NB86Iaa	No|`|93MPvb4Faa	Your cd is fine nothing actually comes off the cd.

29dbff23c7de1df58d1b7e712cbee492aa	LOL!! Guess I'm not the only person sick and tired of people answering "I dunno" or "why would you do that" just to get a stupid 2 points.<br>  <br>  If your computer is really REALLY frozen, that is, even SCRL LOCK, NUM LOCK, or CAPS LOCK won't make the keyboard lights go on and off, sorry, but there isn't any magical command or button that will help you out (other than the power button). If those lights do change in reaction to your pressing the buttons, your computer hasn't totally crashed. If it doesn't respond to CTRL-ALT-DEL, try ALT+TAB and see if it will let you scroll from one app to another. Now, why the hell would you do that if CTRL+ALT+DEL won't work? Because unless you're on XP Pro or a business version of Vista, CTRL+ALT+DEL loads the task manager, and you have a better chance of switching to a running task than starting a new one during problems like this. GIVEN THAT, I recommend running Task Manager in the background at all times while this is giving you trouble. <br>  <br>  Restarting it by pulling the power or holding down the power button isn't the worst thing you can do, but it's not the best thing for it. At the very least it will shorten the life of your hard drive. Basically it leaves the hard drive in a half-way-done-doing-something state. To be safe, each week, run CHKDSK /F C: and reboot. It shouldn't take more than an hour.<br>  <br>  If this happens alot to you, you should start troubleshooting. When it happens, try unplugging various USB devices slowly one at a time (except for external hard drives). Then (after a restart) try running your computer for a while without the external hard drive.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to SCAN FOR VIRUSES!! I've spent days on computer problems that turned out to be infections that the auto-detect feature of the AntiVirus happened to miss. Update definitions and do a FULL scan.<br>  <br>  You can test the memory also. Microsoft has it's own tool for this. <a href="http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp" rel="nofollow">http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp</a><br>  <br>  Are you using a program/game that requires a CD/DVD while you use it? Check to make sure the disk is clean. Also try another drive. Also your hard drive may be dying. Some time when you know you'll be away from your computer for more than 12 hours, run CHKDSK /F /R C:  (if you have additional hard drives or partitions, do this for them too). <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|7aqEtfLRaa	If the computer is frozen, turning it off it's going to hurt it more than it already is, there is no magic key on windows that will magically bring back a completely frozen computer (on linux, there's a way to unmount the drives before you turn it off if it's frozen so you don't hurt the filesystem, but that's just linux for ya.)|`|6c5a2050d65e6a6258c44fce892eddd2aa	sometimes tapping the ESC key on your keyboard will get you going; if not, then press down Ctrl, Alt and Delete at the same time- might have to do it more that once -a dialog box might pop up saying 'program not responding- select 'close now' and see what happens - <br>   good luck|`|H0fXySX9aa	you could have a virus<br>  a hardware problem<br>  a software problem<br>  tracking cookies<br>  the reason for it freezing is one of those reasons<br>  i had the same problem with my computer turns out i had to disable the add ons and install each one again|`|Ce870acoaa	Once your computer freezes there is nothing you can do.<br>  <br>   By leaving your computer alone (by alone I mean not going wild and mashing the keyboard and clicking like crazy) it will usually sort itself out and un-freeze. <br>  <br>  Just a tip to avoid your computer freezing, always close all non-essential programs while running resource intensive programs (like games, Photoshop, Rendering programs etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	Sometimes this works for mee, hold down the power button for a few secs to put it into standby mode.

GlHHz1ehaa	Final Cut Pro doesn't work on any other computer except Macs. There really isn't any equal software to Final Cut Pro. It is by far the best movie making software.

A lot of troublemakers out there unfortunately.|`|tWxwIPkVaa	Start with Malwarebytes (free d/load) and Spybot S&D (also free d/load) - Click on updates to get latest versions and run scans -|`|lb0bYSgUaa	Maybe worth doing a few scans after you erase your browser's cache.  <br>  <br>  In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Porn sites do NOT necessarily cause a virus. That is just something that parents tell naive gullible children, such as yourself, to keep them from looking at porn.<br>  <br>  Most computer viruses come from other sources.<br>  <br>  There is no way your mother, or anyone else for that matter, can tell exactly from what source a computer became infected.|`|IbxhRebgaa	Just clear your history in your web browser and delete temp directories.

You need the CDs that came with it or a recovery partition.  You probably just got the name wrong but i would hate for you to go to all the trouble of backing up then cant restore windows

HYedOEbnaa	yes the 64X2 is a dual core.  which means you have 2 processors instead of 1.  So the AMDX2 is a much faster processor than the athlon XP|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Well, in a manner of speaking, yes and it does have to do with 64 and 32 bit.<br>  <br>  A chunk of 64 bit code carries 2X as many 32 bit instructions in it, right?  That means that two 32 bit pieces can be "delivered" at once to the processor and so the processor is able to do twice as much.  As far as speed goes, in Mhz or Ghz, not much has changed.  But the way that the code and the instruction sets are handled has been changed.  The architecture has been improved, for example, by removing the front side bus (FSB) which improved communications between two or more cores.  The L1 cache has been expanded which immensely speeds up the internal code crunching.  So there is a lot of difference between a single monocore 32 bit processor and a 64 bit processor.  The dual core shares responsibilities about how it handles code - when one core gets tied up, the other goes into action to relieve the pressure.|`|jZ5MnD7Qaa	The AMD 64 X2 is a dual core processor, meaning it has two Processors with seperate cache in one core.<br>  <br>  Even if you disabled one of the cores, it would still be better than an Althon XP simply because they improved the design of the processor itself. Increasing pipelines, cache, execution units, smaller process (90nm to 64nm), newer transistor technology, faster access to memory due to HyperTransport technology, more advanced Instruction Sets. Each core would also have more cache to itself than the Athlon XP, more cache is better.<br>  <br>  Also, because the process is smaller (Google Photolithography), the amount of power it uses (and thus wastes) is MUCH less.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question!

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either<br>  a film / video creator or producer, an artist (musician, singer, comedian, actor),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a 875x75px "banner" for your channel (875x150 if you're corporate branded)<br>  -- a mini-banner beside each played video <br>  -- animated GIF as the background image<br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"<br>  -- extra channel boxes: bulletins, profile<br>  -- automatic higher quality to your videos<br>  -- "special" videos over 11 minutes long<br>  -- more options for your video thumbnails<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- unique skins/sizes for the video player ?<br>  -- the possibility of earning "ad revenue"<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner".

CBpp5Kuwaa	If it's helenaspoetry.com it's indexed in Google now - looks good.   There's no set time to get indexed Blogs tend to get listed first but there's no guarantee Google will list a site at all.<br>  <br>  You need to start promoting it now to get more traffic.  You need to get links in to your site, get people to tag it with social bookmarking sites, post your link in blogs and forums about poetry but don't spam.<br>  <br>  You could also try submitting poems and articles to article directories where you can put a link to your site at the bottom.  One of the most powerful is called Ezine Articles(link below) and you can get lots of visitors if you post articles or poems up there.<br>  <br>  Also google 'anchor text' as that's important too.<br>  Good luck and nice looking site :)|`|IcnER00baa	it takes 2-3 days if you have good contents in the blog|`|T1Si1yvlaa	up to a week, guaranteed.

You might see a prize, but you might not.<br>  <br>  There are sites out there that award real prizes, not pop-up tricks.

XZ4RcUHWaa	All 3 of my printers are HP.  They are very reliable.  I think only the expensive epson printers are good ($400+).|`|AA10820533	I would go with the HP.  The Epson are a ploy to get more money for ink.  i  love my HP and I have had many other brands before inc. Epson.  I found knock off ink refills for HP also at Walmart called NUKOTE and other places.  Checkout refill kits under that name too.  Will save lots of money.  Easy to do.|`|hV48lhvqaa	HP... for me it is the best choice of printer.|`|z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.

You're going to have to bite the bullet, learn programming, and write your stuff in something that's designed to do what you want.  I won't mention product names, but look at <a href="http://php.opensourcecms.com/" rel="nofollow">http://php.opensourcecms.com/</a> - it has most if the biggies, including "J" and "D".

HOq5Urn1aa	Dont remind me, Lsst year I tried out several internet security programs. including Trend Micro internet security. I wanted to uninstall it. I tried everything, but in the end I had to format my computer and completely reinstall window. It is not a problem for me, because I do that at least 5 times a yeare just for the fun of it.<br>  But that I had to do it because I could not uninstall a program did annoy me very much.<br>  <br>  What you could do is install Trend Micro agaiin completely.<br>  Then uninstall it with the help of this uninstaller<br>  <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com/</a><br>  <br>  Then run a scan with a registry cleaner.

It allows users to create websites via a visual editer or coding views then upload your website to a webserver.<br>  To create a website as big as the top names you will need to be able to program dynamic websites using a language like PHP.<br>  Setting up a home webserver is pretty easy though it will never be able to handle massive amounts of traffic so its best to buy a webserver from someone.<br>  Though if you want to set up a webserver I recomend using something like wampserver which installs and configures apache (web server),mysql (database) and PHP for windows.

qYfXHgzuaa	Well you may have trouble wth the boot loader - Microsoft generally wipes everything else off, messes it up bigtime.<br>  <br>  Really, you should not use internet with XP - it's best disabled, just keep XP for some essential applications maybe, for me that's the games - and your linux for everything else.<br>  <br>  If you know the name of your linux installation, then find the forums - they will tell you how to restore the grub/lilo or whatever bootloader you use. With Ubuntu, I made partitions on my 320GiB drive - 40GB for XP, then 50GiB for 'NTFS storage' (D: in XP - used for backups and sharing stuff in Virtualbox). So 90GB for windows NTFS filesystems - then another 40GB for a root partition, and 100GiB for my home partition - so if I reinstall Ubuntu, I don't lose my 'home' which has all my settings and stuff in it.<br>  <br>  If I do another install, I'll make a separate /etc partition, to further preserve settings/installation integrity between upgrades/reinstalls. I will install 64 bit next time there's a major release.<br>  <br>  To reinstall my GRUB loader, I boot the CD, then open a terminal (which is found by pressing 'ALT' and 'F2' and typing 'terminal')<br>  <br>  <br>      sudo grub<br>  <br>      > root (hd0,0)<br>  <br>      > setup (hd0)<br>  <br>      > exit<br>  <br>  Now remember, you can install AVG antivirus, and Avast also do a scanner, which install in linux - so you can use those to scan your XP partition. The best way to fix XP and to avoid having to do the whole painful reinstall is to simply take an image. You can do this with a boot disk (also linux) called 'Clonezilla Live' - very good, then you can just write the image back to the partition next time okay??|`|13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	just re-install offf the xp disk to the existing xp partition...it won't bother the linux partition unless you tell it to...or you delete the partition.|`|ChZQZXQ9aa	djfear12 nailed it solid info will work

However, in order to use PHP, you need to save that HTML file as a PHP file, use an editor to add in your PHP scripts, and upload it to a server with PHP installed.

And these web engines did not have any standard to follow, but just IE as example, and very little information from Microsoft.<br>  The result?<br>  - Seven web browser engines are powering ALL current browsers.<br>  - NONE follows FULLY the w3c recommendations.<br>  - All of them act differently to different tags, arguments, or CSS, EXCEPT for tables, where there is a perfect consensus on all browsers.<br>  - The <div> tag is, probably, the most unreliable of all, and the worst of all about <div> tags is AppleWebKit, that has not evolved since its creation (Chrome, Safari), which, in FACT, does not even defines the tag <div> in THEIR specifications!!!<br>  - Now, on top of dubious specs, W3C recommend the use of CSS!<br>  The browser engines have had no time to adapt.<br>  <br>  For the last two years, I have tried to get my sites to show exactly the same way on ALL browsers, using <div>'s.  I never managed it, unless I were to write code with browser detection, and a huge amount of "if then else" conditions to cater for all engines.<br>  <br>  Enough!<br>  <br>  I came back to tables.  I can now GUARANTEE that ALL my sites will LOOK and WORK the SAME way on ANY browser, at ANY resolution, even if, of course, they fail "Validation".<br>  <br>  In the end, what is the objective?  Valid and not working, or invalid and working?<br>  <br>  In 5 to 10 years, when there will be some real standard, I may come back to <div>'s, but not now: my clients want their sites to work NOW.<br>  <br>  And I don't care if anyone criticise me for using tables: my answer is that they do not know what they are talking about!

fQqAWGTgaa	If YOU think it is a good gaming computer, go ahead and buy it.<br>  <br>  You obviously know very little to nothing about picking a gaming computer, or even what all that info means.  For example, you cut and pasted it ALL in there, even the lines that tell you what the computer does NOT have.  Since we know that the system utilizes dedicated video memory, we did not need to know that also did NOT utilize shared video memory... look through there, and notice all the "no"s.  Everything that has a "no" after it, didn't need to be pasted.<br>  <br>  You didn't realize that... because you have very little knowledge about these things.  You can only buy something because someone ELSE recommended it.  You are incapable of forming an opinion, or learning and making an informed decision on your own.<br>  <br>  That's fine.  This brings me back to my original statement.  If you think it is a good gaming computer, then buy it.  If you have no idea what a good gaming computer is, you are going to be played for a sucker, and you are going to be sold something less than what you think you want... but as long as you BELIEVE you got a great deal, that is all that counts.<br>  <br>  So buy it.|`|55XTsmmFaa	Power supply needs to be more.. at least 750, and what's with the 9 gigs of ram?

Q9aufTNvaa	Obviously not. If Windows 7 does come out at that time, then why not buy a "Windows 7 Laptop" not a Vista one.|`|2wsw2gzgaa	Why, when after april you *should* get the RC of windows 7|`|2LbTrlQnaa	No.  Just as XP users never got any free upgrade Vista disk|`|fQqAWGTgaa	SO let me tell you a story.  A nice group of independent researchers decided to explore what has been offered by microsoft as Windows 7.<br>  <br>  They set it up, and did various things to it... like for example, they installed a legal copy of Adobe CS3 on the Windows 7 machine.  Then, to get rid of a nag screen, they replaced a DLL file with a cracked version.  Without any permission granted by the researchers, in fact without their knowledge beforehand, Windows allowed Adobe to install a third party program that verified and checked this DLL, THEN downloaded a crippled executable for each element of CS3, causing them not to function properly, and forcing the end user to have to re-install everything from scratch.<br>  <br>  This type of Draconian DRM control is out of control.  You want an OS that will disable cracked software, or one that will report you for violating copyright?  Have fun with Windows 7.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure Windows 7 is Real Pretty Looking.
7DpZgDCfaa	the light is a laser. it will hurt your eyes and damage them because when ever you look into something really bright, it damages your eyes. it wont burn out unless your mouse is broken or lacks power. the light is LED and the light reflects off the surface that it is placed on.

Windows has to create varies temp files to run, and the windows\temp folder is where they are created.<br>  <br>  If you were to delete that folder, Windows would probably crash.  Then on the reboot it would recreate the folder.<br>  <br>  Now the files WITHIN that folder are another issue.  There are things besides Windows itself that use that temp folder.  For example, if you install a program from the Internet, it will normally use that folder to copy the install files into before actually installing the program.  (It is a folder that the download can count on being there.)  <br>  <br>  Over time you may build up some files and installs in the folder that are not properly cleaned up by the installs.  You can normally delete files out of that folder without harming anything.  Or if the file is essential, Windows will not let you delete it.  <br>  <br>  So you can empty that folder so that it takes up no space on your hard drive, but you should not delete the folder.

It seems your neighbour looked up the instructions before you did, and decided to put a password on the network since nobody else had yet, to assure himself exclusive access to your network.<br>  <br>  First of all, get on Linksys' website and find the instructions for that sucker! :) Then, reset the router to its original settings. Next, using the browser-based configuration utility, set the network up again, but WITH your own password, and also change the password for the utility itself. Just because Windows users are spoiled doesn't mean anyone has the right to steal your network connection.

9ol07BpDaa	The express version doesn't really have that much to offer. You're basically stuck in the step sequencer screen, which means it's hard to do proper chords, notes etc. There's a lot more missing, you can see in the list.<br>  I originally bought the Fruity Edition, but the same week I had to upgrade to the Producer Edition because I really wanted to record audio (guitar, voice) with ASIO in recording, and I needed full piano roll and automation features.<br>  The XXL only makes sense if you really like Sytrus or Directwave, as these plugins are worth more than the $100 extra that XXL costs.<br>  <br>  You should try the demo version, and play around a bit and see what features you really want. Dig deep, make sure you don't get a version and then later find out it's lacking what you had in the demo (because that's basically the XXL version with saving disabled).<br>  <br>  I think the Producer Edition is best value for money, also since it includes the great Edison audio editor.<br>  <br>  In case you're going to buy online from Image-Line, you can use this promo link to get 10% discount on your purchase: <a href="https://support.image-line.com/jshop/shop.php?offer=Default&promo=BACJBAB469" rel="nofollow">https://support.image-line.com/jshop/sho...</a><br>  <br>  If you have more questions, feel free to send me an email

RAM upgrades are simple, and are the most "bang-for-your-buck" upgrades you can make to a computer, whether it is a Desktop or Laptop.<br>  <br>  Your laptop has 2 memory slots, 1 of which is currently occupied by a single 1GB module.  RAM speed does not matter in this case, as it is based on the bus speed of the rest of your system.  Crucial Memory has a Memory Configurator which shows the compatible memory for your system.  This page answers many common questions you may have about the upgrade, and you can buy it directly from that site.<br>  ***SEE LINK BELOW***<br>  <br>  Toshiba has user guides posted on their website, which contain the specific instructions you need for updating your RAM.<br>  <br>  *Do NOT use the quotes in any of these steps... quotes are used only to specify certain phrases/words:<br>  <br>  1 - Open www.toshiba.com<br>  2 - On the left, under US Services & Support, choose 'Laptop Computers', and click GO<br>  3 - In the upper-right, enter 'A200' in the search box, and click the Search button (>)<br>  4 - At the top, change All Products to 'Satellite', and All Documents to 'User Guides', and click Search<br>  5 - The 2nd link takes you to page 1 of your User Guide in PDF format.  This should automatically launch within your browser.<br>  6 - On the left, click the link to jump to the "Adding Memory (Optional)"  page.  This gives step-by-step instructions (with pictures) for replacing or upgrading your RAM memory modules.<br>  <br>  Since these instructions are included in the User Guide for your laptop, this indicates that it will NOT void your warranty.<br>  <br>  If you have further questions, contact Toshiba Support at 800-457-7777.

The first thing you should do is try to boot into safe mode.  In order to do that, I believe that the key that you would have to press when the system first turns on is f8.  At least thats how it is on a dell machine.  Once you are in safe mode, then you should run a system restore and restore it to a time when the computer was functioning properly.   Just try to go into safe mode and then report back here if you get the same problem.  Worst comes to worst, it would be inevitable to rreformat your hard drive.  Now days, most computers come with a recovery disk that would revert your computer back to its original settings.  First try to see if it works in safe mode.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  3. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  4. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  5. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  6. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #1 and #2.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Avast: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast-compare-home-professional.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast-compare-h...</a> <br>  AntiVir: <a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/products/1/avira_antivir_personal__free_antivirus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com/en/products/1/avi...</a>   <br>  AVG: <a href="http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...</a><br>  <br>  Use only one.<br>  AVG is widely popular but isn't the best, lowish detection rates, update problems and no protection against rootkits.<br>  AntiVir has excellent detection rates, suffers from false-positives and update problems, no protection against spyware.<br>  Avast is pretty problem free, good detection rates, protects against viruses, spyware, trojans, rootkits, etc.<br>  Also Comodo AV and Clamwin, but not really tested out well.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	<a href="http://www.download.com/windows/security-software/most-popular/3101-2023_4-0.html?tag=mncol" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/windows/security...</a>|`|i9PhENN6aa	Pick one...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/software/antivirus/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/software/antivi...</a>|`|2LbTrlQnaa	No need to shout!<br>  <a href="http://majorgeeks.com/Avast_Home_Edition_d1968.html" rel="nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/Avast_Home_Edition...</a>|`|t7sUZQvFaa	How to kill viruses for free with no strings attached?<br>  There's a myth going around that if you play on the internet you have to pay for expensive security programs!

They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before!

Go into WMM and click on Capture From Video Device.  You must have your camcorder plugged into your computer and put on the Play setting.  You'll need a USB cable to plug into your computer, and the other end goes in the front of your camera.  It won't fit into any other place except the right one.  Keep clicking NEXT until you see the screen that has START CAPTURE on it.  Remember to note where the video is being saved on your hard drive.  Click on START CAPTURE and it should start your camera playing your tape automatically.  You'll see it playing in the little square on the right of the screen.  After that, go back to the beginning of WMM, and IMPORT THE VIDEO from where it was saved when you Captured it on the hard drive. Then you can begin editing it with the special effects given on WMM.  Good luck, I hope this helps.

Right click My Computer -> properties, Hardware tab, then Device Manager. Under "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click and "Disable" all the Host Controllers. There is a huge downside to this strategy, as anyone with Administrator-level access who understands Device Manager can restore functionality.<br>  <br>  - On bootup, enter BIOS setup. There should be an option somewhere to disable the onboard USB controllers. If your motherboard supports password-protecting BIOS setup, then it would be extremely hard to circumvent. The only way to re-enable would be to physically open the computer case and reset the CMOS battery. If your computer case can be padlocked closed in the back, then it would require both lockpicking and knowledge of how to reset the BIOS settings to circumvent.<br>  <br>  - If you're interested in simply disabling USB ports on the front of the case, you could just disconnect the wire connecting the USB port assembly on the front of the case to the motherboard header.<br>  <br>  - Another possibility, which might be the most elegant, is to use a utility like USBDLM (link below in sources). It has a feature that lets you reserve certain drive letters, preventing Windows from mounting any new drives on those paths. If you were to reserve every possible free drive letter (E->Z if you have only a hard drive as C and maybe a cd-rom as D), then USB drives wouldn't mount at all, but all your existing USB functionality (printers, scanners, input devices, etc.) wouldn't be affected at all.|`|7DpZgDCfaa	Go to <br>  Start ---> Run ---> devmgmt.msc ---> OK <br>  <br>  This opens your device manager or known as hardware manager.<br>  Near the bottom, you file universal serial bus controllers.

This in the Control Panel on WIndows XP and in "network and sharing center" on Vista.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a router you should buy a simple network cable - but make sure you buy one called a "crossover" or "x-over" cable. This will allow you to plug one end into each network card and will directly connect the two machines.<br>  <br>  A simple way to enable a network with a crossover cable is to set up "internet connection sharing" on one of the PCs - this will take care of all the network address issues - even if you don't actually plan to share the internet this way. Otherwise you will need to set static IP addresses in the TCP/IP properties of each network card.<br>  <br>  Static IP address should be:<br>  <br>  PC #1.<br>  IP Address: 192.168.0.1<br>  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br>  Default Gateway - leave blank<br>  DNS Server - Leave blank<br>  <br>  PC #2.<br>  IP Address: 192.168.0.2<br>  Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0<br>  Default Gateway - leave blank<br>  DNS Server - Leave blank|`|mjSnBgyxaa	Let me tell you that Vista Computer and XP Laptop are ridiculous things to say. Vista and XP are different version of Microsoft Windows i.e. an operating system related to software while your cd drive is a hardware part of your computer. Same CD drive can be used with either Vista or XP.<br>  Add your CD drive to your laptop if it is possible because the structure of CD drive may be different for PC and Laptop. And PC's CD drive may not be fitted in Laptop's slot for CD Drive.<br>  And if both of your computer is interconnected then you can use one's drive from other. No need to replacement.

MxculX2Daa	If an image is 2 X 3 at 300 DPI that means it only contains 600 X 900 pixels. That is all the image data it contains. Period.<br>  <br>  If you convert that to a 6ft X 10Ft banner then each of those pixels is going to end up being pretty large because you will still only have 600 X 900 pixels of image to work with.<br>  <br>  If you printed that image on "photo" setting on an inkjet printer at full resolution of say 2400 DPI then it would occupy one third of an inch by one quarter of an inch. So how good do you think that could look at 6ft X 10ft?<br>  <br>  It will look OK from a distance - but close-up will look VERY pixellated. The higher the resolution of the image, the better it will look when blown up large. Even with all the image conversion software in the world it cannot add extra image data that isn't there.<br>  <br>  Choose an image with more pixels in it for blowing up that large.

gOOxQKNAaa	There's something very strange with the way you type. Normally one's fingers are the only things touching the keyboard, and the wrist is on the table. The edge of my wrist is at least 1-2 inches away from any of the keys. The keys are there because they are important, not to get in your way. <br>  <br>  Also try pressing (ctrl + z), which is a pretty standard "undo" command in case you accidentally erase something.|`|Syvig9Q9aa	I would buy a mac (they're not as bad as you may have been lead to believe).<br>  <br>  Failing that, I would buy a new keyboard.<br>  <br>  The key combination you are probably hitting is Ctrl-A.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/Coffeehouse/96881-Disable-Ctrl-Keys/" rel="nofollow">http://channel9.msdn.com/forums/Coffeeho...</a><br>  <br>  This forum discusses disabling of the key by modifying the registry with a (linked, free) program.

hexzaIGgaa	Unless you know what the Tjmax value is, the best you can do is measure Distance to Tjmax, which will be constant regardless of what Tjmax value you use. Keep this value Higher than 20-30C under 100% load...and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Frankly, nobody really knows what Tjmax values are for any given CPU...too much variation, even chip to chip in the same family. Also, Tjmax is subject to variation. And, for many CPUs, the temp sensors themselves are notoriously awful...one need only look at the early E8400 and Q9450s...or just about any Intel 45nm CPU...to verify that.<br>  <br>  BIOS CPU temps and "actual" core temps are meaningless.<br>  <br>  Use a good temp program, like RealTemp 3.00 or CoreTemp...and only look at the Distance to Tjmax values. Keep them no lower than 20-30C.<br>  <br>  AMD chips are notorious for being "heat engines." It might be a good idea to look at an Arctic Cooler Freezer Pro or a Zalman, but it isn't necessary, unless you are going to get crazy with the OC.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you are not OCing, you should not have any problems.<br>  <br>  My best advice, having built computers since my IMSAI 8080, is TURN OFF THE TEMP SENSORS. The CPU will throttle and shut down long before you do damage. If you OC, which is usually not too smart for the average user, you will need to keep an eye on things...running PRIME95, Small FFT, until you know where your temp. will top out.<br>  <br>  Anyway, a lot of the claims you see for temps. are bullcrap anyway. Remember, core temp. (on air) will ALWAYS be between 7-10C HIGHER than ambient temp. Unless you see someone operating a CPU in a freezer, disregard temps that seem unreal low at idle. I always just laugh when I see people post that their chip runs at 19C. LMMFAO!<br>  <br>  My E8600, running in a warm room (about 76F) is running this web site and 50% BOINC...it is showing an indicated 45/49C. More importantly, the distance to Tjmax is showing 55/51...with Tjmax set at a "realistic" 100C.<br>  <br>  My Q9650 is running 53/53/54/54...or distance to Tjmax of 47/47/46/46, with Tjmax at 100C. Also running BOINC @ 50%.<br>  <br>  If you are still nervous, set your shut down at whatever temp. you feel comfortable with...BUT REMEMBER...the BIOS is reporting Tcase, NOT Tjmax!|`|eTLG23N4aa	It all depends on where you are getting those temps from and what your computer is doing at the time. That temp is not extremely high but i wonder how hot it gets when it's under a little stress.|`|azaMkJijaa	No, that is fine. My processor runs at around that. But, just so you don't fry the motherboard and processor, go into the BIOS and tell it to automatically shut down after it gets to 80C and above (if you haven't done that already).|`|Yuk9ZAIOaa	no, that is normal<br>  i don't like running mine over 70 degrees Celsius.<br>  factory bios settings usually shut the computer down at 90 degrees Celsius.|`|Pxkqq8r2aa	if its running at 100% load and has been for some thime then thats a safe temp. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPUSideBySide.aspx?id=42&id=43&id=44&id=45" rel="nofollow">http://products.amd.com/en-us/DesktopCPU...</a>|`|20ic35A6aa	of coarse it is! that's 122 degrees Fahrenheit! turn off the computer make sure its' fan is working properly
ERfL13kFaa	Microsoft word 2007 utilizes a new format for word documents .docx this format is much smaller than the previous .doc version. Because of this many students using previous versions of word or other older word processing programs will become increasingly frustrated when they are not able to open .docx documents. <br>  <br>  This frustration will lead many of them to internet piracy and open source software such as open office, which will open up a new world of free media, and new communities which will help these students for years to come.|`|c754607fb534cb5b16a4e272222201f3aa	it doesn't<br>  im used to 2003 word, which for me is much better and 2007 only makes tools harder to find, and complicates things.<br>  for example, i was typing a report and there was no automatic spell-checker on it, its shite.|`|6M1h1raMaa	I love it.

0wUwKbHsaa	So Putty is a telnet/ssh client.  You do not program "on putty".  UNIX is an operating system on which you can write scripts.  To connect to UNIX generally you use a telnet/ssh client.  Thus, what you need is to learn to program in UNIX. <br>  <br>  First you need to find out what shell you will program in on UNIX and what flavor of UNIX (AIX, HP, SunOS, Linux, etc.) you are using.  They do have their differences although minor.  I have given you a link to a tutorial for the Bourne Shell.

However you can invite others to your conversation by looking on the toolbar of the conversation and clicking the button that is a person and a 'plus' symbol. <br>  <br>  They can also invite you to other conversations. But dont worry, each conversation is private, only between you and the other people in that conversation, no one can join without being asked. If you look along the side of the conversation window, you will see each person in the conversation and their display pictures.<br>  <br>  Have fun with MSN, its great.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	they can still talk to u. they can have infinite conversations going|`|njHgfl99aa	They can talk to different people simultaneously so it is okay for you to talk to them if they are already talking to someone else. :)
AA12351337	Most you want to leave alone.  If you don't know what it is, and/or it says SYSTEM next to it, leave it.  Some programs, like messenger's, music player's, and programs like that will start up.  Those would be OK to end as long as your not using them, and another program isn't using them.  But in that case, you can go into the program's options and disable 'Launch on Startup.'<br>  Instances that are running like Explorer.exe, svchost.exe, and System Idle Process are needed for the computer to run right.  In most cases, you can simply restart these within the computer.  Explorer.exe can be started from the task manager's 'New Task..." option without restarting or doing much of anything.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	It wont hurt to turn them off. Some things may stop working. The worst that can happen id\s you will have to reboot. You would use less processor and memory with less stuff running in the background|`|Qj53gkswaa	Ending programs that you are not using is very useful. But, do not end programs that you do not know of, like Explorer. Explorer is your whole desktop, and if you end that then you will not have your desktop, and will have to restart your computer for it back up. All-in-all ending programs that you are not using will make the overall performance of the machine greater, and more stable. Also, you can disable these programs from starting automatically when you turn on your computer.
scLagxRwaa	1. Tell Ubuntu to allow remote desktop connections. Make sure to password protect logins, and allow controlling the desktop. From memory this is in System - Preferences - Remote Desktop. The password can only be eight characters, so make them random for best security.<br>  2. Set up port forwarding on the network that has Ubuntu on it. This means that you'll log into your router and tell it to let port 5900 pass through onto the internet. There are tutorials on how to do this based on your router manufacturer, and the process is called port forwarding.<br>  3. Install the open source version of RealVNC for your Windows Client. <br>  4. Put in the IP for the Ubuntu computer, and it'll prompt you for a password. Enter it.<br>  5. Enjoy!

Hopefully your images are all at the same resolution, or when you add them to the document, they may change size, either larger or smaller depending on the relative resolutions (if you are bringing in low res images into a higher res document, they will shrink, and the reverse is also true).<br>  <br>  Open each of your pictures that you'd like to bring into the main document. With each one, hit ctrl (command on a Mac) +A to Select All. You should see the "marching ants" around the border of the image. Now go to your tools palette, and up at the top is the Move tool, which looks sort of like a cross with an arrowhead next to it. Click on it, and then click and drag the photo onto the main document. This will place a copy of the photo in the main document, on its own layer. Repeat this with each photo you want to bring together in the main document. Once you have all the images in, go to File>Save and save it as a Photoshop (.psd) file. This keeps all the layers in the image.<br>  <br>  To manipulate each photo, move it to a different position or whatever, click on its layer in layer palette and with the Selection tool, you can move it around within its layer. You will have to go to the layers palette each time to select a different layer, but because each image is on its own layer, you can easily position it.<br>  <br>  If you need to make the canvas bigger, go to the Image menu and select Canvas>Canvas size. This will give you a dialog box that will allow you to enlarge the canvas.<br>  <br>  When you have everything together the way you want, you can go to Layer>Merge layer or Merge down. Then go to File>Save As and save the image, probably as a jpeg if you are intending to post it to website or share it. Rename it appropriately (whatever works for you, there are no rules here), and hit Save. Now you will have a flattened file with all the photos put together as one image, but you will still have your original unflattened image so if you want to go back and make changes to each layer you can.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|z7FEj9QSaa	Copy the photo and then paste it into one project each photo on a seperate layer|`|e1L43cREaa	you will also probably need to make your canvas bigger by going to<br>  Image>Canvas Size<br>  Make the dimensions bigger.<br>  Then, another way to import them would be to go to File>Place.  Then you can navigate to where you saved the pictures and it will put them on separate layers.

(Turtle Beach makes about the best USB sound "Cards".)   In a desktop I'd just replace the card.  (If it's part of the motherboard, you can disable it, usually in the BIOS.  Then plug your new card in.

If you use firefox there is an addon for creating a temporary email address specifically for this kind of thing.

Try putting your computer in sleep mode.

tOCESHLYaa	I used Kaspersky anti-virus, Kaspersky Internet Security 2009, and just got finish beta testing Kaspersky protection for workstations. I like Kaspersky, it allows users to tweak every setting. The program has very strong protection and never failed while on my computer. The problem I had with the Internet Security suite was that it slowed down my web surfing. This was a know issue with Kaspersky at the time. When testing the Kaspersky for workstations I did not have any problem with web surfing so it appears they fixed that. The other problem I had with the Internet suit and the Beta Kaspersky is it would block know good site on the internet. I could go into setting and fix that but it was a lot of work to have to allow good web sites.I don't know if it was an issue with a program on my computer or not. I just gave up after awhile. Not counting the two issues I had It was one of the better security programs I have used.|`|KLt8LAoaaa	I have it.  It's an extremely good and capable program, BUT it's a little intrusive with the level of control it assumes over your computer.

ja1NsNL1aa	A VB For loop looks like<br>  <br>  For i = 1 to 10<br>   (statements)<br>  Next i<br>  <br>  Where i is called the loop index, or loop variable or loop counter: the group of statements will be executed 10 times, and each time through the loop is called a pass.<br>  <br>  The loop variable is often used in statements where one value changes each pass though the loop, and the loop variable is often fashioned to suit conditions more closely<br>  <br>  For instance in your application, the cells change form column3 to column 6 while the row remains constant (=3)<br>  <br>  To place the column value in each of the cells using a loop: note the range of the index from 3 to 6<br>  <br>  For col=3 to 6<br>    Cells(3,col)=col? ? ' output goes to spread sheet cell row 3, col3 first ie C3<br>  Next col<br>  <br>  The random function in VBA is called Rnd<br>  <br>  The function generates a "random" number between 0 and 0.9999999...<br>  <br>  So to generate a (pseudo-)random sequence of numbers there has to be an upper and lower limit<br>  <br>  Just RN = Rnd(10) gives a number between 0 and 9.99999<br>  <br>  Most programmers will explicitly remove the decimal portion with the Int function<br>  <br>  Between 1 and 10: RN = Int(Rnd(10)) + 1<br>  Between 20 and 30: RN + Int(Rnd(11)) + 10<br>  Between Upper an Lower: RN = Int(Rnd(Upper-Lowe+1))+1<br>  <br>  Each time you run a program, the same random sequence will re-appear: to make it different each time, add the statement<br>  <br>  Randomize <br>  <br>  at the beginning of your program|`|RSzTOkZhaa	A For loop is used when you want to execute a line of code for a set number of times.<br>  <br>  Dim Counter As Integer                   'declares a variable called Counter <br>  For Counter = 1 to 5                     ' starts loop to execute 5 times<br>  Print "hello"                                   'instruction to be executed 5 times<br>  Next Counter                                 ' ends loop<br>  <br>  The result of this would be <br>  hello<br>  hello<br>  hello<br>  hello<br>  hello<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
TMOlF4t9aa	You can't change the video card on the laptop because video card is attach to the motherboard.|`|DEKgpEwxaa	I dont think you need a video card on your laptop.It has an onboard video card.You just have to make sure the video card drivers arent corrupted otherwise go to the sony site and download them.Its free.Unless your laptop is a gaming or highend one, most laptops have onboard video cards.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	I don't know of anyone who builds a laptop with a video card. The geek-squad might be able to put one in for you or you can buy a laptop from Cyberpower,Inc. with a video card in it. Most laptops come with shared video ram that usually maxes out at 128mb. You can sell your old laptop for what you can and buy one from Cyberpower. I bought my last 2 pc's from them and they are very good.
wUqeZl3Saa	The most common "hacker" trick is simply guessing the actual password. Are you sure you never told anyone your password? Was it a good password at least 10 characters and mostly random or was it simply a word?<br>  <br>  Check your system for Trojans and key loggers since that is another method that a number of people have been getting hacked. The only cure here is stop visiting bad web pages and do more frequent malware scans.<br>  <br>  You need a minimum of 10 random or at least random appearing characters including upper and lower case if they are different. Best is actually around 14 characters just to stop internet password attacks. If it protects something more valuable where the attack can proceed much more quickly then it should be roughly double that.<br>  <br>  For offline security where the attacker may actually have a copy of the encrypted password such as the password file in various operating systems, you should regularly change your password. For online accounts where the attacker doesn't have access to the encrypted password, then changing your password won't matter as much.<br>  <br>  The sad truth for many of the "My <insert account type> got hacked" wasn't that it was hacked. It was usually the owner of the account who gave away the password, used a very weak password or one that was easy to guess.<br>  <br>  The only cure is stronger passwords and better security practices. Never tell anyone your password(s). Write your passwords down, but keep them in a secure place away from your computer and your desk. The classic is the sticky note on the monitor and not far behind it is the scrap of paper under the desk pad.<br>  <br>  With good habits, you should never have this problem again.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Probably not. The event causing most people to complain about this stems from an bounced e-mail message claiming that you sent some unknown third party a virus or spam.<br>  <br>  Even so, it does not hurt to change your e-mail password as suggested by the first answer.<br>  <br>  For details, see Wikipedia.|`|s6uZBFmQaa	Obviously someone had to know your username and password. they could have know your email and just guessed your password. what i recommend is that you change your password constantly.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Go to the computer manufacturer's site and look for service, support, download or something similar.  Then find her computer model, and look for the XP driver for the video card.  (Vista drivers won't work on XP and vice-versa.)  While you're there you should actually download all the drivers and save them to a CD.<br>  <br>  Some manufacturers have a modified version of a piece of hardware, so the generic driver from the hardware manufacturer (the video card manufacturer, in this case) won't work very well, or at all.|`|vF2rwFeYaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Sounds like you may have accidently unistalled the Video Card drivers during your add/remove session.<br>  <br>  Just reinstall the video card drivers and reboot PC then you'll be able to reset resolution to your preference.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  TgTips|`|txC0y4BXaa	You probably deleted your video card drivers by accident.

tOCESHLYaa	I would do a scan with Norton and find the threat and remove it. Norton does not pop up every 30 seconds for no reason. You need to find out what is going on with your computer. If you uninstall with a active threat there's no telling how deep it will dig into you system. I think you should update Norton and then do a safe mode scan.|`|IGu4bx51aa	If it is telling you your computer is infected and you keep ignoring Then you can't blame it if it keeps reminding you Follow the advice and let it remove the infection<br>  <br>  edit <br>  I am presuming you have Norton installed btw You don't make this clear|`|CZi5BbJDaa	yeah like everyone else has said install AVG, it is the best there is.<br>  <br>  here is a quick link to the top 3 free anti-virus packages including AVG: <a href="http://kapcom.com.au/index.php?id=15" rel="nofollow">http://kapcom.com.au/index.php?id=15</a>|`|vBdNIfjaaa	Its sounds like you may have viruses, contact technical support, try Unlimited Technical Support, 1.888.297.1020 www.unlimitedtechnicalsupport.com they can remotely access your computer and fix your viruses issues. issues.|`|KGG783Seaa	The thing popping up is a virus, try AVG or Spybot because tif you kepp clikking it your ******

G25nAFeraa	Was he playing with wi-fi networking?<br>  <br>  Everything is possible... even this:<br>  <br>  quote: question/travel/me<br>  <br>  I always use mobile internet on my ways, but not for play. I need info on 'prepaid coverage'?<br>  What mobile network in YOUR country is giving prepaid internet access? (i.e. umts, hsdpa, gprs, edge > with usb modem+sim and laptop). I travel many countries every a while, any country plays for the question! On most websites they don't clearly state what we need. Some countries now have such mobile providers with same services prepaid or rechargeable way. If you travel to Australia you can now web'n'walk prepaid via Optus. SIM card and modem was 148 au. dollars month ago, 2GB data included. Later you buy only recharge vouchers, for instance 2GB for 40$. No worries if you are temporary visitor only. This is good.<br>  p.s.<br>  I am sick of roaming! Last year my home provider took me 2300 euro for 220 MB via roaming. Not a typing mistake it is two thousand three hundred euro for 220 MB...no doubt on 220MB! If you come to Europe, avoid "GROUP", otherwise it will cost you a lot. I failed to understand what tricks they use. I have trusted fair play and money was paid via bank while I was away. The "group" is this >> <br>  "The mobilkom austria group includes the mobile communications providers mobilkom austria, Mobiltel in Bulgaria, Velcom in Belarus, Vipnet in Croatia, Si.mobil in Slovenia, mobilkom liechtenstein, Vip mobile in Serbia and Vip operator in Macedonia."<br>  <br>  The group declares to be Vodafone partner. Who is who, here in this group don't know. Owner is probably Austria, but by that time I was registerred with Vipnet, Croatia as user of mobile broadband. Data of 220MB - done via Vodafone Australia.<br>  <br>  (Never been cheated this way... as for my first question, your answers are allowed to my yahoo e-mail, also). rgds/yall!<br>  <br>  unquote/me|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	so the isp is charging by the amount of usage?

IFljAYPSaa	Create separate layers for each letter or word. Overlay them however you want them. Then change the opacity for each letter or word. It will give it the same effect that is in the picture

AA12351337	Money.<br>  The one partner that I know of makes a 6 figure salary out of it.<br>  It's as easy as just 'becoming a partner.'<br>  Partners have a lot of subscribers and views.  Youtube puts ads on the video's, so if you don't have enough view's to make it worth Youtube's time, they won't take you as a partner.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I say add her.|`|283JrACKaa	u never knw if its a guy or a girl. some retarded men out there pretends to b girls on internet so girls will add them so no.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Go for it, it's not like your asking her out or anything, it's just facebook.|`|ftqiciLpaa	I would do it, if you feel you can't talk to her in person or don't have anything to talk about in person just add her and send her messages and then you have time to think on what you're saying and next time you see her you can both talk about what you guys were talking last time on the computer. good luck with her|`|mhp7JKMNaa	NO NOT YET!<br>  <br>  Talk to her ONE more time, like a 30 second conversation will do.<br>  <br>  Wait a few days for her to add you,<br>  <br>  if she doesn't, than add her.<br>  <br>  The worst thing she can do is deny you.|`|Q79IWCBxaa	yup|`|03b5f9141419ea0eae2aa5d9d3ea728baa	Yeah add her. People add everyone these days. She won't think anything about it.|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Yeah, sure.|`|S1cEi63Qaa	No.|`|KcAehrrKaa	It's up to you.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	sure, why not, when i used to have a facebook, guys who i knew but didn't really talk at all added me and i didn't mind, i was flattered actually.|`|vhuqAqNdaa	no, its seems desperate, actually talk to her first!!<br>  you could just poke her, but then she would know you where looking for her!|`|UXarq5Tdaa	yes add her thats what facebook is for durrr|`|QcnzF6Lhaa	no, sounds stalkerish.|`|r3PgrJhDaa	yes do it! :)<br>  get to know her better, become her friend, and maybe even more as time goes on ;)|`|UDGBrOqaaa	Should you go to the toilet when you have a need?|`|ih2RV0pJaa	I see no problem with it.<br>  Since you have had proper conversations with her, you could easily add her with a message 'Hey, i can't believe i found you on fb! now we can finally get to know each other better' :P<br>  <br>  give it a shot, :)|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	y not lifes to short to worry.<br>  <br>  :D|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	if you have lots of friends on facebook then add her, it wont look like you were adding her because you like her (if you dont want her to find out just yet). or even if you dont have loads of friends on there add her anyway, she'll be pleased :)|`|M2x4rYglaa	sure|`|na0d9uRqaa	go for it a lot of people start theyre relationships on facebook<br>  gooooood luck :)|`|yA5fUf5laa	sure, you know her go ahead|`|jfhGYc8Saa	well, if you do talk at work. Then i guess u could add her on facebook and that way you could get to know her better.|`|oesAfUUGaa	go for it if she seems nice and like to be her friend|`|wHnhj9ckaa	blessssssssss u child. u shouldddd girl like that|`|SqAsjK0Qaa	I would talk to the person in real life first before doing the online thing.|`|BQsPZZfYaa	The definition of "friend" on the Internet is not the same as in real life. If you want to say something, just add her.|`|rFg9Ef86aa	add: add: add|`|JGppUccmaa	Yeah, it's always better to start conversations online than in person.|`|ubZpZ8HUaa	add her get 2 kno her better|`|ed05ZIrsaa	If I were you, nxt time you talk to her direct the conversation to online stuff. Mention that, "yeah, I have facebook/myspace etc.", and then say, "hey, you should look me up some time" and give her your email. <br>  <br>  Let her add you my brotha...<br>  <br>  Chicks don't dig the guy who is admiring her from a far distance. (and I know this cause I'm a girl) <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you are just wanting to become her friend and really don't care about hooking up, then you could add her I guess. But be aware! she might think you are stalking her, lol.|`|af0lmUtqaa	i think you should, coz it you want to get to know her more, facebook and emails and myspace will connect you guys more. but also make sure not everything is over the internet, talk to her in person more, start a conversation not work related. when you add her leave her a little note saying hi its .... from .... or something like that.|`|7bc405a5d2988f3fe96e658b173163e4aa	Yeah, but don't overplay the significance of doing so. I've probably got 20 "friends" that I don't even know on Facebook. If you like this girl, you need to find some common ground in real life and avoid hiding behind the interweb. Talking about work is a good start, it gets the conversation going. From there have the courage to change the subject. Get her talking by asking questions without a yes or no answer.|`|1AOwQZ9naa	sure. facebook is a pretty safe site... so i don't think she's really going to go around stalking you. lol. you should add her and try to get to know her better. she could turn out to be a really cool person|`|GShZGGfbaa	Work on your relationship in person a little better. If things seem to be going better, go for it. Be cautious of what you may find.|`|R25TCvfEaa	yes|`|dY0MfOusaa	the worst that can happen is she accepts and then you find out shes phyco go ahead add her you can always delete here later|`|s0MXkoUMaa	YES!!!! U MAY REGRET U DIDNT ONE DAY|`|0ixYCtKjaa	I guess it depends on how much you want to get to know her..<br>  I'm sure if SHE wants to talk to YOU then yeah :) goodluck.|`|oTXSx60Gaa	If it makes it easier for you to talk to her, why not? I don't think she'll mind. :)|`|cI043f79aa	yeah<br>  go for it<br>  i added this girl from my school on msn and myspace<br>  and we became best friends<br>  and we almost went out with eachother :)|`|pn3gYrdmaa	talk to her get to know he but like a friend<br>  it works|`|iQMf96Wpaa	No, she might end up hacking your account and no longer you will have it|`|pH0Imp3Jaa	Go for it mate there is nothing to lose good luck|`|sp1TB35Kaa	Sure. The worst she can do to you is decline.

Z0lEv4Dzaa	If you need to use an If-Else inside a Case's body. Or if you need need to make decisions on a certain case.<br>  <br>  Example: <br>  <br>  #include <iostream.h><br>  #include <conio.h><br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  <br>  int opselect;<br>  double fnum,snum;<br>  <br>  cout <<"Please type in two numbers\nseparated by a space: ";<br>  cin  >> fnum >> snum;<br>  cout <<"ENTER A SELECT CODE"<<endl;<br>  cout <<"      1.) for addition"<<endl<br>         <<"      2.) for multiplication" <<endl<br>         <<"      3.) for division" <<endl;<br>  cout <<"Number Please: ";<br>  cin  >> opselect;<br>  <br>  switch(opselect)<br>  {<br>  case 1:<br>  cout <<"Sum of entered number is "<<(fnum + snum)<<endl;<br>  break;<br>  <br>  case 2:<br>  cout <<"Product of the entered number is"<<(fnum*snum)<<endl;<br>  break;<br>  case 3:<br>  <br>  if (snum == 0)<br>  cout <<"Division by zero is not allowed!" <<endl;<br>  else<br>  cout <<"First number divided by second number is "  <br>       <<(fnum/snum) <<endl;<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  //See case's 3 body.<br>  <br>  Actually its really an option on whether to use If-Else or Case and Switch. But there are cases like this that you will need to use IF-Else inside a Case.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5818875405c291188cb55036ce5d4433aa	switch statements must have numeric cases such as 0 1 2 3 4 5<br>  <br>  <br>  where if statements are execute on true or false for more complicated than simple case 1 case 2 case 3 statements<br>  <br>  whichever one u code less will probabaly be better,,, <br>  <br>  less lines of code equivilance to more efficiency|`|IFljAYPSaa	The best answer that I can give is that if you can use less code to do the same scenario with switch statements than multiple if statements then you should use the switch statement. In coding it is important to minimize the amount of code that goes into your programs. This will save you time and make your code less complex.|`|d3a1acb6dddaaa183dcce1f33485305faa	If you have multiple values that you are checking and multiple outputs that you want to display that's when you want to use a switch statement.  Also it eliminates the amount of typing you need to do.|`|RSzTOkZhaa	When the IF conditions become nested inside one another and it gets overly complicated.<br>  try to simplify your code as much as possible and avoid using Ifs in situations where there are  lots of possibilities.|`|0wUwKbHsaa	Always.
Z0lEv4Dzaa	Nothing. Its still fine. In a switch-case statement, Cases and defaults are the choices or the match of a number or character user input. In case you didn't include a default statement, the program will still run without errors. It depends of what your program does.<br>  <br>  Let's say A user is to input any numbers from 1-3.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  #include<iostream.h><br>  #include<conio.h><br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  <br>  int num;<br>  cout <<"Please enter number[1-3]: ";<br>  cin  >>num;<br>  <br>  switch(num)<br>  {<br>  case 1:<br>  cout <<"ONE\n";<br>  break;<br>  case 2:<br>  cout <<"TWO\n";<br>  break;<br>  case 3:<br>  cout <<"THREE\n";<br>  break;<br>  <br>  default:<br>  cout <<"Invalid! Please enter a number from 1-3 only.\n";<br>  break;<br>  }<br>  <br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  If you will not include the default statement in the program above, the program will still run without errors but will accept any numbers beyond 1-3 which is not in the choices that we don't want to happen. That's why we use default statement to block any other invalid inputs which are not available in our cases.<br>  <br>  Try to enter 5 and the default message will appear. Its simply because our (cases or choices) doesn't have any "case 5"<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck Christine!|`|0wUwKbHsaa	Well you will not catch whatever case that does not meet any of your case statements.  The default statement is there so that you do not miss any event.  Let us say that your case statement checks to see if a variable contains either the number 1, 2, or 3.  Well what happens if that variable contains a 4?  Generally, you would catch that error or outlier in the default statement.  If you do not have it then you will continue without doing anything.  This may be desirable and it may not be desirable.  Depends on your code.|`|AIvUIn1baa	Usually the default is used to catch invalid data.  If there is no risk of a user entering bad data that will cause errors, then nothing.  If you are expecting an a to c for menu options, as an example, and they enter d, the program will continue on its way possibly giving erroneous results.  There are some texbooks that strongly discourage the use of switch statements, but I always thought they filled a role.
bAUO9Yhdaa	The flow of the program continues to the beginning of the next case.<br>  <br>  switch(x) {<br>  case 0:<br>  // code 1<br>  case 1:<br>  // code 2<br>  break;<br>  default:<br>  // default code<br>  }<br>  <br>  In this example if x = 0 then code 1 will run then the flow will "fall through" to code 2. The break in case 1 stops the flow from continuing on to default.|`|AA11779483	varies by language, but in some, the code in the next case(s) is executed, until a break, or the endcase, is encountered.  This could be just what you want it to do ... or not.

When the Display Properties window pops up, go to Settings tab.  There should be 2 monitors on the display labeled 1 & 2.  Click on the #2 window and below that you should see a box that says, "Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor".  Check that off and click on Apply.  Your two screens should come up as one large screen that's extended from one screen to the other.  You should be able to slide your mouse over from one screen to the other.  If that's set up properly, you should be able to call up separate applications on either screen.

ewbuVeTTaa	Taking the drive out of the PC and installing it in a new one is possible. Any computer store should be able to do this  for not a lot of money. It's also easy to do yourself, one way is to get what's call a USB hard drive enclosure. You would have to know what type of drive you have, an IDE, also known as ATA or a SATA hard drive. If you open the computer casing the type of cable connecting the drive to the motherboard should tell you right away. If its flat, wide, ribbon cable, then you likely have a IDE/ATA hard drive, if its a small, narrow cable with a black connector and the end of it is like an L at 90o,  you have a SATA.  <br>  <br>  Once you determine what cable you have, you go buy the right drive enclosure, disconnect and remove the hard drive from the old PC. place and connect in the enclosure, close the enclosure, connect the USB cable to the back of the enclosure, connect the other end to the PC, turn the enclosure on and it should install the drivers for it and then you should be able to access the drive and pull off whatever you want. I would scan the drive first before you did and then scan whatever files moved.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	If his computer is infected with 'viruses', then the hard drive is where they live. Get a computer nerd friend to put the hard drive in a system with a very good anti-virus program and scan the hard drive before you try to download anything from it.

Then download one of the better free anti-malware programs to help keep it from getting re-infected.

The speed between your router and the Internet has nothing to do with that, and is dependent on the speed you purchase from your Internet provider.|`|PqLpSGE1aa	Could be many reasons. You have wireless network in your house, right? The connection from the router to the internet is different to your network connection, so even though it says poor, you can still have a faster connection.<br>  <br>  You might find that one network is connected to the broadband connection (the main internet line) directly, giving fast speed, whilst the other is connected using old lines, giving slow speed.<br>  <br>  This is how my connection is:<br>  Computer->Router->Old Telephone Lines->Broadband Line->Internet.<br>  <br>  This makes it really slow.<br>  <br>  Good connections would be:<br>  Computer->Router->Broadband Line->Internet<br>  <br>  Basically, I think that although the super speed is coming down the main line, its getting slowed down by old telephone lines.<br>  There isn't anything you can do, short of getting your telephone company to connect you directly to the broadband line, but they may charge you.<br>  <br>  Equally, this might be a completely different problem.

LeBp1gBcaa	The torrent file points to the actual file(s) you want to download, or more specifically, where to find people who have those files so you can download them from them. You need a torrent client like Vuze, uTorrent or Transmission in order to do that, though. Once you have one installed you just double-click the .torrent file and your download starts. Other than that the only difference is that you're downloading from other people instead of a server.<br>  <br>  The only downside to this approach is that you need to have someone else to download the files from. If nobody is "seeding" the files - meaning they have complete copies of all the files and are online sharing them - then you won't be able to download the file. It's almost never a problem, though, unless you're trying to download something really obscure.<br>  <br>  Also, torrents are NOT illegal. What is illegal is downloading copyrighted content, which a lot of people just happen to share through torrents. There are a lot of legitimate uses for torrent files, though, like downloading Linux ISOs and other freely distributed material. And about the virus claim, you can get a virus from almost anything if you're running Windows and don't have anti-virus software. Hell, if you're running XP you don't even need to do anything besides connect to the internet.|`|qJrTQaGAaa	A Torrent in the Internet world is a site that uses BitTorrent technologies to host file for P2P(person to person) file download and sharing.

I am not telling you not to do this, but don't tell your parents about it. You will need utorrent. You ccan get it for windows only at utorrent.com Then go to isohunt.com and search what you want. Search for a video, music, game, ebook, etc. Then click on the one you want (Whichever one has the most seeds, and make sure that it doesn't have a comment saying it has a virus). The more seeds, the faster the download. Now, click on download this torrent. It will say save or open. Hit open. Then hit open with utorrent. It will download (like 20kb) and then utorrent will open. It will ask you if you want to download all or some of the files. Select all of them, and  click download now.It will download. When it is done, it will start seeding. Right click, and hit stop. Then right click and hit open containing folder (probably called downloads, in My Documents). There will be some sort of install directions or read-me. Follow the instructions. If it is a video or music, the read-me will just be advertising for the maker. The music or video will just play as soon as downloaded, but games will not only need regular install, but a type of hack (called a patch or a crack). There also might be the license key to make an application the full not trial version. In this case, just download the serial code only, and download the trial version from download.com Then just put the serial code in.|`|KLt8LAoaaa	In response to the answer by SPCAnde.. torrents are NOT illegal.  The CONTENT of the torrents can be illegal though.

Does the paper actually jam or does it just say paper jam?<br>  <br>  Since the printer is new, check and make sure that you remove all the little pieces of tape that are all over the place to keep the printer intact while shipping.  Open up any trays that you find and look for those little pieces.  It is possible one of them is blocking either a sensor or the paper's path.  One of the instruction sheets that comes in the box with the printer should show all the locations where there is tape.<br>  <br>  Try using only one piece of paper at a time in the feed tray.<br>  <br>  If it still does this than maybe you've got a lemon, take it back to the store and exchange it or return it to get your money back.  Unless of course, you feel its worth it to trash it with a baseball bat.

dkpIjt5jaa	For the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  <br>  So let's calculate a system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including one (high-end) graphic card), 2 hard drives and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+100+60 (2 X 30)+25 =  554<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm not the one building it so compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 600 Watts and get up to 700 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way).<br>  <br>  Best PSU manufacturers at the moment are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>|`|eTLG23N4aa	There are free Power supply calculators for use on the Internet. Pick one and fill in the blanks. That will give you an idea of what's required.<br>  <br>  Don't buy a cheap one either.|`|3LjMWownaa	It depends on what else is in your PC.  You dont need to calculate the exact wattage required.  Usually you just buy a PSU that you KNOW would be able to support everthing you have.  Most devices other than the GPU won't even tell you how much power it draws.<br>  <br>  Generally 400-500w PSU's should be fine if its just a half decent PC.  If your planning on playing the high end games, and buying high end parts, you'd want a better PSU (600w+ )|`|mxv6UyvJaa	Well there are websites that will calculate the wattage for you such as:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.journeysystems.com/?power_supply_calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.journeysystems.com/?power_sup...</a><br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psucalculator.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.extreme.outervision.com/psuca...</a> (Just use the lite version)<br>  <br>  But you should know that wattage isn't necessarily the most important thing. You should look to get one with a decent amp output on the 12v rail(s) - The 9600GT recommends 26A on the 12v rail(s) though this is taking into account the rest of the system.|`|LeBp1gBcaa	An average PC won't need more than a 450 - 500W power supply. NVIDIA recommends a 400W PSU minimum for the 9600 GT, but you want to have some overhead, so I'd go with a 550W. If you plan on adding a 2nd card for SLI, though, bump it up to a 650W one.

4kHMcPUCaa	Your problem is most likely due to the enhanced security settings in Vista. If you have installed the game in C:\Program Files, then Vista isn't going to let you edit the files. One way around this is to copy the file to another location (e.g. the desktop), edit the file and copy it back to its original location (making sure it overwrites the file and doesn't make a copy).

If you decide you would like to reinstall windows, keep in mind that you will lost all your personal data, and have to reinstall all your programs. <br>  <br>  If reinstalling is what you want to do, this is how. When you turn on your comp press the proper key to go into your BIOS/CMOS setting, and look for boot order and make the computer boot from your CD/DVD drive.

AA10700604	Hello Red Tea,<br>  <br>  You have a library folder inside of your main level of Macintosh HD, as well as a Library folder inside of the System folder, as well as inside your Home folder and in the Home folder of whoever else has an account on your Macintosh.<br>  <br>  I think what you’re talking about is the .plist file for your particular game.  Go to Spotlight, the spy glass at the top-right of your desktop, click on that and type the file name.  You’ll be given a list.  If you’ve found the name listed like you say, move your mouse arrow over it and let it stay there and it will show you where it is located on your Macintosh. <br>  <br>   Many Macintosh games are tucked away inside the game itself in your Applications folder.  You go to the game icon itself.  Right-mouse-click onto the icon or use the ctrl-click if you have a single-buttoned mouse or trackpad and you’ll be given the hidden quick menu list and select the Show Package Contents menu command to access the hidden files inside the game.  That’s how you access that.<br>  <br>  I’m afraid that I can’t help you with the Sims game, but I would imagine that there might be some web sites dedicated to the Macintosh version of this.

AA10464818	I don't think anyone can predict how many clicks you can get per 1000 pageviews in Adsense. You can get 100 or you can get none at all<br>  <br>  In terms of earning money on Adsense, your mileage also varies. One website with 10,000 uniques a day can earn $50 a month while another may earn $5,000. It is not easy to predict how much you will earn from Adsense. The only way you can learn about how your site will perform with Adsense is through trying it.<br>  <br>  The amount you can earn will depend on the <br>  <br>  1. Responsiveness of audience to the ads = A travel website that provides information on travel to Spain will attract visitors looking for ways to arrange their travel and spend money on their vacation to Spain. Your site provides the info, but the ads will provide hotels, travel agencies, tourist destinations, car rentals -- ads that are likely to get the attention of the users of your site. This is a site that will most likely do well with Adsense.  However, if you are a gaming website where the main purpose of the user is to play games on your site, then Adsense will not perform as well.<br>  <br>  2. Ad format = some types of ads do better than others depending on your content and layout. In our case, large rectangles in the middle of the content is the best, while leaderboards do not generate as much as income. Skys are the worst for us. Experiment and measure the results via channels and see which formats work best for you.<br>  <br>  3. Ad placement - check Google's heat map as they have tested where the best placements are <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=17954&ctx=en:search&query=adsense+heat+map&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/support/adsense/b...</a> <br>  <br>  4. Ad colors - sometimes ads blended into the content works wonders, but sometimes ads that contrast your site colors work best<br>  <br>  5. Number of ad units on a page = we are allowed maximum of 3 ads + 1 ad links + 1 search box on a page. Maximize the allowed number based on the resulting look of your page (you don't want an overkill of ads). Users going to your page and reading your content may ignore the banner or rectangle at the top of the page, but may click on the ad at the bottom of the article<br>  <br>  6. Smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense. No one knows how this actually works. But it can affect the pricing of the ads on your site. If the advertiser paid for $0.50/click - but your site is smartpriced - then the cost may be discounted lower (e.g. $0.25). So you may try to develop a site based on high paying keywords but if smartpricing gets to you, then you may not get as much per click as what you are expecting from your keywords.<br>  <br>  Here is Google's explanation of smart pricing <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=9562&query=smart+pricing&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  Google's smart pricing feature automatically adjusts the cost of a keyword-targeted content click based on its effectiveness compared to a search click. So if our data shows that a click from a content page is less likely to turn into actionable business results -- such as online sales, registrations, phone calls, or newsletter signups -- we reduce the price you pay for that click.<br>  <br>  Experiment with the factors above (except smartpricing, which you can't control), and see which combination works best. Remember though that not all sites do well with Adsense - even if you get gazillions of traffic but your visitors are not interested in looking for ways to spend their money, they won't be interested in your ads and won't click.

CQOfjctOaa	Vista is a relatively new operating system. there is a possibility that the mouse is not compatible with vista. what i would suggest you do is go to the device manager and check on that mouse to see if there are any conflicts. if there is not, the uninstall the drivers using the device manaager tool, restart the computer and install the drivers again.

In that case, you call tech support and ask for help.  Since you never bought the programs, you don't get help.  Buy them.|`|MxculX2Daa	You cant just move the games folder to a new OS and expect it to work. It must be INSTALLED. That's what installers are for. Or did you think they were called that for some other reason?|`|a7fusxEKaa	Your best bet is to reinstall them. Simply transferring the files from XP to Vista often won't work. You could try inserting the appropriate registry keys, and moving files to the appropriate places for Vista, which can only be found in game-specific forums. The file structure is just difference, so the game is looking for files that aren't necessarily there.<br>  <br>  Just re-download and re-install. If you want your save-games back, find where they were on the XP installation and put them in the appropriate place under Vista. That's usually under Users > YOUR NAME > Application Data > Program name > etc...<br>  <br>  Also try finding the program executable, right-clicking, selecting Properties, go to compatibility mode, and set for Windows XP or below.|`|zGkqGZzYaa	Torrent's are BAD JU JU.
