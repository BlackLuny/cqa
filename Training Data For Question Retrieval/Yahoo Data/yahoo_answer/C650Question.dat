20090222144116AA3CO9G	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I Wrong Or Is He Overreacting?	There's this girl I used to be best friends with, but I stopped talking to her cause I think she's a *****. She's always talking crap about me to my boyfriend, and it gets me annoyed that she's talking badly about me to MY boyfriend. I told him how frustrated it makes me to know that they talk, and he gave me advice saying "Oh, just lose all contact with her. Block her, don't talk to her."   So today is my birthday, and I get a phone call from her, so I was wondered what she wanted, and I picked up. I figured she was just trying to be nice and wish me a happy birthday, ok, it's not like I'm having a conversation with her, no big deal. Which she did, all she said was "Happy birthday." So I thanked her and hung up.      She just told my boyfriend "I spoke to her on the phone, she sounded like a man." Now my boyfriends pissed at me because I ignored his advice, and enabled her to contact me. He was like "Wtf, does my advice go through one ear and out the other? I care so much, that I don't want you to have any problems, big or small, cause small things can build up, so what's the point of me wasting my breath trying to help you, if you're just gonna ignore what I tell you? Whatever, you want me to care less? Fine, wish granted. I'm not gonna offer you advice unless you desperatley need it."      He's also upset because he's already really mad about work, and this situation is just making it worse.      Wtf, what should I say/do?

20090222144659AAaz33j	Family & Relationships;Friends	I wants to wish my EX-BOYFRIEND a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!" but I'm scared he'll ignore me or will find it weird...?	So I went out with this guy for six weeks from October to December (I know I know not long at all) but anyway I got pretty close to him during that time...We spoke online all the time and met each others families etc...But then he broke up with me and said we'd still be friends...Well, I haven't spoken to him for almost 3 months and I still miss him a lot...He dated someone else since he left me and I'm not sure if he's with anyone at the moment but I still would really like to be friends with him...Even when we were dating I thought of him as more of a friend anyway!      So his birthday is tomorrow and I'm deliberating over whether to wish him a happy one or not...I hoped he would come online (MSN) so I could casually say "happy birthday for tomorrow" but he hasn't...So texting is my only other option, but how would you feel if an ex said this to you...Would it be too weird? Do you think he'd be happy or annoyed? I just know this is my only chance to clear the air and let him know we're cool because he's leaving the country soon :(      My other option is to wait until he comes online after his birthday and say something like "happy birthday for last monday". What do you suggest? I just want my friend back...I know we can never be close again but this is the type of guy who isn't deliberately nasty to anyone and he'd prefer peace to conflict anyday.

20090222144703AAw81jP	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend's dad just passed away, I need help, what can I do for her?	It is soooo tragic.  Someone left a cigarette lit and the house burned down.  That's got to be one of the most terrible ways you can go.  The kids are okay and the rest of her family survived, but they will be in the hospital a few more days.  She is left dealing with all of this herself.  She is trying to figure out what to do with their business, making burial arrangements, contacting everyone, and figuring out the insurance.  She has no help and she is sooooo depressed.  Her mom keeps telling her that she wants to die now that her dad is gone.  I wish there was something, anything more significant than just letting her know I love her, that I can do.  I'm looking for suggestions.......please?

20090222145345AAGECaG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	His Ex-Wife's Schedule is Ruining Our Dates?	I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years now, and love him very much.      We are in a committed relationship that is wonderful except for one thing: his ex-wife's schedule is insane!  When we got together, I was well aware of the fact that he was divorced and had a (beautiful!) son with his ex.  He also has two former step-children, from her 2nd and 3rd marriages, whom he loves and sees often.  I want to be supportive of his relationship with them, because he is a wonderful father, and they are wonderful kids.  I also do not this his ex is bad person either - she seems very sociable and easy to get along with.  The only thing that truly concerns me is the amount of time my boyfriend is expected to take all the kids.  Let me make this clear:  I know the kids come first, and I support this wholeheartedly.  My father was always at work and never around, so I want his kids to have him there, and often.  However, we never have ANY time alone together.  At all.  His ex is EXTREMELY social - nearly every night a week she is out at a party or out with girlfriends.  She calls him to take the kids to their lessons, after school programs, or even just to watch them (the other two kids' fathers aren't around much). He loves them, and doesn't want them to be at home alone, so he takes them (he has them approximately 5 out of 7 nights a week, though she has primary custody).  This has caused us to miss MANY dates, and even when we do somehow end up getting one evening alone, he is late by at least an hour every time.  What frustrates me is that she won't even call to let him know when she's late, or when she'll eventually be home so that we can go ahead with plans.  We have missed family functions, nights out with friends, and so on.  I'm not blaming her, and I'm not blaming him, but I feel as though there HAS to be a reasonable way to deal with this.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I'm getting tired of my social life being crushed so that his ex can enjoy hers.
20090222145537AAEhskD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is everyone acting like this all of a sudden?	There's this colleague of mine that I've worked with for a year now. We have a lot in common, but we are not that close. I know that he has a girlfriend and they have a daughter.      Anyway, lately things have been so strange. This guy is frustrated all the time and he takes his temper out on me as if I've done something wrong. And then afterwards he tries to be nice again without even apologizing. I am not forgiving him at all. I used to like him, but now I think he's such a selfish, arrogant man that I don't even want in my life at all. He is acting so irrational and irresponsible. I hate the guy so much. On top of all this he disappears for hours from work and I am left to deal with all his phone calls. His mates always come to me to ask where he is and what he is up to and whether I have seen him or know what he is doing on his time off.....aaaaarrrrrrggggghhhhh. It's so annoying, as if I know all the answers that link to him. The exact same friends of his keep coming to me and talking about him only, never about themselves or even me for that matter.      It's so frustrating. I mean how am I supposed to know what the guy is up to. It's none of my business anyway. I wish they would just all leave me alone.

20090222151308AAzbJ0f	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do i do about my friends?	I'm friends with this guy we'll call Joe. I'm friends with Joe, but he's been known to go for the physical stuff with girls, (I've only joked with him about this, plus most of the girls before were willing to dish it out to him... but that's besides the point...) He's also no longer a virgin (which i know i'm gonna get comment after comment about this, but it IS a big to me and my friends to wait until marriage, so you can call me a prude or whatever, but i take my virginity seriously...) anyways, besides that he used to smoke pot and who knows what else before i met him. Now he says he "used" to do this stuff, but he also said his brother still does that stuff, so it's not like it'd be tough for him to start up again.... But anyways......       One of my best friends, we'll call her Jane, just met Joe 2 weeks ago and they've been texting and whatever ever since then. Jane is one of the sweetest girls i know, not into drinking, drugs, or sexual stuff. Joe is definitely NOT her type, but he puts on this "alias" whenever she's around. he acts like a total sweetie, then the second she leaves he's making tons of rude, degrading comments towards women, and other races and such...      Several people have warned Jane about him, but she doesn't see she's heading down the wrong path... You may say i should just stay out of it, but like i said, she's one of my best friends, we've grown up together, and i've already seen her start to change. Such as ditching people for him, and it's only been 2 weeks!! I'm not trying to help her for my own selfish reasons, it's the fact that this boy is bad news and I dont want to see her get hurt....      What can i do to help her or get her to listen... I dont want her to get hurt over this guy.            ps. she's 16 & he's 17.... ( that probably doesn't make any difference in your answer but i thought i'd let you know :) )
20090222150851AAxd5Y6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What's wrong with her?	I have this drama teacher and although she's incredibly amazing at what she does, there's something about her that I don't like. She likes and often  favours me in lessons, but I seem to be the only person who finds her actions just a little bit peculiar. She took a couple of boys  down the pub and bought them drinks after school (16 year olds) and my mate saw her with his dealer the other day.. She often asks people personal questions (kept harassing me about my sex life) and made a number of people imagine their teachers naked and having sex with each other to get into the role of their characters. These are just a few of the things she does, and I just think it's a bit weird for someone over the age of 40 to be interracting with students in this way. She keeps trying to get me to confide in her and even though everyone else seems to, I just don't feel comfortable.. Is it just me or is something not right?
20090222150919AAWiLnj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Love seems so wonderful but really is it all that you dreamed it to be?	For people who are married, single, dating, whatever.  What did you imagine "love" would be like?  Are you getting what you want/need and deserve out of love?  Or are you giving and not receiving?  How about are you giving what the other person deserves, want, and need?       I've found through life experiences that people have different definitions of love.  People have different ways of showing love and expecting to be loved.  Those differences, in my opinion, is why there is so much failure in love.  What do you think?
20090222150310AAJCuYI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do i feel like  my Friend's don't want to be around me any more?	they are not calling me any more and i have not talked to them in     2 week's and evey time i call they don't answer
20090222150609AAGTsK1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Um...Why does this ALWAYS happen to me?	okay, well...where to begin?   Every time i love something that everyone else hates, suddenly EVERYONE becomes a fan of it after they say they hate it.      Ex #1: At my new school everyone thought that Eragon and Twilight was a stupid book and for nerds. Okay, it didn't bother me, i don't care what people think of me or the stuff i like. So one day i come into school and everyone is talking how "Hawt" Edward is and blah blah blah and people started (literally) begging me to lend them my Twilight and Eragon books.      Ex #2: Being the new kid, not many people know my music taste. I am a country-music-holic. I absolutley LOVE Taylor Swift to death. When i told people when they asked my fave music, i said "Country, especially Taylor Swift." i got the response... "Ew, she sucks. I hate her. She's ugly. Her music is terrible." .....okay, that's expected from Bubblegum-pop-miley-jonas-lovers. (nothing against people who like Miley and Jonas Brothers...) The next week, everyone LOVES Taylor and she's amazing, and blah blah blah. Now i have people begging me to take them to a Swift concert...Great.      But, my question is.. Why does that always happen? everything that makes me different, becomes the new fad. And its so annoying because i WANT to be different, not a clone like the rest of them.

20090222150817AATObTE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Hen a guy makes sexual jokes towards you,does it mean he likes you?	I have a crush on this guy that I work with. We always joke around and he always talk to me in a sexual manner. Sometimes we hug each other and I would like things to go further but I am too shy to make the move.      For example, today when we were working, I told him that I have to use the washroom and he was like “I would love to join you but since the manager is here, I would get into trouble because we are going to make some noises".      I was flattered but I don't know if he is really serious or just joking around.      I was thinking to ask him if he wants to come over to my apartment since I live alone but I am not sure if he is really serious about it. I don't want to get the wrong idea and make fool of myself .He is 18 and I am 23      Do you think he likes me or just playing around?

20090222150219AAT86XB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My fiance is big guy and he's unhappy with his body. Any advice?	It's hard to comfort a man without hurting his pride in the process.      So my fiance is a big guy, a big guy I love and lust over might I add.    I don't see it as a flaw, it's just a description. I'm short, it doesn't mean it's a bad thing. I happen to like his chub. Anyway, he's always been big since I met him but he has gained more weight.          Even when we make love, I kiss his belly to know that every part of him is loved and cherished.      I have an eating disorder. I'm just an average girl. Lost more weight recently. He has come with me to therapy for my eating disorder, also took a test to analyze his own eating habits/relationship with food.. and he does have issues with food. I know that he comfort eats and sometimes just can't stop eating. There have been times in his life before he met me where he was thin. This was attained using extreme measures.I've told him he can talk to me about it because I'm no stranger to his issues, i battle with my own body image. I was also overweight before I met him. He replies and says but you're not fat,  when i say i understand.       He recently told me he wishes he was like me. I asked in what way? And he said he didn't want my ego to grow. I'm guessing he wishes he could eat like me.. I eat/overeat/binge and purge so my weight tends to stay roughly the same. He has been paying me less compliments lately. He asked for some sexy photos of me so I sent him some. And right after we just had a convo that went exactly like this:                Me:   me too! being naked with you is noice.   Him:   Is only noice?   Him:   It WAS noice... before I ballooned up to whale size.   Me:   Stop it   Me:    more than noice.im trying not to be too dirty!    Me:   OKay so you have put on some weight. You're still the same man i desire, still the same man I made love to time and time again, the same man i continue to desire   Him:   Or you are just stuck with me.   Him:   I need to go.            (P.S Noice is a word I made up. It's another way of saying nice and it can mean awesome. He uses it too. We have cute  words we share together.)            So after that I texted him reassuring him and he told me to leave him alone. I called,he didn't answer,I left him voice mail then he texted back saying that he loves me and goodnight.

20090222150342AAiPq4z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I finally find closure?	I broke up with my fiance of 5 years almost a year and a half ago. He left me on my engagement party and never spoke to me again,never tried to contact or even ask for him ring back. We were in love, and I am still in love with him and left feeling so confused with not knowing what his reasons were for leaving and never even bother with a simple phone call ,and he claimed he loved me more than anything in the world ,I mean common we spent five years together and nearly married. I recently mailed the pictures from our engagement to him a year later with a letter asking him to contact me at his will leaving him my phone number.He never responded. I tried to add him on facebook and his girlfriend answered on his name saying to leave him alone,well who know's if it was really her. All I want is closure from him so I can move on. What can I do?

I am trying to help my best friend find information on how to get out of her lease as she is going to file divorce from her husband. They live in an apartment and have been there 2 years and recently signed their 3rd year lease. She is not living there anymore but he is and she doesn't want to go make him homeless but at the same time she wants to get her name off the lease, they have a least till Jan 25th of next year so can anyone help me with the info she will need? Will she have to pay fees to get out of the lease or can she just ask to have her name taken off as he still lives there? She just doesn't want to pay rent at a place she is not living.

20090222151902AA0L6Yh	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a friendship problem?	Hi. I have a friendship problem with this girl who used to be my best friend back in grade 3 - 5.       When it was late grade 6, she told me she didn't like me from mid-grade 6 and she said she was sorry that she did not tell me. She said she did not like me as a friend. I forgave her.      When it was grade 7 she started being very rude. She would get mad at me for no reason and would not pay attention to anything I have to say. On May, she sent me a hate letter to me and my friend calling me a b- - - -. She then later apologized once again.       I always forgive her but she always completely gets on my nerves. I always have the urge to dump her and never be her friend again because of how she hurts me all the time. Now I am in grade 8, and we are about to be graduating. She still hurts me. Whenever we talk she gives rude, sarcastic and careless responses to me. Sometimes she is okay and we are friends like we were that time... that is why I always change my mind on and off about her.      What do I do?

20090222151840AAEQCME	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends want me to choose?	ok so i have 3 really good friends. 2 of them i'v been friends with forever and the other 1 for about 3 years. the 2 hate my other friend for some reasons that i personally dont agree with. they hate being around her and dont like being around me when im with her. but the thing is i dont wanna have to choose between them. plus the friend of 3 years is moving in a few months. (:'C)    iv talked to them and i guess they dont want me to hang around them while im with her. i dont wanna choose over those 2 because in my opinion i shouldnt have to. plus the friend of 3 years doesnt hate the other 2. so shes not the one making me choose. and i dont wanna make the last months she has here hell for her. i dont really think she deserves me ditching her or anything. but im afraid if i stick with her for the next couple months before she leaves then ill lose my other 2 friends. im kinda mad that they cant just deal with her for a couple more months but i guess they apparently cant. i mean, they have another friend that i dont like and theyre always with but i dont fuss over it cause i care about them and im not willing to lose them to lose the girl i dont like. i dont even see why they dont like my friend. she caused some drama a while back but lately she hasnt been causing anything. all the drama is in their heads and i think that if they looked at reality they'd realize that its not her making drama anymore. its them hating her so much for no good reasons anymore thats causing the "drama". i wrote them a letter and they still havent replied to me and im afraid theyre ignoring me. what should i do? should i just stay with my 1 friend for the next couple months and hope i dont lose the other 2 or should i try to make a compromise or something? what would you do? thanks! anything is appreciated if your being serious. :)

Not a big family guy.   I finally met him a couple weeks ago.    Since then, she's been gone every single night and i've been home alone, and im starting to feel really lonely.   The one night that she was home this week, she was on the phone with him the entire time, and when i walked in to ask if we were having dinner, she called me selfish and asked if i wanted her to be miserable.

20090222151749AAtIH9a	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my Friend acting like this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarten and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. When we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure?"      I reply, "Yes, I'm 100% sure you did. Don't you remember? You seriously don't remember?"      Then she says, "Not really, I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile on her and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      When we do hang out every now and then we're still good friends and get along fine. I just don't understand why she's acting like this when we're apart.

20090222152548AA2GjM2	Family & Relationships;Friends	How would you react if your friend told your secret that she promised not to tell?	At the time me and this person were friends, I thought I could trust her and share with her some personal information. There were times when she will ask me if I wanted to share anything else with her, but I didnt realize that she was only doing that so she could use it against me in the long run, and also tell it behind my back. After our friendship got ruined, she told someone to call my dad's house and share all of the secrets that I told her regarding family issues from the past. She even tried to ruien my relationship by telling my secrets to her brother, who was my boyfriend. The thing is that I never told her secrets at all about her father and other family members, so why would she do that to a real friend like me? How would you guys react if a friend told you all of your secrects behind your back? How would you handle this kind of problem?

I'm not into macho type meatheads, or self-assured guys...  I like mine a little smart and slightly insecure so I can jokingly jab them from time to time.      But most of the guys I'm into are taken, dead, or never existed to begin with.      Some will say I'm to picky, but I'm thinking that while there are plenty of fish in the sea, I'm pretty sure the sea has become toxic and polluted along with the other fish.      Even most other girls are stupid in my opinion, and most guys are douches.      As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure most of you (9 out of 10) on here are pretty crappy people, and I didn't even have to meet you to figure that out... imagine that!      So where are some people who don't reek of urban pompousness or rural ignorance that actually think and have a worthwhile imagination?

20090222151440AA45z9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do/what should she do?	I am in a relationship now that has been for a while (more than 4 years). We really seem to enjoy each other but are in a long distance relationship. We don't get to see each other as often as we would like because of school and stuff. Lately we have been fighting a little now and then and sometimes a lot. I'm not really sure if she is what I want and sometimes i have my doubts, but then there is so much good. While I have thinking all of this there is this girl that I enjoy being around that i will call "the girl."      "the girl" that I really enjoy hanging around is here at school. I know my limitations and am pretty sure I would never beak them. I feel that even if some of my time with her is 1-on-1 that it is not a big problem. This is because of "the guy."      "The guy" is the "the girls" person that she seems to like a lot. He doesn't return the favor and can't balance his life with her. He says he does but I'm not so sure about it. he has broken up with her more than once in the past year but they get back together. I feel that if she could just get over him it would be better for her.       "the girl" feels very comfortable talking to me about things. I think this is because I am an excellent listener. The more and more "the girl" talks to me the more I think maybe "the girl" is who I want. Every time i'm with "the girl" I am all smiles and really enjoy my self. I cant tell my gf about half of it cause even though it seems fine to me she of course doesn't like it. From what I can tell "the girl" isnt interested me in that way despite what all my friends say. I think its because I have a gf and she respects that, even though we spend lots of time together lately.      The long distance thing will continue for at least two more years (it has been 2 years of LD so far) and I wonder if we need a break so that I can spend time with someone and try other things. I know that my gf pretty much only wants me but always says if i need a break i need to take one so that i dont pull her in more.       What advice should i give "the girl" about her guy?   What advice do i need for my self?!
20090222151831AAYHCs4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Feeling alone and that my friends don't care?	Recently I'm beginning to feel that none of my friends really care about me. None of them really calls me to hangout and I have to be usually the one that has to call or txt first.       At school, I'm able to talk with my friends and go out to lunch with them and such, but on weekends I feel alone because they're either off doing their own thing or they just don't even think about me. I feel that I don't really even have any friends... although they do say they care about me and that I'm a good friend. I feel that they haven't proven that to me because they never really call me/txt me first.       I feel that like the only times they do contact me is if they want something from me.       What should I do?

20090222152907AAAJkOI	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding - Am I right or wrong about my parents?	Basically my mum and dad weren't happy about my engagement from the onset (they have always liked to think they are ' in control') but then they got use to the idea so they could brag about it and compare my wedding to my cousin's!     So...they offered us 3k towards the wedding and so we started budgeting round the money kindly contributed to us......then we found out that they didnt actually have the money readily available and that they would give it us on the wedding day.......what use is that??? so it turned into an argument and i then found out about a bond that my mum had saved for my wedding dress....￡1300...So she has put a deposit down on my dress and there is still ￡600 left from this bond.    The rest of the money ￡2300 is going to pay for our reception.....i thought it would be nice to use the money for something significant. (plus the reception doesnt have to be paid for until after the date-perfect for them!)      HOWEVER we need ￡100 to secure the reception.....my mum made me feel awful when i asked her for it, so i said I would cover it but we havent been able to with unexpected expense cropping up! Car tax, repairs etc etc. I have found out that my parents have booked a last minute holiday to the carribean for 3k........and everytime we go round they are bragging about what new things they've bought for the house and how much it cost. A LAMP for ￡200????? Half of that could have secured my wedding day........and i am really upset that it clearly isn't that important to them.         May i add that my mum once made a comment to me that i should maybe pay for the deposit so then i am 'committed' and cant pull out......as one day a rich handsome man might walk past me and i leave my fiance for him......what an awful thing to say....         Now i feel terrible for mentioning their holiday as they are entitled to spend their money how they wish, but i cant help feeling upset??

20090222110553AAgiA6l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did anybody get married in their early 20's and only knew their spouse a yr or less when they got married?	My husband is 44,im 40 and we have been happily married 18 yrs.      We started dating march 1990 when he was 25 and i was 21 and got married 10 months later on january 19,1991 when i was 22 and he was 26.      We moved in together 3 months before we got married and had already been engaged for 4 months when we started living together.      A lot of people on here say that a couple should wait a yr or 2 before getting married so you can get to know each other better but in my opinion it doesn't take a yr or more to get to know someone better.

20090222160039AA1DfYZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Alcohol at the Reception, what to do?	Ok so we're having our wedding reception at a hall, a roast buffet will be catered but i'm stuck on how to handle the alcohol, we're doing this on a relatively tight budget and will have around 60 people. I've come up with a few different options and were just wanting some opinions or any other ideas people have.      Option one: BYO, supply some beer and wine punch but spirits would have to be BYO or complete BYO      Option two: supply beverages including alcohol (beer, wine, softdrink, vodka, rum, scotch) but have everyone serve themselves       Option three: same as option two but find someone to be a barman for the night and serve people (also thought perhaps people could pay $1 a drink or something to help us out a bit)       I don't know how to do this, because , being at a hall, if we run out of drinks thats it! I also thought that maybe if we were going to supply it all that i could send out sort of RSVP cards that people have to return and have them state or check from a list their prefered beverage for the night. I'm in australia if that makes a difference. Thank you everyone sorry its long.
20090222160201AAr2jO5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So, is this a guy way of saying I am his best friend?	I met this guy 3 years ago, and we became really good friends. The last few long term relationships he has had were with girls he has been "best friends" with. In fact, I really liked him, and he recently started dating a girl he kept referring to as his "Really close friend". Well, him and I were talking the other night. And randomly, he goes "You know I really suck at being close friends with a girl. There are girls I am KINDA friends with. But VERY few I would consider that close, best friend. And you are one of those girls.". Sooo, does that mean anything??

20090222103829AAVsZ4S	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you apologize?	To someone that means like the whole world to you?       Well I can’t believe I’m doing this but here goes….   “My life would suck without you”, and you know it.  I’m bad at apologizes and you know that too. I get sad when you don’t call cuz I need to talk to you.  I get frustrated cuz its like illegal to see you. Sometimes I think it would be easier if we didn’t talk so I pick a fight. Its annoying as **** and I get upset cuz we have less and less to talk about. I get worried your starting to care less and less.       The next person to insult you at RH is getting hit right in the face. I probably don’t tell you this but you’re the cause of half the fights I get into. Lol everyone thinks your lame but I know your not. They should get to know you like I do. All I’m saying is I’m sorry and I’ll always have your back. Do forgive me? Do you have mine?       Hopefully making an *** out of myself on answers is a good enough apology. If not I tried. This is the most creative thing I could think of…I’m out of ideas because I’m sad. :( Lol hopefully too many of my contacts don’t read this.

My best friend and I are really REALLY close, and then the rest of my friends, we get on really well just i don't click as well although we have fun and everything.

20090222154834AAmstmw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Its nothing to be ashamed of being single at 17 never having a proper relationship?	I'm 17 years old and I have never properly dated anyone. I just go to work, go to college and have a laugh with mates. People (family and some friends) say you should be getting girlfriends at your age. Most people I know have girlfriends or have had them? There's nothing wrong with me not really having one ever? I'm not too bothered about having one right now tbh but people still say I've got a girlfriend and you can't find one. I'm not particularly looking. Some people my age seem to see it (having a girlfriend) as something to show off.       Point is its nothing for me to be ashamed because others seem to be making it a big deal.

My husband saw my sex toys collection when he helped me clean my drawers. He said he's jealous with my toys. I'm not sure if he meant what he said or he's joking. Last night he didn't touch me.

20090222102305AACPoGQ	Family & Relationships;Family	Would you still attend the funeral?	This morning, my cousin Billy was found dead in Baltimore. It is thought that he killed himself, he did OverDose on his own mothers pills. Billy has completely torn apart our family, he has totaled 5 cars, is completely brain-fried from drugs and has given his father a heart attack. I, most certainly did not consider him a good family member and he knew that. Me and him have gotten into in a good couple of times, I know its "unconditional love" but still. I most likely will attend the funeral, but would you?

Me and her went out for a while like 6 months ago maybe and since then its been like on and off talking to her. We tried something again to see if it would work out but it didnt. i still kinda like her but she pisses me off alot. she started talking with one of my friends but that ended and she sometimes doesnt answer my texts which pisses me off. i havent really talked to her in like a week maybe but idk if i should keep trying to get her back or to just give up. any suggestions?
20090222110430AAYU95M	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is love necessary for a healthy life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.
20090222160234AA6VWCb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I love myself if I don't know who I am?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..??
20090222105915AASeWkV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me and my friend are bored? What should we do?	We are bored and we were going to play games from "Whose Line is it Anyway" but one of her brothers doesn't want to to play... So what can we do that is REALLY FUN?

(0-5 points)      Total (0-10 [0= F*** NO!!! 10=Definitely!!!])=      So, does she like me or not? I know that the test is a little biased with just two questions, but work with me, okay?

Just like every relationship we were perfect in the beginning he got turned on by everything. We had an 8 month break and I was with someone and he wasn't. We got back together and we are happier than ever just as if we just started over again which we did. It is really hard for him knowing I had sex with someone else and I was his first and only. I'm not sure what his deal is whether it is his intimidation, insecurity, fear or what from the whole situation but he doesn't get turned on by my boobs anymore and he doesn't even like me to go down there ya know. He has a hard time getting up and we have to do it on his terms to make sure he is ready to go and won't feel like he's failing. We can't be spontaneous or anything. It makes me feel useless and insecure as well like I'm not good enough. I know he loves me and isn't getting it from anyone else we are together 24/7. I'm almost positive it is because of the whole break. I just need advice on how to make it better how to make him more comfortable so we can move on from this and be completely full filled in the relationship. Help it's so frustrating.

She was visiting her mother on San Diego last december, then, one friend of hers says they needed a model to film one fetish video.   So, they paid $100 to my wife to be the model.

I've had a full beard since I was 17 yrs. old. check me out if you'd like    http://img19.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...  now... I have an urgent problem, thats been leaving my balls blue for years. I have had minor experience. I've made out with chicks, and I've fingered a girl and wet my pinky in her sinky, but unfortunately I was unattracted to her and got a half *****... leads me to my first question. does that mean I've lost my virginity??? Second Question: Although I've had these encounters, I've never actually had a Girlfriend before, and now that my generation has progressed into the more sophisticated dating world, Im left in the dust. Can you guys out there give me some pointers, from some sort of Tom Leykis view? Its too bad I had to say good by to the professor so soon, because I never got to call in.

Me and my ex work together, and we have been broken up for a month now.      Yesterday at work I was talking to another guy, and then him and my ex almost got into a fight..and he just walked out of work      So then I txtd him when I got home and apologized for what happened, and at first he was mean and said **** off, then he called me about 12 times until I answered and talked to me on the phone for the first time in a month and he admitted that it bothered him when I talked to that guy and not to do so anymore, and then he stated all the problems we had and why he broke up with me..(all small problems, nothing big)      I really miss him :( since he got jealous, does it mean he still has feelings?      I want him back, but if he doesnt call me, i dont wanna call him first.         sighhh.   idk wat to do.

20090222155909AAAtWjw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(10 points for best answer) I need help what did I do wrong?	Alright so my girlfriend came over today, and whenever she comes over we can't keep our hands off each other. Were rolling all over each other kissing then we have sex while trying to watch a movie. Other then that we were having a really cute time everything was going awesome.       Then we have sex a second time and its going really well, then she starts saying owe. So I think I'm hurting her so I slow it down and we started doing it romantically. Then all of sudden she seemed back in the mood so I started going harder again. Then she just gave up on me, and she said I'm sorry I feel really bad but I can't do it anymore its hurting me now.      So I tell her its fine no problem, I'm never going to get mad if she does that I don't care we were going at it for a while anyway. I just started holding onto her and I wanted to talk about it she obviously didn't and seemed really tired. So I tried to slowly ask her about it, once she kind of brushed off the question. Then I made the mistake of asking her again and she got a little mad.      And for some reason I brought up something she said earlier about getting an abortion. And if I would bring her in so her mom would never know. And I told her well I'm going to have to make sure I don't get you pregnant because I don't like the idea of an abortion      So now shes really pissed at me... I don't get it though. She use to tell me that every time she tried to care about me I pushed her away. And I changed I opened up to her more and now its almost like shes pushing me away.      I don't understand what I did wrong though I'm just trying to care, and she left before we had dinner or anything. Were teenagers by the way. I'm a little bit older and shes 16.      Can anyone help me out?

20090222104035AAFh8YU	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do about this situation I am in?	I got in a big fight with one of my friends about something I did. We had an argument then he said he was going to end our friendship. So after that I talked to him only a couple of times on texting and then he told me to stop talking to him. Then, he deleted me as a facebook friend. I want to just confront him and end this but I don't know how. I appologized numerous times and was sincere about it, but he didn't believe me and said he wasn't going to forgive me.      How can I talk to him without making him even more mad?
20090222110555AA3WR9o	Family & Relationships;Friends	I was at a party and somebody threw boiling hot water at me.  What now?	On Friday was the volleyball game finals and Jane was so rude with our team!  She is our team captain.  The coach decided we need a new captain - me!      If I said yes, then I would become the captain and I could kick Jane off the team if I wanted to.  If I said no, then Jane would stay as captain.  I was going to talk with the team, but Jane threatened to "kill me" if I said yes.  So I wanted to get back at her and I said yes.      So there was a party that night too.  I went there with all my friends.  We saw Jane and her friends there.  Jane was SO upset!  I knew they were going to do something to me so I just went into the room and I started dancing and I ate Pizza and I had a drink.      So then Jane went into the kitchen and her friends did too.  My friend Courtney called me over and she said I have to go pick up the cake from Dairy Queen (I am 14 and I can't drive, but Dairy Queen is only 2 minutes away).  I went to the door and I was getting my purse.  I was wearing a light blue top, a pink skirt, and long black leather heels.  I was just talking to Courtney and standing near the door.  There is a balcony RIGHT above the door area where I was standing.        All of a sudden, while I was talking to Courtney water came and hit me.  Everyone thought it was a prank and I started screaming so much since the water was literally BOILING hot.  I fell on the floor and I was rolling it was hurting so much.  No one realized the water was boiling hot.  Courtney came and she just touched me and she realized how hot the water is.      No one really knew what to do, but then my boyfriend came and he got a blanket and he literally held it outside in the snowstorm for a minute and the blanket was really cold and he wrapped me up in the cold blanket and he took me to a bedroom and I took my clothes off and I took a towel and I patted my entire body with a cold towel.        Courtney put my clothes in the dryer.  So I put my clothes and stuff on and my boyfriend checked how I was.  My skin was slightly red but it was not THAT badly burned.  The water hit my right on the top of my head, and I fell and then more came down and hit my stomach.        It was so hot that I felt so itchy and oh my god it was terrible. 1      What should I do?  I am not sure if it was Jane that did this to me.  So I can't tell the police.  Also my parents are on business.

20090222160049AAqIeQY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need help with confusing person?	So idk exactly I guess we're considered ex's, but she wants to be friends. Well the problem there is she doesn't spend more than one day a week to talk to me and all she does in that time is making me feel bad and hurt. So I stopped talking to her and skipping out on activities that involve her. Well apparently today she had a break down and it was because she was missing me. She thinks she really treated me bad apparently. She didn't tell me this I found out through other means. Well she got on I M today and didn't say a word to me. Which normally wouldn't surprise me but today is different. She got on for like 2 minutes and got off. last time she IMed me I got mad at her for pissing me off when it was only for a few minutes, so that makes sense if she only could be on for a while. What should I do?

She texts him constantly and flirts with him non stop. Obviously hes a guy, he wants sex and god knows she will give it to him. I just feel like shes my friend and she knows I have feelings for him so why would she do this? At the same time Im not dating him so hes free game. I just dont know what to think about it but it kind of hurts my feelings that shes going after him. Am I being too sensitive?

We always joke around and he always talk to me in a sexual manner. Sometimes we hug each other and I would like things to go further but I am too shy to make the move.      For example, today when we were working, I told him that I have to use the washroom and he was like “I would love to join you but since the manager is here, I would get into trouble because we are going to make some noises".      I was flattered but I don't know if he is really serious or just joking around.      I was thinking to ask him if he wants to come over to my apartment since I live alone but I am not sure if he is really serious about it. I don't want to get the wrong idea and make fool of myself .He is 18 and I am 23      Do you think he likes me or just playing around?

I told her not to but she did it any way during passing period and ever since he's been ignoring me. We used to just wave . smile at eachother and had a little talk between classes but thats it. Then he just got all nervous around me and ignored me.    Then i guess he talked to the girl who told him that i liked him and so when i went over to there classroom to say 'hi' she pulled me in and across the room shouted "HEY, THIS IS THE GIRL THAT LIKES YOU!" and ever since THEN he keeps looking over his friends shoulder and looks into my eyes. When my friends were just at the table during lunch we was going out of the room trying to get his hood up and he jsut stared me straight in the eyes has he walked right in front of me. Then when i walked by him his friend pointed at me and they started wispering. Im really emberressed now and idk wat to do. Do i lie and tell him i dont like him any more or what??

20090222160025AAlPsbT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will ignoring an ex get them to come back?	Well ive been broken up with my ex for a few months,(we were together for 3 years) and well she wanted to remain friends at first. So i said ok and i did it her way for id say a good three months. She says things like were soulmates and we talked about what went wrong in our relationship and we seem to be more open now then ever. And its been driving me crazy seeing her and not being able to kiss her and all the things we used to do. If she doesnt want me back i told her to just tell me so i can move on. And i cant get a yes or no about wheather or not she sees us getting back together. so i dont know what to do.       she says she doesnt want to depend on me for everything like before. And wants to get her life on track. I dont understand why i would be a burden on her at all. And they say the definition of insanity is to continue to do the same things and expect differant results. now i changed my approach.      I havent talked to her in 4 days on all my friends recomendations. They say she will come back and want to be in a relationship if i do this.So far ive done the opposite of what they told me hoping it would get her to come back. Now im ignoring her for a month WILL THIS HELP OR HURT MY CHANCES AT THIS POINT?

20090222160125AAeLCwP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FOR GUYS: What does it mean...?	What does it mean when a guy friend hangs up on his girlfriend to talk to me who is only his friend? Or if he answers my calls all the time even when he is with his girlfriend? Or if he always flirts with and says he wants me to bear his children (jokingly)? Or if he always initiates hours-long text fests with me? Or answers my calls during major football games (like The Super Bowl) to talk about nothing? Or if he calls me during Valentine's Day, instead of his girlfriend?      NOTE: We are strictly only friends, never kissed, or had sex, or anything other than friend stuff (we even talk about farts and call each other names).

My friends new bf isn't exactly true to her...   like the day after her first date he kissed another girl   he's told my other friend that he's partly only in the relationship to see how far he can get with her.   He's asked various girls to sleep with him (this was like a week or so before he asked my friend out)   I'm kinda worried about her, because even her mom won't let her hang out with him cuz he's apparently a bad kid.   I just don't know what to do... should i tell her or just let her find out on her own?   If i let her figure it out herself it'll probably come back on me cuz i didn't tell her...

20090222154933AAoSAbJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Bridal Shower - how did yours go?  How would you handle how mine went?  Suggestions?	My bridal shower was last night.  It was planned two months ago.  My bridesmaids were supposed to phone people and personally invite them so that they felt personally invited (based on a list of people, with phone numbers and email addresses of who I really wanted to be there).  I found out last night that a 'facebook event' was the only means of constant communication with any one of the women invited.  Oh and an email sent out about a month ago.      So I spent most of the week last week, and all of Friday receiving messages from people saying they weren't going to make it.      They had a headache, their walls needed cleaning, they were leaving the country, their dog exploded... you get the idea.      Well long story short; two of my four bridesmaids came last night, and two other friends.  I was happy that they came, and I got some very appreciated gifts from them... but it was hard to not feel slighted at the actions of all those 15+ people who blew off my bridal shower.      What made everything really awful was after everyone was gone at about 11:30 at night, I had a hefty pile of unused game prizes(we didn't have enough people for the games the girls had planned), a kitchen table full of all kinds of handmade food from the girls... and a mess to clean up all by myself.      I don't think anything has ever hurt me so much as knowing that my bridal shower meant nothing to all those people blew me off.      So my question is... how would you handle this?

20090222155049AAXfoJx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls why would you do this to your crush?	You ask about him to his friends, when he's around in a group you want him to stay, you act nervous at times around him body language etc, speak very loud to get his attention when he's in the same place as you.      But you will not talk to him, avoid him, rather than talking to him you talk to other guys and about other guys so he can hear you, when your crush tries talking to you are mean to him?      Yeah I'm confused!

20090222155247AAy9oEg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS SHE CHEATING ON ME?	Hi, i kinda am concerned about something... My girlfriend! k so we have known each other since grade 3 and now were in grade 8 moving on to high school. We liked each other since the first time we looked at each other in grade 3... i had always gone to her house in that year until the last day of that school year... we got out of school and while we were going home, on the bus she cried (we live pretty close). When we got out she told me to get to her house later on that day... unfortunately i was in trouble that day and stayed home for the rest of the day, i didn't call her cuz i really never liked calling... (it is summer vacation) i got to her house and knocked on the door... she moved homes and schools ...its been a whole year grade 4 i had that of her and i never forgot about her... grade 4 i also moved and moved schools. At the time i thought there might be a chance i would gotten to see her again... this was my first time moving so i never knew what i was going to expect... sadly she wasn't there... Grade 5 i was middle of the school year and just when we were going to go to gym to listen to other peoples speeches the teacher tells the class we have a new student... it was some guy... but when later on we got another new student that was late while the class was going to the gym... it was her... the one i loved. The strange  part was i prayed to see her again the day before... that is a reason why i am so religious now. So we haven't talked much threw the years til grade 8 but we did do projects together which got us closer but ether way we still didn't talk... later on in grade 7 a boy started going to our school and turning up to being a very good friend... he led me into getting to be with the girl i loved.. it came up to valentines day and we had a dance at our school ... i got to dance with her and from that day we've been dating but STILL we dont talk as much... is it becuse im shy or what? mabye cuz shes in another class( I'm in 8B and shes in 8A)... and finally its coming to the point of all this... one of my friends told me she talks a lot with another GUY! they flirt, talk , and *giggle*... i have seen it my self and hope its just something that I'm over reacting on but soon i will figure out but also would like some tips on what to do... ill keep you updated tho how it ends up...
20090222155324AAOnVst	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do I have reason to be upset....?	My husband and I have been married a little over a year now [together for 3yrs]. We have a son together who is 9months old. About 2 years ago I caught him cheating on me and since then I have not been able to bring myself to trust him...fully. So when he asks if its ok for him to go out with his friends for a "guy nights" we end up fighting. Considering the fact that I am a SAHM [stay at home mom] I dont have many friends here [all friends back home]. So I'm always stuck in the house. Also, he's getting ready to turn 26yrs old. His friends are 22, 23, 24, single guys with no kids. We were all friends before we had our son and with that I know that when they go out they are out to "get laid" and yes they have even tried to get my husband someone to sleep with right in front of me. My thing is that 1. i dont trust him and 2 i dont trust his friends. He complians about how all he wants to is hang out with the guys and lately its almost as thats all that important to him right now. to party. what about our son..what about me?? I dont ever go out and I dont complain either. Last night he got sooo upset that he said to me that if i dont start letting him out then we would have to get a divorce!!! Please help. Am I just being a child about it or do i have reason??

20090222061652AA58jCw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm worried, would you be pissed off if you were in my situation?	Hi, so everyone in my group of friends has just turned 18, old enough to go clubbing in the uk.   There's this girl in my group of friends who (don't get me wrong she's amazing) gets on really well with my boyfriend. I've told him that i'm worried about how well they get on etc.   They're all going clubbing next weekend (i'm the only one in the group who isn't old enough) and she's invited my boyfriend along.    7 girls...and my boyfriend.   Now, my question is...would you be pissed off if your boyfriend went, even though he knows how worried i feel about the situation?   (He knows i already have trust issues, my ex boyfriend of a year slept with my ex bestfriend when we were together a little while ago, so i'm a little, let's say...insecure which sucks, blah blah blah)   anyway, i'm rambling, so i hope that makes sense.. :s   xx
20090222092126AAhhOtI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me and My Friend are Both Girls and I Like her!?	There's just this strong feeling that I have towards her. It's so powerful. The problem is that she doesn't know that I'm gay. I don't know if she is either. I told her I like someone and give her hints. What she doesn't know is that the person is really her. I would come up with a fake name like Never Wet. Her initals are NW. I'd describe her too and she wouldn't get it. She danced with someone and asked if the person I liked danced with someone. So I said yes. She gave me a list of people who danced with someone at the school dance. She came across a boy she danced with and I stutterd. She asked if I was jelouse of this boy. I said I wasn't exactly jelouse of the boy. Then she a had this really soft and relaxing voice and said, "It was the girl he was dancing with isn't it." I became quiet and said no. She said she's open about me being gay and all but it's still kinda wierd. When she first started guessing who I liked she asked if it was her. Then she said, "That would be kind of creepy." I said,"Yea it would be creepy wouldn't it." But she said it all nervously. We would a lot of the time talk about the topic of gay. She would always be open about if i was gay. She's never dated a boy (shocking b/c she's popular and pretty) but she had a crush on a boy since second grade. She said she's over him.        So how do I know if she likes me back or if there's a chance or if she even likes girls in general? When would the perfect place and time to tell her about my feelings toward her? How do I start a conversation that would lead to that? I just feel such an intence connection between her and I. When i stare into her eyes it's so mezmorizing. She has this amazing soft voice that gently makes me feel better. She herself is so amazing but it's only fair to let her know about what's going on.

Its Really annoying being mistaken for about 12-14, what age do I look, I will tell you my actual age when I get a few replies.   My mates all look about 17+ and can get into bars and clubs. but when i get refused we all have to head to houses and street corners like common chavs. I've tried dressing smarter and growing a bit of facial hair lol, but nothing seems to work. I wear black shirts, jeans and brown leather shoes / suede. What else can I try?   P.S. This is also a big problem when socialising with girls cause they say they would talk to me if i looked a bit older.

My boyfriend has a friend who is full of hate and drinks so much he has had to have an intervention with him many times. The first time I met him which was a few months after my bf and I started dating his friend got drunk and disrespected me. This same friend has caused many issues - he got a divorce and beat his wife etc - I personally would like to run him over with my car but I more than tolerate his snide remarks to me and his actions.      So - everytime they are around each other or alone I get totally disrespected. I just told my BF that the guy came out and said he hated me....      Am I wrong to be hurt that my BF wont stand up for me? What is the appropriate thing to do?

We have a messed up social skills because of her. I am a very social person, everyone wants to hang out with me, but she is not, she doesnt have friends at all, I started to notice that a lot. in the beggining I didnt know why. But now we started hanging out w her brother and his GF and, F$U*(K, both my wife and his GF are like constantly fighting on what we gonna do, they fight on the music, on when we gonna eat, and every silly small thing, they dont explictly say it, but you feel the tension in the car, and honestly, at times I felt like beating the s%hit out of them, just to let them shut the f*U*&K up, they are so annoying. And the thing is is that I really dont like hanging out with any of them, I just wanna go home and do my stuff, but if I tell this to my wife, holly molly christ almighty. The worst part is that we would sit in the car the four of us and would just lsn to music sometimes without talking, its like they are waiting for me to start a conversations, and i am like comon now, you lived all your life together and thats ur girlfriend, you've got to have things you know about each other more than me.I dont know I think am just Venting.   I feel trapped. I miss my freedom, and you'd probably tell me to o hang out with the guys, I did that last week and went home tipsy and cheerful, and what do you think happened next day, exactly, so many fights, its like she is jelouse of me having some good time. If I tell her I wanna go out with ma friends, she would be like I wanna come with, but I dont want her to be with me, coz i wouldnt be comfortable with them, I mean WTF?

20090222124029AAhgK2i	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to decide a date...besides knocking your fiancee unconscious, and hoping he forgets?	We haven't picked a date yet.  My fiancee wants next month, and I want December lol.  Two dates...complete opposites.        I want December for 2 reasons.  LAST year before he "really" proposed, he said we should get married on Dec 31st.  Because its the end of the year as a couple, and we will wake up in a new year with a new life together forever.    Apparently he was joking, but he pretty much sold me on the date haha   And secondly I would really like to lose some more weight.  It seems shallow, but I don't want to look back on our special day and think...why did you marry a whale?  I know he doesn't care, but I do.  I mean the date would be set, so if I don't do it I wouldn't cancel, but at least give me a chance haha      He wants next month because its the same month as our anniversary now.  And because he doesn't want to wait that long to be married and show his love for me (awww)        btw, we already live together so there really isn't a big rush.      Any tips for how to compromise?

But at school he doesn't really act like a friend anymore, we just sometimes talk for a little while, and then leave. My friend made us hug a few times, and one time he said "It's been too long...." and I just said "...Yeahh." I get too shy to talk to him, and I don't wanna keep begging my friend to make us hug. I just want us the way we used to be..best friends talking a lot, having good times and hugging when we see each other in the hallways..      ?;thanks.

This girl I've been dating for a couple months now has been very busy this week. Normaly she would still find the time to text me or text me back but hasn't really been too communicative this week. I asked her a couple days ago if she wanted to hang out this next coming week and she said "yes definitely", gave me a quick update then headed off for work. I decided I need to give her some space.

Then I saw that he was on his myspace & he told me that he doesn't know what time he would get off work. BS again b/c he was home early. He told me that he wanted to hangout soon hopefully but never does. I texted him saying why am I even friends with someone who never responds back or makes an effort. I was going to tell you that I liked you but see theres no point b/c you lie & never have the guts to respond to my texts. No response. Then I said I'm not going to be friends with someone who can't be a friend back. I have taken him back tons of time but not this time. This is the last time you will hear from me.    Then he texts the next morning saying :Uh I definitely just got all those texts...If you don't wanna be my friend that's fine. I told you so many times I just wanted to be friends but i guess you didn't really catch that point. I apologize if you feels like I've wrong you & I wish you the best. Is that a bunch of BS or what?

20090222113343AA4IoaE	Family & Relationships;Friends	So I have a huge problem?	Ok, to make a long story short, my friend gave me a box to ship to UPS. He gave it to me cuz he knew that the UPS is coming to my house to pick up my Xbox.      Anyways, while I was away from home, my brother opened the box not knowing that it's my friends, and he saw a jacket inside. He thought it was mine, so he just hung it up on one of the racks. The UPS came, and I wasn't home, so my mom only have my package without giving my friend's package.      Moving on, this package had a label with a experation date which I didn't know about. The label is expired, and it costs like $20. Without it, you can't ship the box.       What should I do? I didn't tell my friend yet, because if I do, he'll get REALLY, REALLY angry. I have this box on my hands, and I don't know what to do with it.       Your thoughts?

20090222114709AACsbYJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do u think she is wrong 4 this?	ok so ALL summer my moms friend would drop her kids off at my house and i would be stuck babysitting. the only problem was that she didnt pay me. she has been leaving them with me 4 about a year now and when she knew my mom needed some shopping 2 do, she would buy her kids happy meals and drop them off and they would eat them in front of my younger siblings. i personally think this is wrong because when we had a refridgerator full off food she didnt send them with food. so i thought that it would be only fair if she got me and each of my siblings (4) something from the dollar menu at least because its only $4 (and its the least she could do considering that she NEVER pays me and that these kids sleep over my house all the time and i take care of them.) am i wrong for thinking that this woman owes me some sort of child support check??? lol i talked 2 my mom about it but at 15 theres not much you can say 2 an adult and not get popped in the lip ya know? so please tell me what you think =] (by the way, her children are 5 and 8...and they are NOT what you would call WELL BEHAVED).

He was going to a bar with his friends so I told him I would drop by after work. I work with severally autistic children. I have worked there for about 3 years part-time just for 'fun'. It is not my primary job. I love the kids I work with more then anything and I my love my job. It is not my primary job.      I did not know any of my friend's friends at the bar and there were about 5 of them there sitting around having beers. I sat down after intros and my friend said "how was work, did anyone pee on you" (this happens once and a while at work) I typically don't talk about were I work to people I don't know, especially not 20 something year old guys who are drinking but my friend would not have known this and was just trying to get a laugh.       I also don't appreciate the word 'retarded' and get very mad when it is used about my kids. My friend knows this and once and a while he will say it to get a rise out of me (I am a passive, easy going person and this is one of the few things that gets me very worked up).       So for about an hour or so I hear stories on and off about "retarded" people and how funny this is. I was being tolerate as I could-being that they were all drunk and laughing each other on. Finally one of my friend's friends who was sitting net to me crossed the line and said something to me like "Do your retarded kids eat there poo?" (or something along those lines) I had a high ball and it was pretty much empty just ice in the bottom of the glass, so I tossed it at him. He then poured a better part of a pint of beer on my lap! Everyone laughed. I was kind of shocked and trying to laugh it off but was mad. I pointed out that I tossed some ice on his shoulder and he dumped a pint of beer on my lap and that was not 'fair'. He then said "Ice melts you stupid *****". Everyone laughed in shock. I was just stunned and sat there waiting for something to happen like an apology but he just looked ahead like he was so mad and couldn't even bare to look at me.       I gave my friend a hug wished him a happy bday and left.       On my way home I just kept getting angrier at this jerk for pouring beer on me. My self for not kicking his butt. And then I started to get mad at my friend for starting the whole "retarded" thing and for not saying anything to his friend. On my way home my friend sent me a texted saying “hey i am sorry”.      I am so mad at the whole situation. Everyone made fun of my job, I got beer dumped on me and was called a stupid *****. My friend is now in Mexico for a week so I have time to think about all this but my question is should I be made at my friend for his part in all this? He did start and continue the ‘retarded’ thing knowing I hate it and didn’t say anything to his friend. What should I do? I am really really mad.       Thanks for reading sorry if I was babbling. Please share any thoughts you have.

Shes in love with her friend, and shes worried that shes becoming obsessive or like a stalker... the guy apparently already has this obsessive ex who follows him around alot and all that jazz. && my friend doesnt want to be like that too. So she asked me whether or not she was, but I have no idea so im asking you all what you think... This is what she does...      She says this...   she thinks about him all the time, including daydreaming and well dreaming.   she worries about him 24/7   she likes to look at him   she checks his facebook and msn to see if hes on.   she says she also tells him stuff she never tells anyone else because she feels safe with him or something.   && she says she talks about him sometimes with friends...         so i told her i wasnt really sure if she was becoming obsessive or anything and she doesnt want to make him uncomfortable so I told her I'd ask on here... so let me know what you think...

20090222115741AAS8qri	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice? And do you think this is creepy?	There is this boy. My friend and I really want to get to know him. He isn't very popular. I mean, he's cool but he doesn't have a ton of friends. He just seems like the kind of person we would have a ton of fun with. The thing is, we don't know him. Like we see him in the hallway sometimes and his best "bud" (apparently different than best friend) really likes one of our good friends. So we were talking to this best "bud" and he was telling us alot about him. But.. we have no idea how to get to know this guy. We don't like him, we just really want to be friends with him. First of all, is this creepy? And secondly, how would you suggest going about getting to know this kid? He's older than us but most of the people he hangs out with are younger than he is. Our school is HUGE.

Now Jenna is mad at me for telling Kaela it was really her. Isn't that stupid? She's telling me to apologize to her even though I have nothing to apologize about.

But with this particular guy, I 'feel' him looking really deep into my eyes when i am talking to him and he locks me on the target with his eyes. he keeps looking on my face even if i finish my words.

20090222112139AAsmiTo	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Really confused about student/teacher relationship?	About six months ago, I started tenth grade. Since a little before then, I have been feeling depressed and down. I started to talk to a really great teacher at school and we have been talking for about five and a half months. She is a really cool person, and she is a teacher that every student really likes. As time went by, I kept feeling pretty depressed and stuff, and my teacher gave me her home and cell numbers and we would talk on the phone and on Facebook, especially when I was feeling real low. I have started to talk to a counselor at school, my teacher encouraged me to, but I am still chatting with my tacher. Lately, I have been seeing her in a motherly light, though. I think this could partially be because I lost my mother shortly after I was born, but also because I am close with the teacher. My question is - is okay for me to feel this way? I am just close to the teacher in a friendly way and she is kind of like a mother figure to me - it is nothing sexual or anything like that. So, it is okay for me to keep talking to my teacher and to feel close to her? And, should I tell her how I have been feeling - like she is a mother figure to me - or should I just leave things the way they are? Also, I am very scared about losing her - like after this year when she is no longer my teacher. I really really don't want this to happen and am not sure if I can handle it. Any advice on what to do? Sorry this is so long, but thanks for those who answer it seriously and honestly.

Hes in 7th and I am in 8th. He has alot of friends down my street, but that was before he knew me. Earlier this week, I saw him at a volleyball game at our school (afterschool) and he was looking at me then looked away suddenly, then again later but acted like he was looking at something else. He didn't say a word when we were by each other (my friend is friends with one of his friends that's why were all talking). he would look at me but i wouldn't look at him then he would like, to me, seemed nervous. He would look all around, but if i laughed or said something, he would look at me. I tried not to look at him, because I was nervous and I like him too. He is dating one of my friends :(. We live on the same road too. When he was dancing with her at the valentienes dance, i looked over and he was looking at me. then i looked away. i was nervous too! lol. We only know each other because my friends are friends with his friends and him. HELP PLEASE

I've been in a marriage that hasn't worked out.  We are seperated, he stays at his mom.  Last night I looked at his email,  I couldn't sleep so I was just looking not to expect to find anything.  But he had his most recent e-mail, one confirming to be a member on fling.com.  And it had confirmation of his password.  It stated to click on a link to confirm the new password so I did.  His homepage had his profile and his pasword was his employee badge number he uses for everything, and his b-day our zip code everything was him.  I wasn't upset over that, but the fact that He was seeking another MAN! just blew me away.  I don't know how to react but I feel hurt.  I drove over to his moms late last night and he was up and I confronted him and of coarse he denied it. I knew he was gonna deney iy, he didn't want his parents to hear. He was more embaressed than anything.  I was crying and I wanted him to confort me and he wouldn't.  He has acting very cold and distant. When I went towards him to touch him I though he would put his arms around me but he didm't want t o touch me, he ran off into his house and told me to leave cause he was gonna call the cops, I was so angry and hurt that he left me like that, I grabbed a tool from the back of his ttruck and busted his windows.  I am so stupid.  I totally flipped out, I didn't care at that point if I went to jail, I was so angry.  I feel so unloved, I want to hide under a rock and die.  Last night aroud 2 a.m. the cops came looking for me.  But I just didn't answer the front door.  So now I'm gonna go to jail and I'm just screwed.  Really, I'll loose my job and maybe even my daughter.  What do I do?  I've prayed and prayed I don't know what else to do. Help.

20090222124913AAQIJxO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why doesnt she want me to pole dance?	I was speaking to my mother the other day about the fact I started a pole dancing class which me and my friend now attend. I still do my regular job, and coursework. I asked my mum if I would be able to buy a aerobic pole to put in the gym, because there is loads of room, and, I would pay for it myself. She immediately came out with the fact it is a stripper's pole. I keep trying to reason with her, as I would never use it for those type of things, and all I really want to learn is the aerobic side, inverts, spins and flips. I understand that the poles are used in a lot of strip clubs, but that is not the reason why I would like to have one. The main reason was a friend of mine, showed me a video on metacafe, of a girl doing a dance on a aerobic pole, and personally, I thought she was absolutely amazing. I know this may seem like an ordinary row, but I don't understand why she didn't make a fuss of me going to the classes, but made a fuss of me actually wanting the pole?   Im so confused :S

And "everyone does it" that you have never once seen in real life because people you have come across don't do them?

20090222133048AAYQ78V	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would really just like some opinions on what i'm feeling?	k. so i dont know where to begin or how to put all of this shortly. but i'm going to try.      so my ex boyfriend told me he still liked me about a month ago. i was heartbroken when he broke up with me and couldnt stand it. when he told me he liked me again, i was the happiest girl ever and then we started going back out. this has been my best relationship ever..i hang out with him every weekend and we hang out with each others families and stuff. i feel really comfortable around him and his family now, and i think he feels the same with me. were constantly talking to each other and i love it. last weekend he kissed me, then i started wondering things. ever since then, i have been having really stupid thoughts. all because that when we kissed, i didnt really feel any 'magic' or whatever, you know, like in movies. it was both of our first kiss.haha, it was just really awkward and stuff. i started wondering why i didnt feel sparks and magic if i liked him so much. then as the week went by i forgot about that. but then on friday, we kissed again [more this time, because we were both trying to figure out what to do. haha]. it was so awkward, but i guess you would say i liked it. when we stood up, and he had to leave, we held hands and kissed again, and i really liked that one.....i felt semi-magic i guess. but not like real sparks or anything. i want to kiss him so badly again, but im afraid ill get these thoughts in my head again that tell me i should be feeling magic, or i should break up with him.  the thing is that i really like him. i look forward to  being with him and seeing him. he makes me so happy, and the other night he told me he loved me. and he isnt just the kinda guy who would say that without meaning it. and i told him i love him too, i really could see us spending our whole life together [NO im NOT just saying that!]. but then the kissing thought comes back to me. i'm afraid that just because im not feeling magic means something bad. when we hold hands, i love it and i kinda feel something, but when we kiss, i guess just not really. but i look forward to doing it. do you think its just cause we are both so inexperienced that we just dont know how to feel anything yet?       please help me. please. ive been thinking about this constantly..and i keep crying about it. stupid, i know, but i just dont understand why im not feeing anything if i like him so incredibly much. do you think once we kiss more ill start to feel something?      PLEASE HELP.    thank you[=
20090222141057AAjPQUx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does clothing affect friendship?	Does it?      because my "friends" ware black all the time,ware skateboarding shoes, bracelets, necklaces and other emo/goth clothing.       I'm not against this stuff,      and i ware normal things like blue or red things and don't ware braclets and stuff.      and they make comments on how my clothing sucks and how boring it is.      there the type of people that would spend 25 dollars on a shirt that has "element" on it.      i'm a guy that just buys cheap things, you only need something to ware not anything special.      can this affect your relationship with someone just because you ware different clothing?

20090222125817AAeb4xe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help - what do you make of this?	i have a very complicated relationship w/a guy for over a year now. i can't commit fully and he has issues of his own. He called me last night and we talked for over 3 hours. At one point in the conversation he said "I love you, have I told you lately that I love you" after that he mentioned how lately he knows when he texts me or responds to my text that he is cold and that he could take the extra few seconds to add something sweet.       That my messages touch his heart and motivate his day and it makes him feel bad that he doesn't return with the same kindness but that he is holding back so he doesn't confuse me or himself further. Than he asked "should I say those things to you I mean for some reason it makes me feel uncomfortable I do feel those nice sweet things but now for some reason feel uncomfortable to say them...do you think i should say them?"       I told him that he should do whatever makes him feel comfortable. I am so confused as to what he meant and why he would say this. I tried to ask but he didn't really want to get into it further....what do you make of what he said to me??

20090222134224AAPtayQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What are some good websites about abusive relationships?	Someone very close to me is in an abusive relationship so I've decided to do some research for this person and give it to them. I need a list of websites that have photos and stories of abuse, stories and photos of abusive relationships that have ended in murder- statistics/percentage of those relationships that have ended in murder, facts on what they have to do to change and a percentage/statistic of them who will never change. I also really need a website with the pictures. I'm not trying to exploit those who have been abused, I'm just trying to make that person remember what their significant other put them through and how much worse it will get, because it does in fact get worse each time you go back. This is very important to me-this person means the world to me so I really need some sound/educated/researched help. No vague/misguided answers.

We've been friends for like 8 months and we really get along well with each other. He knows I'm waiting for a guy (also our friend) and I would even cry to him when things went wrong. But recently, he came up to me and confessed he likes us to be more than friends. It's not that I don't want to give him a chance, I just think it can ruin our friendship  knowing that I'm in love with someone else. How can I effectively turn him down and the friendship stays? Or should I turn him down in the first place?
20090222140828AAer5ly	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Grade this for me/help with correction?	Please telll me if I need any corrections or should add/change something      Prompt:   "Each candidate for admission to the collegiate studies program possesses qualities not necessarily found on an application form or teacher recommendation.Select a topic of your choice that you believe will give the collegiate studies selection team a deeper understanding of the goals and values you cherish."   I chose my topic to be my drive to do well and achieve high grades in school. As in, not being influenced by your surroundings and following what you believe to be right.      Here is what I wrote:   " Being driven to achieve what you desire is a valuable quality not found in many teenagers or adults. As a student, I’m driven to do my best in all subjects. Although many students struggle to keep their priorities in order, I recognize that I must stay focused in order to acquire my goals.   Above all, there is one thing I value most- my grades. I give all effort to accomplish high scores on tests and graded homework. Also, I give my best attempt to follow through with finishing my work knowing I’ve obtained the best grade I can for my efforts. No matter what stress I may be under from other activities taking place in my life, I always take the amount of time needed to study and make sure my homework is of the best quality I can achieve.   As with my value of grades, I also value independence and not being influenced by others. I strive to only follow what I consider to be ethical to stay on the path that I’m on. Concentrating on accomplishing all A’s through high school and graduating college is of high importance to me.    Along with my most important values are my goals. As I have through middle school, throughout high school I wish to do entirely what it takes to accomplish the grades I know I am able to get. Additionally, I anticipate going onto college and continuing my education and pursuing the highest degree I believe I can reach for any career I may choose to do.   My drive to do the best possible for myself is what pushes me to work hard and attain the highest grades I am capable of. Once I have my mind set on making an A, I will do anything it takes to obtain the grade. Unlike most teenagers my age, I am not influenced or persuaded easily. I follow my values and concentrate on what I believe is right for myself and not what another wants of me. "

20090222130917AAaje5X	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would my Friend act like this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarten and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. then when we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward to me.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure?"      I reply, "Yes, I'm 100% sure you did. Don't you remember? You seriously don't remember?"      Then she says, "Not really, I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile on her and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      When we do hang out every now and then we're still good friends and get along fine. I just don't understand why she's acting like this when we're apart.

20090222130818AAT8bIH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	MAKE IT WORK OR RUN LIKE HELL, WHAT DO U THINK?	Ok here goes. I have a question that I want honest answers to. I  have lived with forabout 31/2 years now. We live with my two teen children and his son comes to visit on weekends. Sounds great doesnt it. Well not so great it is!!! I am more and more frustrated with our situation as time goes by. I want people on both sides of  a situation like this to give me your honest opinions. The problem is that I feel used a majority of the time and I am not sure how to express it. The reason I feel used is because I am not able to express to my boyfriend anything in regards to the visitation schedule or anything that oocurs in our life that is about his son. His son's mother regularly cancels the court ordered visitation at the last minute which in and of itself causes our home to be disrupted. You as why. The why is because my boyfriend is exhausted with trying to fight for his visitation weekends so when she does prevent the visitation then my boyfriend spends the weekend depressed and to himself. It causes our home to be a most unpleasant place to be. Then when we do get visitation it as well becomes miserable. His son's mother calls our phone 8-10 times a day. She will become hysterical and show up at our front door if we do not answer the phone for a few hours. She also dictates what we do the entire weekend. My boyfriend has to get permission for every move we make and he does not realize that this is not a way that most people live. Last summer we packed up the van and were headed to the lake with the kids only to have her call and demand that we bring her son home immediately. Only later did I find out that my boyfriend out of trying to respect her wishes in regards to being informed about what her son was doing had told her of our plans the night beofre. So, of course she destroyed the outing. I am so mad I could lose my mind. If I try to say anything then my boyfriend feels like I am trying to butt in where I dont belong when it comes to the business of his son. While I will agree that it is their son to raise and not mine I also feel used when I get last minute calls on Friday afternoons where my boyfriend says Hey I just found out I am getting my son this weekend and he wants me to drop everything and all plans to aqccomadate the situation and vice versa cancel all plans when he suddenly does noit get his son. WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I DO???

20090222142505AAPN5jP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't want him in her life, HELP??!?	My ex-boyfriend got me pregnant on purpose trying to save our relationship. However it didn't work so now he wants nothing to do with the baby, and I want to keep it that way. I want to make a contract with him that says I will never come after him for child support, as long as he gives up his rights to see her unless I allow it.       I know for him to legally give up his rights I have to have someone ready to adopt her, and I can't sign away her rights for support from him. But the contract will be between me and him that says if he tries to see her with out my say so, he is then required to give me child support, or if I go after him for child support he has the right for custody. That way I know he has no rights unless he breaks the contract, and I know that later on if I find someone who wants to be her dad and is worth it, he can adopt her, and he will be the only father she ever knows.       I am positive he would sign the contract. But I’m not sure if there is another way or if this will even work. Any other ideas?

20090222125951AAgP6zf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is she not having sex with her husband?	4 years friends, she's married, i'm not, she pursued me, we hooked up, took a break so she could work on the marriage, she decided she wants me more than him.  A year ago she said she hates when he touches her.  About a month later she commented towards the fact that she isn't having sex with him. She avoids him by sleeping with her daughters.  She is sticking to this story that she isn't having sex with him, and not even sleeping with him.  They've been married 8 years, have 2 kids, and apparently no sex for a year.  Also, he is very civil with her, amazingly!  Is this something that happens ever?  Does anyone know of married people not sharing a bed or having sex for a year without just getting divorced?  And does this mean a divorce is in the near future?  It doesn't matter if i beleive her or not, i just wanna know if this is something that could be true.
20090222140814AAoaSg7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	PLEASE HELP?! What do you think?	If you were engaged to someone but started to doubt your relationship what would you do? If you met someone while you were engaged and started to have feelings for that person would you call off your engagement? Do you think if you have feelings for someone else while you are in a relationship that maybe you don't love your partner as much as you thought?      The reason I'm asking is because I was engaged but for the whole year we were engaged I felt like things kind of went down hill. We saw each other 3-4 days out of the week but would fight every day we were together. I know people fight but doing it every day isn't healthy. Well at least I don't think so. A few months ago we ended things. I started the argument but I had to be honest with him about how I felt. I couldn't keep it in any longer. I just told him that I felt like things weren't like how they were when we first started dating. I was afraid things were just going to be the same or get worse. I'm not sure how to fix things. That's pretty much sums it up. At first I didn't want to break up but then I thought maybe it was something that we needed to do. I just had this gut feeling. I feel so guilty. I still love him more than anything. He was my first love so I know it's going to be hard to get over. Do you think I made a mistake? Maybe I shouldn't have told him how I really felt?

20090222134448AAi6FSB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am 19years old and have been in abusive relationship for 4 years, i now have a 10 month old son?	I have been with my partner for four years now. At times he can be very loving, other times he is emotionally and physically abusive.       The first time he hurt me he threw me up against a wall and strangled me so hard i couldnt breathe. He then appoligised and said he would not do it again. He doesnt even apoligise anymore because it is "my fault" for some reason or another.      Some days he will just wake up in a bad mood yelling and screaming about something so small like there is no cold soft drink in the fridge.    Before i got pregnant i was going to leave him. But then i found out i was pregnant i just couldnt i had to give him a chance.    Well things have just gotten worse since then, when i was pregnant he got so angry, i forget what over, but he chased me into my bedroom and dragged me off the bed and strangled me so hard i couldnt breath (mind you i was around 7 months pregnant).       Now that my son is born he just yells and swears all the time. All weekend he was in a bad mood.  On saturday i tried to leave but he took my son out of my arms and wouldnt let me put anything in the car. While holding my son he was yelling swearing and pinned me down on the lounge so i couldnt leave.      It scared me so much that my son will grown up thinking this is normal. My partner thinks all relationship have fights like this because that is what he grew up with (long storey cut short, HIS mum is a drug addict, has 8 kids none in her care most in docs, and a very vioilent woman, my partner raised himself and all his sister and brothers until they went to foster homes) His mother and i do not get along because "i stole her son" after her attacking me while i was pregnant as well, trying to break into my house when im home alone with my son to attack me and destroying my car, i have finally gotten an AVO against her which my partner is not happy about. Mind you this is a VERY large woman and has been to jail.     My partner is also very much addicted to pot and alcohol. Alot of our money every week goes on his habbits, i give him almost half my pay for it because if i dont he would be a nightmare to live with.       He constantly yells and me and puts me down. I dont even want to have sex with him anymore but he forces me to.      I dont know what to do, i want to leave but HOW? where do i go? Everything in my house is mine, eg furtniture, dining set so on...i cant afford to start all over again.  I love him but im not in love with him. I dont want my son growing up in this physically and emotionally abusive relationship. But then i dont want him growing up without his dad. And if i did leave i couldnt stand to think that he had visits alone with my son and his mother around my innocent baby boy.       I have this fantasy of when he is at work one day packing up the whole house and moving far far away to the country and changing my name so he will never find me. He says if i ever leave he will hunt me down and shoot me.     Sorry this is such a long post i could go on forever i have so much to say. Please give me some advice.
20090222132829AApzAsY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married and curious question?	What happens when you are in a marriage for almost 5 years and you feel that your spouse is mean to you all the time and talks down to you. There are more unhappy moments than happy moments, but you are the one that is financially dependent on the other person, have no where to go and is falling in love with a person you have only known for 3 weeks?

20090222141212AANYUAs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am i a really mean person?????????????help?	ok so last year i transferred to a new school and met some friends one day one of my friends became so mean to me that i couldnt stand it anymore.i thought that i was going to explode.this year she acted a little bit nicer because her friend realy likes me.she still treated me like crap though.when i got closer to my friends they told me how before i came to the school she treated them likecrap too.she used to brag alot and critisize them.then when i came she focused all of her meanness on me.so one day(about a week from today) i came home from school really angry at this girl.then this idea came to me.this crazy stupid idea.my sister just got a new phone and this girl didnt know the nuber yet so i texted her pretending to be the boy she secretly likes.i texted her saying hi this is yadayadayada and she went crazy.first she called me and asked what she should tell him cause she thought i was like really smart and romantic or whatever.i told her to calm down and text what she feels.later that night my sister went over her friends house and started to text her saying how much she loves her or whatever (a bunch of gushy stuff)then when found out i felt gulty but went along with it. i texted  saying a scene from romeo and juliet and then i wrote the lyrics from (love bug) and a bunch of funny things and she replied in a way that really freaked me out.she replied saying how much she loved me(the guy she likes) i thought that if i broke up with her it would make her really emotional and she would start crying and going crazy and mabye she would go to this boy and go crazy on him.now i dont know what to do i stopped texting her and she couldnt stop texting me saying hello,your there,hi my love,why dont you answer me.and the truth is i dont know what to reply      i thought about letting her down easy.what do you think?am i mean?am i a bi**h?please tell my the truth and be honest!what do you think?
20090222131723AA72jzf	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does HE LIKE ME? *shy guy.?	So there is this boy that I like. He is really cute and nice. He knows who I am, and we have hung out in big groups of friends before, but on rare occasions.  He always looks at me and then looks away when I see him staring.  Or he will look and pretend to be looking or at something else, or maybe he is looking at something else? I'm not sure! Next hint: he is very quiet when we are like near each other. He tries not to look at me and kinda acts like hes out of the conversation. When I start to talk he either acts like he doesn't listen, or really does listen, but just trys to be cool and doesnt really pay attention. I KNOW U HEAR THIS QUEATION ALL THE TIME BUT DOES HE LIKE ME?

20090202080335AAPKJ0w	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need an opinion... ?	Ok so I have been in this amazing relationship with my boyfriend for a few months now. Already we are much closer than I ever was with my Ex of four years.. its a normal happy relationship.      Here is my delima he is still friends with his ex, and this is his most recent ex. He was with her for a year before me and they had been split up about 6months before I ever came around. The reason he has to be civil with her is her brother is a good friend of his and his roommate and she comes to their house occasionally with her parents.       I knew from the start this would be trouble because Females always want what they cant have, so when they see someone they use to have happy, and they always think they can get them back and when they cant they try harder.       He came to me last night and told me a week ago she confessed her love to him again (blah blah) and she wanted him back. He told her no, I am happy with my girl friend and I want to be with her so I'm sorry but its not gonna happen. The funny thing to all of this is she has been all over a bunch of other guys recently, my girlfriends have seen her all over at least 3 different guys in the past few months. Which is fine its her business, but it proves my point. Females want what they cant have.       He says they still have to stay cool because he lives with her brother and until he moves out he cant treat her badly. Still I don't like it. I delt with this with my ex of 4 years. He tried being friends with his ex and the girl tried and tried to get him back and I ended up having to give him an  ultimatum, basically her or me. and he chose me, but because of my past experiances its extremely hard to be ok with this.       I'm not friends with my ex for the same reason, because he will try to be back with me. So to save my bf from the bs I stay away from him. I would love to be able to be his friend and have no commitment but he cant accept that we can't be more so I stay away.      I feel like she is gonna try to get him back in any way she can, by coming over to his house dressed up, txting him, acting like a regular ditzy chick who wants attention, she is known for that.       What would you ladies or fellas do?       By the way we are very happy and we get along very well. I do trust him, but I don't trust her at all.
20090222130422AAjBsLz	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm confused and i'm in dire need of some good advice...?	For the past month i've been pretty depressed. There's this girl, whom i've liked for a long time, but i've been adult enough to accept the just friends option, and it's actually been great, we've been best friends. I can honestly say she is the most important person to me, but things have been really difficult lately. I have two other guy friends, now both of these guys (who are my supposed "friends") have their own girlfriends (two really nice girls in different classes than ours). So me, this girl and these two other guys are all in the same class, and i WAS best friend with this unbelievably amazing girl, until these two guys came in. They are (or were) my friends, but they've secretly liked this girl forever, and they blatantly flirt with her constantly and hug her and stuff; it looks so wrong. They have their own girlfriends, they shouldn't be doing that. They've became so close to this girl, that i've been butted out completely. One of the guys told me to just accept it and i was like "wow, that's crazy, you want me to just give up the most important person to me" and he says "pretty much". So for the past few weeks, i see these two guys hover over this girl with constant flirts and hugs, and these two are not respectful at all, they have sick fantasies with this girl that they openly discuss with other dudes, and i[ve heard them and they are GROSS. I hate to hear this over someone i respect and love for who they are, not just for their body, which is undoubtedly how these other two feel. She has no idea about what they think and how much they wanna "do" her. So what i'm basically asking, isn't it wrong for these to guys to do this seeing that they have two nice girlfriends and they are destroying my friendship with my best friend. What do i do?

She's supposed to be coming over for a sleepover and I call her to see when she's coming and her mom answers the phone. She's just like "oh, um.... she's not here right now." and that's normal, even though she sounded really suspicious. Later, I call again and my friend answers. She says she's sick and won't be at school for a few days. The next day she IS at school but she won't talk to me. And I wonder if I should just forget about her and move on. PLEASE HELP!

20090222131836AABSpqW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Best friend trouble. BIG TIME. Help!?	Okay, this is an extremely long story. But, I'll try and make it short. My best friend has a boyfriend of.. 5 months. Who she spends an absurd amount of time with. To the point where, I really can't take it anymore. Now, her boyfriend and I don't like each other. At all. But, we can manage stay civil while we're around each other. For the most part. Anyways, it's probably really hard for her to deal with us not liking each other, but I do the best I can to fix it. HE, on the other hand, sends me venomous texts saying that I don't treat her right, I don't see her for the amazing person she is, that I need to just leave her alone. SHE DOES NOTHING. At all. Well, now that I've given you some background, let me tell you what's going on:      Her mother has her on birth control. Just incase, I guess. Now, I have a feeling that they've had sex. Because I've casually or jokingly brought it up a few times and she hasn't denied it. Now, obviously asking her would be the wrong approach here, but I don't know what do do about any of this. She says she tells me everything, that she's always going to be there, the whole nine yards. But, she doesn't even answer my texts that often. If it were him, though. She answers his calls and whatever when we're out at the movies or hanging out. The few, few times that we do. So, please. If you can give me any advice what to do about all of this? How to find out if she has had sex with him? I feel like she would tell me, but I don't know what to think anymore. Or if you have advice on anything else? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)

20090222133006AAbTaLG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please help!! Do you think he was being honest? 10 points best answer!?	i have a very complicated relationship w/a guy for over a year now. i can't commit fully and he has issues of his own. He called me last night and we talked for over 3 hours. At one point in the conversation he said "I love you, have I told you lately that I love you" after that he mentioned how lately he knows when he texts me or responds to my text that he is cold and that he could take the extra few seconds to add something sweet.       That my messages touch his heart and motivate his day and it makes him feel bad that he doesn't return with the same kindness but that he is holding back so he doesn't confuse me or himself further. Than he asked "should I say those things to you I mean for some reason it makes me feel uncomfortable I do feel those nice sweet things but now for some reason feel uncomfortable to say them...do you think i should say them?"       I told him that he should do whatever makes him feel comfortable. I am so confused as to what he meant and why he would say this. I tried to ask but he didn't really want to get into it further....what do you make of what he said to me??

20090222140959AAFjU45	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why am I always so tired? I just don't get it.?	Okay, so I am 18 years old. A freshman in college. I typically wake up everyday between 8 and 9 (sometimes 10 and on weekends more like 1) get breakfast and start my day.   I have a very busy schedule, but I manage to work out 4-5 times a week (weights and cardio), I eat very well (a good balance of vegetables, starches, protein, and fats), but I always am exhausted. I try to get to bed between 12 and 2 also.   Being tired has started to effect my work, I just can't seem to focus or concentrate. Any ideas on how I could get through my day without using caffeine as a crutch? I just always want to sleep.   Also, I have been (due to dorm living) sick on and off for the last 3 months. I just feel like I'm in an underperforming funk - sometimes I get really down and upset about not working as hard as I should, it really angers me. Like I woke up today and was just tired and dizzy... Any thoughts?
20090222141928AANb6Uh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife wants a divorce, but I dont.. Can i change her mind?	ok let me start by saying i am 31, my wife is 36. This is both a second marriage for the both of us. Her first marriage was long and hard on her from what she is telling me. She was married for 13yrs and her ex-husband use to cheat on her regularly, and use to physically and verbally abuse her. She did not tell me the truth about how long she was out of her previous relationship before we started our relationship. she told me she had been out a year. but she had just went on a vacation with him in sept. and we began our seeing each other in december. the beginning of our relationship was filled with lies. first i had to decided not to come see her one night when i had gotten off work late and decided to go hang out with one of my buddies that lived closer to home because i didn't feel like making the long commute to her house that late at night after a 12 hour work day. well she text message me at about 5 in the morning to let me know that she was really hurt and wanted to kill herself. I didn't believe her at all. then about 8 in the morning i got a txt from the same phone claiming to be her sister at the hospital asking me if i knew why her sister was in the hospital for trying to kill herself. well i found out a few months later that it was all a lie and my wife was trying to play mind games with me. Then we came to a point in our relationship when my wife asked me did i ever want to have any more children. I have two boys now and i told her probably no. She said ok fine thats good because her tubes were tied anyway.  well as our time together went on i had mentioned that it would have been nice if we could have had a child together. Well at that point she told me that she had originally lied to me and that she could really have kids, meaning no tubal ligation. So i immediately    began my quest to get my wife pregnant. after a few weeks she had told me she was pregnant. then about a month later she told me she had a miscarriage. to make a long story short this went on for a few months and to come to find out she was lying to me again. her tubes were tied. i was devasted. so another lie. now what i did to her. i know that she is fragile and hurt from her prior relationship, which alot of the anger and pain she brought into our relationship. and i really messed up whenshe found out i had sent a message to a girl on myspace and told her how sexy she was. i had no further intentions then that tho. that was the end of the conversation. but my wife took it as i was cheating on her and she ran me thru pure hell. but i didnt mention i live in nyc.. the girl i sent the comment to lives in hawaii. so i meant nothing by it.           Well months have passed and things are progressively getting worse. I amtrying to make up for the times that I have hurt her and let her down but she still has the same negative attitude. she recently told me one day that she didnt wanna be with me anymore. so the next day i packed all my things and i moved out. and now i am stable and in a new apartment. but things are really hard on me because i really miss her. and i have found out she has made a close bond with a guy in the army who is over in iraq right now. she has deleted me off her myspace and my pictures and now she has a picture of him. it really hurt me. its not like its her man or anything cuz she just has him under pictures of friends. but it still hurts. but if i add any females to my myspace or get a comment from a female on my myspace then she calls me bitchin. she says we are suppose to go this thursday so that we can start the ball rolling on our divorce but i asked her the name of the place and where it is at and she cant tell me. sometimes she txts me and asks me do i miss her. and if i dont answer her txts and phone calls she starts to get very angry and throw fits and starts saying really mean things. she found out that i was going to hand out with some friends from work last night including a few girls that i work with and she threw another fit. i dont understand. if she doesnt wanna be with me and cant stand me and she has got her lilttle boy toy in iraq, oh did i mention he is only 22? only 3 yrs older then her oldest son. then why does she keep throwing these fits if im trying to move on with my life.. i am really starting to think that she is just pushing this divorce thing to the max trying to see what changes she cn bring out in me. maybe i am just grabing at anything i think can save my marriage. but i dunno. im frustrated. plz feel free to leave me any honest answers and positive feedback. and there are many other factors to this story that make it to long for me to sit here and type. as if it werent long enough. but if you would like to know the full story please feel free to give me a call and i will tell you everything. my number is three four seven two zero nine one eight six nine. my name is jay. thanks for reading all this.

20090222153705AA10V7L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE help. I'm really falling hard for this guy, I'm scared, should I take the risk?	I'm 19 years old & I've been dating a guy for 2 months. He's a year younger, which is new to me as I've always dated slightly older guys. To cut to the chase, I really, REALLY like this guy. I've only felt this way once before with my first bf aged 14. I was crazy about him, true "puppy love", & he broke my heart into a million pieces. I was young & naive, I've grown up alot, but since then although I've been in much longer, more mature or even more meaningful relationships, I've never again felt the exhilerating feelings I felt with that guy. Until now. I think I could easily fall for this guy. I've never been "in love" & I'm not even really sure what it means to be in love, but all I know is I talk about him constantly, when I'm not talking about him I'm thinking about him. I just love the way he is, the person he is, the things he says. But I'm petrified.      I have a real weakness for this guy & he could potentially really hurt me. I've had flings, romances, and a few meaningful relationships in my teenhood but I've never felt QUITE so vulnerable. I'm worried that he doesn't feel the same way about me. I know he likes me, I know he "fancies" me and I know he's definitely sexually attracted to me as he makes very clear. But I sometimes feel like it's largely physical for him, I wonder if he could actually feel these feelings for me. Sometimes when I think about it all I get so scared that I just want to tell him it's off, I can't date him, this can't go anywhere, because I'm almost certain I'll just get heartbroken.       Please help, I might sound pathetic but I'm just so confused right now. I just don't know what to do.
20090222144626AALYyra	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm not too sure......?	well i have friends, but it seems they're ALWAYS inviting someone else. for example, there's this group of choir people that always hang out (they're reallllly nice), and for some reason, they also like this one other girl, who is nothing like them and is such a b**** to me! I don't get it. They never invite me to any of the things they do, but at school, we talk and stuff. I just don't get it.   I'm in middle school.
20090222153647AAz6noe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IDK what to do now...?	I'm in high school and I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, he turns his head and looks the opposite direction. I told my friends about this and they said he's starting to like me. When I was walking slowly to 6th period a couple days ago, Shane walked past me. Then a couple of his friends walked next to me. One of them yelled Holy S*** in my face. Then he said "Sorry" in a joking way. After that, they left to catch up with Shane. Now every time I look at Shane, he's not the one who's looking at me, its his friends. What was up with that whole yelling thing?? Why are his friends always glancing at me? They never did that before. Does Shane like me?

20090222150950AAYhSrX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do you think my best friend and I drifted?	This one's pretty long, so if you've got the time and willpower, please proceed. Anyway,      Anyway, I've known this girl since we were still in preschool. We grew up together. We laughed together. We cried together; we even fought together. But none of that had altered our friendship - at least up until the past year or so. My mother (you could call her the 'kiss of death' or however you put it) and my friend's mother had formed a mutual friendship over the years as well. That was until the beginning of 2008. For one reason or another, my mother decided that my friend's mother was a total female dog and that she wouldn't have a thing to do with her, and in turn, my friend's mother wanted nothing to do with her, either, which significantly affected my relationship with my friend. We stopped hanging out, and eventually stopped talking altogether. I'm not really sure why my friend let our mothers' relationship affect our own. I've even tried on multiple occasions to contact her, but she has ignored all of these attempts. We haven't spoken since Spring 2008, except for an accidental run-in at a Halloween thing, which she only uttered the word "Hi" to me, then went off. Does anyone have any advice as to whether or not I should let it be? I've known her longer than I've known anyone else, and I would really hate to just leave her be. For the record, we don't go to the same school anymore nor do we hang with the same crowd.

Like if a friend/family slept with your boyfriend/girlfriend.  If you forgave them,   that is like giving them the okay to be with your boyfriends/girlfriends in the future.      You have to cut people like that loose for life, true?

20090222153155AAPJzif	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys! What do you think about "He's Just Not That into You"?	The book, the movie..       Basically, women make excuses for men like:   He's afraid to get hurt again.   Maybe he doesn't want to ruin the friendship.   Maybe he's intimidated by me.   He just got out of a relationship.      THe book says: Men are not complicated, although they'd like you to think they are. And there are no mixed messages.   "if a (sane) guy really likes you, there ain’t nothing that’s going to get in his way."      The truth may be He's just not that into you.      Guys, Do you agree with this? Do you think women should follow this advice?

20090222153017AAo4RQu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why on earth would a guy do this?	Hi.  I am so confused and hope that someone can answer this for me.  I have been dating this guy and two weeks ago he told me that he wanted to start dating me more and spending more time with me.  He even made a promise to me.  After that I didn't hear from him for 2 weeks. I sent him an email.  In the email I asked him why I hadn't heard from him and why we weren't talking.  We also work together.  He responded right back and told me that he has been busy recording new songs (this was on Wednesday).  Later that afternoon, he called me.  He was telling me all about his new music and how he wanted to give me one of his cds he made.  He was also asking me about when I worked again and was getting upset because me and him weren't working together.  Then, he told me about how he was having this show (which was Thursday night) and how he wanted me to come to it.  I told him that I would let him know.  Thursday morning before I went to work, I signed into Facebook and found out from someone else that this guy has been dating another girl and that she was going to be performing at the same place he was that night.  I didn't know what to think, so I sent him a text message asking him why he would want me there when I found out that he is dating another girl and she was going to be playing there.  He responded back saying that the only reason he invited me was to see him sing and it was simple. That was all he wrote.  I didn't respond to that text and I haven't spoke to him since then.  But, my question is why on earth would he do that? Why did he just 2 weeks ago make me that promise that he wanted to spend more time with me?  Was he trying to make me jealous, her jealous, did he want drama? Why did he do that? He didn't have no intentions of telling me about her.

20090222153633AAd3Hfg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me, or is she just playing games?	Hey, I've been getting really close to this girl over the last few months, we talk practically everyday and she seems very into me. However, she has never had a boyfriend but she is known as a very outgoing girl. At first, I didn't take her very seriously and I kind of turned down her requests to hang out and stuff but I have become really attracted it to her and I want to start hanging out and possibly start a relationship. The only problem is, as I've show more interest for her, she has kind of closed the door a little. For example, if I hint to her that I want to hang out she seems more hesitant and a little reluctant. Does she just want to be friends, does she actually like me or is she just playing games? Thanks so much for any help!

20090222153754AAuoGhe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to make creepy guy in bar go away?	i hate going to bars because i hate when men hit on me.  so recently at a bar with another woman and a man and im minding my own business  and some creepy loser starts making my friends talk to him both the guy and the girl and i can tell hes irritating them.  Meanwhile im trying to be as unapproachable as i can because it pisses me off.  But then its my turn to play pool and that stupid mf comes up to me and starts yapping and im walking away the whole time hes yapping.  i dont want to be RUDE!  but on the other hand hes got to get away from me.  not to mention the one word answers, the 'u r weird' faces and generally  obvious hints that hes unwelcome within 100 feet of me.  Finally i just tell him to f off.  then, of course rather than leaving he leers at me the whole time im there yelling that im a rude ***** and other insults.  I tried to ignore his presence and focus on playing pool with my other 2 friends and hes staring at me the whole time and sending some lady to tell me hello and planting his body right in my line of vision from my pool ball.  I wanted to beat the **** out of him.  i felt stalked.  i started by 1 i gave him hints to leave me alone   2 then i told him to leave me alone   3 then i started being rude to him   4 then i started flipping him off every time he 'forced' me to notice him   5 then i ignored him.   By the way, I was also wearing my wedding rings...   Please tell me how do I get rid of creepy over-confident bar stalkers?  What works?
