For example, i can get itchy rashes from too much contact with fake jewelry, belts, etc. I've heard that tongue piercings are more serious that other piercings because the tongue is connected to the heart in some way. Anyways, I was wondering if there's anyone out there that knows more about it and how safe tongue piercings actually are.

20090202222433AAb5kAv	Beauty & Style;Hair	I'm tired of this hair/scalp problem?	Hi, I'm 14 and my hair and scalp is pretty much effed up and I dunno why for the life of me. I'm a guy by the way, but I have long, "girly" hair. I don't know what to do. I don't really want to go to a dematologist or anything and I don't want to use any products that will make my hair even more disgusting while it works because I go to school every day.    - Hair -    My hair is dry. When I take a shower (it's a standing up only shower and the hose thing is stuck on there) I just let the water rinse it off usually because I don't really understand how to do it with my hands too. I think I use the appropriate amount of shampoo/conditoner but I am still unsure. I don't feel clean if I don't take a shower everyday. Should I just use 'enough' or should I have it on their so I can give myself exotic hairstyles? lol only way to explain it. maybe "foamy" is a good word. My hair is dry and my sister always yells at me saying I need to condition it but I do. Also when I get out of the shower after shampooing and conditioning I let my hair dry and sometimes it feels like it's wet and 'sticky' in certain parts of my hair. I don't get what is it? I'm positive I wash everything out too. I don't use ANY hair products or gels or anything. It seems to go away if I straighten it.    - Scalp -    Eww here is where It's bad and the real problem. I have some form of dandruff but It's like 'caked' on my scalp, it only comes off if I scratch and 'pull' it out with my fingers and nails. It is such a bad habit but I feel icky when I know it's there. Even grosser than that is I have some scabs I think came from scratching. But they are in the same spots all over my head, since I pick them off they just come back and back but It's too tempting not to. My scalp literately bleeds when this happens. Well it doesn't 'bleed' as in dripping but I did just have a scab there. The weird part is I don't know how this all started!!!    ugh help me i don't think my mom would even take me seriously anyway if i asked her to take me to the dermatologist

20070614094632AAvQuhC	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	A little help changing my style?	id really like to change my style but i need a little help. it seems like everything i buy is black (not goth but the classic simple black style) or a neutral color. im 19 and newly wed but despite being 5'6 120ibs im very self concious about my body. so i guess i tend to go for colors that camofluage. lol..anyway. id really like to change into a more colorful playful wardrobe. there are a few catches tho. i only wear skirts (love dresses)...and they need to hit the top of my knee at least. this makes it a bit difficult to wear those cute tunics and dresses. i also dont wear sleeveless. cap sleeves are good. i love colorful belts and heels. but im really liking the cute flats theyve been coming out with lately...if you could help me turn away from black or give me ideas to brighten up my VERY neutral wardrobe youd be my hero...with my husband now in iraq i need some cute new outfits too cheer myself up!

I am 5'10", so I am tall but not a giant and over the past two years my feelings towards being tall have gone from feeling proud and sexy to feeling ashamed and embarrassed. I don't know why. I think it's because I liked this guy who was tall but he turned me down and I later realized that he only liked short women. Anyway, I don't have problems finding a bf; my bf is actually a bit shorter than me. I am self-conscious about my height though and was wondering if there were any other tall women out there who can help me out and give me some tips on how to feel good about being tall.

Is there a specific reason why everyone, especially teenagers and young adults, seem to emphasize their hatred for crocs? Many times this supposed hatred comes from the reasoning that crocs are "ugly". Well, in my opinion, many things are ugly, and I'm sure many of you see ugly people and clothing all the time, but do you see me expressing my supposed hatred whenever the subject is brought up???    The logic and reasoning behind the public's dislike of crocs seem just ridiculous.     If anything, I'm interested in them ever since I first saw them about a year ago, especially since a number of individuals who use it, individuals with sound reasoning and a rational mind, vouch for things such as the croc's durability, comfort level, the grip it has on surfaces, etc.

20090203021224AAAfMm9	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Whats the best mascara for short and virtually straight lashes? ?	I have the same problem when buying any mascara. Even if I find one that gives me the slightest bit of length, it seems to drop if you know what I mean after an hour or so. I try curling my lashes and they do go quite curled but it still doesn't give me the length that I want. Is anyone in the same position?       I was looking at buying the Max Factor False Lash Effect mascara. Has anyone else with short lashes purchased this and liked the effects? Does it do what it says?       Or if not.. is there any other mascara suggestions?    I'd rather not pay loads, but I'm open to any.   Thanks :)

20060910014834AAqi63s	Beauty & Style;Hair	I have highlights/chunks but base color on my roots are lighter than the rest.?	I just got my hair colored by a friend of mine who studied cosmetology and she knows how to work with hair real well. The day I went to get my hair done, she needed to buy products for my hair but the store she goes to was closed so we went to a sally's beauty supply store instead.       My natural hair color is dark brown/black. I got highlights and chunks and the base color is a medium to light brown. The problem is my roots are a lighter shade. I know how it happened it's just that I want to be able to even out the color without removing the highlights. I love the way she did my highlights.       So is there any way I can even out my hair and still have the highlights to show. I don't mind if the highlights are toned down because right now, they're really yellowish and slightly but not so much orange. So I don't mind if evening it out will also cause the highlights to tone down.

20061112174211AAfTLnZ	Beauty & Style;Hair	To Hairstylists out there?	My friend organised for her boyfriend to get a body perm into his lank straight shoulder length hair earlier today unfortunately for him the perm made his hair very curly even with the stylist using large perm rods in it. The stylist then roller set his hair to make it less curly and has told him that he will need to roller set his hair every time that he washes it until the perm grows out.      Is this true and is there any way of reversing the perm without causing damage to his hair or will he need to shave it all off which he refuses to do
