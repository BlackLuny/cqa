20080704150540AAQk9me	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Transmission or Something Else?	88 Ford Taurus L 3.0L V6 FWD      The other night when I was driving I heard a loud pop from the front left of my car. It sounded like someone popping a paper bag full of air. For the rest of the night the car steered to the right and a light knocking sound came from the left tire area whenever the car coasted. I took it to a mechanic the next day. My first thoughts were that a CV joint, tie rod, strut, or shock had failed or broken, but I never told any of this to the mechanic because I didn't want to give him something to look for.      So I get a call back later in the day from the mechanic and he tells me that my suspension is perfectly fine, but that an "internal transmission differential carrier gear was damaged" (quoted from the estimate). This didn't sound right to me because the car drives perfectly: no problems with shifting, accelerating, over-revving, downshifting, etc.      He recommended replacing the transmission for $3000 (1000 for labor). Does any of this sound right? Thanks

Anteriormente ya les habia preguntado xq puede ser y cuanto puede costar la reparación del coche que me indicaron se desvielo. Lo que dijo el mecanico (con quien lo he llevado varias veces y no habia tenido problemas con el) es que lo que se "descompuso" fue la bomba del aceite y que entonces a pesar de que el coche tenia el aceite, no "subia" y por eso fue el roce de metal con metal, la elevacion de temperatura y finalmente que se desvielara. Desde el jueves 13 se llevo las piezas que se debian reparar y segun me dijo ayer le entregan el motor hasta el lunes porque habia una parte "cuarteada" y se tuvo que soldar. Para quien conoce mas de coches: esta explicación es lógica? puede ser esa la razón? si puede ser posible "tanto" da?o? realmente se requieren casi dos semanas para hacer esta reparación? Segun lo que dijo hasta ahorita serán 9000 pesos en total por la reparacion, es razonable este precio?   Por favor ayudenme con sus comentarios pues quiero ir aprendiendo mas y sobre todo que no me vean la cara.    El coche es un monza a?o 2000.

20061020014307AAYDdRq	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Pourquoi les gens ont ils si peur des radars automatiques.?	Si la vitesse est limitée à 90, vous n'avez pas besoin de ralentir jusqu'à 70 pour passer devant. Si vous respectiez tous les temps les vitesses, vous n'auriez pas ce souci.   Mais non, vous être tous des dangers sur la route.   Alors oui les accidents aux abords des radars automatiques ont fortement baissés mais cela ne doit pas cacher qu'en dehors de ces zones, les gens roulent majoritairement 20km/h au dessus de la vitesse autorisée ; si ce n'est +. Mais cela ne s'arrête pas là. Quand un automobiliste respectueux des vitesses se présente devant eux, alors là ca joue des appels de phares, du klakson et j'en passe. Et la plupart finissent même par doubler sur la droite pour gagner les précieuses minutes qui les feront rentrer chez eux. Voir même pousser le véhicule qui était devant eux (ca m'est arrivé).   La violence routière est grave et nous allons arriver dans une ère de non-droit où vous allez faire comme dans les jeux vidéos (ne le niez pas) en croyant que vous êtes invincible.

The four wheel drive engages and works in both 4H and 4L; but the truck starts shaking if you go faster than 15mph.

20070618174421AAKyGzZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car underwent an oil shower...how can I get rid of the gasoline odor?	Something bizarre happened to my car...My car was parked at a corner of this restaurant parking lot right next to (like 10 steps away) an oil well (of course I didn't know about the well when I parked).The well exploded and my car literally went through a shower of crude oil... Since then it has gone through two car washes and one $100+ detailing to clean up the oil on the body as well as all the rubber sealings and the doors, but the gasoline smell in my car is still overwhelming. Does anybody know how to get rid of the gasoline odor inside the car?

20080403124133AAQon8L	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Problems after jumping car battery?	Hello.  Few things happened that I have some questions about:    1. My car battery dies, we tried using my girlfriends car to charge.  2.  Hooked up the cables, but when we tried to start her car to jump mine, hers' died.  Wouldn't start.  3.  Used a third car to jump both, let them idle for 20-30 mins.    My car works fine, but my girlfriend just called and told me her car wont start?  Did we fry her battery when we tried to jump it?  It started when we jumped it with the 3rd car but we didn'tr do anything but idle it for 20 mins.  Or do we simply need to jump/charge it for longer?    Can you see any problems?
20080303192119AAxusxM	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Aftermarket head unit volume fades after a few minutes?	ok I just bought a hyundai elantra that the previous owner installed a gps, remote start, neons, and aftermarket jvc headunit. the problem is that the stereo will work fine when first turned on but after about twenty minutes of driving the volume fades quickly and in order to hear anything I hav to crank the volume and its all distorted. when i change the station it will be normal for like ten seconds and then fade again. I know next to nothing about car audio but if I were to guess it seems like there isnt enough power getting to something but I dont even know where to begin to attempt to diagnose this problem. the car is a 2001 . any help?
