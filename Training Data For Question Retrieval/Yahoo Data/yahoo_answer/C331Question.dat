20090225092129AAfAsoS	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Second opinion.......................â€¦	The doctor said, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration.    You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'    Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.    He saw a men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new suit.'    He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new suit.'    The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said   'Let's see... size 44 long.'    Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'    Been in the business 60 years!' the tailor said.    Joe tried on the suit it fit perfectly.    As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'    Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'    The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'    Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'    'Been in the business 60 years.'    Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly.    Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new underwear?'    Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure.'    The salesman said, 'Let's see... size 36.    Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! I got you! I've worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.'    The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.'

20090225093642AA0vM7i	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Musicians: Any interest in an open music challenge?	Anyone interested in a music challenge?      I imagine it going down like this: we pick either a song that everyone has to cover or an album that everyone must pick a song off of to cover. we give participants a couple weeks or a month to prepare and then we all post are results. we would leave the results question open for a week and then let everyone vote.      MQ: anyone interested?   MQ2: any suggestions for how the challenge might go (if you dont like something about my preliminary idea)?   MQ3: any suggestions for what we should pick to cover?   I am thinking for the song... something that everyone more or less knows, something that takes well to being covered and something that is open to very diverse arrangements so people can do it in the style or genre that they are interested in.      Ok here is what I am thinking:      I think I should post this a few more time over the next week or so to make sure that everyone who might participate knows about it. I am thinking next Thursday in the Rock and Pop section (Iâ€™m putting these in several genres to get the biggest and most diverse turnout possible, but will have the actual question in Rock and Pop) I'll have a vote on what song to do. At that point I will email an update to anyone who expressed interest.      Also I think I might give people the option of submit anonymously by emailing a link to me and I will put the link on the additional details. If we do this I was to get submissions from all talent levels and I donâ€™t want anyone to be discouraged.

He went into the doctors room sat down and was told that he had some sort of rare intestinal virus. He was subscribed with suppositries and told to take two a day. The doctor said he would give him the first one.       Once we got back to his house I had a few beers and left then it was time for his next one so he asked his wife if she could do it. So she put her hand on his shoulder and thrusted the supositry into his ***.       He screamed and his wife said "Whatâ€™s wrong? Did I hurt you?"       He said "No - I just realised the doctor had both hands on my shoulders!!!"

20090225092758AAqlS8h	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Do you think female rappers have helped change the image of the genre even a little bit for the better?	I think rap music because it came out of oppression with a fight back attitude has always been criticized no matter what as detrimental either for speaking against politicians or speaking against women. I don't think it matters what the lyrics are. Someone will always find a way to view the whole genre as negative. Sometimes I wonder if Queen Latifah, Foxy Brown, Eve, MC Lyte, and other female rappers have made progress to changing the image of the genre by speaking from a female perspective about what matters to them whether it is overcoming the pain of infidelity from their romantic guy friend or overcoming poverty or even the struggles of parenthood. More women I think need to write songs about life experiences that matter to them. Even if Eve did a rap song about cleaning her house and referring her house to a castle and being the queen of that castle and being careful who she lets in it would dramatically change how some (not all) people view rap music as a positive force for positive emotional and physical change focused on giving of yourself to others out of compassion and spreading that affection and concern among humanity. Even a rap song about pollution would be cool but I think it's mostly all about popularity and money so I guess death, smoking, and sex are the heavy hitters that people will pay money to hear. Some of these guys need to think outside the box instead of rolling with the popular fads. It's like comedians only talking about sexual experiences in their jokes because that's what is popular and lots of people will pay and like to hear instead of talking about their childhood growing up or about the traffic. Some of these people would help the negativity if they would think a little differently about what they are putting out and have some diversity.

20090225092627AATzKqu	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Question regarding pressing down guitar chords.?	Hello, i recently received an acoustic guitar and I've been practicing on my own till i find a teacher, and I've come into one thing that's been bugging me. Since I just recently started learning, i switch between chords rather slowly, except for some of them that i found very easy to switch between ( E-G Em-G Dadd6add9(i think)-G )  .. But for example when i try to switch from a G to C, it takes me a while to get my fingers in position, and i press down the strings not all at the same time ( the three strings that i need for the C chord ), but one at a time which i noticed mutes out the G chord, and it sounds a bit crappy to me. So i just wanted to ask, when switching chords, is it essential to press all of the strings of some chords AT THE SAME TIME, or can i press the strings one at a time but just fast? Like for example when switching from G to C, i press down the 2 string on the first fret first with my 1th finger, then quickly position my 2nd finger on the second fret 4th string and then the 3rd finger on the 3rd fret 5th string, which mutes out the sound of the open strings played in the G chord.. Don't know if how i explained made sense.. I hope it did. Because i tried trying to press down on the strings at the same time, it looked nearly impossible ( The easy ones i mentioned i press at basically the same time because all i have to do is slide my fingers and adjust them a bit ) . I just can''t position the fingers to press down on the same time.

20090225095524AAecIVN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Dirty Joke : Poor guy hahaha...?	A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years. He breaks into a house to look for money and guns and finds a young couple in bed.       He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:      "Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."      To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"
20090225095212AA3IygZ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Dirty Joke : Girls night out...?	Two women friends had gone out for a Girls Night Out, and had been decidedly over-enthusiastic on the cocktails. Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.   The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other. "Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!'

I'm making a manga and I need a title. It is a shoujo manga about fantasy, romance, and drama. There are no humans just: cat people, vamps, dog demons (like inuyasha), werewolves, bunny ppl, kayubi's (like naruto), valkyries, angels, demons , and fairies. The heroine is a high school cat-girl who had a childhood sweetheart that was taken away from her because of family rivalry. So during her life she is wonders where he is and how he is doing until she finds him. They get together and have to endure obstacles in their relationship. I had the idea of this story since it is kind of like what happened in my life...I had a childhood sweet heart and him and his family left because of an argument between the fathers.Well anyway, got any ideas for a title?

There was this boy who I know deeply cared about me and I kinda liked him to, but it just wasnt there at the time. I know he liked me alot, and it makes me feel sad now because it's been more than a week without talking to each other. He asked me out on V-day and I rejected him. We got into a fight over this kid who he thought I liked that I worked with and that he found out that I slept with this kid twice.      He doesnt text me anymore! I know he can't stay at mad at me, he told me that himself when we were hanging out. I miss him so much! And never apperciated the things he has done for me. He wasn't the best looker, but either am I. There was one time we went to the mall, and he put a giant red dot with a red sharpie on his face cuz I was paranoid about my cold sore. There was a time where we went to a movie, and he picked me up so I wouldnt have to walk up the stairs, and he asked where I wanted to sit, and I was like top row (and when we got there, I said ok, first row). and he did it! He always has done the most cutest romantic things and I took him for granted, and he hasnt seen me since V-day and hasnt spoken to me since the 16th. I tried texting him, but he wont answer back! What can I do to get him back!?

Data never tired, so why would he not also move and think in fastforward all the time?   In an episode or two, he claimed that he had a program that made him look like he aged through the years. How in the world would this be possible with synthetic materials?   Data breathed. Why? He didn't need to, as time and again we see him fully functional in places without air (like space).   Data could eat and drink (to analyze), but it wasn't necessary for his survival. How did he process sustanance? How did he get it out of his body afterwards?   What was Data's power source? I don't think it ever explained that.    Data was found some 20 years after his creation, and then went to Star Fleet academy for years, in all this time no one else duplicated his design/technology? Seems fair-fetched that he's be "cutting edge" for so many years. That would be like saying that the microwave was yet cutting-edge in 2009!   Data's overall data storage was 100,000 terabytes. In 1987 (when the show first aired) that prob sounded huge, but does it sound that big in 2009 when we now have 2 terabyte drives? This is supposed to be 400 years in the future!   That's about it. Please, serious answers. I know it's Star Trek, but I'm interested in serious responses. Thanks.

20090225073552AAwS67m	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How can my estranged hubby say he wants to work it out w/ me, but continue to see someone else?	We've only been separated for 5-6 months, after 2-3 months apart he started seeing this party girl, who goes out drinking and partying every weekend and is like 7 years younger than him. He says he loves me and wants to make it work, but he 'needs time' b/c "I really hurt him by initiating the separation" He was not blameless in this by the way, and he admits it, but at the same time seems to be enjoying being the wounded party. I asked him if he never planned on reconciling w/ me at all, point blank, told him to be honest and he quickly said "no no no I''m not saying that at all". Why would he start seeing someone else so soon afterwards anyways, he was 'devastated' when we separated and then outta nowhere he started seeing this girl that he picked up at the bar one night. Is this girl just a rebound that is easy and fun and it won't last? She isn't his type, and has a bad rep and no one that has met her has a single nice word to say about her.

20061212224606AA8iCzC	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Women's Vocabulary?	Fine - This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use "fine" to describe how a woman looks - this will cause you to have one of those arguments.      Five Minutes - This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.      Nothing - This means "something," and you should be on your toes. "Nothing" is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with "Fine".        -  A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing".        -  "Soft Sighs" mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content

"OK, alright" the guy responds.       "Tell you what, I'm tired of paying for airplane tickets to Hawaii. I'd like you to build a bridge from California to Hawaii."       This pisses the genie off.       He screams, "Hey, this isn't the movies. Your wish has to be practical."       "Do you know the engineering it would take to design that, the materials it would take, you'd have to compensate for plate techtonics, the continental shelf. . ."       "Geez" the guy responds, "Well, I'd really like to understand women."       The genie responds "Did you want two lanes or four? "

If one of my past partners had not been from Belfast or if I had not been too informed about the troubles, would have have giggled it off, but felt disgusted as she spat it out...it made Carol Thatcher's 'gollywog' skank seem almost like a statement of love. I'm sure someone will answer, writing that I didn't understand it, but I hope a newspaper story (about her comment) is read by one of the panel tomorrow - with the same eagerness as the '...all black EastEnders' story (in the Sun - who else) was read before her naive squeal.

20060702080150AAXQE99	Entertainment & Music;Music	Any ideas for solos using locrian mode in the key of E?	I'm into metal and dabble in a bit of guitar. I came up with a great riff and rhythm and have a few lyrical ideas on paper. I'm basing pretty much the whole song on the locrian mode in the key of E, which (if the way I learned is correct) goes: E, F, G, A, Bb(A#), C, D, E. I've got the start of the solo which starts off with an F, A, C, E arpeggio. I didn't realise the spelling when I first played it on the guitar. Then it goes into a decending run with a couple of bends and some hammer-on, pull-off bits based around E locrian but it feels too short and incomplete. Any ideas as to where I can take it from here? The rhythm guitar is a truncated version of the opening riff of the song. Also, bare in mind that I have small hands and am a bit rusty when giving your suggestions.

We create profiles for models for our clients. We deal with magazines, bilboard ads, commercial and movies. We put you in the types of modeling that you request for and our clients are aloud to see your profile if they wish to book you then we contact you.       We don't have a website we are not that cheap. We deal straight with the companies. They give us an account to bid on and if we want it we take the account. Your profile is in our data base. If you fit what they are looking for which they will make the call, then we will contact you if they pick you.         I understand but for this to be a scam I would have to get money from you and I don't get paid unless I get you a job.      my guess..not really but i want to see what others think about this!

TEX          :  Sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million dollars.     GIDEON  :  Not unless we're blind.      My question is what is the meaning of GIDEON's word.  They are searching 250000 dollars and checking one bag, but does not find anythin in the bag. So I wonder the second sentence should be "Unless ---", or "not" is unnecessary.   Your comment will be appreciated.  Thank you.

20070309080319AAzcreV	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What happened to TRON 2?	I am a huge fan of 1982's TRON. What it did to computer graphics at the time was amazing. Amazinglyu more is that it didnt do very well at the box office. But yet if TRON hadnt been made a lot of stuff may never have been made.      About 8 years ago, sometime beforte the 20th anniversary came out, there came word they were working on a new movie. The original creator was still part of Disney and wabnted a sequel and maybe a remake.      In the 20th anni release, it has story boards for the sequel.      Then came TRON 2.0 the computer game which i understand was built around the script for the sequel.      So, does anyone know where the sequel stands? was it shelved? are they still working on it?

Eine Bekannte hat mir eine interessante Frage gestellt, die  ich ihr leider nicht beantworten konnte, aber ich h?tte schon gerne die Aufl?sung gewusst. Also, es geht um folgendes: Mein Bekannte hatte bei einer Firma (ich wei? den Namen jetzt leider nicht mehr) eine Fernsehzeitschrift abboniert. Nun wollte sie sie nicht mehr haben und hat deshalb das Abo fristgerecht per Einschreiben mit RÃ¼ckschein gekÃ¼ndigt. Das Problem: Diese Firma hat das Einschreiben nicht angenommen und es wurde meiner Bekannten zurÃ¼ckgesandt mit dem Kommentar, dass der Empf?nger die Annahme verweigert hat. Gilt diese KÃ¼ndigung trotzdem? Und wie kann meine Bekannte beweisen, dass es fristgerecht zugestellt wurde? Hoffe, Ihr k?nnt mir und vor allem ihr helfen. Vielen Dank im voraus.

Whatever direction, you may turn, youll see my friend, the Earths been poisoned, by the human germ." Look to the sky, look to the moon. Escape for some, but not for you. Doomed to wonder, a barren rock. If I was naive, Id call it bad luck, but, " " Evolution, well thats passe. However we got, to wherever we are today. Whether from space, or whether from chimp, all excuses, are looking quite limp cause, " "      Now, whoever first gives me the correct band and song name gets best answer, and everyone else will get the runner-up prize of the mandatory 2 points. Everyone wins, and good luck!

20090109102208AAoDwc1	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Complicated situation?	OK, well I moved a few months ago, and there was this guy who I used to be like in love with. He liked me too but we never went out. We were basically a couple, we talked like one, we acted like one, everyone knew about us, but there was never really that label between us. We were like that for almost 2 years. Well then I moved. And I miss him so much. The guys here are jackasses. I feel like there's no one out there for me but him. It would be a whole lot easier for me if he actually broke up with me, because I would KNOW that it was over, but I don't know it, because I don't really know that there was a beginning, and I don't know now that it's over now. We still talk and stuff. But I just want to move back. But I can't because I'm almost a thousand miles away. Can anyone give me any advice or reassurance or something? Thanks.

Someone said that they were afraid Twilight would take their viewers or something???? Also, I heard that the release date was changed to November 2009. Why do that when New Moon would be up to bat next?       I'm really confused.

20090227105543AAvtKmf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Would you say Akria was a ground breaking film?	I remember hearing Akria got lots of good reviews and thumbs up from critics. I think maybe it was viewed as groundbreaking for it's animation, character development, and plot as well as possibly being a launchpad for vaulting Anime into mainstream America sort of like a precurser to later Japanese Anime films such as Princess Mononoke, Pokemon: The First Movie, Digimon: The Movie, Spirited Away, and several others that would later gets tons of praise in America. I remember seeing the previews for Spirited Away, Digimon, & Pokemon. Princess Mononoke was a really cool movie. Given the plot of Akira and that it was released 2 years after the much celebrated sci-fi thriller Aliens, I think it can be said that these two 1980s classics really did a lot to also set off a renewed interest in sci-fi cinema!
20090227104849AAKGgS7	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How would you change Street Fighter 1994 film to make it better?	I seen a lot of negative reviews for the 1994 Street Fighter film which I would agree with given that there were inconsistencies between the movie and the Anime/game at least as far as character development goes. If I had been in charge of the film I would have allowed Ming Na to tell the story in first person narrative (much like she did in Joy Luck Club the year before) and have her character Chun Li as the protagonist. Her character would have focused on brining Bison down for killing her father and I would have opened the film with a tragic past sequence of Chun Li's village being destroyed and her father being murdered while she is still a child and Bison looks coldly at her before taking all those in her village captive. Then we flash to present day with her as a private investigator/spy/detective instead of a reporter and she's getting information on Bison's activities and whereabouts to bring him down and vanquish her past nightmares. That would be a more compelling story than the story they did with focusing on the taunting between Bison and Guile. Ryu and Ken should have been best friends instead of reluctant partners in the film. The character development was all wrong and I think it would have been cool if Jet Li had been Ryu. The movie was far more comical than suspenseful or dramatic with the dialogue and the goofy fight scenes. It was like watching 3 Ninjas for adults or something. It could have been better especially with better fight coreography like what was used in Romeo Must Die with Russell Wong and Jet Li or even in The Art of War with Wesley Snipes. I think Snipes should have been cast in the Street Fighter film too. I doubt there were any effective acrobatic fight coreographers doing the fight scenes given how goofy they looked compared to those in Blade II.

20090227112617AALHiPc	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Will there be a season 4 for "Zero no Tsukaima"?	Okay, I KNOW it's on the forums and everything if I look, but it seems to me that there are more so rumors, rather definite answers. Right? All I'm asking for is a definite answer; yes, or no? OVA, movie,  season 4, the end? Since the others were apparently released in the summer of previous years, and considering that this is a fairly new anime (wasn't season 3 released just last year?), there are people who are saying to wait until later this spring to hear the results.      Honestly, I don't mind waiting. But if there's an answer out there already...      I can see why people are saying that season 4 would be a waste. But, there ARE a lot of things they haven't finished yet: the two other void mages, the mysterious book that Louise got from Queen Henrietta, heck - I still think that there's room for more closure for Saito and Louise; since she's now second in line, what happened to the Valliere family? And if she's still related, will she still have to have permission to marry Saito (not that they were already married, but a second, more offical wedding could be cool to watch)? And the thing with Saito's admirers: Siesta, Henrietta, Tabitha - don't they need closure too? I could see how they'd be able to do this in one movie, but a season 4 would be nice too. I just hope that they don't drag it for too long. A season 4's cool with me, but any further might drag me back. (Okay, not really, but still!)       Anyone who disagrees with me, please, then, I ask in Louise's confidence and stature, explain what's going on with Zero no Tsukaima.

20090227094008AAzhubz	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Opinion question about Naruto chapter 347 and about the death of Hinata...?	Alright, so what do you think? The fact that so many people have died now to get our hopes down a bit, the fact that Hinata's death was not even seen clearly and that Pein emerged with a bloody knife was, I believe, just to scare us. Kishi knows that we're like "anything can happen now that Asuma, Jaraiya, AND Kakashi are dead". Cuz those were all HUGE deaths that were totally unexpected and devestating. The fact that Hinata's death was so quick and straight forward, and so convincing. I don't think she's dead. Kishimoto just knows that we would think she's dead because it's so likely now and he's just doing it to **** with us. And when we find out shes alive after the fight or whatever, there's gonna be a nice big relief for this horribly solemn arc.      The thing is, she could be dead, and that pisses me right off. What we do know for sure now is that Pein's fucked.      Your opinions?

20090227103123AA1hPPk	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Wrote a script and want to be main character in the movie!!?	Basically my boyfriend and i wrote a script for this independent movie that we will be doing. We have been talking to some producers and directors who are very interested in the script. The thing is, I want to be one of the main characters in the movie, in fact i wrote the character for me! I am kinda worried though, that the director will not want me to be the character because I don't have that much acting experience in fact  I am an aspiring actress of 23, but I have taken acting classes. However,I wrote this role specifically for me and i know for a fact I can do the character justice! However, I don't want to have any conflicts with the director either. My question is since I wrote the script I feel that I should be entitled to play one of the main characters if i want to and i know that i can pull it off. So I am interested in what you all think I should do?

20070702221434AAJTYYp	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Fatevi una risata...e accendete una stellina!!?	Un tale entra in un bar con la sua mascotte, una graziosa scimmietta. Mentre beve il suo caffÃ©, la scimmietta inizia a saltare per tutto il bar, prende alcune olive sul bancone e se le mangia, poi fa lo stesso con le arachidi, poi si dirige verso il biliardo, prende la palla numero 8 e la ingoia.    Il padrone del bar, stupefatto, si rivolge al cliente:    - Ha visto cosa ha fatto la sua scimmietta?    - No, cosa?    - Ha ingoiato la palla numero 8 del mio biliardo!!!    - Oh, non mi sorprende. E' molto dispettosa e mangia tutto quello che trova. Non si preoccupi, le pago la boccia e tutto il resto che la scimmietta ha mangiato.    CosÃ¬ fa e se ne va, con la scimmietta in spalla. Due settimane dopo, lo stesso cliente si ripresenta nello stesso bar. Ordina un caffÃ¨ e la scimmietta inizia ancora una volta a saltare per tutto il locale finchÃ© non trova una ciliegia sul bancone.    La guarda incuriosita, la prende, se la infila nel sedere, poi la toglie e se la mangia.    Il barista stralunato si rivolge al cliente:    - E ora, ha visto cos'ha combinato la sua scimmietta?    - No, cosa?    - Si Ã¨ infilata una ciliegia nel sedere, l'ha tolta e se l'Ã¨ mangiata!!!    - Oh, Ã¨ normale. Continua sempre a mangiare di tutto. PerÃ² dopo aver ingoiato quella palla numero otto, adesso prima prende le misure...       Un ateo stava facendo una passeggiata nella foresta.    - Che alberi maestosi! Che fiumi impetuosi! Che begli animali! - si ripeteva.    Mentre camminava lungo il fiume sentÃ¬ un movimento tra i cespugli dietro di sÃ©. Si voltÃ² per dare un'occhiata e vide un orso di 3 metri che lo caricava.    Si mise a correre piÃ¹ velocemente che poteva su per il sentiero.    GuardÃ² sopra la sua spalla e vide che l'orso si avvicinava sempre piÃ¹. GuardÃ² ancora e vide che l'orso era sempre piÃ¹ vicino. Il suo cuore pompava freneticamente e cercava di correre ancora piÃ¹ veloce.    InciampÃ² e cadde a terra.    RotolÃ² per cercare di tirarsi su ma vide che l'orso era proprio sopra di lui, avendolo raggiunto con la sua zampa sinistra e alzando la destra per colpirlo. In quel istante l'ateo gridÃ²:    - Mio Dio!    Il tempo si fermÃ². L'orso si congelÃ². La foresta era silenziosa.    Mentre una luce abbagliante brillava sull'uomo, una voce venne fuori dal cielo:    - Hai negato la mia esistenza per tutti questi anni, insegnato ad altri che non esisto e addirittura attribuito il creato ad un incidente cosmico. Ti aspetti che ti aiuti in questa circostanza? Devo considerarti un credente?    L'ateo guardo diritto verso la luce:    - Sarebbe ipocrita da parte mia chiederti all'improvviso di considerarmi credente ora, ma forse puoi rendere credente l'ORSO?    - Molto bene! - rispose la voce.    La luce se ne andÃ². I suoni della foresta ricominciarono. L'orso abbassÃ² la sua zampa destra, accostÃ² insieme entrambe le zampe, abbassÃ² il capo e disse:    - Signore, benedici questo cibo che sto per ricevere e per il quale sono molto grato.

I imagine it going down like this: we pick either a song that everyone has to cover or an album that everyone must pick a song off of to cover. we give participants a couple weeks or a month to prepare and then we all post are results. we would leave the results question open for a week and then let everyone vote.      MQ: anyone interested?   MQ2: any suggestions for how the challenge might go (if you dont like something about my preliminary idea)?   MQ3: any suggestions for what we should pick to cover?   I am thinking for the song... something that everyone more or less knows, something that takes well to being covered and something that is open to very diverse arrangements so people can do it in the style or genre that they are interested in.      Ok here is what I am thinking:      I think I should post this a few more time over the next week or so to make sure that everyone who might participate knows about it. I am thinking next Thursday in the Rock and Pop section (Iâ€™m putting these in several genres to get the biggest and most diverse turnout possible, but will have the actual question in Rock and Pop) I'll have a vote on what song to do. At that point I will email an update to anyone who expressed interest.      Also I think I might give people the option of submit anonymously by emailing a link to me and I will put the link on the additional details. If we do this I was to get submissions from all talent levels and I donâ€™t want anyone to be discouraged.

Horrified, Katie told her grandmother that 2 people nearly 100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble.      "Oh no, my dear, " replied granny. "Many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. It was just the right rhythm. Nice and slow and even. Nothing too strenuous, simply in on the Ding and out on the Dong."      She paused, wiped away a tear and then continued, "And if that damned ice cream truck hadn't come along, he'd still be alive today!"
