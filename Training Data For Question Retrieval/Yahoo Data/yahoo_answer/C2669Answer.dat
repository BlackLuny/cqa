AA10270018	There are several types of tetras and barbs that will get along. Those are school fishes so make sure you get at least 3 of each or more.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	First I'd recommend getting more than six tetras<br>  Nothing looks worse than a measly group of tetras in a large tank<br>  <br>  <br>  After that the sky is pretty much the limit<br>  Rams<br>  Other dwarf cichlids<br>  Kilifish<br>  A myriad of catfish<br>  Hachetfish<br>  Danios<br>  Rainbowfish<br>  Angels or discus<br>  Other tetras|`|pcvcMePXaa	hmm you should go with some tiger barbs those are very entertaining always swimming around playing with each other but you need a shoal of em about 6 no less so bigger the shoal the better as they wont bother your other fish,<br>  <br>  or go with some neon tetras about 20 of them would look nice but they dont swim around as much as tiger barbs do and zebra danios and leopard danios are nice they are a top dweller and swim around a lot|`|V1Ev5s1laa	zebra danios....at first i thought they were going to sit at the bottom and help clean my tank....omg! i was totally wrong! they are so hyper and lively its not even funny! get a school of zebra danios...i have 5 and prob going to get some more because i love them so much! also swordtails are great! they are pretty hyper. um neon tetras. mollies platies. gouramis. PS you want my serpae tetra he has no more school and is nipping at my fish! ug! i seperated him and hes horrible....want him?|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Go to your downtown in your city, there should be a fish store there somewhere with lots of fish.
WJAM199Waa	They are little kittens so they are going to get into EVERYTHING just like a young child does.  It will take a long time to get them to stop permanently.<br>  <br>  The main thing is you have to be consistent. NEVER let them get away with it. AND you have to catch them doing whatever it is you don't want them to do.  Even one minute later is too late. They won't get it.<br>  <br>  So the best way is to clap your hands once or twice loudly and say NO! at the same time. If they don't jump down, clap closer to them and then "guide" them down with a touch of your hand - not a push.<br>  <br>  BTW No is NOT a long syllable or even a long word. No, is the best thing to use. Has worked for me and I've been training dogs and cats SUCCESSFULLY for 20 or more years now. My cats come running when they are called, they go when I tell them to, they shake a paw, they sit up and beg, they do not jump on the table or counter. They don't do anything they are not supposed to. Consistency is the key and keeping your commands short and always the same. (come, sit, no, bye, car ride, whatever. The shorter the better. My friend used to say "Are you quite finished now with all that nonsense?" Far, far too long! Say No and use it each and every time. And for a thing like this, the clap with the no is by far the best. Works all the time.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Cats generally HATE water-So fill up a spay botle with water and when the cat jumps up on the table-spray and SAY NO firmly.<br>  <br>  Other alternative if you find plain water not working-then add a touch of lemon juice to the water-another alternative to water is White Vinegar.<br>  <br>  Another device on the market is call SSS SCAT<br>  <a href="http://www.absaustralia.com.au/ssscat/ssscat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.absaustralia.com.au/ssscat/ss...</a><br>  <br>  Kitten trainning is very simple compair to dog trainning!<br>  Cats DON'T respond to being hit, Ignoring them doesn't WORK either.<br>  <br>  Provide your cat with a scatching post and toy and teach it to use it.|`|9G03aQhsaa	I agree with Dr. Doolittle's answer.  In addition to the bubble wrap, you can also try loping up some tape and putting that on the table, cats hate things stuck to their feet.   Also, try filling some cans with pennies and leaving them on the edge of the table, the cats will knock them over and get startled and think the table is a bad place.  Don't try the water gun thing, they will associate it with you and will still jump on the table when you are not looking.|`|q4rdye4vaa	Sticky paper, alum. foil.  or spray wth a water gun, they hate that and it's not mean.|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	there kittens theyll do that till the older|`|taLD45Sqaa	I had to retrain my cats at 7 months after they lived with someone else who allowed cats on their table. What I did was use the spray bottle with water but when I sprayed them I made a noise that sounds like Psssssssss as loud as I could. After they associate the sound with getting sprayed with water, you only have to make the Psssssss sound and kitty will obey! Worked like a charm :) Although who knows what they do when you aren't home.... I still find clumps of cat fur on the table from where they were wrestling! But cats will be cats and that's why we love 'em!|`|wddqp34Aaa	BUY A FEW CHEAP LITTLE MICE TRAPS ,SET THEM AND THEN CAREFULLY COVER THEM WITH NEWSPAPER If the cats jump on the table and set them off the noise and movement scares them and.they won't get hurt . My cats are 12 and they still stay out of the kitchen ,they also avoid newspapers ,so if I need them to not to be in an area I just lay a paper there and they stay away! The best thing is they blame the paper not you because you don't even have to be there  !|`|H7AZxsplaa	Reprimands simply do not work when training your cat. If you catch kitty in the act, he will only misbehave when you are not around.<br>  <br>  Set your kitten up to succeed in performing those behaviors you want her to learn so she can be rewarded.<br>  <br>  Set up your kitten in an environment so that those behaviors you don't want him to learn are not rewarding.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can put up round table linens so that your cat won't be able to jump on it.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Loud Sharp noises work great. the word no is a very long syllable so using something like AaAa works great. <br>  <br>  The cats dash into your moms room because they know that they are not allowed in there so they see it as a fun game. My cat does it to my sister every time she opens the garage door.<br>  <br>  A great thing to do is to teach them the stay command (this is what i did with my cat) you can teach them the same way that you would train a dog it just take more time.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do to keep them off the table is to try and put bubble wrap on it when you are not there. The popping of the bubbles well scare them..inless they like to chew on plastic like my cat does.
AA10270018	If you like lively fishes then any barbs or tetras will be great.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	A dwarf gourami is a great idea!  They're very bright and easy to see fish, try getting them in a pair though.<br>  As for buddies, these are usually put in with other tropical community fish.<br>  You could do  school of danio, or guppy or some tetra.  Just be careful mixing long fins with tetra as they tend to be fin nippers.  They guppy need to be in a group or they will be shy and cower in corners.  Same with the tetra and danio.  Get a god healthy group and they'll happily swim around.  Danio are quick zippers and very hardy fish.<br>  You can also check into hatchet fish or killi fish, they hang out near the top.  And killie can come in a wide range of vibrant colors!<br>  Or a school of rainbow fish, they also come in a wide color variety and are a good few inches and very active.<br>  Or a group of molly and platy.  Black mollies will often come to the glass when you touch it, gathering around your finger!<br>  I also suggest a group of cory cats to clean the floor, or shrimp.  I luv my shrimp, they're pretty livelly, riding the water current from one end of my tan to another.  My cat loves to watch them scurry around.<br>  As for algea, try hunting down a dwarf plco or try a school of otto cats.  I prefer otto cats b/c they're active and easir to see.  Plus, more attractive I think : )<br>  Best of Luck!|`|pcvcMePXaa	here are some ideas<br>  <br>  First.<br>  <br>  2 dwarf gouramis<br>  10 neon tetras<br>  3 corydoras<br>  <br>  Second.<br>  <br>  4 Mollies<br>  4 Platys<br>  6 Glow light Tetras<br>  4 Sword tails|`|V1Ev5s1laa	guppies! oh and get zebra danios...they help clean the tank (bottom feeders) and are so so so so so so so hyper and fast and zip around the tank and i always think the lady gave me more than 5 but they re so fast they look like they are everywhere!|`|zW5OWgXtaa	You can get a cray fish, or maybe make the tank trpoical, like get thoes weird moving plants like the one nemo lived in, in the movie and get some water snails and water hermit crabs!
nd30LQhlaa	nope... i doubt it...because the dog was on your land and if they wanted to say anything you could say that their dog should have been put up so it could go to your house! YOu will be fine!|`|h7F4wA7eaa	No you cant get in any serious trouble their dog was trespassing on your property, your dogs were protecting their turf.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	Although its not likely there is a possibility you could get in trouble.  If they hired a lawyer and he said that your dogs were vicious, it wouldn't matter if they were on your property.  He would argue that next time it might be a child who wanders into your yard.<br>  But from what you describe I don't think you have to worry.  Just lay low as one other person said.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Well you can get in serious trouble. The neighbors probably don't know that your dog did that. So lay low. Your great dane was just protecting the german shepherd so it wasn't that bad of aggression. I feel bad for the boxer though. That must hurt like crazy but I guess he had it coming if he was up against a big dog like a great dane.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Nope, because it was on your property, however if it were a child on your property and your dog attacked him/her that would be a different story, the law just sees this as a dog defending its property and will do nothing. Good job for your dog protecting your little puppy:)<br>  xx|`|zW5OWgXtaa	You can't get introuble if it's on your lan, your dog was only protectin his proprty. So it was your nabors fault letting hier dog loose.|`|8FdOfT11aa	Yes, you can get into trouble with this.  Everything depends on what county you live in and what their rules are.  Try finding your local animal services website.  That might have the information you are looking for.|`|QLrk3ep9aa	No, their dog was off their property, and it is illegal to have your dog out off leash. Not only that, but it attacked your dog, and the other dog was only acting in self defense. Since their dog was on YOUR property, you are fine
2Ku4DuvCaa	You can get either. Budgies won't be encouraged to mate unless you supply them with a nest box. If you don't want babies, then don't give them a next box.<br>  <br>  Either way, you should NOT immediately cage them together. The first reason is because you should always quarantine a new bird for a few weeks to make sure it's not sick. Your avian vet can recommend how long to keep them apart.<br>  <br>  Next, you want to introduce them to each other before putting them in the same cage together. Your first budgie might become territorial and fight with the new one. If you don't want that to happen, it's best to let them play together and see that they like each other before caging them together. You can keep their cages close (AFTER the quarantine period) to see how they react to each other, and let them out at the same times to play with each other.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, make sure the cage you want them both in is large enough for two parakeets. Those tiny "parakeet" cages they sell at some pet stores are a joke. Make sure you offer them plenty of toys, a healthy diet of pellets and bird friendly fresh foods (only a small amount of seed is acceptable), and plenty of time outside the cage to socialize with you and each other. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|vjijiJT3aa	get another boy they'll get along fine.|`|z2cysiEhaa	A boy will be fine if you don't want to take any chances of a pregnancy.<br>  But girls will get along fine with a male also.

FvAl3UgQaa	I think you misunderstood the previous answerer - 2 crickets (what size?) doesn't sound like enough. I've never read anywhere that states how many you should feed, but have kept and bred leo's for decades and have found that they generally will eat about 5 crick's (of the appropriate size for their age) per day... Your leopard gecko is probably hungry. However, the biting of the edge of its water-bowl could also be due to an attempt to address a vitamin or mineral deficiency. What supplements are you using, and how frequently. Also, are you gut-loading the crickets?<br>  <br>  *********<br>  <br>  Sorry - butting in: Willow - are you saying each of your adults will eat 20 mealworms *each* day, and occasionally additional crickets too?!|`|ufCDyf8laa	Its probaly normal.

K2QwEM4raa	I only use pellets from the pet store. Treats with seed once in a while. Don't like to use seed because they do what your bird is doing and only picking out what they want to eat and that is usually sunflower seeds and they don't provide all the nutrients the bird needs. And there is a lot of waste and mess. My birds have always been healthy on pellets only problem some time they decide not to eat one color for a few days so I save it and then if I get low I give it back to them, I keep it in a sealed baggie. I wouldn't give it back if they pooped in it but they don't. At first they may not want the pellets and If I get one that had a former owner that feed seeds I take the seeds away and when they get hungry enough they always eat them and no mess and no waste.|`|v6coHbIeaa	If you go to the pellets i wouldnt go to the colored ones. Alot of birds wont eat the other color .I have a conure and quaker that wont.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	If by "cockatiel" food you mean a seed mix, that's a crappy diet anyway. A good diet for a bird is a diet of pellets and bird friendly fresh foods. You're on the right track with the fruits and vegetables- just make sure you read up on which ones are toxic.<br>  <br>  Sunflower seeds are addictive to parrots. I've run into this problem a number of times, and there are always ways around. To start with, mix her seeds in with the healthier pellets and fruits and vegetables. Over the period of a few weeks, offer fewer and fewer sunflower seeds and more and more of the healthy pellets and fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  She will not let you do this easily. She's going to be like a pouty little child about it. What you have to do is stand your ground, and encourage her to eat the healthy foods. Pretend you're eating it sometimes, too. Some parrots beg worse than dogs, and they will fall over themselves just to get what you've got! (Not all, but it's worth a shot.)<br>  <br>  The main point is to be persistent. Make sure that she doesn't lose lots of weight and that her droppings remain normal. (If you feed her coloured pellets, her poop will turn colours. No worries there.)<br>  <br>  If you keep trying and keep offering, she will eventually eat the good foods because she's hungry- just like a kid being forced to eat his vegetables. Beyond that, make sure she has a large cage, plenty of toys, and plenty of time out to socialize with you.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you want to switch her to a better diet! Best of luck to you!|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	I've found the best way to convert a seed eater is to soak the seed in warm water for 8 hours, rinse and sprinkle them over the fresh foods that I want them to eat.  (Soaked seed is very good for them, but dry seed is not - unless it's very fresh.)<br>  <br>  Buy some fresh "soaking seeds" and a bag of Harrison's High Potency super fine pellets.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.harrisonsbirdfoods.com/products/index.html#ANCHOR1" rel="nofollow">http://www.harrisonsbirdfoods.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Serve only about 1 teaspoon of soaked seeds mixed in with her fresh foods each day, and make sure there are plenty of the pellets available at all times.  You should not need to add any vitamins or other additives, as Harrison's already has nutrients added.<br>  <br>  Take your parrotlet to an avian vet at least once each year for a check up to ensure her continued good health.<br>  <br>  Parrotlets also enjoy fruit juices (in small amount) - only use organic produce whenever possible and wash everything thoroughly prior to serving.  <br>  <br>  My parrotlets enjoy having fresh baby lettuce greens in their drinking and bathing water, so you may want to try that as well.
j45Q2ipRaa	Don't under sell your horse.  Through experience I have learned that a good hunter can do almost anything.  In the video he looks very comfortable with jumping and is being very tolerant and honest.  As you become more secure in jumping it will even get better.  Just a tip, release him a little more over the fences so you won't catch him in the mouth which we have all done while learning to jump.  With time, you will find he was probably a good choice even though he doesn't have the eventing time that the others have.  If you choose to do eventing, dressage, hunter or just trail, you are a good team.  Nice job jumping for just learning :)|`|TTLIp8Beaa	you really need to work on your jumping position over fences if you want to be an eventer. you tend to get left behind, pull on his mouth, and slam down into your saddle. (i know you're still learning, but make sure you have a good trainer!)<br>  <br>  as for your horse, he defiantly has what it takes to be a low level eventer. he is very clean to the jumps, and he looks like he's finding his own distances to the jumps. (very important) i suggest seeking out a good dressage trainer too, so that they can teach you the basics that you need.<br>  <br>  good job & good luck!|`|14PrlLjFaa	You can try. It takes guts to do cross country though, and a fair amount of speed. So he might cut it, he might not- but you don't know until you have tried it.<br>  <br>  .....and work on not jumping up his neck. (Which you really are in that video) If he stopped or spun out, with that jumping position you would be long gone.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Go for it! You are not going to start at the top of the tree but if your horse can jump and has done some dressage he will be very suitable. Just work at it.|`|n6v6bRg2aa	I think you will need some work before you go eventing (not criticizing your riding, just an observation, your not too bad if you haven't jumped that much) but I think you have a very honest horse. With some practice you should do well. Maybe get a little help? You dont have to pay out for an instructor, ask around your barn for someone to watch you ride and give you some pointers. <br>  Give your horse a chance, as long as he is fit enough to do the job, I think the two of you will do very well.<br>  Good luck.|`|yNHBBQ6faa	from watching the you tube clip he looks perfectly capable of introducing you to the eventing world.<br>  he shows a good jump,<br>  lovely smooth paces,<br>  the correct flat work and work Between jumps to carry you far,<br>  there is no reason why you shouldn't participate in events on him, providing the jumps aren't too big or the dressage too demanding, with training more challenging jumps and dressage should be no problem to either of you though!<br>  <br>  start simple so you both get a taste of eventing before deciding on any thing, even if he can jump all the jumps and preform perfect dressage tests for you eventing may not suit your horse in other aspects or you may not like it!|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Give him a try, he may do fine and since you're new at it you can learn together and see if this is what you really want to do. You just walked into an A barn and feel like you're on the C team. Give him a chance!!  I'm not going to critique your riding but you need some work before you go out eventing. You have a good horse. Don't short sell him.|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	If you're still learning a lot, then dont event. Its different out there when you are doing XC and you have to jump into a ditch then up again, it takes a lot of skill to do that. Wait until you've learnt more, until you've perfected yourself, then go for it. Don't rush into it, you could hurt you and your horse.<br>  Btw, I really think you're a good rider :D|`|RloOJ43haa	With dressage and a background in hunter, your horse already has an education in two of the three eventing disciplines. So, with some careful education in cross country, he ought to be fine as an eventer.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	He should be able to do it.  It might take a while to get him used to cross country.  One thing I like in an event horse is the ability to think on their feet and get themselves out of a sticky situation.  Take him out on some trail rides or just ride around the field and see how he does out in the open.

ulhyTxoGaa	this happened to my kitten...he wouldn't even get up to use the bathroom.<br>  my vet told me it was either a hairline fracture, or a sprain.  puppies and kitten's bones are like rubber for the first year.<br>  this is what my vet told me to do: (she didn't even give an xray or meds for it)<br>  right now, you just need to let the puppy rest, try not to let it walk a lot.  try warm compresses for pain, cold for swelling.<br>  The puppy should be better within 7 days if it is one of the two mentioned.  (my kitten got better in 3 days)<br>  If the puppy seems to be getting worse after doing the above or just within the next few days, you have no choice but to go to the vet, as it may be broken.  Try calling around and asking if they accept payments|`|wnxOXBuKaa	I know that you cannot afford to go to the vet, but maybe call one and ask them if there are any signs you can check for to tell if it's broke or just sprained. <br>  Have you looked and made sure something isn't stuck in the paw? <br>  <br>  Call around to rescue groups and ask if there is ANY way they can offer you help to get the dog into the vet. <br>  <br>  If not, call the vet and ask if there is anyway you can set up some kind of payment plan...Let them know that it's VERY important and that you (or your friend, rather) are completely broke but you are more interested in the well being of the animal. <br>  <br>  If one vet tells you no, call another. Do it until you run out of options. <br>  <br>  Chances are, however, the puppy just has a sprain or tried to squeeze through something he was too big to get through...he very well could have dislocated his hip or something. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fqvLguGCaa	Please surrender the puppy to someone who CAN PROPERLY CARE FOR IT.  IF YOUR FRIEND DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR A VET, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A DOG!!!<br>  <br>  LETS HOPE THEY NEVER GET SICK AND CAN'T AFFORD THE DOCTOR AND DOESN'T HAVE TO SUFFER!<br>  <br>  Bring the damn dog to a rescue so it doesn't have to suffer or get it put to sleep that's cheap enough.  You don't want that poor dog to have to grow up with people who can't take care of it properly, grow up with a broken leg that was never mended, has bad arthritis in that leg and suffers every day b/c they never got it fixed and can't afford the pain meds to help the dog.  <br>  <br>  very terrible. How do you live like this. Cancel you're internet service and use the money for that poor dog. <br>  <br>  DISGRACEFUL. <br>  <br>  that dog will end up in the shelter and put to sleep b/c of you people|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	If the puppy's leg is broken and it is not fixed in due time,  the poor puppy will go into shock and die.

Borrow money and go to a vet.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Well the obvious thing would be to take him to the vet.. but seeing as though your friend is broke, maybe she could bandage the puppies leg to take the pressure off it a little bit.

If the dog can't put weight on his leg it's broken.  Ice won't do a damn thing.  Sometimes a vet will do payment arrangements.  Don't make the dog suffer.|`|gMwSxdpCaa	Denise that's a funny name, put the dog down on its side and hope it will sleep like that and keep the ice pack on its legs as long as u can|`|38ab6659a0292a00b09330a5fca5c2deaa	If it is broke and she doesn't take it to the vet she will be charged with animal cruelty.  If she can not afford a vet she should turn it into the SPCA where it will receive medical attention and be given to a family that can love and afford it.<br>  This animal is suffering !  How would you like a broken leg that didn't receive medical care. At best it will heal crooked and give the animal pain for the rest of its life.  It could also throw a clot because of the break and kill it before you could drive to a vet.|`|8FdOfT11aa	You need to get her to a vet.  Call around.  Sometimes vets will take payment plans.  If you don't get this taken care of correctly, the dog's leg could end up messed up for the rest of its life.  Even if the dog gets used to a crooked leg or something, it's just not fair to the poor animal.<br>  <br>  Also have your friend look in to CareCredit.  It's a credit card that you can use for ANY medical reason (doctor, dentist, vet, even cosmetic surgery).  And there's no interest on any purchases if they're paid off in 3 months.|`|EnwYxbS4aa	Denying a pet medical attention is officially and legally classed as animal cruelty and your friend could actually be prosecuted for this offense.<br>  <br>  It is an absolute disgrace to get a dog knowing you cant afford medical care for it.

If you think the leg is broken, take it to the vet and let them put a cast on it. I don't think anyone thinks you are stupid, but you can't heal it yourself. I think a cast will probably be affordable.|`|wStPZeEEaa	hmmm...well lets think about this together.....im sure we can come up with something....OH!!! i got it! take the dog to the vet...i dont get why she cant go to the vets...put a cast on the poor dog<br>  <br>  EDIT: dont act like im stupid if these people cant take this poor dog to the vet maybe they should give it up and not let it sit there in pain|`|GSf09ALBaa	You nor your friend can fix a broken leg!

I'm sorry your friend can't afford to do it, but she cannot afford to not take it if she cares about it.

That is better than allowing the dog to suffer.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Take the dog to the vet to have an xray done and to get a cast on if it its broken.  That's the right thing to do.  If your friend has a credit card she can charge the appointment and then pay for it in payments.  You have to get the dog some help.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I found this really good website.  Maybe they have some answers for you on how you can help your friends dog until she can take him to the vet.  Good luck.|`|52otNiElaa	If you have icy hot, get some icy hot and put it on the poor little guys legg and wrap it somewhat tight around his leg. fasten it with a saftey pin and keep an eye on him. help him eat, give him milk. u know all that good stuff.

LPEO6AsCaa	Do you excuse your dog's behavior because of its breed?<br>  No, If I do then I have not done my job as it owner correctly!<br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you it had a traumatic experience?<br>  No again.  If the dog had a traumatic experience you help the dog to get it's self confidence back so it will not fall back into old bad habits. <br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you failed to train it?<br>  Then that would make it my fault and not the dogs.  So why blame the dog for my ineptitude at training my dog to be a good canine citizen? <br>  If you have a dog with a good solid background and great temperament the only reason it would have any of the above mentioned faults is the owners doing not the dogs.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	The only thing I can blame his behavior on is his age. He's an exuberant doofus of a puppy. If he gets too excited in the pet shop (and pulls, for instance), I force a smile while I lead him away or distract him and tell the person, "We're working on that."<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't have much to excuse him for, though. The extent of his "crimes" is being over-eager to greet another dog. (He's finally getting the idea of sitting for strangers.) He has absolutely never shown any aggression (growling, biting, shying) that I need to excuse him for. And he doesn't jump on people or anything.<br>  <br>  Oh, wait, I can blame some aspects of his behavior on his breed.. He tends to slobber on strangers, which I get to blame on the fact that he's a droopy-faced, loose-lipped Mastiff. :P (Luckily for me, it seems everyone and their cousin here has a Mastiff or knew one, so no one really seems to mind his exuberance paired with his size, or his drool.)|`|t78DA6Dpaa	I only have one dog that i blame for his traumatic first 2 years of life. He sometimes doesn't like men. I believe the previous owner used to kick him whenever he lifted his leg in the house. That's the main reason why they got rid of him was the leg lifting in the house. I've had him for over two years now and he hardly lifts his leg because I've trained him not to. But he still does on occasion.|`|BYL1tSGKaa	The only time I may use an excuse is to admit I have been lacking on keeping them in line. Breed or their experiences has nothing to with anything. But I will admit to my faults in training.<br>  <br>  But they are good dogs so never really have problems.<br>  <br>  edit- I agree you should know your dogs (breed) traits before getting them and train accordingly|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	not excuses. but explanations. <br>  there's a reason for everything a dog does. we're just not always bright enough to know why.|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	Nope my dog is very easy going because I trained him from 8wks. old and his is a good friend and listens to everything I say.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Can I just say, people also use breed/past traumas/the weather to explain why their pet is so fat!!!<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|ErjSVRkqaa	I don't excuse my dogs behavior because of her breed, but, I do know that since she is a Lab she was bred to be prey driven and energetic. She is a hunting dog but she knows when to flush and when not to.

So she is protective, but I don't think that's a good excuse at all...I love that she is protective.She has kind of learned when we approach someone and I say, "its okay." that I don't need her protection. Still working on it, but its going good so far.<br>  <br>  My dog is very well trained. I mean, she has her moments...shes a dog not a human afterall.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  I *do* excuse my Aussie mix's behavior when she begins to bark/chase the cattle. She's not a "trained" herding dog, but she has it in her, since she's a Shepherd.<br>  <br>  I excuse my Sheltie's barking (though he knows "quiet"), because it's a breed "trait".<br>  <br>  I excuse my Lab mix carrying dog-knows-what in her mouth 24/7, since she's a retriever.<br>  <br>  My dogs are pretty well trained, but I have excused them on many random occasions--such as jumping on people or into their cars (don't ask)--because I wasn't there at the time, and they are pretty well rounded, they just prefer to listen to me.|`|QLrk3ep9aa	I make some excuses for my dogs behavior, but then I take the time to fix it.<br>  <br>  Me and my girlfriend have a 5 month old german shepherd. He is very weary of strangers, and afraid of people. Today he nipped at the vet. It is not his fault. German Shepherds as a breed are known for their weariness of strangers. They require a LOT of socialization, and even then are usually not super fond of strangers (of course, each dog is different). Throw in the fact that he is from german imports, and german lined shepherds are known to be even more weary then their american counterparts. Certain breeds have certain traits, and your stupid if you DON'T accept that some behaviors are commen for some breeds. If you own a pit bull and it kills your small dog or cat or any other animal in the house, you can't blame the pit bull. If you own a hound and it kills your rat, you can't blame the hound. If you have a beagle and it barks constantly, you can't blame the beagle.<br>  <br>  My aunt fosters beagles. Many of them are abandoned in the field by hunters. They are usually traumatized by this. Most of her dogs are very aggressive to men, and people wearing bright orange and red colors. Again, you can not blame the dog in this.<br>  <br>  Our shepherd is enrolled in training. We take him out daily to get him around new people and dogs. We are doing everything right, and our pup is only acting how people bred shepherds to act.|`|TgNQAYyXaa	No<br>  No<br>  No<br>  <br>  Owner of a UD dog.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Do you excuse your dog's behavior because of its breed?<br>  No<br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you it had a traumatic experience?<br>  Not after the first 6 months<br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you failed to train it?<br>  No|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	There are some behavioural problems where you need to understand the cause of the behaviour before you can begin to address the behaviour.  By understanding the CAUSE you can choose the most appropriate training METHOD to address the problem.<br>  <br>  I also think you need to understand your breed so that, again, you can choose the most appropriate training methods for that breed.<br>  <br>  I have an Australian Kelpie and a Belgian Shepherd Malinois at the moment.  Both of these breeds are herding breeds but have VERY different natures and their training needs to be "tweaked" to take this into consideration.<br>  <br>  I don't excuse my dog's behaviour, I address it.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Do you excuse your dog's behaviour because of its breed?<br>  <br>  I have never needed to.<br>  Dobermanns are naturally obedient, *but* have a natural tendency to be dominant. If an inexperienced owner has a poorly bred Dobermann & then fails to train and control his dog, there is the potential for disaster. Usually for the Dobe. <br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behaviour because you it had a traumatic experience?<br>  <br>  When I noticed a behavioural problem in the bud with one of my Dobes {after he had been mauled}, I addressed it & did not bury my head in the sand hoping it would go away. The solution wasn't simply to *just* train the dog, I had to learn to read my Dobe, control his behaviour & manage his environment. Some problems can be managed but not cured. {My Dobe was slightly weak nerved, so made an excellent, but not a complete recovery}<br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behaviour because you failed to train it?<br>  <br>  Definitely not. The responsibility for training *my* Dobermanns falls squarely on my shoulders. It was a steep learning curve after my Dobe was mauled, but at all times when he was outside, inappropriate behaviour was immediately corrected & he never posed a threat to a canine {human aggression wasn't the issue}.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Do you excuse your dog's behavior because of its breed?<br>  No,  I researched the breed before I got it, then took steps from the day I got her to offset undesirable traits.  In my breed it is a tendency to be overly dependent and wary of strangers.  So it was, socialize, socialize, socialize.  <br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you it had a traumatic experience?<br>  No, I am careful to avoid traumatic experiences.  But when something does frighten them I make them deal with it immediately, without babying them.  I will give a reason as I work on the issue.  Case in point, I just got a 4 year old male that was raised in a kennel situation and had limited exposure to the world.  He was hesitant about every new situation.  I gave him some slack while we were working thru it.  He now goes everywhere and is gaining confidence by the day.<br>  <br>  Do you excuse your dog's behavior because you failed to train it?<br>  Yes,  any negative behavior my dogs do is because I have not trained them properly and it is my responsibility and my failure.|`|AA11026827	I never make excuses.

oDVx7nSxaa	People say that Siamese are mean because they don't understand them!  Siamese can be very much a one-person cat, to the point where they will shun others.  The offended people who they ignore (generally visitors) then call them mean.  They also have that loud yowl, which is just their way of talking, but it can sound pretty bad.  Yes, there are mean Siamese out there, but that is true of any breed - there are nasty Persians, mean Ragdolls, mean domestic short haired cats.  <br>  <br>  I'm involved in Siamese cat rescue, and in addition to my own Siamese I've fostered almost 200 other cats.  Of all of those, only one was mean, and she had been terribly abused.   Enjoy your kitten, and try to educate those who wrongfully tell you he's going to get mean.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I don't know WHERE people get that idea about Siamese - I've been around cats my entire life, show cats, and have yet to meet a "mean" Siamese.<br>  <br>  They are very talkative cats and like company and will help you do everything.

A lot of siamese in the 1980's were inbred when sold as pets, which didn't help the 'mean' label.<br>  <br>  I can say my siamese was absolutely a wonderful cat all the way around. I've met others who were just as great.  My sig. other had a bad experience with one as a kid so was hesitant to come in when he saw mine, but ten minutes in the apartment and the cat was smitten with him--changed his whole outlook on the breed.<br>  <br>  Socialize your cat, give him attention, he should be great.

I'd love to have another at some point (we have 3 cats right now, most are former strays).|`|aOx0U3wKaa	my friend has only had siamese cats as pets since as long as i can remember and shes never had a problem with them being mean. just dont give them a reason to be mean, or afraid of people|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	yes its true he will become mean...get a bombay cat...mine was 10 and acted like she was 1 hehe!|`|PnXIkoz7aa	Siamese cats are some of the most beautiful and sweetest cats you could ever own. I have found in my experience anyone that says Siamese are "mean" are people that have absolutely no real experiences with them. I've found the only knowledge some people have of Siamese cats are the cats from the old Disney movie The Lady and the Tramp which is a completely wrong perception of this beautiful breed. Siamese, however, are very vocal about their needs and wants. They love to headbutt, kneed their paws on your body and give love "bites". They can also be stand-offish and proud. In my entire six years with my siamese whom I've raised since he was six weeks old he has only ever hissed at two people and that has been the extent of his meannesss. He is sweeter and more loving than my DSH cat but only slightly less sweeter than my tabby.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is love your Siamese kitten just as he is and your reward will be the most wonderful cat owning experience you could ever hope for.|`|K2fGbrMQaa	no... who told you that? <br>  <br>  Siamese makes really good pets if you are ready to give them the affection they need, and to put up with their quark of being VERY talkative (I love talkative cats!) Siamese are very very dependent cats; they are more like dogs in terms of affections and attention they'd need, so I raised mine as if he was a dog. He is more affectionate than some dogs I've trained!<br>  <br>  From what I have heard from other cat owners, cats are needy when they are kittens, but have less attention span for being held and patted because, well, they are babies. Then they become a bit stand-offish when they are in their teens (1-2 years old) and rebellious. As they go into adulthood (2+) and age, they mellow down and thus can sit for longer sessions of affections. However, in my experience, my Siamese/Burmese mix has NEVER gone through the rebellious time. He was affectionate when he was a baby and he is now 5, and just as sweet and lovey.<br>  <br>  In my research and personal experience, in order to have an affectionate cat, you need to do the following: (if starting with a kitten)<br>  1. DO NOT get a tabby, or an offspring of a feral<br>  2. Spend the first few months of your relationship with the kitten setting boundaries (don't let a kitten get away with anything you don't want a full grown cat to do, and reward him/her for behaviours that you adore. Please contact me if you need pointers in this directions), and loving and loving it. Spend as many hour as you can afford to with him, don't let him go hungry for affection or food or water.<br>   REMEMBER, your kitten has just left mom and his previous situation--which could be good or bad, but was familiar--he need as much reassurance you can give. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps, please let me know if you have any questions about training and care about your kitten :)|`|741ae50bbc3a424e88ff8d0a0bc91407aa	They are very entertaining cats!

We found a reputable qualified riding instructor/school.  They understood, took everything slowly and ensured that the horses she rode were suitable.

What you can do is have the vet run it through the insurance company for approval PRIOR TO surgery to be sure it will be covered first.  If it's not, then you'll need to make some hard decisions.  Have them fix the knee for now, and deal with the hips later, or whatever.  Are they sure the surgery on her hips will correct the problem, or is it something that will have to be repeated when she's older?  If that is the case, then you may want to wait until she is done growing before having the surgery on the hips anyways.  Ask your vet if that is more plausible - no sense on putting her through all that trauma more than once.|`|eoQoCcz5aa	German Shepherd dogs do seem to have a problem with their back legs when they get older I don't know why but friends that have had them all had the same problem . Regarding the insurance it's only a baby there's no way they can bring up garbage like a genetic disorder .Get your vet to put down something else or get any treatment done now and if a problem arises with payment from insurer to your vet let it go to court . Without a doubt this will be laughed out of court , trust me a young child in court because of the dog that they loved needed treatment and the insurer wouldn't pay . Insurer will bottle it before you even mention court action so do not worry about payment for treatment . Wish it would go to court though would love to witness that.

OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  The Goldendoodle is a "designer dog," a hybrid resulting from breeding a Poodle with a Golden Retriever. Like all other designer "breeds," the Goldendoodle is not truly a breed of its own, but is a crossbreed--and in this case, a cross that is enjoying growing popularity.<br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=912304334927585133157515506270" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=912304334927...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|3TzXXp1yaa	Well since a golden retriever and a poodle are both very active dogs I would think that they would need to be exercised every day. A few good walks, playing fetch in the yard, maybe some time at a dog park or puppy daycare would be good. If you go hiking, jogging, or are outdoorsy active even better! :)<br>  <br>  As far as the personality it could be either way. I imagine the puppy will be intelligent, friendly, active, playful, and destructive if not given enough to do. It will be a great dog though.<br>  <br>  As far as grooming I would just think that you would take it to the groomers like a poodle.<br>  <br>  Have fun. :)|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	There is no such breed.  That is a mutt and the only place you should obtain one of these mutts is at a shelter.  Any person breeding these animals is irresponsible and looking only to make money. <br>  <br>  To your questions:  There is no telling.  One person's "goldendoodle" will not be like the next person's.  When you breed mutts, there is no consistancy.  So you could get more poodle, more golden, or anything inbetween.  Your best bet would be to thoroughly research the two breeds and then be ready for any of those characteristics to pop up in your dog.|`|WBv2vD4haa	my neighbours own a Labradoodle its a horse and it lives in a small courtyard...its crazy it can almost clear our 8 foot fences in one jump...<br>  i suggest lots of room and huge fences. and good ears as they like the sound of their own bark|`|RecUV33Daa	who knows its a mutt<br>  no particular style, mutts dont have a breed standard clip<br>  who know?

gUMHWrjMaa	indeed, most likely your hamster has a huge stash of his favourite food hidden somewhere in his/her bedding. he/she will no doubt eat the food you have placed out when they have run out of food/get hungry enough. Hamsters are not that stupid, and wouldnt turn their nose up at food when they need it. if it is really worrying you take him/her out and give him some sunflower seeds or fresh vegtables (carrots, cucumber, apple etc) and see if they eat it. if your hamster starts to look too thin then yes, take them to a vet, but i am quite sure you will be a good "hamster mommy" and it will be just fine :)|`|l7N2Egneaa	you will be a good hamster mommie,dont worrie.But you need to get your hamster to eat even if it means adding some of the sunflower seeds an corn back in.it does not have to be alot but enough where it will start eating again if it does not eat for a long period of time then eats it isnt good for its health.<br>  <br>  you can also buy your hamster a wheel or hamster ball.they get edicted to the ball/wheel and they will exersice enough where you wont have to worrie about it getting fat.<br>  <br>  dont worrie.|`|Z4Fgk1q7aa	i've had tons of hamsters all my life and i wouldn't worry. hamsters tend to stash some food in different spots of the cage so although you don't see the food missing out of the bowl its prob eating from a stash somewhere. if you notice it is losing weight then i would take to a vet. hamsters are pretty easy to take care of... food, water, the right cage and they will take care of themselves lol. no worries :o)|`|Bm3vyuNpaa	Don't worry, every one has to have a 1st time to be an expert, and I'm sure you'll be a good owner.

We watched until he got too close to one of them and the cat slapped his nose, we were within grabbing distance to see if he would snap but he walked away a little ashamed.

dPLkNRNuaa	Heinz 57.<br>  <br>  Can't be a good ol' mixed breed and your local animal shelter has lots of them waiting for good homes.|`|bIaywrBCaa	chihuahuas. They are small, smart, cute, loving and lovable, just my perfect dog for all these reasons and more. Lifetime owner and lover of these wonderful little dogs.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	I have three favorite breeds-<br>  <br>  Jack Russel Terrier also called Parson Russel Terrier for a small breed.<br>  <br>  Dalmation and American Staffordshire Terrier for large breed.|`|JsBb732Maa	Australian Shepherds, beautiful, loyal, protective, intelligent beyond belief.|`|AxaspNJJaa	shih tzu: cute, loyal, smart, friendly, good with kids and other pets. LOVE THEM!lol|`|OJE7NHHAaa	I want a Pomeranian so bad:).<br>  They're just too cute.|`|DeUuipSBaa	I like all dogs but I still have my first dog, a Pomeranian. He is my favorite dog in the world and he always will be so i guess Pomeranian.<br>  Why? Because He's fluffy and energetic, always happy to go outside with me. Loves long walks epically in the winter. I love ice skating and so does he. He is a very lovable dog. He is orange and his name is Rufus.<br>  He's smart too, when you sing him his walka song: It's walka walka time its walka Rufus time its Rufus walka time. He barks and heads for the door, He's just so cute!! He's gentle with guinea pigs too. lol and gives kisses.|`|3JJVMmPnaa	Newfoundlands are my number 1 breed because they are very calm, loving, patient, intelligent, gentle giants, loyal, friendly, great swimmers and save people from drowning, excellent with children, they are responsive and devoted to you, Newfs can be a couch potato indoors with you but they can be active outdoors, and i think they are very attractive to look at. <br>  <br>  I LOVE them!!!|`|qAkLi8oQaa	Doberman would have to be my favorite breed..I would say the reason is because the dobe that i have she was so easy to train she is very smart and i love her personality..|`|oHKpy4IRaa	My favorite breeds of dogs are Labrador retrievers, Great Danes, and mutts because they are big, friendly, and love everybody and everything.|`|E7JjLeSxaa	German Shepherds! German Shepherds usually attach to one person and are loyal to that person forever.

PM23RDycaa	No she's cleaning them. If she's not acting erratically or aggressive towards the pups take a deep breath.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/medical/whelping.html#whelping" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/medical/wh...</a><br>  <br>  And keep trying you neighbor until they pick up or show up at your place.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Just don't make this more stressful for her than it already is!  Try to be calm!  She is opening the sacks and disconnecting the umbilical cords/placenta from the pups.  It is normal for her to eat the placenta/after-birth. She will lick and lick and lick. All this is very normal, but can be of worry of someone who has never witnessed a whelping.  If you can, if she will allow you, move the pups out of the way while another pup is being delivered.  You don't want her to step on or squash any of the pups that are already born while she is whelping the next one.  In between births, put the pups up to nurse.  The first milk/colostrum is very important for the pups.  Just keep a close watch and call the Vet if you have any problems.  Make sure you take Mom to the Vet within 24 hours of post whelping.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Lord there is nothing more nerve racking then watching pups be born. When my border collie had her first litter I thought I would have a nervous breakdown. lol I actually was scared she would eat her first pup but she didn't thank god. It sounds like your little mommy is doing what she is supposed to do. I would sit back and let her do her thing.<br>  Good Luck!!!|`|AxaspNJJaa	No she's doing fine. Shes just eating the membrane. Yes, it does sound gross but thats just how it is. :) lol.|`|1pNj7xEqaa	well not really. she is liking them because she is cleaning then from the blood they have on them. no begie|`|bIaywrBCaa	Sounds like she is doing great. They lick to clean them, remove the membrane, etc. She will not eat them unless maybe she has a dead one. You really should get a free pup out of the deal! Seriously! I think the owner knew she was in labor(how could she/they not) and did not want to deal with this and left it to you!<br>  <br>  Glad they came home. I would be so angry that they left a dog in labor at my door. I have canceled many appointments just because my dogs were in the last week of pregnancy and I wanted to make sure I was there for the event. They had to know she was in labor. They just wanted someone else to deal with it!! You deserve pick of the litter for sure.|`|uKpkOss0aa	It sounds like she is doing just fine.  When a mother dog licks her newborn puppies, she is doing so to clean them off as well as get rid of the after birth and placentas.  If you have any questions, you should ask your neighbor's dog's veterinarian.|`|b1461ee6cb21361aad22b1b0151b5104aa	my pom just had puppies, and she licked them forever!!! lol she's not going to eat the pups thats what she is supposed to do, allllll normal!! lol dont worry .they will all be fine.|`|7ViHb7cwaa	Very doubtful that she will eat them. My dog Lucy gave birth last summer and she licked them like crazy; they are supposed to do this to clean the puppy's face so that it can breathe.|`|1cPB2NYfaa	A human cleans their baby in a bath right? <br>  So animals have their own way of cleaning their babies. By licking them. It's all gravy.|`|JMOvQhIGaa	No|`|ce41R9gFaa	No! she is just cleaning them
bIaywrBCaa	I have had chihuahua give birth to 7, even 8. There may be more, just watch her closely. The pups have been coming pretty quickly, she may slow down a bit. I applaud you for doing such a great job! btw, I handle my newborn pups from the minutye they are born, just wash your hands before holding them. <br>  <br>  Glad they came home. I would be so angry that they left a dog in labor at my door. I have canceled many appointments just because my dogs were in the last week of pregnancy and I wanted to make sure I was there for the event. They had to know she was in labor. They just wanted someone else to deal with it!! You deserve pick of the litter for sure.|`|AA11244754	If you wash your hands really well before and after.  If you have the vet's number and if your neighbor was a really responsible pet owner she would have taken the dog to the vet for prenatal checks (just like human women need) and given you the vet's number in case of this happening so that you can call and check.|`|EeJMITyCaa	YAY!!!! She had the pups! I saw your question early. You should get one for all your work! If the mother is taking care of them and its warm in your hosue then everything is fine for know. The owner should take her directly to the vet. If they arent feeding they should go to vet.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	You will know by her wanting to "Settle in" she will be at ease, place the pups on her to nurse so she can relax and be mom.<br>  If she is still panting, restless etc she still has more.<br>  Get her some cottage cheese and a drink of water, she will need it.|`|JsBb732Maa	That's a big litter for a small dog, the owner might have to help feed them. Wash your hands before you touch them.|`|b1461ee6cb21361aad22b1b0151b5104aa	wash hands, and if she lets you, you can pick  them up long enough to move them so they can feed, i would make sure she has plenty of water, but no food, especailly dairy !! i wouldn't hold and pet the pups yet, i would just watch her, and move the babies so they can feed. good luck. she knows what she's doing.|`|PM23RDycaa	Wash your hands first. If the mom seems like she will let you touch them you can, but sit down while you are doing it.<br>  <br>  Five should be it, but you never know. If she shows signs of still pushing she may have another pup or two inside of her. You should have talked to the vets about this when you had them on the phone.<br>  <br>  ADD: If the pups are spoken for your neighbor knew her dog was pregnant and dumped the work on your shoulders. She better be glad that nothing went wrong. My advice never petsit for her again as she seems to forget IMPORTANT need to know info.
pd5rERcfaa	Oh my gosh, she is so cute!  I'm so glad you decided to adopt, I'm so proud of you!  Way to be responsible!  To me, she kind of looks like a Lola.  Make sure you get her some chew toys as well a interactive toy, like a tug rope.  Any kind of soft bed will be good, she'll love any warm and comfy bed. I'm so glad you found a pup to love, have fun!<br>  <br>  Seriously, your story has made my week.  It made me cry to read how much you love this little pup!  Thanks for being so kind hearted and for doing the right thing.  Yay for you!|`|80S8U7Edaa	Congrats on the new dog! You can find a lot of awesome things for your dog on this site: <a href="http://www.gingerpuplane.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gingerpuplane.com</a>|`|bIaywrBCaa	What a beautiful brindle. How about Tessa after my chi, she looks just like her! Same coloring. I would call her Rena or Trena. She will probably be about the mother's size. thanks for adopting! I like the name Tiger Lily too as she is tiger striped.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	Name her Rena the best food for a pup is Purina puppy chow with 1/2 tablespoon of water on it|`|gse1455saa	How cute!  Looks like a chi body and head and a brindle cairn.  I think she will look like a brindle chi when she is done.  How cute!  Ten pounds tops.  Cairns are usually about 15 or so but seeing as her body is so chi she will probably be smaller.  Get a decent puppy food (science diet) or the equilivent, little bowls that will be hers,  a small crate wouldn't hurt either, she is so little and needs a safe place to all her own.  Make it really open on all sides so she can see and maybe throw a small blanket over three sides sometimes to give her someplace cozy.  Small toys that squeek-something soft
crlXvjXOaa	The fact that you are concerned enough to ask all these questions says to me you're a good candidate.  Greyhounds DO NOT need a huge amount of exercise. One walk a day is plenty, their main joys in life are sleeping and being with you.. They are sprinters and unless conditioned for it they do not have the stamina for great amounts of exercise.<br>  <br>  Stairs can be a challenge  as many retired racing greyhounds have no experience of them. This will take time and patience.  You will never regret taking one of these beautiful souls into your home.. Best of luck.|`|20fqa5hCaa	I can't imagine that there will be a problem.  One thing they will ask about is where the dogs will be when you work.  They won't want him outside the whole time.  Either he's in and you have someone let him out to go potty or there is a dog door that leads to the fenced yard.  Greys are not too hardy to heat and cold.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	The most important thing to keep in mind is that adopting *any* dog is a learning experience, and the dog will be your teacher.  That means the rescue rep and the foster will guide you as to what you would need in terms of setup and schedule for that particular dog.<br>  <br>    Any dog is going to need two to three walks per day - especially a dog that is confined to the house.  If you mean actual long walks as opposed to short outings to potty, make sure you communicate that. <br>  <br>    Some Greys are fine in crates, and some are not.  Be ready for that, and have an area in your home where the dog can be kept safely - they can reach everything on a shelf or counter that you can, and very little is safe unless it is in a cabinet.  You may need kiddie latches.<br>  <br>    Make sure the bird is somewhere the dog *cannot* get to it - although I know one Grey that lives on floor level with a parakeet, you hjust never know.  Tastes like chicken...<br>  <br>    If you go into this with an open mind, and ask for help, you will get a much better response - but for the most part, you have the makings of a great home.  Good luck - and thanks for giving a Greyhound a home!|`|P5CLeokmaa	Go to the shelter's site, and try and find the adoption application.<br>  <br>  and print it off if you can.<br>  <br>  Grey hounds are so pretty, i am in the process of adopting right now. and you have to be 21 and i am not 21 so my mother has agreed to adopt her for me.<br>  <br>  Just you have to assure them you'd be a great owner and mommy.<br>  The adoption that i am doing they will have a house visit to.<br>  <br>  Just make sure, you can handle the dog.<br>  <br>  you seem like it would be okay.<br>  <br>  I would just look on there web site.. the application maybe be under apply?|`|XavY3fiWaa	It sounds like you are a great person to be adopting a dog, i think there is a great chance they would let you adopt one.  They will probably want to visit your home and ask you how the dog will get exercise, and if you have other pets, and if you own or rent your home, and different questions like that, when you find a greyhound rescue try to see if they have the adoption application on their website(they usually do), and you can look at all the questions.  And i think it is great you are adopting a dog in need of a home.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Most of your info is good but speaking from the ones where I live, they will not adopt to anyone w/o a completely fenced in yard. My sis has adopted couple of them & you must have a fenced yard. They need to be able to run & there is no way you can run fast enough for them.  They are quite a chore to catch when they get loose. I had experience with this when one of hers escaped from my home while I was watching dogs for her. Finish fencing in the yard then apply.|`|GSf09ALBaa	They may require you to have more fenced in yard for the dog to exercise in.  And keep the bird in a cage.  Go for it.  I foster for a Dachshund Rescue and though we are strict, you sound like a good adopter.<br>  <br>  One thing that is very important is if you have had dogs in the past they will check your vet records to make sure your dog had all shots, was on heartworm preventive etc.<br>  <br>  Don't let those adoption apps scare you.  Go with faith.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Adopting a dog is a life-changing event--or should be. A dog needs lots of time and attention and you've got to be there every day to give it. So find out whether you're ready for a dog, or would be happier with a goldfish instead.<br>  here's a quiz:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=012239747972184286996144202895" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=012239747972...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|71i6IjdZaa	You sound like a great person to adopt, and im sure they will see that! however Grey Hounds need alot of exercise and cant stay inside most of the day, they need a huge area to run around in, maye you could get a cheap fence put around your property?:)<br>  xx|`|FdcWPp48aa	You sound like a good candidate for adoption.  I hope you will give it a try.  If you adopt one, then another can move into rescue.  So you will directly affect saving a life!|`|GR07LyyTaa	you sound like they will let you.. but i had a grey hound before and they need a lot of exercise.. i actually got one from a racing place because she wouldn't race she'd try running out to the stands.. but any who.. they are amazing dogs and very pretty.. if i had the room i would get one my self.. but you sound like you are going to be a good owner.. just remember they will need tons of exercise!!!! good luck!!!
0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	You have all of the earmarks of a dyed-in-the-wool fish-aholic.   "Hi my name is(your name here),and I'm a fish-aholic." (Group) Hi (your name here)." The first step is realizing that you have a problem. <br>  The next step is to locate some support. Look around on the Inter-net for a local or nearly local Aquarium Society or Tropical Fish Club. Here you will be able to observe all of the various stages and degrees of your problem. Also you will be able to narrow your choices as to what sort of fish problem you'd like to address first. I've seen people that change their addiction every two years or so, to people that get fixated on one type or another and make that a life time focus. As for myself it's been 60 years and has covered lots of different fishes and people. I've been collecting in the Brazilian Amazon half a dozen times,and have been a member of several different Societies and associations and clubs. I've met hundreds of fascinating and eccentric,and learned people and wouldn't trade a minute of any of it. Lately my wife and I have become SCUBA divers just to avoid having a Marine aquarium. It's much cooler to go visit the fish than to keep them in the living room.<br>  Please excuse me for rattling on so,but even after 60 years I'm still fairly enthusiastic, and there are lots more species that I'd like to try.<br>  P.S. Start using the phrase "fish room" in everyday conversation so it won't be too big of a shock to you spouse when you ask for one.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	I think you need to put your husband in a bigger tank.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	huh, oh, yeh, i'm still awake. i'm sorry what did you want to know again.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	you need to talk to my ex.  he filled the basement up with wall to wall fish tanks he built.  then he got a good deal on a shop going out of business and got about 50 ten gallon tanks for the babies.<br>  counting babies at one point he probably had about five thousand fish down there.|`|Jis9ipcNaa	haha, there is no such thing as too many fish (unless we are talking about in a single tank which I know we are not)<br>  <br>  I had seven at one time, I am down to four but with intentions of going back up when I can afford it. I guess the answer here is, when you either run out of room, money or time, then you have too many fish|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Quite writing questions that are too long to read and go set up a proper fish room to keep your tanks in.<br>  <br>  ;-)<br>  <br>  Ian|`|bDPVRtCNaa	It becomes too much when you can't keep up with the maintenance.<br>  <br>  As for the cat, teach him that it is not acceptable to climb on the tank. Though I don't usually recommend negative reinforcement, but you could spray him with a water bottle.
nAK8bm91aa	I suggest buying two 2/6's from any homedepot, lay them across the area where the feet of the stand is. This will reinforce the floor beams.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I say put them in opposite corners of the house. The corners are the strongest places.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	have three people stand side by side that should give you around 400lbs, if they do not fall through the floor you should be ok. lol<br>  <br>  i think you'll be fine if you haven't stepped through the floor yourself.|`|Jis9ipcNaa	Think of it this way, does your fridge fall through the floor? I'm guessing no, a 30 gallon would be fine.|`|4c50260b4401a8982a4125a4f42c298eaa	im  sure  it  will  hold
Td3Azeabaa	Yes there is, what you could is go to petmart or petco and buy nature's miracle its a dog spray. It does not make any stain and you can spray anyway. All you have to do is spray around where the dog pees also spray on it. Your dog will know the smell it works everywhere and all the time. If your dog barks say no, wag your finger and blow on there nose not hard though if you do that everytime it barks then your dog will learn very quick. A simple way to teach your dog not to jump you do the same thing with the nose smack its butt. It is not cruel your dog needs disclepline if you dont do it while they are young its more difficult. So after you smack there butt AND tap there nose say No and turn around until ur dog stops then when your dog does stop you say good girl and give it some love.<br>                     If you have any more questions feel free to ask I am very good with dogs I have a difficult boxer I have learned the hard wayh but giving my dog disclpline makes it easier. My dad is too hard so my dog acts perfect around him. But dont be to hard you dont want ur dog affraid of you. All this information will help you alot!!|`|pTzm38Aqaa	If he comes in and pees again than say bad dog and put him outside, than wait a little while to let him back in. Continue with the routine and if he finally gets it right give him any treat he likes. The main reason why he pees indoors is because he has spent more time outdoors than in.|`|JsBb732Maa	<a href="http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Information/HowToCrateTrain.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Informa...</a>  Crate training is the best way, here are some good tips. Before you bring him in walk him first to get him to pee, then bring him in.|`|0ZH3EStcaa	yes|`|Wt61EclRaa	When he is outside make sure that you stay with him and tell him to go potty.  Sometimes dogs don't finish emptying out because they are in such a hurry to get back inside to be with everyone.  If you walk your dog and it pees on everything until there is only a dribble left he won't pee in the house....and tell him he's a good boy when he goes outside. Remember..... Take him out often...and don't just stick him outback,walk him on a leash also.  That is the key. Also make sure you clean the spots where he has already gone...if you see him going for it -say a sharp no! Put the leash on and take him outside immedietly and praise him when he goes.  He was probably never fully trained in the beginning but dogs learn very quickly.  Their only goal in life is to please us.  Don't lose patience..good luck.|`|uKpkOss0aa	Yes.  There is a simple way to house train the dog.  Take him outside more often to do his business.  Some dogs, if they get really excited, pee all over the place and they are unaware of it.  I know a family who has a dog that does just that.  Whenever we come over, the dog has to be let out.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Get a smaller Dog, that Lab belongs out on some Farmer's land chasing Ducks.|`|zal6shPUaa	it takes a long time there is no simple way but to force him to go were ever he goes pee
WlCvwBFLaa	Well because you don't have a blanket, I would just walk him around a little bit and then put him in his stall for the night, then she what he does tomorrow morning.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Definitely put him in the stall if it is because of the other horse outside. If you don't have a blanket find somewhere he is calm and walk him until he is cooled out and dry and then put him in.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|psNR7hDJaa	Just put him in and feed him. Keep his mind preoccupied. Do you have any ideas why he is doing this? <br>  <br>  Also for this other horse he doesn't like, is it really bad? Cause I suggest separating them then!|`|9zrHyhknaa	put him in his stall with a blanket on talk to him say easy there and don't panic|`|x6QATdl5aa	Is there a horse in the stall next to his?  If there isn't that is probably why he spins when you put him in his stall.  If you can put a horse near him I would put him in his stall.  Or is there another pasture you could put him in?|`|mMfK2LdGaa	If the horse he hates is a mare he might want to breed or show off for her.If it is a stallion he hates he is trying to tell him to back off.I hope this help you with your problem.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	its freakin cold! put him in his stall buy a blankent! calm him down a bit and just walk him or lunge him for 10 mins to tet some energy and see how that works|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I would bring him in. Throw a cooler on him, walk him out until he isn't sweating, and let him eat some hay for a while.|`|NOAwpvcTaa	He is probably freaking out and needs to calm down. I would take him out of his pasture and walk him until he calms down, then put him back in the pasture, if he runs around again then put him in his stall
SzW9GmRsaa	To have any sort of credibility as a breeder you have to get into the breed.  You have to know it and be passionate about it.  It's not enough to have a couple of Connies ... get to Ireland to the breed shows and examine what makes a good Connie.  Speak to breeders and judges.  There is no point breeding unless you know what you are breeding for.<br>  <br>  It comes from passion and knowledge, which come from time.  If you are breeding because you think you can create a product someone will buy, that makes you a dodgy breeder and only other people with questionable motives will want to buy from you.<br>  <br>  Good breeders breed because they have an emotional involvement with the breed and want to contribute something good to it, regardless of how rare or not the breed is.<br>  <br>  I've been involved in breeding for around 20 years (only a few years on my own but many helping/grooming for others) and am yet to meet someone who turns a profit.  It's a labour of love and I can guarantee you will not make a living by breeding.  In financial terms, I make a huge loss.|`|u1HahCoqaa	You do not really need to go get a degree, but think about this.<br>  <br>  Are you in your last year of school as in college or high school? Either way, I will just tell you now that breeding horses is a giant hole for money. Yes, you might get something out of it, eventually, if you get nice foals, but you still need to pay for everything before that. So, you would need another, considerable source of income.  So you might want to reconsider for a few years. <br>  <br>  What you could do, possibly, is buy a foal in-utero, or maybe use AI to impregnate a really nice Connemara mare there. With in utero, you have no garuntee about the foals conformation, temperment, talent, or gender, but it tends to be much cheaper, and you can basically get a really nice foal without having to own a really nice mare and stallion. Anyways, say you end up with a nice Connemara stallion.  You show this thing in whatever, do well, then promote the thing as a breeding stallion.  Although you are still risking a flop, atleast you flop with one horse rather than 5+. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, you could start with a mare. It might be easier. Stallions are a pain to keep. The thing with a mare is that you can't really use her as a stud, but hey, that could be fine. I just said stallion becuse you said that, basically, there would be no competition. You could still use AI to get a stallion from anywhere around the world to breed the mare though. Just make sure it is a NICE mare. You do not get nice foals from crummy parents.  Either way though, yes, you would have to show the animal and WIN.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	All you need are two intact horses of opposite gender.<br>  <br>  To be a good breeder and develop a reputation you'd need to start with a young horse, colt or filly, that has good parents. By good I mean registered with outstanding show records, great temperament and conformation. Bring the foal into halter shows and classes. Rack up points for showmanship and best in class/show. Start showing the horse at the appropriate age at high level shows. If it's a stallion you can offer free breeding to approved mares (free because you don't know if he's a proven sire) to see what he produces or you could breed your mare to an equally impressive stallion and then repeat the process with the foal that you did with your foundation mare.<br>  <br>  Getting into the business takes a long time if you want to do it right and have high quality horses and a good reputation. It's expensive to start up and you should keep a very open mind about importing semen and stock.<br>  <br>  You don't need a degree but you do need to research the breed and find the "ideal"  connemara and go from there.|`|zQ4QGrAYaa	All you need to become a Thoroughbred breeder is a registered Thoroughbred mare and money. When you register the foal, you become the breeder of record, eligible for any breeder's awards or breeder's incentives the mare and foal are eligible.|`|v67Oyaukaa	well, you should probably get as much knowlege as you can about breeding Connemaras then you should ask a professional for advice     <br>  good luck:):):):):):)|`|E3SKXPF1aa	If you find the right horses then you'll be away! You don't need any degree or anything. Just get the horses and find a buyer and you'll be fine!
gtrL7AbBaa	Don't like a dog? I like all dogs. I think their so adorable and CUTE! - All dogs! BTW what is it with you asking all animal questions- 'do you like dogs?' ' do you like chickens?' I'm just a bit confused- ah well..|`|vfd9kRrnaa	I don't understand.|`|7AehlnuJaa	that's sad.|`|EeJMITyCaa	oh|`|YLYAo2zmaa	In almost 43 years of life, I have never met a dog I didn't like|`|jy9q7AZ2aa	ring my bell and tell the maid to get rid of it.|`|11PAFD9Caa	??????<br>  <br>  You say that to the dog ????|`|VkFDAQ46aa	Leave it alone|`|ce41R9gFaa	huh im confused
rTaaIXSuaa	Think twice before getting one.<br>  These dogs have gone through so much inbreeding it should be considered animal abuse. These dogs bodies and health are below normal. They eventually will have expensive health related problems in the future and many are turned in to pet shelters and rescues because the owners didn't realize the time and money that is involved with owning one. Trust me. Besides being very stubborn, they are expensive to own let alone to buy one.<br>  If you are looking for an english bulldog for LESS than 1000 then most likely you are getting a very unhealthy dog. No reputable breeder will sell their bullies for less than that. They are expensive to breed. Females cannot deliver babies naturally. They also have to be artificially inseminated. This does not make the bulldog 'special'. It goes to show you the horrible transitions these dogs have been through.<br>  If you do decide to get one (hopefully after A LOT of research), please go to rescues or pounds first. There are plenty of them that need homes.<br>  Also, please don't get one because 'everybody has one'. It upsets me when people get dogs because everyone else is having them or they look cute. If you are not prepared or experienced in the breed, please do yourself and the dog a favor, don't get one.|`|aCqSF87Raa	With the English Bulldog, cheaper isn't really better. You may be able to find one (or a mix) at a shelter, but no good breeder will part with one for what you would consider as a "reasonable price."<br>  <br>  This is because the breed is VERY difficult to  breed - they need to be artificially inseminated and the b*tches need to have a c-section and cannot whelp naturally. In addition they need a LOT of genetic testing because they have a LOT of health problems.<br>  <br>  Even a well bred dog may have breathing problems, may snore, won't tolerate long bouts of exercise, and so forth. A poorly bred dog with have all of these problems multiplied by ten AND genetic problems like hip dysplasia (and others.) <br>  <br>  These dogs are VERY expensive to keep and tend to need lots of vet care. I would be cautious and only buy from a breeder who has done extensive health screenings and has shown their dogs (to prove the dogs are to breed standard and not too large/small.) The dog will be healthier in the long run.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  try this dogfinder to see a list of adoptable dogs near you:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=490176464155786429125353076474" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=490176464155...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Find a reputable breeder and ask to get it on a pet contract (where you will get the dog spayed/neutered). <br>  <br>  You can try and find a bulldog breed rescue as well.|`|XavY3fiWaa	Check a bulldog rescue, you can find animal shelters and rescues on Petfinder.com , try it there are so many homeless pets.|`|MaDN7knJaa	Maybe you could look on any selling websites.

GSf09ALBaa	Get a Martingale collar.  Use good leash techniques.  If I can walk my 7 month old Pit you can learn to walk a 4 month old Papillion.<br>  <br>  If you want detailed information, email me.|`|d5KySuEFaa	I second the motion for the Puppy Obedience Class.  You can do them at any Petsmart, Petco, or SPCA, etc.  They are not very expensive but you will be very hapy with the investment of a couple of hours a week and the hundred bucks.  I never owned a dog until I got my puppy last year and was lost until I took the class.  He isn't perfect but he walks pretty much at my side, etc.   Basically, you have to correct them everytime they leave your hip.  This will test YOUR patience like you cannot believe, but in time they will get it.  Learn to do it right and you and your puppy will both be happier.<br>  The class will tell you a regular collar and leash are the most responsive and humane ways to go, not the harness or choke chain.  Go and listen for yourself.  Positive reinforcement is the prefferred method for mature modern pet owners.|`|KFItomKjaa	My dog used to choke too she is such an aggressive walker.<br>  <br>  Definitely get him a harness, not a collar.  It's much easier on them to be tugged by all around the tummy and shoulders, and not just the neck.  With small dogs, the neck is really fragile and can even possibly break.  Plus with a harness he/she can't slip his/her little head out of it. Every pet store will have the option of harness vs. collar.  I love Gooby brand.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	i use a harness on my pap.<br>  also they have to be trained to walk.<br>  my neighbor uses a head halter on their pup.|`|JsBb732Maa	Look for a puppy obedience class, they will train you to train the puppy.

Please get a little girl this time even though I know you're a good owner who has their dogs fixed, two males will always be struggling for "top dog" status.  I you get a little girl they will get along great!|`|43d7bcd8eb6978e1af38224038c541f3aa	Dogs don't get along according to breed. Just because someone has 2 Labs doesn't mean they'll get along. Dogs don't discriminate like humans. Just make sure you socialize yours pups and have them meet somewhere neutral for the first time. Like a park. Somewhere besides home. And a girl would be a great fit. Good luck!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	You have to train him to like the new dog. And give him attention so he doesn't feel left out. The breed of the new dog shouldn't matter.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	A dog can get along well with any dogs if it is being socialized well.  It's not so much about the breed, it's more about how they are being introduced to each other and the personality match.  All dogs regardless of breeds, some are more dominant and some are less....<br>  <br>  If your yorkie is mellow, try to get a maltese or yorkie that is mellow...
3e9DGtfxaa	my cousins dog got involved in a hit and run and it cost about $50,000!!<br>  <br>  the guy didnt get caught and that was even worse so make sure you take your dog to the vet and work up a payment plan|`|JsBb732Maa	Call the emergency vet and ask if you can work out a payment plan, ask a relative or good friend to help.Good luck!|`|FdcWPp48aa	At the very least you should call the emergency vet and pay to have your dog euthanized.  Leaving the dog suffering is criminal.|`|5CvocInQaa	I am very sorry that your dog got hit. I think you should look at how severe your dogs injuries are and go from there. Look up on the internet on how to take care of the wounds. Be very specific on what injuries that your dog has. All that I can think of is that try your best to keep your dog comfortable and patch his wounds as best as possible. Sorry I can't do more for you. I really hope for the best and I will definitely pray for your dog.|`|AUIGCl4Raa	OMGOSH! I hope your dog is OK! I am sure that the vets will take money payments. If they don't... I am not sure what to do I'm sorry I'm only 13 yrs old. I would be so scared if my dog got hit! I hope everything goes smoothly with your dog.|`|P5CLeokmaa	WHAT IS SHE DOING?!?!?<br>  <br>  How is she acting, is she bleeding? dragging?? drooling,... foaming?!?!?!<br>   ???<br>  <br>  Ask for help from a friend a payment plan with an emergency vet..|`|XavY3fiWaa	Find an emergency vet that is open 24 hours a day.

ncWYvkheaa	Plastic tubs are the BEST snake enclosures... the only negative side is that you have to drill holes in the sides (not the top) for ventilation, and make sure the lid is escape-proof.  You'll need to use an under-tank heat pad (from petco or petsmart ...etc.)since you can't use a lamp. Most snakes do better without a lamp anyway.  They get too hot and dry out the air. <br>  <br>  btw- a plastic tub will NOT stunt the snake's growth.  Why would a 36 gallon rubbermaid container stunt a snake's growth, but a 20 gallon glass aquarium wouldn't???  Just buy the appropriate size tub and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Plastic cages hold heat and humidity much better than aquariums and you can buy a slightly tinted plastic tub so that the snake will feel safer (clear glass tanks sometimes freak snakes out because they are solitary and nocturnal...seeing people, dogs, and cats walking around all day might make them feel exposed.)  <br>  <br>  Plastic tubs are very popular and if you don't believe me, do an image search for "snake breeding facility".  I've never met a snake breeder that didn't use plastic cages.|`|zzzd9tC4aa	I would say that for a temporary home, a plastic container is fine. But remember corn snakes live for a long time and can grow up to 6feet, so buying or building your own tank is probably better off for you and your snake in the long run.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	you can-i have some ball pythons in them.need an undertank heater and need to put holes in the container.i have most of my snakes in aquariums so i can watch them|`|Syrlo7a1aa	yes u can but u have to but a heat pad for heating or you can use heat tape|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Yes, I use Sterilite containers from Walmart for mine in rack systems. You can use a heat pad or heat tape connected to a rheostat or thermostat for heat. They hold heat and humidity much better than an aquarium with a screen top. I use a soldering iron to melt holes in the side of the plastic bins. You can use a drill, but it will leave sharp edges and can crack the bin. The only benefit to a glass aquarium is it makes a better display, which the snake could care less about.<br>  <br>  mike a, a plastic container won't stunt a snakes growth like you think. Where did you even come up with that nonsense? You also refer toa glass aquarium as their "natural envoironment". How many snakes do you see in the wild living in a glass tank?|`|McnuekTBaa	Yes.<br>  Plastic rubbermaids and similar containers are easy to stack, easy to clean, and space efficient. A rack system can easily be designed so as to be 99.99% escape proof. They can be heated with heat tape.<br>  <br>  None of the above can be said for glass aquariums (except for the heat tape).<br>  And no, a plastic container won't "stunt it's growth". What a ridiculous thing to say!<br>  A plastic "blanket box" has more floor space than a 10, 20, or 30 gallon aquarium.<br>  Funny how a previous poster thinks a glass enclosure is a "natural environment" for a snake.<br>  Sorry I'm rambling. But you get the idea.
bEQn0Vrtaa	You do not have to worry about holding your mom, in fact you want her to be as tame as possible so she will allow you to hold the babies from the time they are born, The younger a guinea pig is held the better pet they are as they are used to being held and do not get scared.i am sure you can not keep all the babies so the more hospitable they are the better home you will find for them.All animals are in their own sack in momie so you can't hurt them unless you intend to hurt the mother, and Yes guinea pigs sorta gag cough, it is not a cough like we do but they do cough. I would think the main thing you should be worried about is whether the mom is to young to have babies and for that reason she should be checked by a vet so you are prepared  for any problems that might arise at the birth.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and enjoy your mom and upcoming family.|`|11Vgs45Naa	Oh no! Don't hold your guinea pig while it's pregnant! That's not good for the guinea pig and the babies could be defected if you do that. Please, don't pick her up anymore while she's pregnant.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yeah, if she keeps coughing, she could be allergic to the bedding. But once or twice is not cause for alarm.|`|oE778xh7aa	hey! its perfectly fine! mine cough all the time its ok don't worry!<br>  if you have more questions ask me at my guinea pig website in my guest book!<br>  good luck! <br>  go piggies!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  my website!<br>  www.guineas4ever12.webs.com<br>  thx!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|v1A9lxuzaa	anything with lungs can cough, it probably just had some food or sawdust in its throat. <br>  Good luck with the guinnea piglets|`|kTTK2YoCaa	I think it should be fine a baby might have just kicked something it shouldn't have i.E. the bladder.|`|0QIDzCL9aa	my guinea pigs do it all the time, mostly when they are eating and ate something to fast. i didn't know what it was at first but its a strange noise.<br>  <br>  don't worry about her being pregnant. we got a guinea pig from a rescue centre and they didnt know what sex it was. so she ended up being put with a male and became pregnant.  just don't hold her now she is nearlly due cause you could accidently hurt the unborn babies.|`|DeUuipSBaa	She's fine. My sister's piggie was prego and she coughed. It's normal. You cough don't you? :) Emma and her babies are fine!! :)<br>  <br>  Emma got pregnant because the petstore gave me a boy so that's why she was prego.|`|XDCLL4Oqaa	Okay, number one- thanks for getting your guinea pig from a shelter. <br>  Number two - Many shelter workers are teens and have no clue upon how to sex guinea pigs. <br>  number three- Guinea pigs cough somtimes because they swallow spit faster than normal, choke on somthing, and yea. She may have a cold though in this weather i don't think so. I think it was just a little choke. No biggy. Don't worry i would be going crazy if my pregnant guinea pig coughed :) <br>  <br>  Goodluck, i hope there are no complecations, in the birth.
iZml58CAaa	Enroll yourself and the puppy in puppy class immediately. Do not allow puppy to bully your other dogs. The poster who said "its just a puppy thing" is giving you a potentially dangerous piece of advise. Puppy needs to understand that you are the boss and that it displeases you when she bullies the other dogs. Getting control over the puppy is easy when she is little. If you do not intervene now while you puppy is little, she will hurt your little dogs when she gets bigger. You need to get on google and read about training puppy and how to handle dog aggression tonight. Every time puppy acts aggressively towards the terriers and you do nothing, it reinforces the notion that the behavior is acceptable. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|RtdTxsd7aa	Just let them get along with each other. Us they see each other everyday they will love playing and have fun together. But, if it doesn't work just let them sit in the same place and if they get bored they will love to play together. Sometimes, dogs just need time to get along with someone.|`|HMekr9oKaa	this is just a puppy thing my puppy did the same thing and now that she is older she knows who is boss|`|xNZj9Wn1aa	Dont worry its a puppy thing.

m4uDn0ofaa	She may have a bad tooth, you should call your vet and set up an appointment.

The breath may indicate some sort of systemic disease or infection, especially if it has come about suddenly.  The licking and eating issue is very strange as well and may indicate some sort of nerve or neurologic disease or damage.<br>  <br>  Please have your dog examined immediately, if it is something major you really want to get it diagnosed and treatment underway immediately.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	She could have dental disease, almost certainly if her breath is that bad.

ldfE9vNGaa	I'm so sorry to hear about what's happening to your pup. I know how horrible this disease is. <br>  <br>  The most acute phase of the illness usually lasts from about 7 - 10 days, if you're on day 6 now, he's holding his own. That's good.<br>  <br>  Getting enough fluids into him is one of the most important things you can do, and an IV is the best way. Also, he should be on antibiotics to combat any secondary infections. <br>  <br>  The shaking is because  he's scared, has a fever, is dehydrated and feels terrible. All you can really do is to comfort him and give him as much love (and rest) as possible. The fact that he gets to his feet when he sees people is also a good sign. Often a dog with Parvo won't move for any reason. Labs don't have the predisposition to Parvo the way some other breeds have, and he's not a tiny puppy, all of those things are in his favor.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately Parvo is a very vicious disease, and very indescriminate in the way that it kills, so there are no guarantees. A puppy can seem to be improving one day, and die the next, I know because I've experienced it. However, I think you have room to be cautiously hopeful that your pup will survive this. It sounds like he's a fighter!<br>  <br>  There are different strains of the parvovirus, some target the intestinal tract, others also target the heart. The ones with the cardiac/heart component are the most dangerous. Hopefully, your pup doesn't have that variation.<br>  <br>  Just keep doing what you're doing - fluids, rest, love.... and some prayers, and hopefully you're pup will make it through this. If he does survive, you can expect the recovery period to be several more weeks, but once he is over the worst he will eventually become his old self again.<br>  <br>  I wish you the very best of luck and hope your pup is feeling better soon.|`|GSf09ALBaa	My heart is very heavy right now for your dog.  Don't let this suffering go on any longer.  Have him euthanized.  He is in pain and his quality of life is gone.  For God's sake, please put him down.  He is dying a horrible death.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	This happened to my son's boxer, talk to your vet. it's very expensive but maybe there is something they will workout. his dog ended up having a blood transfusion and did live to be 8, but the parvo did shorten his life. but I guess what I'm trying to say is if you cant afford the expense don't let the poor dog suffer. he may wag his tail that's why dogs are so loyal, no matter what they will try to please their owners. But if he is only vomiting blood he is in pain and he will lose more weight and die a cruel death. So you need to find the a way to pay for the expense or say good-bye. Do some research on line with valid pet websites, talk to some vets. but act soon.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	See if there is a vet school local that would help, I think that unless you take him to the vet and get a transfusion, he is going to pass away. It may be more humane to have him put to sleep if you can't afford the care. Or ask for donations from people.....ask the vets for a payment plan if you want him to stay with you.<br>  If you know of a dog that can give blood, they may give you a break.|`|u4WU01EXaa	Have a ring around some vets may surprise you and organise some sort of payment plan i know where i work we finance through ge money for vet bills, ring a few its worth a try and they can suggest what to do. good luck|`|n2CU8mFMaa	This would be why you get him his parvo. shot!!!! You shouldn't have taken him to any public places w/o it and now you have a choice.... Get him the correct medical attention, or watch him die|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Make sure to plan ahead, and go get him more bags of fluids BEFORE you run out.  The fact that you are tending to him almost nonstop and making sure he is hydrated is a lot of the battle.<br>  <br>   Ask your vet about using Tamiflu - I am told that can help, but only if it is given at the proper time and in the proper dosage. DO NOT experiment with without a vet's direction.<br>  <br>   It is understandable that you might not be able to afford round-the-clock urgent care for your dog, but most of this you can administer since they showed you how to give him fluids.  Just make sure you are getting all the medications and fluids they would give him, and that  he gets them when he should.<br>  <br>   The rest is between him and God - but the important thing is that you are caring for him, and he knows you're there.  Dogs have made it through this - and by the way, many dogs have gotten parvo that WERE vaccinated - it just gives them a better chance.<br>  <br>  Good luck-|`|77yg1Svcaa	im sorry to hear about your puppy : ( my friends rottweiler puppies just died because of parvo : ( thay were just abut 2 months old and even if they have the shot they could still get it my friends dog already had the shot|`|7ViHb7cwaa	I pulled my 5 month old border collie mix through this; give him pepto several times a day (to coat the stomach and prevent blood in stools); also do you have him on amox anti-biotics to prevent sickness? How about a pain-killer syrup (ours was flavored with cherry; Riley loved it)...Between pepto, anti-biotics, and pain killer, Riley pulled through. I know it's hard to be strong when it's your baby's life at stake; i was lucky to find a vet who gave me all of these medicines for a very reasonable price. Good luck and I hope your baby pulls through.<br>  <br>  And don't feel horrible, these people giving you a hard time have obviously never made a mistake in life and are completely insensitive. I'm sure you're doing all you can.
50WCN0graa	Grapes are toxic to dogs.|`|lKp5ZpzNaa	Here is a list and some talk about things you should never feed your dog. <br>  <br>  Giving your dog a treat, something from your own dinner table, is an act of love and giving that we all have done at one point or another. This is actually a bad practice. Not only does it lead to begging, there are also many foods that are toxic to dogs.<br>  <br>  For example, chocolate, garlic and onions are just fine for people but can be fatal in large enough amounts, to dogs.<br>  <br>  Chocolate<br>  Chocolate is well know for being harmful to dogs. The reason is because it contains a compound known as "theobromine" This is a diuretic and cardiac (heart) stimulant.<br>  <br>  When a dog overdoses on chocolate, it becomes excited and hyperactive. Since it is a diuretic, it will make it urinate abnormally, possibly dehydrate, and also cause the dog to drink water excessively. The dog can develop diarrhea and may start vomiting. Chocolate also interferes with the heart. It will make the dogs heart beat irregularly, rapidly, and while doing something energetic may even cause cardiac arrest (heart attack).<br>  <br>  Even though after initially feeding the dog chocolate it may seem fine, but in fact it will not be. The effects are not instant, leading you to believe the cause of the illness was something else. It may take several hours to see the effects, and it is possible the dog will die within 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Chocolate that you cook with, chocolate like cocoa and baking chocolate are the most harmful. These types of chocolate are concentrated, and contain up to 10 times the harmful properties of, for example, a snickers bar.<br>  <br>  Garlic and Onions<br>  These are dangerous because of a toxic ingredient known as "thiosulphate". Onions contain more of it then garlic, so onions are more serious, but garlic is not good either.<br>  <br>  Dogs given too much onion or garlic develop what is known as "haemolytic anemia", this means the dog's red blood cells actually "burst".<br>  <br>  The symptoms the dog displays start with gas, vomiting and diarrhea. They will loose interest in food and will become lethargic. Their urine will show traces of blood in it, and the dog will have trouble catching it's breath.<br>  <br>  This part is important, it can take several days for the dog to show signs of illness. This will lead you to believe the illness and the food are unrelated.<br>  <br>  All forms of onion or garlic, cooked or raw, contains the dangerous ingredient. Table scraps, pizza, subs, steak that's been cooked in it all carry these properties. Don't do it!<br>  <br>  Macadamia nuts<br>  Either raw or cooked, these are bad because they cause your dog to have trouble moving, walking etc. They will develop tremors and can even become paralyzed from eating too much!

And I would ask to get only females or else you will be overrun with babies!<br>  <br>  Do not buy your tank and your fish on the same day, you need to give it time to cycle, the longer you wait the better. Of course to cycle it you will have to get a bacteria, or start with the betta. <br>  <br>  If you stay with tropical community fish you can feed them tropical flakes, the betta will eat it to, just make sure you are still varying their diet though, maybe with some frozen brine shrimp or something.<br>  <br>  Ten gallon starter kits are about $60-$80, but that doesn't usually include the bacteria or the gravel and decorations.

I would suggest a 5-20 gallon aquarium depending on what you would like to add, and how much space you have to devote to the hobby. <br>  -I personally like to house African dwarf frogs with Betta's, though some people have had issues with this combination. Given plenty of hiding places, there shouldn't be a problem.<br>  -Certain fish are known "fin nippers" and should never be housed with bettas. Fish with similar flowing fins should be avioded.

So this is what you will need. You have to have a heater because it is a tropical fish, keep it around 77 degrees or more (not more than 82) this way the fish is not likely to get infections. You will also need a filter to clean the water constantly. If you get plants you should silk because plastic will cut it's fins! What sex is the Betta? If it's a female you could possibly get mabey some smaller tertras that are not expensive. The betta might kill them! Get a 5 gallon with a cover because the bettas are known to jump out! Just get a starter kit because you are a starter. You should get betta flakes because they are made for them! My opinion don't go to petsmart and those places, I wouldn't trust them! This all might cost around 30 dollars or much more depending on brand and stuff like that! Cycle your tank without the fish for about a week. Get a kit and it will have everything you need for now.Hope it helps!!

CkecSp4Uaa	All of the studies I've ever seen regarding microchips and cancer were done on rats, which are quite literally tumor factories to begin with, and showed such a *slight* increase in the incidence of tumors that I am not convinced it wasn't due to natural variation between the test and control populations.  In short, I do not believe that there is any evidence to show that microchips have anything to do with tumors or cancer.  And microchip technology has been in use long enough that if there were any connection it should be apparent by now.<br>  <br>  Yes, shelters and vets DO always check for chips if they have a reader.  I work for a vet and that is the FIRST thing we do whenever anyone brings in a new pet that they got anywhere but a breeder (and the ones that did come from breeders who microchip so that we can verify the number) whether they are aware of the presence of a chip or not.  The local german shepherd rescue I work for microchips all of their rescues (even before it was a state law that they had to) and they have had several dogs returned to them through the years because they were picked up as a stray (several of them in a different state) and the local shelter scanned the chip and got the rescue's contact information.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, there are no cons to microchipping...especially if you do it while the animal is under anesthesia for some other reason (the only con I can think of is that it is a large needle and some dogs/cats do seem to be bothered by it...although just about as many don't even seem to notice).  The biggest con isn't the implantation of the microchip itself, but failure to register the number to you.  Every microchip can be traced back to the individual/business that purchased it.  So if your dog gets loose but you never registered your information under her microchip number the person who scans her will call your vet.  If your vet has your current phone number it's no big deal.  But if you haven't updated your information with them and it is different then no one has any way to get a hold of you and let you know that your dog has been found.  We have had several cats at the vet where I work who were brought in as strays and had a chip but were unable to be reunited with their previous owner because the chip was registered to a shelter with no way to contact the owner.<br>  <br>  In the end, it's up to you.  But personally I would never own a pet that was not microchipped because the chance of that microchip meaning my pet comes home is that significant.  Tags and tattoos are nice additional forms of identification.  But tags can easily be lost  or mangled beyond all recognition (my dogs chew theirs all the time if I leave their collars on and I have lost several sets of tags that just fell off the collar...not to mention that I don't feel comfortable leaving collars on my dogs when they are unattended because of the risk of strangulation, which IS very real and well documented).  And tattoos, while very much permanent, do not have a national registry or database and can not be easily traced if the dog is lost while traveling.  Microchips on the other hand can migrate under the dog's skin but will never just "fall out" so they will always be there no matter what the circumstances.|`|AA11887983	I actually asked the veterinary oncologist that I know, when the first reports came out that there was a concern about microchips causing tumors.  She said that she didn't think that the research proved that at all.  She told me she would not be concerned about it. <br>  <br>  I think that the very minute risk of something like that is totally outweighed by the potential life saving identification that a microchip can provide.  All my dogs are chipped.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	yes love microchips! if your vet/shelter has a scanner (which they should) they should be checking.  rumors are rumors dont listen to them.  i would love for human drs to start putting them in kids.  as long as you register your animal's microchip number with the microchip company you will get you lost animal back.<br>  <br>  i have my dogs, cat and horse microchipped|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Despite our best intentions, dogs get out when we're sure they can't.

Also, change the puppy's food gradually so that the dog isn't overwhelmed, this can lead to stress, something that can worsen the dogs health. <br>  Best of Luck<br>  -Eroberts|`|QO1okC6Caa	Whenever you change your dogs food - especially for a puppy - it upsets their stomach, causing diarrhea, vomiting, and belly bloating. This is common for puppies to bloat when they eat - usually because they scarf down their food just too fast. <br>  <br>  You should stick to the food the breeder has kept your puppy on at least for the first few week of having your pup. They should have sent some home or made a recommendation. <br>  <br>  The WORST thing you can do is change your dogs food again. The dog needs as least 4 weeks to fully adjust and form bulky stool. <br>  <br>  Iams is not the best food. I would recommend a more premium brand food with a meat, polutry, or fish meal rather than a chicken or beef by-product or corn grain. <br>  <br>  <br>  \|`|dl1OOOT8aa	I'm glad you are switching (and your dog's stomach thanks you to!), Iams is a very cheap dog food that consists mainly of fillers like corn, which they use because it is cheap, but since dogs can't digest it, it can create bad gas and large feces. etc. etc. etc. In fact I looked up you small puppy iams food and the 2nd ingredient is.....CORN MEAL!!<br>  <br>  Switch to higher quality foods such as innova, blue buffalo, or canidae which doesn't have corn meal as the first ingredient. Dogs are meat eaters not corn eaters.|`|ox7yweaQaa	because IAMS are animal killers and your dog hates them. please switch her. don't buy IAMs your just supporting animal cruelty.|`|peQIh3Pgaa	Because it's like junk food.<br>  If you start feeding her good food (human-grade) You'll notice a difference.
7HxJvbjMaa	Be honest with your mom and tell her what you told us... that you are in love with him, he's your rock etc. etc. But also make a list of all the responsibilities you will do (and are doing) to care for this pet. If it's a matter of paying for food and vet visits are you willing to get a job and set aside $20. a week to put into an account to cover the basics for the dog?|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Try telling her that he's become part of the family in the time that he's been with you guys. I don't know how old you are, but if you're eighteen and have a job, why don't you ask her if YOU could adopt the dog. You'd be taking over the costs of vet bills and food, but she may go for that, since she'd feel little to no responsibility for the dog.|`|DDR6UUPjaa	tell her what u told us
JpH6FAlBaa	First if he is papered and registered then he is purebred. Second , breeds such as GS tend to be slow to mature the bigger the dog the longer maturity takes.. so give him more time and also sometimes in a litter there comes the oddball but that is the one that should be sold only to pet homes and not showing or breeding..I looked at him and think it is just a matter of time..he is Beautiful.|`|DTGO1pgyaa	I get a lot of emails about taping German Shepherds puppy ears. The majority of these emails come from people who are jumping the gun and worrying too much. By that I mean their pups are 3 or 4 months old and they are starting to panic because their puppies ears are not standing. I tell these people that they need patience, they need to wait until their pup has finished teething.<br>  <br>  I caution these people not to jump the gun and tape the dogs ears too early or in the wrong way. I know people who have screwed their dogs ears up for life by doing this. I have had puppy customers who go ballistic on me and panic. So I issue a word of caution here.<br>  <br>  With that said, the other side of the spectrum of taping ears is something that many people do not take seriously until its' too late. When ears are taped at 7 and 8 months there is very little chance of it working. This is an unfortunate fact of life.<br>  <br>  German Shepherd puppy ears can come up between 8 weeks and 6 months. If they are not up when the dog is through teething (this varies from dog to dog but in general between 16 weeks and 20 weeks of age) I tell my puppy customers to get very interested in their ears. While its not time to panic, it is time to sit up and take notice.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well, he is a cutie, My GS ears were up for all of them by 7 months or so. They say it isn't so but don't fool with his ears like patting him on head and stuff. See what happens..did he come from stock that you have seen? Where their ears up? Whatever happens he is a cute dog!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Looks like they are up to me. If at the age of 14 months his ears are not up then they probably will never stand up, however, his ears look like they are up to me in most of the pictures.|`|ZfKDp7IXaa	Aww he's cute!<br>  <br>  Don't worry, my dog looks like a wolf too! i have a similar problem, they don't go down! Don't worry, he just doesn't feel like it.|`|tmGRe2Jraa	We had a purebred German Shepherd with coloring very similar to yours, and his ears didn't go up for ages, either.  People insisted all the time that he must be a mix (despite his papers and pedigree).  His ears went up eventually, but I rather thought he looked cuter with them all floppy.  I guess sometimes it just takes a bit longer.<br>  <br>  Thunder is adorable, he's got really beautiful and unusual coloring!|`|ptNy4uicaa	sometimes you need to tape the shepherds ears to get them to remain in a upright position. Usually this is done when they are very young. <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a link that may help you.<br>  <a href="http://leerburg.com/tapingears.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/tapingears.htm</a>|`|zTeLhroWaa	One of my GSD's ears are perked constantly<br>  <br>  The other ones are down constantly.<br>  <br>  It's a genetic mutation more or less.  I think it's cute|`|4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	Not all GSD's ears go up, sorry but it is true.  The pictures you have do not look like a purebred GSD to me.  Is he American or European Stock?<br>  The reason why I ask is the picture of him in the grass facing away shows a very short tail and absolutely no slope to his back.  These are two major traits to the GSD's.<br>  "Papers" or being a Purebred does NOT in anyway mean quality!<br>  I agree he is cute, but he may stay they way he is.  <br>  What you feed can also have an affect on if they ears stand up or not.<br>  What did the breeder say?<br>  <br>  *note* just because a person "says" a dog has papers, does have papers, or is a purebred does NOT mean it is true.  If a person has papers on GSD # 1,2,3 and then dog #2 dies and he still keeps papers.  Then he gets a dog from a friend or as a stray that looks like a GSD and breed it they can use dog #2's papers.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Doubtful they will stay up.  It is genetics & quality of the breeding.  Each pup can have a different father so it is possible your dog had a different father than the others. You can try to get them to stand but I don't know if it is worth it at this point.

FvAl3UgQaa	A tortoise can store sperm for years and only lay fertilised eggs if/when she feels the conditions are correct. This can cause additional problems when eggs are retained for too long and the eggs get over-calcified and become rough - making them far more likely to be retained to the point where they become stuck (known as dystocia or egg binding). <br>  <br>  If perfect laying conditions are provided, Mediterranean tortoises (the ones I have most experience with) will mate in the Spring and lay their eggs in early summer, so it can't be a long pregnancy - around 2 to 3 months on average. <br>  <br>  Incubation time varies from species to species.<br>  <br>  Why are you asking?|`|jDPULfjKaa	depends on species|`|1NtC3SG0aa	six months<br>  ..... <br>  haha kinda random question though.. can i ask why??|`|UcmRqoKeaa	60-100 days

AtLdnZd5aa	give them a few months to see if they will recover and learn that lesson always buy locally and might not get ripped off anymore plus you will help your local economy|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Yes they will add some flourite substrate (petsmart or LFS) when your planting them and drop in some plant food tablets (LFS) and you should be good=) I think it was that color due to shipping and god knows what conditions these plants were exposed to over there.
AtLdnZd5aa	yeh a little overstocked but not too badly i think it should be fine <br>  btw i love the way you have it planted.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Its fine because each of those fish arent big waste producers. But it would be best to get those fish in a proper school of at least 6. Especially the barbs. Barbs are problematic fin nippers when they arent in schools, and the betta has long fins.<br>  <br>  Other than that, its fine. Planted tanks can generally hold more of a load compared to non planted. But even if it wasnt planted, youd still be fine. The only problem is the 3 bristlenose. Thats kinda pushing it. I personally wouldnt have more than 2 in there.
RNvg2e30aa	Well, I would not do it. <br>  <br>  The dwarf frogs require a heater, while the goldfish are cold water fish. Trying to keep the temperature in the middle between their needs, means that their requirements are not being entirely met.<br>  <br>  The goldfish will need a large tank (a minimum of 30 gallons) and a very efficient filter. What I would be most worried about is the waste given off by the goldfish. Keeping goldfish means keeping a close eye on the tanks ammonia and nitrate levels. The frogs might not be able to withstand living in a goldfish tank.I hope my answer can be helpfull,good luck!|`|vVdJQPoEaa	Well im not a fish expert but there is only one way to find out|`|EZkKZtGxaa	i think so|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Dwarf frogs are tropical. Need a heater with temperatures at a constant 78-82F. They only grow to about 1.5 inches. And goldfish grow to 16 inches (depending on the species), and will eat the frog.

JJPH4yFjaa	There are many reasons for fistulas to appear on the fins of a fish, with either viral, bacterial, fungal or a protozoa being the usual causative factor. In some cases, antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals can be used for treatment, along with improvement of the environment (hygeine, water exchange, etc.). Last resort would be the total removal of all infected fish and then proceed with cleaning the tank, etc.

01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	Take it slowly. I know its so easy to just reach in and get them out but this scares them and in turn makes it harder for them to bond with you.<br>  You need to start by just sitting your hand in the cage. Do it a few min. maybe five or so times a day. They will learn that your not going to hurt them. You will notice that they will not be so jumpy the more you do this.<br>  Then you need to slowly move closer to them (they will try to get away) just be patient.  When they get on your hand start to take them out of the cage. They will jump off a few times before you are able to take them all the way out. <br>  When you are able to get them out you will need to take them away from the cage. (make sure they can not see it) and then work with them slowly. They will come around.....|`|qqeus5kCaa	don't start with your hand... first get a perch... teach them to perch on the stick first... then pull them out slowly and get them treats.... its going to take time.

They won't tolerate others, so you shouldn't have tried to breed them, only expert hamster breeders should. His age may be aiding his pain. This may be fatal if not treated. You should bring him to a vet. It shouldn't cost much, since hamsters are small animals. Good luck, and best of wishes to your hamster.
jDPULfjKaa	Well my first guess is that it is a vitamin a deficiency. What have you been feeding? calcium dusted insects, dark leafy greens and fortified pellets?<br>  <br>  or just pellets?<br>  <br>  if you have been feeding a measly diet of pellets, you need to understand that is NOT a good diet and does not provide nearly enough variety!<br>  <br>  check out the pictures bellow in the link. these are the food items that you SHOULD be feeding : <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/ca...</a><br>  <br>  its a lot of variety. vegetables, dark leafy greens and plants, and live or dead insects (preferably dead to avoid bacteria contamination)<br>  <br>  Calcium and vitamin supplements are extremely important in preventing deficiencies. If you have a young or small turtle is is ESPECIALLY important to provide calcium and vitamin dusted insects. The insects should be fully covered in the supplement before being feed. Do this 2 -3 x a week to prevent deficiencies.<br>  <br>  insects: <a href="http://www.exo-terra.com/images/shared/products/canned_foods_set.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.exo-terra.com/images/shared/p...</a><br>  <br>  supplements (rep-cal calcium w d3 and herptivite) :  <a href="http://celebritygeckos.com/Portals/28/Housing/DSC00231.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://celebritygeckos.com/Portals/28/Ho...</a><br>  <br>  that is the main reason for a swollen eye in turtles. Another could be accidental injury and no access to uvb rays, OR to much, lets say the turtle got to close to the uvb light- potentially blinding.<br>  <br>  but i think that it's definitely a calcium and vitamin deficiency, and you need to feed the proper diet and if your uvb light expired, get another! the uvb rays last 6-8 months then fade off. Reptisun 5.0 is a very wonderful uvb light that allows the turtle to self regulate their own vitamin d3. EXTREMELY important.<br>  <br>  Reptisun 5.0<br>  <a href="http://www.reptilesupply.com/images/FS-15.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesupply.com/images/FS-1...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  <br>  "we usually feed her anything. is that bad?

I am just so disappointed its hard to think straight. its the same as feeding a baby cocaine. obviously "just anything" won't ever cut it.<br>  <br>  i already described what you should be feeding!!<br>  <br>  calcium dusted crickets, grasshoppers, silk worms, earth worms, rosy red minnows, caterpillars, duckweed, anachris, romaine lettuce, mustard greens, collard greens, mustard greens, and at least ten more things.....<br>  <br>  stop being ridiculous and get the poor thing another home where loving people can take care of him/her.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	My first guess is that there is an infection and that you need eye drops. If both eyes were affected, I'd guess vitamin A deficiency and would suggest feeding it strips of liver for the nutritional value. That certainly couldn't hurt anyway.<br>  <br>  For the infection, you might also want to insure that the water is clean and at about 80°F with the basking temperature about 10°F higher. If all else fails, I hope you know of a vet who can tell one end of a turtle from the other. He can inject antibiotics.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Raise the temperature 5 degrees to bring her immune system into action. So the water should be about 75 to 80 degrees and the basking area around 95 degrees. Get some ZooMed turtle eye drops and start using that on both eyes (even the healthy one--if there's any infection starting in the good eye we want to nip it in the bud). Just be patient with her, she doesn't know what you're doing and everybody knows eyes are sensitive and worth protecting :) but you HAVE to clean it. Keep it warm for a week after the infected eye opens and then turn it back down to normal but continue the drops for another week.<br>     Eye infections are usually caused by either dirty water or improper diet or can be a forerunner of a cold or ear infection. So keep on the lookout for bumps on her jaws/neck, runny nose, and listing (swimming withone side of the shell lower in the water).<br>     Turtles need a filter that is rated for 2 to 3 times the water they are in. For example, if you have a 10 gallon tank, your filter needs to be rated for 20 to 30 gallons to clean it adequately. On top of that the water needs to be changed out weekly.<br>     She should be eating whole feeder fish, earthworms, gutloaded crickets, greens like watercress, kale, spring mix (bagged salad mix), turnip greens, dandelion, shredded carrots, and occasionally romaine or radicchio. Some apples, strawberries, or canteloupe is OK as a treat but no more than twice a month. You can supplement with pellets like ReptoMin, ZooMed's natural turtle food, and cichlid pellets. She should not get much fruit and no processed food, iceberg lettuce, or spinach.|`|498e35be1dd5947977699c8735bff699aa	first is it a water turtle or land? and my turtle had that problem...usually they can rub there eyes after a while and it will open but i did have a turtle get a disease and he couldnt open his eyes|`|UcmRqoKeaa	save up for vets and get info charts at local pet stores that's serious|`|zltJwdYyaa	my turtle had the same prooblem ... but it was dead

If the female is stressed, she will eat every fry she see.<br>  Don't use breeder nets or whatever is available, they stress females.<br>  And the females may even die of stress.<br>  <br>  If you want lots of platy fry, have 1 little tank. about 10 liters.<br>  put the female in that with some plastic plants. You'll end up with lots of fry|`|25CAIGfeaa	get a breeder trapper it's made for that.|`|ptNy4uicaa	I would not trust that statement. I would keep the frys separate for a few weeks, to ensure they survive.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	if you plant the breeding tank very well, and remove her soon after she's done then it should work out fine

Oiabe82gaa	I would slowly introduce sugar beet and rice bran. I would also introduce it twice daily both morning and evening. Also feed a High fat feed for hard working or senior/hard to keep horses. All this fat will soon start puting weight on your horse!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	Try Weight Lifter.... i find it works really well and im in Aus and since Aus and NZ go hand in hand i assume its over there to. failing that i used to feed my TB Calm Pelets.sunflower oil.lucern chalf,oaten chalf,copra and boiled rice!!! the best way to feed your horse to fatten up is like humans really.<br>  <br>  Lots of small meals though out the day works well. even if u buy a bail of lucern and feed a bikie and a hald in the morning a bikie (or a half Bikie ) and a small amount of hard feed at lunch time and a full hard feed at night. <br>  <br>  one you have required the weight that u want on your horse you can put her on a maintenance diet witch is your hard feed at night, remember excersise is also good to build mussel witch will also make her look underweight. especially on her top line ( weight lifter is great for building top line weight)<br>  <br>  Trot polls,lunging.general riding will build this up....<br>  <br>  Good luck and i would love to know how you go.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Putting weight on properly does not happen overnight. She needs lots of high quality hay, preferably offered free choice 24/7. I wouldn't start her on a lot of grain right away. If she was abandoned, then the grain would be a shock to her system and she could colic. Beet pulp soaked in warm water is a great way to get extra calories and it will be especially good for her since she doesn't have any back teeth.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Beet Pulp with her grain.  I am not sure what you have there but here in Washington  US we have a complete horse feed called Sterling Pellets that really puts weight on them.  Just make sure you are feeding her a milled grain not whole grain products so she can digest it well since she is missing important teeth.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|ysJusb21aa	You do not want to feed your horse food that will make her 'hot'.  I suggest beet pulp.  You need to soak it for at least 8 hours with equal to twice the amount of water.  You can make a mash out of it by adding some fruit and oats.  It smells so good, that it make me want to eat right along with the horse.|`|41a51e6d55d8a268a7dec4161fc89437aa	mix in high fat milk with oats, or hay|`|MUfMJYHGaa	She has no way to chew her food properly. Give her slurries of senior feed and either very chopped hay or soaked pellets. Every thing you feed her needs to be like pablum for ponies if she has no way to chew it. add a little rice bran or oil for fat She can have shredded carrots, applesauce or bran mash as well Keep her warm in winter so she doesn't lose calories trying to stay warm and cool and pest free in summer|`|v67Oyaukaa	You  give him/her a lot of sugar cubes, but not over 20. Also, if your  horse seems like it can eat more try feeding it  a little more than usual(:  good luck fattening your horse(:(:(:(:|`|OXA9s57Uaa	Use a high calorie supplement like weightbuilder.

49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Yes, they have incredible amounts of energy at this age, and need mental stimulation as well as physical exercise.  A bored GSD can be a destructive one.<br>  <br>  Training classes can help immensely to keep him busy & learning, and will help you learn to handle his energy & drives.<br>  <br>  add:  Look into this forum, lots of good advice about training, health issues, etc:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubbthreads.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubb...</a>|`|t9Fxx75uaa	My ex has a GSD and she is almost 2 and still is nutso.  BUT if he takes her on longggg walks and plays with her alot, she behaves alot better.  She ate the remote the other day and while he was programming the new one, he put his glasses on the floor and she ate the frames.  They NEED LOTS of running and playing.  There is a saying that "a tired dog is a good dog."  that is sooooo true.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Puppies have a lot of energy. He needs more than 2 walks a day. Try playing with him in the backyard for about an hour or 2 a day too.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	He's being a bratty, bored Shepherd.  Yes, 8 month pups are full of energy and antics ... and they will test you.<br>  <br>  He can help it, but he needs to learn how to control those impulses.  You can help him by making sure he has plenty of exercise and by enrolling him in an obedience class.  Don't get mad at the pup, go get educated on how to handle this boy.|`|imKCvvFKaa	it is that he's a bit bratty... i have a GSD and he was never like that. in fact, he's never chewed on that stuff, only shoes. get him some bones or chew toys|`|ydshiNrKaa	Sorry but this breed of dog needs a lot (and I mean a lot) of exercise and socialization.  Try taking him to a dog park where he can run around and play with other dogs as well as run off all that excess energy.  I take my GSD to a dog park every day for several hours to keep him from getting bored and in trouble.  I take him for several walks as well and spend time playing with him one on one.  They also need to have their mind stimulated so teaching him some tricks or commands on a daily basis for about 5 to 7 minutes at a time will help.  Give him something to do while on a walk, like putting on a doggy back pack and have him carry around some bottles of water of something.  If he likes to swim, take him to the creek or a lake and let him swim in the water.  A tired dog is one who will not get into trouble.  Once he gets older (like 2 or so) he will begin to settle down a bit.|`|YdI0TLczaa	I have had 3 GSDs and none of them were that wild. They do have a lot of energy at that age but mine have never been destructive. They've only chewed on shoes and only a couple of firm "No"s and a swat with a sheet of loosely rolled newspaper on the butt stopped that behavior. And no, I didn't even catch them in the act. I just showed them the shoe and said "what is this?!", No! and swatted them on the butt. They are extremely intelligent and if trained and corrected properly, they will never do anything that will upset you. I trained all of mine to play fetch. Everyday I would play fetch with them until they were so tired they would bring the ball back and lay down (usually 1/2 hour in a 1 acre yard). Then I brought them inside and they would sleep the rest of the evening.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	yeah sounds like normal toddler stage.  have you tried kong toys or filled bones.  sounds like hes just bored out of his mind and its causing distruction.  just b/c he is 8 months does not mean hes all grown up even if he is of size.  is he only getting the nice walks 2x/day? or do you do other activities after the second walk?  check into fun activities like doggie day care (where he can interact with other dogs)/ agility/ target training (clickertraining.com) etc.  youre lucky hes not peeing on everything :)|`|iZml58CAaa	You need to go to puppy class. You need your dog to understand that you are the head dog. When your dog learns to obey your commands, you will be able to get him to stop the behaviors. You also need things for your dog to chew if you don't already have them. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|6hvf02Eyaa	well two walks a day and play time should be a great start and he should be calming down some at this age. You are handling it correctly but if he is rolling around he is not taking a correction seriously from you! He thinks I believe you are playing..If he does not take "NO and redirect when you try this then you either need to make your correction faster or  more stern Clap and say "NO" when he re directs tell him good boy.  They have sprays that are safe for furniture at the pet store to help him not chew those things.  Also a Kong is a great toy for him and can be filled with treats and keep him busy some.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Shepherds are the most Intelligent dogs..(in my humble opinion.) T<br>  <br>  They NEED to have OBEDIENCE TRAINING. We just bought one that we had to sign a contract with the breeder that we would put her in three different classes in the first two years.  <br>  <br>  You have to CRATE the puppy when you can not watch him or are gone, this will keep him out of trouble.<br>  <br>  DId you get him from a breeder? At what age?  If you got him from a pound you could be seeing actions because of his past experiences.<br>  <br>  With proper training and rules, you will never find a more loyal and loving and protective dog than a shepherd.  <br>  <br>  Do not encourage aggression in him by playing "tug of war" or "Wressling with him on the floor"<br>  <br>  Do not allow him to run free in the yard for long periods of time, out to go potty, then back in. (our trainer has a two minute rule) Or they can become territorial.<br>  <br>  Learn the languge of dog dominance and pack rules.  <br>  <br>  Never let him walk in front of you on a walk.(this tells him he is above you in the pack) He should be at your side.<br>  <br>  Never let him sleep on your bed ( sleeping on the same level tells him he is at your level in the pack)<br>  <br>  They need a good walk 30-40 minutes a day.  Keeping him at a heal makes him work MENTALLY too. MOST bad behaviors are from lack of sufficient exercise.
lTeXIjpOaa	my 4-H club bought material and ribbon and made curtains to hang on our stalls at fair and shows, we sewed the ribbon in strips at the top to tie to the top bar on the stalls, some clubs have sewn loops in the top of their curtains and put pvc pipe through them and hook that to the top bar; we also buy a cheap shower curtain or two with shower curtain hooks and hang these up on the inside of our tack stall so that some of the kids can use this area to change/rest in private|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	Well at most shows the front of your stall has a length of 12 feet and a height of 6-8 feet. Then attach "conchos" (not sure if that's the right term, then get some decorative ribbon or string that's decently strong and tie it to the top bars of your stall. If you can try and go to the grounds a month or so early and either ask a manager or find the stalls yourself and measure how big they are. Thats what we did.<br>  <br>  AND theres a certain type of paper that you can iron right on too your fabric.. So you can print pictures of your horse and or "Ariel princess" and iron them right on to the fabric.|`|MhkscRE9aa	hmmm you can use ribbons, banners, flowers, and other springy things since spring is coming.<br>  <br>  you can print out some pictures of little mermaid. lol hope i helped.
01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	Take your time. <br>  Me personally have always let my animals work it out. I have never had one of them that has been hurt. <br>  My newest dog that I got about a year ago loved to try and play with my cat. He (Cat)wanted nothing to do with her(dog). I let them work it out and now they will chase each other around and they play all the time. Its the cutest thing ever. The only thing I made sure is that the cat had a place that he could get away,so that the dog couldn't get to him.  I hope it all works out.|`|ZGelYopdaa	put one on one side of a door and one on the other so they can slowly get use to each other... when they seem comfortable enough have a face to face intro, if they start hissing again start over!! my cats and dogs adore each other!!|`|EZkKZtGxaa	little by little show the cat the dog and show your cat that the dog wont hurt it|`|7qgMYSfTaa	I haven't had any problems with my border collie.
FkGh0LuWaa	Do not put another hamster in with her. I made this mistake with my sons Hamsters and one is now missing a toe.  Instead buy tubes, wheel, treats to hide throughout the cage and chew toys to keep her busy.|`|KeevlZnTaa	I am going to assume you have a Syrian hamster(since you other question stated it was a American short haired hamster), and there is no such type. Most fancy "breeds" of hamster are all the same type, which is a Syrian.<br>  <br>  Syrian hamster are solitary and do not like other hamsters(even their own siblings). They will fight and kill an intruder. <br>  <br>  Your hamster is probably not bored. Just get a wheel, some toys, things to chew, and a lot of bedding for digging. Hamsters do not have the same feelings as people, while we would probably go crazy if we were alone all the time, a hamster does not care. They prefer to have their own space, and do not want anything invading their territory.|`|7j3l8EJZaa	It doesn't matter.  If you like the breed of hamster you have now then sure, but if you want to see what other breeds are like then that's good too.  I wouldn't get a friend for your hammy.   They get jelous SUPER easey and they fight anyway.  All hamsters fight, unless they have grown up there entire live to together.  Your hamster would be happy if you just played with him youself.|`|RyLOBfL2aa	Yes, just make sure that it's not syrians because they will kill each other. You have to use the split cage method. You can search it into google and find how to do it.|`|JNnSMh64aa	Do not get another hamster. Hamsters, especially Syrians, are very territorial and they will tear each other apart. If your hamster is bored, get it a bigger cage, more toys, etc.

Chihuahuas don't need to be walked because of their size, but are not smart.  They will not be easy to train, and you will have a hard time teaching them anything.  I have one, and he refuses to learn even the basic commands.  Rat terriers are easy to train.  Like most terriers, though, they are very energetic.  But because of their size, a medium sized yard should do.  <br>  Go with the rat terrier.  They don't have much grooming needs, are smart and don't need much walking.  Just let them outside.<br>  Dogs need canine distemper shots, which are a one time deal.  But you need to get them a rabies vaccination every year.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	first suggestion... do your homework. rat terriers can be highly active. chihuahuas act like large dogs just in smaller bodies and yorkies need grooming on a regular basis.  <br>  <br>  please ask yourself these questions:<br>  how much time do you have to devote to a dog? - do you have time to train a puppy or do you need to get an older dog that will fit your needs.<br>  <br>  where are you going to get the dog? - petstore? puppy mill? breeder? specific breed rescue? shelter? etc.<br>  <br>  can you afford vet bills on routine vaccines and emergencies? <br>  <br>  Please review www.dontgetadog.com   to ensure you can take care of a dog.|`|tgvNs8SHaa	HEY im stuck on the same question i wanted a dog the other day and now im getting one <br>  to get a cheap cute small dog<br>  just go on<br>  www.tradingpost.com.au<br>  and then click the category pets and horses<br>  <br>  u can search all types of breeds and the price is sooo CHEAP its really good and wen u get the dog it already comes with needles i would choose a chauwawa there cute playful and great !<br>  i think you would be a great owner of a dog best of luck!|`|ErjSVRkqaa	You should do some more research on those breeds....its "Yorkie" and "Chihuahua."

A dog is replaceable but a childs face is not..if a person can't have a dog that can be left alone with a child for a few minutes then that dog is not good for that family, maybe someone with no kids . I have 4 children that grew up with dogs usually multiples in our house and NEVER had a biter..had one that growled at the youngest and it was rehomed next morning..a child is much more important than a dog...Don't feel you have to defend yourself to these people..you should be able to leave the room.|`|AA11887983	Have her checked out by a doctor.

It's common sense if there is a dog in the house. You just don't leave young children and pets unsupervised. <br>  You seem to be complaining about having to watch your child every second, well, I got news for you... preschoolers do need to be watched every second that they are awake.

Now I know many people are going to give me a thumbs down, but I am a huge dog lover and always defended the breed.  That was until my friends pittie locked on to my dog at the throat.  I had to beat him off with a pipe and mind you the were best buds for years.  The same dog attacked my neighbor and bit his hand.  Then another friend of mine who actually is a rescuer for pitties had an incident with her mom's dog and killed it.  Again, these 2 dogs grew up with eachother.  I know its not your dog, but unless you are able to keep it seperated completely, you should think of your daughters safety  To anyone who wants to call me out, I guarentee I have more experiance handling dogs than you do.<br>  <br>  BTW -  For any people saying that you should never leave a FAMILY pet unattended with a 3 year is an idiot and should own a dog.  If you have a FAMILY pet and can't leave the room for 1 min, you have more problems than the dog.  We have a baby and a 2 years old with 2 huskies and never for one sec have worried????????|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well you should never, ever leave a toddler alone with a dog unsupervised at any time.  You have no idea what your daughter did to the dog to make her go after the child.  It was not the dogs fault that he bit your daughter, it was the adults fault who left the toddler alone with the dog.  Don't ever leave a toddler or any child alone with a dog unsupervised.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	You should not have, under any circumstances, left your little girl alone with a puppy who doesn't know any better. Your little girl probably did something to the puppy. Poor pup.<br>  <br>  Getting rid of that dog won't solve anything. If you dare tell your parents to get rid of their dog who probably didn't do anything, you'll likely cause tension in the house, and you won't enjoy living there anymore. They don't HAVE to get rid of THEIR dog at THEIR house. You live under their roof.<br>  <br>  Also, some neosporin will work. If your daughter is up to date on all her shots, the doctors won't do anything except MAYBE prescribe anti-biotic pills.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well was the dog playing or aggressive?

Unfortunatly, the puppy, who was being a puppy, is going to have to pay for your laps in judgement.<br>  <br>  Take the kid to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Edited:  I'm not sure which shocksme more.  The fact that you left your three year old with a 7 month old puppy or the fact that your kid got bit by a dog and you're on yahoo answers asking what to do.  So wrong, on so many levels.|`|DTGO1pgyaa	the puppy is young and makes mistakes. at the same time you're right the dog shouldn't be around her any more. now that he is getting older (but still very very young) he might see her as a toy. This situation i am about to mention is a little different but the same concept...I have a horse when she was 6 months, she would "charge" me and it wasn't to be mean. she was playing. she doesn't see me as a human, she saw me as another animal to play with. the puppy was probably trying to play and doesn't understand but if it happened once it will probably happen again. I don't believe he is a bad dog for children to be around but until he can get proper training and manners i believe it is best. as far as the markings go, i would take her to a doctor as soon as you can. not as an emergency but just to get her checked out. the marks may not look bad but can have more damage than what can be seen like nerve damage. I am NOT trying to make you nervous i am sure everything will be okay but it is best to have a professional look. If you notice she has a fever, even a slight one, take her to the doc even faster because it is a general sign of infection if she wasn't already sick.|`|KpiCMmmVaa	i agree with jen and bonzie 12<br>  a three year old should not be left alone with a dog, especially a puppy because they do not understand what theyre doing, ESPECIALLY a pitbull.in this situation it wasnt really the dogs fault, he didnt know any better.  i also believe that you should take your daughter to the doctor to be on the safe side.you never know|`|lNzhglLFaa	i would put neosporin on it.. it is ok to use on lips so it will be fine if she gets some in her mouth.<br>  <br>  the dog was probably just playing and got carried away...<br>  <br>  i am sure it is nothing to do with the breed! its a puppy, puppies bite sometimes. (most pits a very nice dogs) a chihuahua can bite too ya know!|`|EJqsqnZFaa	Take her to the doctor, but the only one at fault here is you. Never leave a 3 year old child alone with a puppy. Niether know any better and even worse could have happened. Dont you dare try to make her get rid of the poor dog, you were careless and irresponsible and the dog shouldnt have to pay for your mistakes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****EDIT*****<br>  You are completely missing my point, 7 months old is a PUPPY and 3 years old is a BABY, if a baby jumps around and gets a puppy excited the puppy could get rough and mouthy. You do need to be around them and if you are going to leave the room you need to put the puppy in a crate, its called parenting. <br>  I do American Pit Bull Terrier rescue and finding a GOOD home for a pit bull is NOT an easy thing to do, more times then not they end up being put to sleep. Try supervising your child and see if things work out a bit better for you.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	Dog bites suck, when i was little i was bit by a Schnauzer and i know have a permanent dimple on my cheek.

I see this incident as results of two adults.  Yes, indeed it's your sister's fault not socialize the dog well.  A dog should never never bite.  But at the same time, you should not leave your child alone with a dog.  Dog see children differently and some dogs are scared of children..because of the high pitched voice and fast movement.  And sometimes it's not the dog's fault, children sometimes don't know how to touch dogs.  For your additional details...yes, you never leave the child alone even you are in the washroom.  Lock the dog up in a crate when you can't be around....especially you are talkng about a powerful breed such as pitbull.<br>   <br>  I think yes, indeed you need to take your child to a daughter....especially it's bleeding.  Without proper care, your child may have scar.  Also, you said you think the dog has only first shot set of shot...so you are not sure...so far the safety of your child, take her to the doctor.  And be prepared this incident may get escalated once doctors get involved.....they would want to see the rabies certificate...they may report the dog, etc.|`|20fqa5hCaa	Yes.  She needs to see a doctor.  It may require stitches and, at any rate, she needs a shot to make sure an infection does not set it.  A dog bite can be very serious even when it is from a healthy dog.|`|zTeLhroWaa	Next time please don't leave your daughter alone with a young dog.  One of my dogs (a small lab/coon hound mix) bit a toddler in the face.<br>  <br>  She was sitting on top of him, had her fingers in his eyes, and her hands were pulling up his lips.  He was hurting.  He retaliated.<br>  <br>  Dogs don't understand anything but to protect themselves.  Babies don't understand anything but exploring.  That's a bad combonation.<br>  <br>  We ended up putting the dog down but it wasn't because of that incident.  He got sick some years later.<br>  <br>  Point is, babies and dogs need to be watched around each other.<br>  <br>  It wasnt your baby's fault<br>  Wasn't the dogs fault<br>  Reconsider killing the dog, just put it up for adoption<br>  <br>  AND GET YOUR KID SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION<br>  dog bites can be serious and get infected very easily!|`|RgYuXggfaa	Take her in.  You are the mama, you know what is best for her.  Also it may limit the scarring on her lip if she gets the stitches.|`|4H9e8tq7aa	Yes, I would take her to the doctors ASAP! Just to be safe, you don't want her to get any dangerous infections!!! good luck, and I hope she is okay! :]<br>  <br>  -Aero|`|61wB21Kmaa	i would take her to the doctor but everything is probably fine. Mouth wounds are the fastest thing to heal in your entire body. Good Luck|`|nBehRANyaa	Yes, she should be seen by a doctor.  Young children should NEVER be left alone with ANY dog, even for a moment.|`|XL0cIxj1aa	just take her to the doc to checked out. better safe than sorry with our kids.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	yes take your daughter to the dr.  if there are punctures they usually suture dog bites on the face to prevent scaring.  <br>  <br>  did your daughter provoke the bite? if this is the case getting rid of the dog is not the answer.  children get bit by dogs all the time b/c they dont respect them.  if the dog was sleeping and she went to it the dog may not have seen your daughter as your daughter but more of a threat.<br>  <br>  the dog should be rabies vaccinated.  in a lot of cases if the dog is not vaccinated it will either have to be quarantined for an extended period of time or the human will have to go under a series of rabies vaccines.  it is dr descretion.|`|4c047641be778d779abfa8ec0d667d8caa	Yes, you must take your daughter to the doctors.  She will need antibiotic and possibly a Tetanus vaccination.<br>  <br>  *EDIT*  Also, make sure the puppy has been dewormed A LOT.  Round worm eggs in the mouth of a dog and then into your daughters may mean she is infected.  Roundworms can cause blindness in children.  SHE NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTORS!<br>  <br>  There will have to be a bite report taken as it is the law.<br>  <br>  I would say it is NOT the dogs fault, but yours.  It is a 7 month old puppy, and a puppy(ANY puppy) and a 3 year old should NEVER be left unattended even for ONE SECOND!  And yes if you have a wild puppy living in the house and care about your daughter as I am sure you do, then you will HAVE to take her to the bathroom.   A puppy is rambucious, has very sharp teeth, and doesn't understand being gentle always.  This is where you and you sister come in...but to blame the dog is ignorance.  Or get angry when people give you the advice you asked for is also ignorant.<br>  <br>  If that dog wanted to really hurt your daughter she wouldn't have a face left!  Of course if your family refuses to train the dog, then it is better off elsewhere as they don't care about him if they let him act wild and play rough.  This is what gives pits a bad name.  Irresponsible owners!  This dog doesn't need a home withOUT kids but rather this dog needs a responsible owner.  Your sister needs to step up for the dog, you, and her niece!<br>  <br>  To the owner with the Huskies...it isn't a matter of not always trusting, but the What If...I trust and love my dogs but I'm still not going to leave my baby alone with them.  Thats just plain craZy!!!!|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	I agree that you should always err on the side of caution.  Do take her to the doctor for what might be a deep puncture wound.  Having said that, in regards to the puppy, I hope that you will not hold it against or encourage your daughter to hold it against the animal that this has happened.  Yes I understand that this is a pit bull you are talking about but it is also a puppy.  Puppies much like young children are full of energy and have a deep desire to play.  It is very possible that while you were in the bathroom your daughter and the puppy were playing together and the puppy simply got over excited with the play.  Being the owner of multiple Pits in my life, a child as young as your daughter could easily have zigged when zagging would have kept her out of harms way.  Not blaming the child for the injury here.  It seems to me it was an accident pure and simple.  A 3 year old child should not be left unattended with ANY bread of puppy for just this reason.  Any medium to large breed dog at 7 months old would easily overpower a 3 year old child.  The dog obviously need some training but I don't feel that forcing the owner to get rid of the dog is reasonable so long as they are willing to put in the time to properly train the animal.  Puppies will be puppies and children will be children.<br>  <br>  Please do not misunderstand my comments.  I am in no way trying to accuse you of being a "bad mother".  Again, this was an accident.  The puppy in obvious need of training.  I know from first hand experience that especially pit puppies are just bundles of energy with lightening quick reflexes.  It is well more than possible that your daughter did nothing to cause her injury but that is an unknown as no one say what lead up to it so there is no need to beat you with it.  All I am saying is YES take your beautiful baby girl to the doctor be certain but please keep an open mind toward the animal.|`|7A30yQf4aa	When I was a child around 9 years old I was bit by our family dog. I also did not need any stitches, but my mother took me to the Dr. The Dr. then gave me a Tetanus shot. In my opinion you should take her to the Dr. She may need a shot as I did.|`|e0uosNRsaa	Any bite to the face needs a doctor's attention.  Go to the ER.  And they will take care of having the dog reported and removed from the house.|`|XTISzn2Naa	It is your daughter, you are not a doctor, play it safe and have a doctor check her out.|`|PM23RDycaa	Is there some reason your THREE year old daughter was left ALONE with a puppy? Doesn't matter what breed it is your daughter should not have been left alone with ANY animal. First off the dog does not need to be gotten rid of but EVERYONE and this includes you need to not leave your daughter alone with the puppy. This is just common sense as kids can provoke animals to bite - you weren't there so you can't say she didn't do anything.<br>  <br>  Check her lip thoroughly to make sure there are no punctures completely though the flesh. Have her looked at if any bites went through.<br>  <br>  This is why you don't leave animals and kids alone. Puppies play rough that is how they are and to him your daughter is just another puppy.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	I think you should apply the cream and take her to the doctors. But please, please, don't be against pit bulls... please please please. Pit bulls aren't bad dogs, people treat them badly, and say it's their fault. In this case, it is most likely because your daughter was annoying the dog. It is the peoples fault for leaving a 3 year old with a young puppy. <br>  <br>                                    SPAY AND NEUTER
AA11887983	Definitely seek out a puppy socialization class.  Pretty much, those are where a bunch of pups get together and play.  It teaches them how to deal with other dogs at an age when they are really willing to learn.  Then continue into training classes.  If I were you, I would continue on until the dog is very well trained, maybe even getting a canine good citizen certification.  That way, if anyone questions your bully, you can say that she is not a bad dog!  Besides, dogs really like training class.  It gives them a better bond with you.  <br>  <br>  Also, get your dog social with as many people as you can.  Try to let people know what to do if she jumps, or barks, and just keep trying.  The more people she is exposed to now, the more social and confident she will become.|`|GaL66jbQaa	download a free copy of Before you get your puppy by Ian Dunbar  <br>  <a href="http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html</a>|`|RgYuXggfaa	First she needs to learn her name.  I taught my dog to sit until he calmed down.  He is goig to be very big and I wanted to make sure he didnt take any one down.  What I did was sit with him or hold him until he calmed down.  I also asked all visitors to ignore him until he was calm.  If he didnt calm down we walked away.  At six months he sits and wiggles until he gets the attention from human or animal.  Pits are so smart.  Yours will get it in no time|`|0fKQhIX0aa	puppies are puppies no matter what breed. talk to your local vet or trainer to see if they offer strictly puppy play groups.  let her tucker herself out just playing.  and if the other dogs dont mind let them have fun.  they will let her know when they have had enough just like her mother and siblings did.  try working on self control techniques with her.  also use feeding time as training time.  use her kibble as treats and try training on a lenolium or tile floor so she slides easily (for down and sit, etc) .  they are never too young or old to train.  <br>  <br>  check out clickertraining.com  for more advice.

They think I'm nuts because my dog lives in the house with us at night. And my dog can't stand being in the house if the inside temperature is over 65F. My neighbour has three purebred Komondors that have never seen the inside of a heated building. They pasture with the sheep. And the temperature here three weeks ago was -45F.

uY7uRpXSaa	Hi Karen! This is Sarah! I used to have fish and I think you need to buy goldfish food. And if it is just swimming around the bowl along the sides then it's bored.

Please vote for me. :)<br>  <br>  -Sarah|`|bDPVRtCNaa	A single fancy goldfish requires 20 gallons, cycled, and double the filtration.<br>  <br>  Fish food from two years ago is no good, and neither are the Betta bites. The fish will be fine for a few days without food. As soon as you can, go out and buy sinking goldfish pellets.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Well the food that you have has been formulated for Bettas. I used to think it was all the same but if you compare your food to the goldfish labels in the store you'll notice a difference.

Physical size will be similar for a pyr and a lab.      Homer has shorter lab fur length and texture in pyr coloring.  Pyrs have longer fur in a dual coat. The coloring of the body and ears is pyrish, and possibly somewhat lab color as well.  I'd have to see the lab parent.    Homer doesn't appear to curl his tail up over his back the way a pyr does.  Pyrs sometimes stand with the tail down the way Homer's is, but more often, it's curled up over their rear.        Homer's nose is pink.  I don't know if this is a lab trait, but pyrs noses are usually black.      His jowls look a bit smaller than I'd expect to see in a pyr.     The head shape is slightly different than what I'd expect for a pyr, but I can't explain exactly why.  If you look at pyr photos and lab photos, you will notice differences in the facial features.    You can also visit the akc website and read the breed standard and I believe they always describe the shape of the head of each breed.     He's a lovely boy and a good mix.  You should have a loyal, playful friend in Homer.  I hope you join us in group so we can answer the questions you will come up with and you'll enjoy hearing about other pyrs and possibly some other pyr/lab crosses.  -!-|`|TmEoTapDaa	they look nothing alike|`|IdSqunZuaa	The Great Pyrenees is taller than the lab which make it twice as heavy.

XUrgcOMDaa	Yeah, ghost shrimp simply have a very short life expectancy.  Even if your fish do/did not eat them... they probably won't last long anyway.  That's why they only cost pennies.      Most people buy them as live food, just like crickets, although they are quite a bit cooler than crickets to look at.    You could certainly buy more, as they are so cheap.  You don't even really need to pull them out if they die... the other shrimp will eat the dead ones, and most of the time you will never witness this.    I'm not sure about the spots/stripes... but I recommend trying a little Melafix in your tank.  It is a very mild, herbal medicine that will soothe your fish and could get rid of any non-serious ailments in your tank.  Ask someone at your pet  store and they will tell you the same thing.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	listen fish eat them especially big fish|`|AA12205365	The surviving ghost shrimp is fine.  The back spots are eggs, and the stripes are common on mature ghost shrimp.  Just realize that    a)They hide when they molt    b)They are soft and yummy when they molt.    c)Your fish are fine over the weekend without food, but fish that wouldn't eat them before might.    d)They rarely manage to have babies grow to visible size.      All and all I'm rather pro ghost shrimp.  They are cheap.  Cool looking. They are good for other fish to eat.|`|Gta9wO3taa	Ghost srimp are live food for fish. Even if you saw your fish be ok with them you cant watch them all the time and they will eat some. Just keep on buying more and try and get the largest ones you can.
3sB49YNnaa	Do not use mix!  You want to buy pelleted feed specifically for guinea pigs which contains stabilized vitamin C.  If your pig is young, small or long haired you should get 18% protein pellets.  If your pig is over a year old and is either overweight or has bladder sand, get the 14% protein pellets.<br>  <br>  Your pigs should also have grass hay and plenty of fresh water along with the pellets as their base diet supplemented with moderate amounts of fresh greens|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Pellets should form only a small part of a guinea pig's diet (about 1/2 cup for the day). The main part should be a constant supply of Timothy hay. You should also give at least one orange slice per day along with a cup of fresh greens (romaine lettuce, parsley, cilantro, mustard greens, collard greens, turnip greens, etc...just make sure you research poisonous/nonpoisonous veggies). Guinea pigs should also get vitamin drops in their water to ensure the proper amount of Vitamin C in their diet. The drops I recommend are Oasis, made specifically for guinea pigs.|`|uvU5DnHcaa	Most pellets made for guinea pigs have added Vit C. I make my own mix up so I know what they are getting as not all packet mixes suit all pigs. Young, Adults, Pregnant sows, or Show stock all need different things in their diet.<br>  I feed mine <br>  Oaten Hay once a day,<br>  Celery and broccoli stumps every day,<br>  Grain mix every day that I make up myself<br>  which consists of <br>  Oaten Chaff <br>  Lucerne Chaff<br>  Horse and Pony Pellets ( bran & Pollard )<br>  Lucerne Pellets<br>  Stable Mate Grain Mix<br>  Oats<br>  Lupins<br>  Large Parrot Seed<br>  Flaky bran.<br>  <br>  They also get carrots, capsicum, apple, cucumber, dry bread, sweet melon and fresh grass when available. Any small amounts of veg or fruit can be given so long as the left overs are removed from the cage and not left in there for more than 8 hours|`|GrYhFNMdaa	Just pellets is best for your pig. The mixes with different colors and shapes are actually less in nutrients. They are cheaper and just look good so you buy it. I know rabbits are different but i feed mine pellets only and its $10 a bag instead of $5 for the mix stuff. Look at the percentage on both bags to see the difference.<br>  <br>  I could have went on about everything they should eat but you were not asking that. You were asking about pellets and mixes so thats how i answered.|`|XurYYreBaa	Many packaged guinea pig foods have added vitamins but they're not always stable.  Check the label for preservatives, artificial colors or other chemicals before buying anything.  Pellets are good b/c your little guys won't be able to pick out their fave bits & leave the rest.  Also, mixes often have ingredients that piggies are better off without.<br>  Some guinesa pigs won't drink water if you add vitamin drops to it & this isn't the best way to give vitamins anyway.  Our vet advised us to give our pig a natural source of vit. C *every* day-- a piece of orange, bell pepper etc.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	NEVER EVER FEED YOUR PET SEED/NUT MIX DIETS!!! PELLETS ONLY! Trust me.

Zh1Y6lFIaa	Parakeets are great pet parrots and easier to care for than the larger types. They cost only around $20 (USD) and have the ability to talk, perform tricks and be tame enough to sit on your finger, shoulder or cuddle into your hair.

And the good thing is if you only have an hour to spend with him, he should be fine. As long as he has  a good cage and enough toys. Hope that helps.|`|QxIhMHwAaa	I've had birds since I was 8 years old. I'd definitely begin by owning a so-called "starter" bird...finches, parakeets, or cockatiels. I'd personally suggest a parakeet, it is what I started with. Finches are just too jumpity for me, and cockatiels have the possibility of turning very mean as they age and if people don't know how to properly care for and play with a bird. Parakeets seem the happy medium.|`|YXnRq4XXaa	go for a parakeet! i'm 14 and i just got one the other day and its really sweet.     don't expect it to sit on your finger just yet though it takes time for it to get used to you, your family, and your house :)|`|M9KUiTOAaa	I would suggest a parakeet, they are very inexpensive and with an hour a day training you can do a lot with it. They are pretty easy to train. Try to get one that was hand-raised. They have good little personalities and are not too loud. They are pretty forgiving of your schedule too. Good luck with whatever you get!|`|dcsAFr5uaa	if you can get your hand on a toucan they are amazing pets. just watch incase they bite.|`|OugNf0x6aa	Finches.

RN1wGlWWaa	Now YOU are a responsible person!  I think you are going beyond what an normal person would do and that is a very responsible thing.  Too bad others will not do the right thing.    Only thing I see is the price for mixed breeds - that's a bit high if you are not including shots (1st shots) and worming in the price.  I would suggest you cover 1st shots and a worming and then refund the left over money when the kitten is spayed/neutered.  At least get part of your money back.|`|GSkA8wh9aa	I think the way you are handling the situation is wonderful. You may want to call a rescue group in your area to assist you in finding the purrfect homes for the babies.   Please do not separate the kittens from the Mom for the minimum of 8 weeks. they need her for at least that long!  All the best!|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	I wouldn't blame yourself too much, you can't keep an eye on your cat 24/7 and neither can your neighbours! It's as much their responsibility as it is yours.   But it's good that you're taking responsibility for it and helping to find new homes for the new kittens. I'm sure people won't really care how they get their kitten, they'll just want their kitten :)|`|4D7nhSHnaa	Where you live is there a  nonprofit spay/neuter clinic?  I my area the clinic charges $50.00 for males/ $55.00 for males  and if you have more they will work it out for you for even less money.  I took my baby, which I found at  3 weeks old.  i have since gone back and taken a few of the strays and also had them "fixed".  Good Luck to you!  Oh, this clinic also includes the kittens shots with the price of the entire proceedure.|`|DtkLsetkaa	I think its a great idea, but first i would check with your local shelter and see what their adoption fees are, then maybe ask for a deposit of half that amount.  Might make it more enticing, but shelters also usually spay/neuter the cats themselves.  I would say its worth a shot tho.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Decent people will spay/neuter the kitten and get their money back after proof from a vet. However, the only way to be sure is to have the kittens spayed/neutered before they leave your home. Than just charge the price of the spay/neuter and shots, which they will have to have prior to sugery, for the kittens.|`|PyOCZiwjaa	This is an awesome idea, I think.  But you have to consider, most people probably don't want to and/or can't afford to just give you L90. You gotta ask for a lower price or you won't be able to give them away.  But I do think it's a VERY good idea.|`|435c271Kaa	Depending on your area and available resources, you could look into places that will s/n for a discount price. Being kittens, the operation is cheaper. That way, you could find homes for the kittens, and know for a fact that they have already been spayed or neutered.

Bake for 12-15 minutes until slightly brown at the edges. Let cool. Store in fridge for up to one week. Give to your pooch and let them enjoy!    (for the making a shape to the cookie part--I cut them out with a dog bone cookie cutter.)    When I found these--They were called Pug Pops.

Evaporated milk? reconstituted 1/2 canned milk with 1/2 water is not bad for a cat once in awhile.  Pet milk meaning that made for pets (that kitten milk) is fine for a kitten from 0 - 4 weeks old.  But milk doesn't have all the nutrients a cat over the age of 4 weeks needs.  They need protein, some fat, some vegetation.  If kitty is an indoor/outdoor cat, it may be getting what it needs outside and only getting treat fluids indoors (the milk).  But if kitty is and indoor cat and refusing to eat, something is wrong.

AA10029366	It could be that Jack is feeling insecure, and trying to re-establish his place in your home. Humping things (especially legs, other dogs, etc.) is more about dominance than sex. The only time it's about sex is when there is a b*tch in season in the area.    I suppose it's possible that these people could have done something like this -- I'm surprised that the rescue turned over his AKC papers. Most rescues destroy them simply to avoid any issues like the one you're concerned about (of course, most rescues spay/neuter animals *before* placing them, as well). However, assuming that they did breed him and copy his reg. number, they would still have to have the address and signature of his owner (as listed on the registration papers) on the litter registration.    I suppose they could simply forge it, if they were dishonest enough to use him in the first place.    I am never one to underestimate the sliminess of human beings, but I do think maybe you're over-thinking this, and Jack is just insecure. I'm sure he'll get over it.    I've seen people come up with all sorts of "bad behavior" excuses in order to return an otherwise angelic dog, just to avoid admitting that they can't deal with the responsibility. So they probably were losers. But that doesn't necessarily mean they bred him.|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	No, it's not necessarily the sign of having been used for breeding.  I would guess it's because it's about now (nine months) that the little guys has discovered he *is* a guy and doesn't quite know what to do about it.  Most nine month old dogs, even toy dogs, haven't quite figured out the logistics of the birds and the bees yet, so I really doubt the little guy is going to be a father.     Yorkies are somewhat notorious for humping and dominance marking.  You need to discourage this behavior and HAVE THE DOG NEUTERED.  Frankly I am astounded that the rescue adopted the dog out without having that done first.  It really sounds like kind of a weird and not too great rescue organization -- did the new people even see the dog (since you had him all that time) or did they just take him sight unseen?    BTW, Alexandra, don't be ridiculous!  Using the dog at stud does *not* take away the urge!  It only makes it worse!  And just what we need, more idiot people breeding dogs!|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Humping is a sign of dominance.  He could be trying to "dominate" things after his ordeal.  It is stressful when they are uprooted and things don't work out.  More for some dogs than others.  Just correct him for humping.  My female pom started to "hump" things after she got spayed. we just kept removing the "objects of her affection" and she finally stopped.    As for them breeding him, it is possible but you have no proof and it is just conjecture on your part.    As for the AKC papers, they cannot register any litter from him with AKC without the signature of the registered owner that is listed on the papers.  Since they returned the papers without transferring him into their name. they would have had to forge the signatures.  Or they may not even try to register to pups.    Most rescues neuter all dogs before placement and just include the cost in the adoption price.  Your rescue may consider doing the same thing.|`|f39270a966433c441b97202467862551aa	I have Yorkies, and Jacks recent behavior is that of a Dog that has been with a female in heat.. His biting behavior is also typical of a Yorkie who is with a new female who is in heat.   All you need to register a litter of puppies is the number of the mother and father and you can even do it online at the AKC registry..  Sounds like your Jack has just became a Daddy,   PS, He will stop the humping in a couple weeks.|`|loEiJ241aa	I think he wasnt bred because after they are bred they dont act like that since the urge to release the semen is gone. I just think that his hormones are over the edge. A good idea might be to get a female for him. i had a expeirence that i had a female and a male and the male was always humping her then she got pregnant and he hasnt humped anyone or anything since.
q4JaBnQuaa	i think that you should NOT put them in your luggage first off lol. and i think that you can maybe find like a big plastic tube like the ones they sell at target and place them in there and make sur the water cant come out. wrap them in like seran wrap and send then with the fragile stuff i think that they should be fine.|`|f57a735201cbe1357a7d68c97fe1003daa	I once did a move from San Francisco to Northern Cali.  I put my fish in a small tank and strapped it to the passenger seat.  Half way home it got too hot and they didn't have their air (I didn't know you could buy oxygen tablets!) so I took some of the tubing and blew bubbles for about 3 hours!  Not an answer to your questions, as my fish were not exotic like yours, but I think your common sense is correct.  Have you talked to your pet store?  I am sure a good, reputable one would give you great advice.|`|7708161c5408392d4a303b97b60f207faa	Look up Fishmovers.com. They are pro fish movers and could offer ideas if not move your fish for you. An airline is not going to allow that kind of live animal on a regular passenger flight and the stress of flying in the extreme cold would certainly kill the poor fish. Good Luck
qEn157Ppaa	If he has had it ever since he was born, then why didn't you ask the  breeder or shelter what happened? You should also have taken the puppy to the vets for it's shots by now. Ask the vet, they can offer you a theory or two. <br>  If it was born with a skin condition you would want to get it treated as soon as possible, and it could be a recurring condition depending on the breed. Otherwise, if it is simply something he was born with and will have it all his life, that just makes him unique ! <br>  Can you edit your post and add what type of breed he is. and what did you name him?

NlvghuIkaa	It is basically impossible to tell anything from a picture at such an angle. What we now need to see is this handsome dog's body.. He should appear sturdy, heavy boned and athletic from across the ring. The coat needs to be glossy while nails, trimmed back to a short length. Just as the AKC standard, it isn't all about how the dog looks. <br>  <br>  Your Pitbull must show interest in things around him, aggression is a good sign though any unruliness will be disqualified. Every solid colour and patch markings are withing the standard of the Pitbull apart from blue merle and albino.<br>  <br>  When in the show ring, he must be confident and alert.

9kceDOTraa	Some good points here in the other posts.  I'd have to agree, part of what is likely going on, is the presence of ammonia in your tank.  Just by chance, what sized tank is this?  If this is the only fish, and not sure what you mean by baby, like what size?  If you have a proper sized tank for an Oscar, like a 55 gallon or higher, ammonia is likely still only in very small minor amounts after a couple days.  It's still an issue because it takes about 6-8 weeks to mature as someone mentioned.  Here's a quick visual overview about what happens.  There's reading to go behind it, but if you take things in visually, this should help.    http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...    There are numerous internet sources out there to read over.  It certainly isn't going to hurt to take the time to read them.  This may not be a direct answer to what you are asking, but you do need to know this stuff.    I agree, for the time being, cut down on the food.  Fish do not use food in the same way people do.  They do not need nor use it for an internal heat source from burning up calories.  Many fish in their natural habitat, go several weeks without food.  You'd be extremely hard pressed to find fish that die from starvation.  In short, cutting the food down not only cuts down the amount of waste your fish is putting back into the tank, and cuts down the ammonia produced from the uneaten, but it's also not going to harm your fish in any way either.    Acclimation as mentioned is likely why they don't move around too much.  Honestly, this also sounds like a tank too small as well.  In a proper sized tank for an adult Oscar, your baby Oscar should have plenty of tank to go  exploring.  Give it a few more days and see how it goes.    In the mean time, you'll want to get a product called Prime.  Prime will help you with your water changes, as it de-chlorinates at a high volume, 1 cap treats 50 gallons, but will ionize the ammonia and eventually nitrites that will start forming, to at least keep it less harmful to the fish, while keeping it able to be used as fuel for your growing bacteria.  I have not found a better product out here that offers all these benefits to help your fish.  If they don't sell it locally for you, this is where I get mine from.  I totally love this product, and I'm not big into chemical products for fish keeping personally.    http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...    A bottle of this, should last you a very very long time.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	You have to test the water to be sure if its clean. All water looks clean,its the Ammonia,Nitrite and Nitrates that kill. You Need to buy a master freshwater test kit made by API and test all these levels. You also need the kit to test your PH and see what its level is.     Also another thing, if you just ran the filter for two weeks in that tank its not cycled. You need a source of Ammonia in the tank to start the cycle. Now that you have your fish in the tank will start its cycle, you should see the water start to get cloudy, that will be the bacteria establishing themselves. Being that its a new tank and its gonna cycle you should only feed your fish a FEW flakes or pellets every Other day, and test the water every day. It should take about 3 weeks for it to cycle and during that time if you test and any of the Ammonia,Nitrite or Nitrate readings go high a 50 % water change is needed ASAP to save your fish.  Oscars are VERY hardy but also produce tons of waste, make sure to keep up with your weekly 30 % water changes and gravel vacuums.    As far as his behavoir goes.... its normal for him to hide at fisrt untill he gets used to the tank and his new envoirment. Once he gets used to his surroundings and you he will come to the front every time you walk into the room. Esspecailly once he realizes your the source of food lol      Goggle : Fish Tank Cycling and Fish Tank Nitrogen Cycle and learn about what I speak. Also read this link for Oscar care. Good Luck    http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Oscar.h...    http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Cichlid,%20O...|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	The Oscar is just shy because he's in a new tank. Fish are wary when they are first introduced to a strange environment.  As to the cricket, if he hasn't been fed them before he might not recognize it as food at first.    Assuming the Oscar was healthy when you got him, he should be out patrolling the tank in a few more days, if not before.|`|igpMQn0kaa	Cycling (most of the time) takes 4-6 weeks.    Fishless Cycling:  http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_fish...    Which means that he might be suffering from ammonia poisoning. What are your readings for Ammonia, NitrIte, and NitrAte?    If everything's good, he's just being moody and ought to perk up in a week or so.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with your little Oscar. He's just the new kid on the block and needs time to adapt to his new surroundings. Give him a week or two and he'll be all over the place.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	You are doing absolutely nothing wrong, Oscars are babies and yours has spat its dummy out :o) They hate change.    Two days is enough time to settle in. My first success in feeding was with garden worms; try dangling small ones, just watch your fingers, because it will take the first one fast.    Once it gets settled it will be splashing for food, they're not called water dogs for nothing.|`|hCyt28Meaa	He is "pouting", a common occurence with oscars. They will sit or even lay down on their side motionless when they are upset or they are in a new environment. They will do this when you do water changes sometimes, or move the plants and ornaments around. Just leave the lights off for a little while and keep the water around 76-80 degrees, and he should be fine. Best of luck, and happy fish-keeping =]|`|DqOkUgVsaa	dont worry my oscar was just like that when i got him ...i was going nuts because i tought he was dyng until i found out his shy 3 days later and he was everywhere
uke9Ysrvaa	well yes your molly will be fine,you could keep them in there for about 2 weeks but what you do is a filter, you could get one of those cheap internal filters which are powered by a air pump and its like 5 dollars or less which provide 3 stage filteration.|`|25CAIGfeaa	YOU NEED A FILTER AND A HEATER.

NAGiNKFWaa	Well ironically you need to answer this.  Every puppy is different.  I have some puppies that pee and poop every time they go out, some pee every time, but only poop maybe twice a day.  Andy would pee, then poop 10 minutes later, and poop again 2 minutes later.  One would hold his poop all day and wait for my husband to come home and then poop for him.  You need to watch your puppies patterns and see what your puppy does.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places.<br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.    <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	There is absolutely no possible way for us to accurately guess the cycle of your puppy's bladder and bowels. Every dog is an individual, and they all operate on different schedules. You can probably bet that he'll have to pee within thirty minutes of eating, soon after exercising, and after drinking water, plus other times. He'll defecate whenever he needs to defecate. I think a safe guess would be within an hour after meals, and probably first thing in the morning. If he doesn't urinate *and* defecate before bedtime, wait until he does to put him to bed, or you'll most likely be woken up in the middle of the night because he'll have to go. Oh, and on that note, expect to take him out in the middle of the night or in the wee hours of the morning anyway. Most young puppies can't go longer than a six-hour night.<br>  <br>  At eight weeks, to effectively prevent any accidents, you will need to take him out every two hours or so. Some puppies at that age even require being taken out every hour to prevent an accident. Just play it by ear, watch him carefully for any signs that he needs to relieve himself, and you'll grow accustomed to his schedule very quickly.

She could have kennel cough but thats only if you boarded her or if she was around other dogs. 11 years is pretty old expecially if she is a larger dog. Try calling the vet and see what they say. they might have you come in and that will cost you something, but if its your dog then I think its worth it.
vGP1ZXUuaa	There is *nothing* wrong with "showing teeth" when a dog doesn't want to interact with another dog.  This is the way that dogs tell other dogs that they aren't interested and to bug off.  The GSD should respect that and back off.  If she doesn't, then the next step the Rottie will try is a growl.  This means, "Leave me alone, dammit, I'm not in the mood right now."  If the GSD persists, the Rottie has only one recourse, and that's to snap.  Usually the first thing is an "air snap" that doesn't make contact.  The next step is an actual bite or fight.  Since the GSD is so much larger, the Rottie probably feels threatened when the larger dog tries to play with her.  It should be *her choice* (the Rottie) whether she plays or not.  BTW, it really does sound like the GSD is inviting play, since the tail is elevated and is putting her paw over the Rott's head.  But the Rottie needs to be able to tell the other dog that she is not comfortable with this and to please go away.    They all live together and need to learn to get along.  It's not a lot of fun to have to separate dogs so that they don't fight.  I'd stay out of it unless the situation escalates to actual fighting.  Then you have two choices -- keep them separated or rehome one of them.|`|tZV7DAcVaa	We currently have 8 dogs in our pack.  We've rescued all but one and over the years have had to deal with a lot of puppy introduction.  One thing that we have always done is anything we want our dogs to be gentle with we call it a "baby".  Whether it's another dog, a cat, a horse or an actual baby.  This is the name we give so the dog knows.."oh I need to be real gentle."  We introduce the dog to the new "baby" by being calm.  If you are nervous your Pitt is picking up on it.      You definitely need to get your Pitt trained and like the others have said show that you are the Alpha.  When a dog behaves undesirably you have to correct it immediately.  You don't have to be mean just firm.  Find a trainer that you are comfortable with and that is very reputable.  Ask for references etc.    The puppies are going to also learn behaviors from the Pitt so you want your Pitt to be the best she can be.    As for the puppies...they are going to be puppies and play and be rough.  It's also very possible you purchased 2 very different personalities withing the breed, meaning maybe the GSD is more of a dominant personality and the Rottie is more submissive.      You're going to have your hands full that is for sure.  Just hang in there, do as much research as you can and be the a good Dog Parent!    I have to strongly DISAGREE with Anands idea of putting the GSD in the kennel and letting the Pitt bark etc at her.  A kennel is always supposed to be a SAFE place for the animal, not one of stress and fear.  By doing that you will only add to the anxiety of the dog.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	At 7 weeks it is play and dominance.  It's how dogs establish the order when they are young and they sound like they are going to kill each other, but really it's just play.  Keep the older dog away unless they are being supervised directly.  Introduce the older dog slowly and on a leash so you can instantly correct any bad behavior before it gets out of hand.|`|6Ehb9r1kaa	I know these tutorials and crap seem pointless at times but I actually found one that helped me through my 10+ yrs of breeding.

Contact your local kennel club for a reputable trainer in your area.    Of course you know that 7 weeks is too young to own any dog|`|DHcEbZKVaa	Your answer is in your question when you state your pitboxer has gotten into fights with other dogs. Some agressive dogs do not tolerate other dogs and must be the only dog of the house. If you sense this is true and the situation does not improve after you have had the dogs together for a month you have to decide which dog or dogs have to go. It does not sound like a good situation.|`|OxFsslN8aa	You can have one dog or thirty dogs living with you peacably if you are the pack leader.  It becomes a problem when you aren't leading and the dogs need to step up to the plate.  Which dog will lead?  The one who either wins the fight or intimidates the other into submitting.  That is the nature of canines.      When you got the other two dogs you should have known that there could be some dominance issues.  You have very aggressive type dogs & they will establish leadership if you do not.  I suggest you learn how to be dominant.  Find a trainer, buy some DVD, read some books; something that will give you a clue as to how to control these dogs.      You can start by standing up tall, being calm & assertive & never backing down from even the smallest challenge.  You leave the door before any of them, you eat before they do, you feed them when they are calm & submissive, you lead on a walk (they should never be in front of you).  If you say sit - they should all sit or you make them sit.  If you say come, they all come or you go get the one that didn't come & make it come to you.  Good luck.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	It is purely dominance that your dog is trying to display.    In my opinion of handling, showing, training, and rehabilitating hundreds of dogs, you got too many dogs at the same time. How do you expect to train and bond with a 7 week old puppy, if you have two at the same time of different breeds (not that the breed part matters)?     You should have waited a few months before getting another dog. If you already knew your pit mix wasn't overly good with other dogs, bringing in TWO dogs at the SAME time is a bit much. That is like being a spoiled only child who gets 150% of the attention, toys, food, etc. for 7 years of their life and then suddenly being asked to share not just HALF of it, but 2/3's! That is a big thing to ask of your pit mix.    As for your german, she is displaying a lot of dominance for her age. She needs to be corrected (not harshly) NOW.     Female dogs are actually more dominant when living together then if you had three males. Females tend to be moodier, want to establish a "pecking" order, and can be unpredictable. Males tend to be more even if socialized early.    You need to enroll in some training classes. Things will work out, but you did just jump into the deep end not knowing how to swim.|`|iXijnCxOaa	You have two 7 week old pups.  Do not attempt to read anything into THEIR behavior, they are puppies and are doing what pups do.  However, apparently neither of them was purchased from a responsible breeder since it is the height of irresponsibility to sell pups prior to 8 weeks of age... since both breeders of these pups were irresponsible in that - you have to worry they were also irresponsible in regards to temperament and health issues (orthopedics).  At the very least - neither of these pups was given the foundation they needed in dog socialization or bite inhibition by remaining with their littermates until a proper age.    Since your pit/boxer is dog aggressive you need to get a behavioral training consultant NOW.. before she does damage to the pups.  This will get worse as these pups age.     If you're not going to get assistance from a trainer you need to resolve yourself to the fact that:  1) You're going to end up with dog fights and possibly a dead pup from the fight.  2) You're going to have to keep the dogs separate to keep dogs from being injured.  3) You're going to have to place either the pups or the aggressive adult into another home to keep them all safe.    Steps you need to take:  1) Behavioral training consultant to work with your aggressive adult dog.  2) Puppy kindergarten for both pups.  3) READ - How to Raise a Puppy You Can Live With by Ruthorford and Neill.. and Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson|`|GmWo39XMaa	hey,,    my friend had the same problem,  Your pitbull/boxer will get used to it in time it will just take time to aajustto heving new dogs in the same house as it has ben very used to having all the attention from you, so just pay it a lot of attention and just let it know that you wont neglect it.  Hope this helps|`|WajPIdN6aa	Too many dogs at a time can be troublesome. Your pittbull seem to be abit possessive. your german and rottie will get along in the long run. however, the pitbull is of major concern. my suggestion is that put ur german in a cage and leave it near the pitbull and move away. observe it from far. make sure your cage is strong enough to keep your german safe. it should get bored after a few hours of barking. however if you feel like your german might get hurt or something, call your pitbull back. keep her favourite food ready. Do not try to pull of the german shepherd as she may get aggressive and turn on you.    if it does not work, try again after the german gets a little older. 4 months should be good. 7 weeks is still too young. if this do not work, you should choose among one of them.     by the way, buying a puppy at 7 weeks old is a bad thing. puppies need to feed from thier mother for at least 8 weeks. your pups may be vulnerable to sickness and will need a frequent visit to the vet.    for more info, check out http://anand00.blogspot.com|`|3p6wp7DYaa	What you need is expert advice, which you cannot get over the Internet. Nobody here can diagnose the problem and give you a solution without even meeting you and your dogs. Any behavior expert will tell you that they cannot help a dog  they haven't met. Find a professional behaviorist and start to deal with the issues properly.    I think you made a mistake getting two young puppies - which by the way are too young to be separated from their mothers - when you already have an adult dog. One puppy at a time, maybe, but two is just too much to handle. Young puppies who have been separated from their litter mates too young have really poor social skills. They don't know how to read other dog's signals and body language. They don't know when to back off because the other dog has had enough. This is a difficult situation that will only get worse as the puppies get older.    Either you commit to resolving this issue by spending the money to get a behaviorist to work with your dogs, or give up one of the puppies at least. Find her a good home where people can properly socialize her and where she can grow up safely. It is not fair to the dogs or to your family to live in this environment.|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	I've been integrating new dogs and pups into a foster home situation for a good 15 yrs now. Yes. You rushed into what could be a messy situation especially if you have no  experience. I sure hope you realize you have 3 dogs with totally different traits and the pups are going to be big dogs.    First, at 7 wks age for pups they really do not know about dominance,real fighting, etc. They are pups and pups can play rough or sound like they are getting serious when only typical puppy behavior. A mom and her litter can really play rough and that is part of her training them. Rotties are normally a easy going dog unless really bad breeding. For now you need to concentrate on allowing the pups to interact and only sound a warning or seperate if actually hearing screams of pain. Dogs can appear to be "fighting" when it is only play. You need to research both breeds thoroughly. And do some research on puppy behavior. If one is being over bearing then use a warning sound. even a firm NO. Actually the less you interfer for now the better. You need to just observe.    The older female may step in to the role of "mom" as she is your lead dog. This is normal. She may run interference if the pups are getting carried away. You need to show her the respect as she has been there the longest. I would be in trouble without my lead female to make sure the other dogs are behaving. Yes, she  may growl or bark to warn the pups. She might even nip at if they are pestering her. This is all very normal. Yes, you have overwhelmed her by bringing 2 new pups into her world. You say she has already shown some problems with other dogs. You  should have been working on that socialization problem years ago. No, normally pits are not human aggressive if properly trained and socialized to family/friends from early age. This is true of all dogs. Now you have added  2 pups, both have the ability to do serious harm if left untrained.     I highly encourage you to look for a puppy training class for both. this will also allow them to be around other pups and learn good manners. I would get some local training help for having all 3 of these dogs together. You may have to leash or tie out the older dog while the pups are in yard playing. This will be safer until you see how she responds. Now older dogs can be irritated by pups wanting to play when they don't want to. Normal.    There is no one here that can be there to assess this situation so get some help. You are going to have to be very "hands on" and observant while the dogs are getting use to each other.
QQXMcit7aa	ok lets start with the pregnancy, when she starts to get fat and gets moving bumps then she is pregnant. cats are pregnant for about 3 months so you should be able to tell in a month or two. now it will take even longer to "re-tame" her with other animals in the house, also if there are kids. what she needs is a quiet place with lots of loving attention. Right now she doesn't trust people so a busy place with lots of stress is not good. treats will also help, it will convince her you are trust worthy. from what you said about her eating a lot, they were probably not feeding her.

They don't understand that animals run on a different biological clock, or that illness or injury may make euthanasia the best option.<br>  <br>  At all ages, honesty is the best policy, says Marty Tously, a bereavement counselor. "That means using the words death and dying, and explaining the permanence of death. You do it gently but without confusing what dying actually means." <br>  <br>  Tously is a counselor with the Pet Grief Support Service. She says that a child's ability to understand what death means depends on his/her emotional and cognitive development, but outlined the generally understood guideline of how children perceive death and dying:<br>  <br>  Under 2: A child can feel and respond to a pet's death, based on the reaction of those around him or her. A child picks up the stress felt by family members, no matter what the cause.<br>  <br>  2 to 5: The child will miss the animal as a playmate, but not necessarily as a love object. They will see death as a temporary state – something like the way leaves fall off a tree in fall but grow back in the spring. As they perceive the trauma around them, however, they may regress in their behavior (e.g., thumb sucking).<br>  <br>  5 to 9: Children begin to perceive death as permanent, but they may indulge in "magical thinking," believing that death can be defied or bargained with. This is also the period when children recognize a correlation between what they think and what happens. For instance, a child may resent taking care of the pet and wish – however briefly – that the pet would die. If the pet then dies, the child is often consumed with guilt. Parents need to reassure children that they did not cause the pet's death.<br>  <br>  10 and up: Children generally understand that all living things will eventually die, and that death is total. Understanding and accepting are two different things, however. They may go through the normal stages of grief that grownups do: denial, bargaining, anger, guilt, depression and acceptance. (To learn about the stages of grief, see the story Coping with Pet Loss.) Or they may react in other ways:<br>  <br>  <br>  Depending on the age, the child may regress (sucking their thumb or temper tantrums that they had outgrown).<br>  <br>  <br>  An older child may withdraw from friends and family for a while. Schoolwork may suffer and they may seem uninterested in extracurricular activities.<br>  <br>  Death and dying are two of the hardest facts of life to explain to children. Very often, the death of a family pet is a child's first encounter with this immutable law of nature. How we handle this event can have a far-reaching impact on our children's understanding of death and dying. <br>  <br>  Eleven-year-old Maria, for instance, was used to greeting her cat Feifel every day after school. One day, he didn't appear. Maria and her mother found Feifel under a bed, breathing weakly. The veterinarian said Feifel had heart disease. He might be able to save him, but Feifel was 14 and suffered from several other age-related problems.<br>  <br>  His quality of life would only grow worse. The most humane course to take was euthanasia. Later, her family held a memorial service, and Maria wrote poems about him.<br>  <br>  An Informal Guide to a Child's Psyche<br>  <br>  At 11, Maria understood euthanasia and the finality of death.<br>  <br>  Children may fear abandonment. If a pet can die, then they may reason that their parents could die as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Children often become intensely curious about death and what happens to the body. They may ask for details that you may find uncomfortable to explain. These are questions you should answer in a straightforward, gentle and careful manner.|`|iTZHWx5Vaa	Be honest with them.  That is the golden rule with pet loss and children.  Do not lie, as the children might be resentful of you later if they find out on their own.  Sit the two kids down and explain that their grandparents' dog is dead.  Encourage them to make a scrapbook, draw pictures of the dog, and remember the good times with the dog.<br>  I had once answered a question that a young grieving dog owner had posted.  I'll leave the link to it.<br>  <br>  Add:  I am now unhappy.  It appears that on a LOT of my answers, I've been getting thumbs down.
FNdsPNrJaa	Are you positive it was an egg? I've never heard of that behavior either. However theres always a strange one in the bunch "sorta say" Perhaps it was its only egg and felt to strongly towards it? Protection of a offspring can result in all kinds of strange behavior! ....also...strange that it was a male...Maybe his mate died and he doesn't know what to do ? :/
ufcmMqQ5aa	The dog may have been hit by a car and could have other internal problems. It's not always obvious that it's been hit as that would depend on the nature of the impact and there is also the possibility that it was abused. If you can't afford the vet, check with your humane society as there is always the possibility that the owner is looking for it and you're causing more trauma by keeping the dog from the owner who would happily pay to have it treated (check what the humane society does with strays) - if the local shelter is a "kill" shelter, you may wish to keep the dog in your possession while notifying them about it so the owner has a chance to recover it. Not all "strays" are neglected - many times they are simply lost.|`|9G03aQhsaa	Sounds like he has a cut that got infected.   He will need antibiotics.  Also, he could have been hit by a car and the injuries are just not visible (internal bleeding) I'd take him to the vet and tell him he's a stray.  My vet did not charge me when I brought in my two kittens for the first time because I found them as strays.  His reasoning was that most people would not have stopped to help them so since I did them a favor he did not charge me.  Maybe your vet would feel the same.|`|zBwyfE92aa	most vet's will take him for free.. Just call around to your neighborhood vet.|`|TPTnzRI3aa	His back leg may be worn from an extended amount of time spent on pavement. You could try wrapping it with a soft bandage but I'm no vet.|`|lO5KKqYYaa	you could always take him or her to an animal shelter, they'll get it back to health and put it up for adoption. maybe they'll have a happy home soon :)
OPOBIzqMaa	Some animals eat things like rocks, and grass to help their digestive system if they are having problems, or are not feeling well. I would not be too concerned about it at this point. If it appears that the dog is very sensitive in the stomach area, call your vet to get an appointment to have your dog seen. I don't think this is anything to worry about.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Watch her very carefully. Chances are she'll pass them if they were very small and few in number, but she may need surgery to remove them. My dork of a dog ate a stomachful of rocks as a puppy. We were cautious and admitted him to the animal hospital for close observation because we had no idea how many rocks he ate and how large they were.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	She may just have been licking the grease, whatever it was. If she swallowed them there's a good chance she will p**p them out in a day or 2. If she starts looking sick then take her to a vet but it's astonishing what some dogs can eat. My spaniel ate coins and buttons off shirts. We found them in the yard later. Yuck.<br>  I know what you mean by the guilty look..
K2QwEM4raa	Probably he is young and not sure yet what to do.  When SHE is ready, she  will point him in the right direction. And he will figure it all  out.  LOL.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Because deep down, he knows that you are a bad owner and a puppy killer. He doesn't want his kids ending up like the 10 MILLION dogs, adults puppies and purebreds alike, euthanized every year in shelters.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	Because he knows that you dont know what you are doing. He knows that he should be fixed, so he is acting like he doesn't know what he is doing.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Why are you intentionally breeding mutts you irresponsible person???  Spay/Neuter stop being part of the problem...no one wants your mutts when the shelters can't even keep up with the ones that are already here.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	Maybe he isn't that into her.  Is this his first time?|`|rp8DUN9Waa	idk sorry
N9pKl35Xaa	Some say 4months.. but they dont always change. Some just change from being a darker blue colour to a lighter blue even a light green/yellow, or a darker brown to a lighter brown even a yellowy colour. Also it apparently can depend on the colour of the dog, you have a dark pit the eyes dont stay light or something. Either way they may or may not change and its a matter of time..|`|BYL1tSGKaa	not sure what you are asking-----color, shape or size perhaps-<br>  <br>  My Pits eye color never did change and I adopted her when she was a puppy. As far as shape and size as her head grew bigger. takes about 2 1/2 yrs.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Change to what?  My Pit's are the same as she was at 3 months.  I didn't know they change.  She is 7 months and her eyes are the same color.<br>  <br>  Beautiful.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Change color? They usually don't. Change shape? As the pit grows up, its features will mature. But their eyes do not really "change"
4ap1GPvsaa	Well, i think i can answer your question because i have to keep goldfish to feed to my oscar's. I have noticed when the goldfish get stressed out there colours can change and/or fade, i am guessing your goldfish is just stressed out, once it gets more used to its enviroment and surroundings it will get its colour back.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps<br>  ~Sincerly Cori~|`|q4JaBnQuaa	I think that you should because maybe his markinga are coming by instict of camofluge so yeah it would be a good idea to set a mock living place. Also get worried if he starts acting funny|`|hQQuqyYcaa	It's most likely that he's just extremely stressed out. The black marks should come back once he gets comfortable in his new environment. I have known of some goldfish to GRADUALLY lose their black as they get older, but obviously this is not the case.|`|aeonmRR2aa	The black was probably damaged flesh.  Common goldfish can be gold, silver, white/gold, white/red, or maybe other combinations of those colors.  Shubunkin goldfish and some fancy varieties can be black or partly black.<br>  <br>  If you have a common goldfish that had black marks, and they are now gone, this is a good sign!  Black marks on MOST goldfish are caused by "melanophore migration", a response in the skin cells to damage (kind of like a sunburn).  Goldfish in overcrowded pet store feeder tanks often have big black marks because the water they are in is horribly polluted with ammonia, nitrites, pathogenic bacteria, and who knows what else.<br>  <br>  So if the black goes away, it should stay away, and you can be happy that your fish is now healthier and has recovered from his skin damage (most likely ammonia burn).<br>  <br>  <br>  You can confirm this with a web image search on 'melanophore migration'.  For example, look at these pictures (not for the faint of heart!)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thegab.org/Articles/DiagnosingNecropsy.html" rel="nofollow">http://thegab.org/Articles/DiagnosingNec...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  You can toss whatever you want in with him, as long as it is not big or sharp.  But I DO suggest that you keep bubblers in the water to keep it oxygenated.
yfxUhArLaa	Thats so sad he didn't want to talk to you. But i talked to my hamster all the time. She was really nice! ;) Dont worry he still loves you he is just going through a stage of worry because he doesn'y know if you will accept him as being a talking hamster.<br>  xxoo<br>  :)|`|onfHuV54aa	YES....yes yes, he DEFINETLY hates your GUTS. you might wanna try shaving your haid, though... i heard that helps|`|IIonTAU2aa	OMG! That happened to me too! What i did was wake up at 2:30 everyday and he started talking. Hope this helps!! <br>  <br>           P.S. he doesn't hate you he's just shy.|`|6JNswOpbaa	i never new that was possible lol.|`|DGp6suhwaa	What are you on?|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	u gota give him the formula from the nutty professor dawg|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i think you better get off the drugs|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Your hamster thinks you are Richard Gere, and he is scared, so very scared!|`|0s3QjkuBaa	probably.... there very synical animals.

YnCUyvK7aa	I'm hoping you're looking for a freshwater fish that resembles a shark rather than the real thing.  The smallest saltwater sharks you can buy will eventually reach 3-4 feet in length and need that as the smallest dimension of their tank. So you would be looking for a tank around 6-8 feet long, by 3- 4 feet wide and at least 18 inches high. They also need to have pristine water conditions.<br>  <br>  Freshwater *sharks* are either members of the minnow or catfish family, that just resemble sharks.  Many of these will also get too big for an average tank.  Iridescent sharks will get to around 4 feet and bala sharks around 14 inches, but need to be kept in a school of at least 3, and are extremely active and are known jumpers.  Others that are smaller like rainbow sharks and red tailed sharks are territorial and aggressive to other fish.<br>  <br>  Something you might want to research is a Pimodella catfish, other than their long whiskers, they look a lot like a small shark.<br>  <br>  But if you're interest is really the saltwater variety, look into a banded catfish shark or bamboo shark as these are 2 of the smallest.  But any real sharks are considered for saltwater experts only, and if you don't have much experience with saltwater, you might want to try the freshwater versions or some easier saltwater species first.<br>  <br>  A website with information about keeping sharks.  <a href="http://www.wetwebmedia.com/sharkslvgrm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetwebmedia.com/sharkslvgrm.h...</a>|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Im assuming you mean actual shark, not a catfish thats just called "shark".<br>  <br>  The smallest sharks grow between 36-40 inches. They need at least 250-300 gallons, preferably more. I believe its the banded bamboo shark is the one I see most often, but I believe there are a few other species that stay around this size as well.<br>  <br>  Petco will never carry these. Youll need to go to a local shop that has saltwater fish, and see if they do. If not, they should be able to order you one. Expect topay around 120-150$ for one though. Then the saltwater setup for that size... You are probably looking at the 2000-3000$ range.<br>  <br>  If youve never had experience with saltwater tanks, sharks are horrible to start with. These are very sensitive fish, that need precise conditions.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I really would not recommend that you get a shark as your first aquatic pet. (besides a goldfish). They can't be found at Petco, that's for sure. If you have no previous experience with saltwater fish, do NOT get a shark.|`|AraBfesHaa	I agree with everyone else.  Not a good idea.<br>  But whatever you decide, if you find any at a pet store that you want to get, just please go home and research it before buying.  They'll tell you what you want to hear just to sell a fish.<br>  They told my son the iridescent shark he wanted would only grow to 6-12".  He bought it, put it in his 55-gallon tank, and 2 years later, at 22" long, it smothered to death because that tank was way too small.  A horrible, horrible death to watch, and not being able to anything for it made it that much worse.    If he were in the proper tank, he would have grown to 48".  They need to get at top speeds to breathe.  They don't breathe thru their mouths, so don't surface for air.  They bang into the ends of the tank trying to get the air they need, risking injury to themselves and shattering the tank as well.   He was  a beautiful fish, though, my favorite.<br>  If these stores were made to be liable for lying about what they sell, I think they'd be more responsible about what they tell the customers, but evidently, they can and will say what they want, so please research them.  <br>  Some like to be in schools, (they won't tell you that), and will need a larger tank for larger amts of fish.<br>  There are lots of facts to find out really about what kind of fish, shark or others, before buying them.  they'll live longer if you know what you're doing.|`|zdclAyo5aa	here are all the types of freshwater sharks:<br>  >albino shark<br>  >black shark<br>  >red-tailed sharks<br>  >rainbow sharks<br>  >paroon sharks<br>  >ruby sharks<br>  >albino paroon sharks<br>  <br>  thats all the frashwaters sharks i know hope info helps <br>  <br>  <br>  !!!!CAUTION!!!!DO NOT MIX PAROON SHARKS WITH ANY OTHER SHARKS OR FISH THEY WILL EAT THEM!!!!CAUTION!!!!|`|XJEGTZJqaa	i would recommend that you get a Thai bamboo shark OR<br>  Carribean Minatiure PonyTail Gill Shark
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Buy a screen top and you can get the locks for them right at the pet store. I just looked at them last night when I picked up a new 75 gallon for one of my beardies.  The locks looked like they would work pretty good and they were not expensive. To be on the safe side I would still weight the top down. My son had a snake but no locks and his got out.|`|wZKb8egaaa	Okay . . .|`|he18hGKNaa	You could get a regular screen lid that sits on the top of the tank, then put a brick on each side over the wall.  I did that for a little while for my bearded dragon when his tank was too small for him, but I couldnt afford the upgrade just yet.  I often came into the room with him standing on top of his bushes or on top of his shelter with his belly against the glass wall with his nails through the screen on the top of the tank.  He never did escape without the bricks, but I was paranoid, so weighed down the screen to make sure he couldnt push it up.<br>  <br>  I've also seen some that will snap into the top of the tank, and they have a sliding screen that has a hole that you can put a lock into.<br>  <br>  Theres dozens of different kinds of lids for a tank... go to your local pet store and ask for some advice.|`|qCUz6YXMaa	So go buy one them . . . . . . . <br>  try : craigslist, gumtree, local online forums.<br>  <br>  PetCo, Petsmart etc etc or online or eBay.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
LwEwd7lcaa	If he is acting excited as well it means he wants to play with the other dog.  My dog is the same.  although the whining has almost stopped the more mature he gets (bad english I know.  Sorry about that)|`|24CFl7sjaa	Take him somewhere he can socialise with his own kind, its really important for dogs.<br>  Get a companion for him.
AA12083992	Don't take her out and stand there, walk her. The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) but don't let the pup see you clean it or she will get the idea that is your job! Then get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck|`|VpeQ6xDnaa	Crate train..Buy the puppy a Crate just big enough for it to stand up and turn around in. Take them out every 2 hours. After Naps, After eating, after playtime, first thing in the morning, before you even brush your teeth and right before bedtime. If it doesnt poop after eating leave it in the crate until it does. No potty outside no freedom in the house. That's my motto. When ever your not with her keep her in the crate. I have a 3 month old yorky that I've for a month. The first week was a pain, but since I've crate trained her, she's doing a lot better. Hope this helps.|`|GMtoiRRmaa	we had the same thing with our 2 month puppy. now he is almost 3 months.<br>  <br>  he used to whine, but then stopped whining and would just go lol. man. when we took our puppy out too he wouldnt do anything. but thats because he is still unsure about the whole place and what to do. we had to look for every kind of sign. heres what i suggest<br>  <br>  puppies don't have control over their bladder as well as older dogs. just like babies. remember he is still a puppy.<br>  <br>  what i suggest is when you want to take him out. pick out a word that he can associate to go pee with. For example my wife and I chose the word potty.<br>  <br>  so we say " who want's to go potty?" and then we say "come on lets go potty" then we head to the door and go out and they follow behind. I suggest this everytime you want him to go. sometimes when outside we will say "come on go potty" doesn't always work of course :P<br>  <br>  sometimes he would go out for 15min. we stand there the whole time he doesnt do anything. then bring him back in and then he would go sometimes. so we started take him out . then bring him back in and take him out again lol.  but here is also what u can do<br>  <br>  -I suggest taking him out anytime he is near the door that you go out at.<br>  -after long naps<br>  -after play time<br>  -after eating or excessive drinking<br>  -after walks (especially if your puppy doesn't know what the walk is for)<br>  <br>  and stay out with him. give him time its all new to him and he is still very usnure about everything.<br>  <br>  when he does go. praise him either via verbal praise or hands on praise. like petting. or maybe a treat.but timing is also crucial you dont want to wait 3 minutes after he did it and praise him.<br>  <br>  and be consistent.<br>  <br>  when he does go inside and ONLY if you catch him at the scene of action discipline him<br>  <br>  meaning when he does it stay calm, swat him in the nose or butt. just something but dont beat him. and tell him no or bad dog. and then take him outside. while he is outside clean up the spot<br>  <br>  when your anger gets the best of you, you are no longer disciplining your dog but your punishing your dog. dogs don't react well to punishing but they react better to disciplining. so stay calm|`|XLuGWl8zaa	1. You can get puppy training pads and put her little mess on it or find where she does it the most and put a pad there.<br>  2. You can take her out 1 hour after she eats and let her run around and play more then likely she will go to the bathroom. <br>  3. If she makes a mess in the house you can take it and her out side put it out side where you would like her to go and show it to her see if that works. <br>  There are many ways to hose train a dog just try some out for a week or two see if it works but the thing is you can't change the rutine till she gets the point to go out side it shouldn't take long!|`|FaPrr8bbaa	When you know you won't be paying good attention to puppy, hook her leash to your belt.  She might not like it at first but when she sees that you can't hide from her either she will like it.  At first keep walking around so she doesn't struggle.   When  pup potties in the house, crate her until you clean the mess and then walk her back outside, or she will think that potty inside lets her go back outside to play.|`|6PK28K9taa	put down wee-wee pads|`|f0YtsWUTaa	Confront her when she poo's in the house, tell her "thats for outside" and take the pile and her outside and place it in the yard and then litteraly "praise the pile" and her for it being outside thats what worked for me.
L22hVXTIaa	If you decide to do a spay/abortion of the puppies, it's better to do so in the first half of the pregnancy rather than the latter half.  Since a normal pregnancy is approximately 63 to 64 days, that would mean to have the surgery performed "preferably" no later than 32 days into the pregnancy.  While this type of surgery is performed fairly routinely, it would obviously have been better to have had her spayed before she was pregnant.  There can be significant blood and tissue loss in a spay/abortion, and since it is major surgery, you will have to contact your vet.  He will want to examine the female to ensure that she is strong enough to undergo the surgery and to ensure that she is not so far progressed into the pregnancy that it would be better to let her deliver the pups.  There are two schools of thought on this:  Some say the spay/abortion surgery is safer than allowing your dog to deliver the pups and then, there is the moral question of bringing more unwanted dogs into a world overrun with dogs in shelters.  However, some counter that it is safer to allow a female to deliver.  So, you will have to consult your vet to make the best decision for your particular dog.  I wish you good luck!|`|iVQULHqYaa	Poor you,  It's not your fault that she is pregnant and I realise that you are concerned about bringing more puppies into an overcrowded dog world. Molly could suffer if she has puppies and the vets expenses could be huge. Molly's growth could be stunted if she is young and has puppies. Perhaps she has been mated by a large dog and she will have pain and problems giving birth.<br>  <br>  If Molly were my dog and after weighing up the downside, I think that you should get her spayed. Having said that, for Molly's safety, obviously you will take advise from your vet.<br>  <br>  If the cost is a problem and if you are in the UK you can get  financial help from the PDSA if you are on benefits. Or if Molly is a purebred their rescue societies will help you.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|fgxajTiBaa	It should be fine to get her spayed at this point the puppies aren't anywhere near fully developed. Yes it would be aborting, but it's better than potentially 8 adult shelter dogs being euthanized.|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes it can be done.<br>  <br>  There are slightly increased risks as opposed to spaying when not pregnant..  but, a spay/abortion is much safer than to allow her to continue the pregnancy and go thru labor..  the risks of the spay outweigh the risks of the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  People may not like the idea of killing the unborn puppies.. but in all reality, thousands of dogs die daily because of lack of homes.  These pups are no more deserving of life than a dog that is sitting in a shelter.  Odds are that at least half of these puppies will end up euthanized in a shelter at some point anyways.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Although people don't like to know it happens, you can get your dog fixed while pregnant and she isn't too far along to do this.  I know, I know...people are not going to like it.  But if your dog is going to be having puppies that you don't want and didn't plan for then this is the best decision for you and your dog.  Your Vet will charge you extra for spaying while pregnant.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is not too late.  It is safe and given your circumstances I am surprised the vet didn't bring it up.  Obviously, sooner is better, so call the vet and make an appointment.  You are doing the right thing.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	You may but the vets say it is more risky and they prefer not to.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	You are just about at the cut-off point for the safest abortion/spay.  After a dog is 3+wks along there is too much tissue and blood loss to make the operation as safe as possible.  If you are going to have an abortion/spay, I would do it this week rather than waiting until any later. Some quacks will do it later, even in late pregnancy, but it is not in the best interest of the dog.<br>  After a dog reaches that 3wk mark bloodflow to the uterus is greater.  It is just safer to do it before then.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	your vet will know if it's safe.<br>  <br>  a few months ago i picked up a dumped dog. she was 45 days pregnant. i had the vet abort and spay. i was willing to care for her, but i'm in no way set up for a whelping b****. and it's hard enough finding good homes for the rescues i've already got. AND i'd have been obligated to spay/neuter each pup which i can't afford to do.|`|6KyyhE0Xaa	You can - although it's slightly more risky than doing it when she's not in season or pregnant.  You're best doing it sooner rather than later, as the further along the pregnancy she is the harder and more dangerous the surgery is.|`|KmC0K59taa	I know that you can get a female cat spayed when she is pregnant.  I imagine you can do the same for a dog.  Just anonymously call a vet's office and ask.|`|J5hsCONRaa	It is fairly safe - as safe as being spayed without being pregnant is. Call your vets and ask, they will run through the risks with you. Well Done for doing the right thing.|`|ZKYz2MvZaa	It is ok, it would kind of be like an abortion. I'd consult a vet first.
WIFKeDBgaa	I'm assuming you mean across COUNTRY...as opposed to COUNTY. Either way, I fly dogs across the country and internationally every week for 30 years.... no problems.<br>  <br>  I prefer to use Continental if I'm shipping them as cargo. If I have a handler travelling to deliver a dog, I use Delta or Northwest and check the dogs as baggage.<br>  <br>  all that is required is 2 bowls, absorbant material in the bottom, and health certificate with proof of rabies (when travelling as cargo). Northwest and Delta do not require a health certificate when checked as baggage.|`|8YrqeCPQaa	Try to make him as comfortable as possible. Dont feed him or let him drink water before the flight to avoid poo and pee problems and make sure he empties out good before he gets on the plane. Give him his favorite toys and maybe an old t shirt of yours with your scent on it to make him comfortable.|`|2zgv89OQaa	I've never traveled with a pet but found this info that hopefully can help you.   <br>  <br>  Once you've decided to bring your pet along, you need to think about safety. While packing extra food, water (ice cubes work wonders), and favorite toys, it's wise to take a minute to locate the closest veterinarian to where you'll be staying. Healthy pet is an excellent resource, and is part of the American Animal Hospital Association. In just a few clicks, you can print off a list of doctors and directions to have handy in case of an emergency. It's also a good idea to pack a basic first-aid kit for any journey. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you have a current ID tag with your pet at all times.  Take photos of your pet with you in case your pet becomes lost.
PM23RDycaa	Because of the nutritional training (or lack thereof) they get. The course which i believe is not a requirement in many cases is taught by kibble companies.<br>  <br>  There are more and more neutral or pro-raw/raw friendly vets out there. When they said "well talk" means "we are going to try and talk you out of it"<br>  <br>  I have heard from other raw feeders who have gone to new vets who before finding out what the dog is on go on and on about how good the dog's condition is, ie spotless teeth in an older dog. The minute they hear Raw Diet they change their tunes just that quick.<br>  <br>  When you go in if you keep the appointment just politely say BEFORE the lecture starts that you understand the concern but you have studied this diet and your cat is doing fine on the diet and that if they cannot respect that, you will be finding another vet.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Not all vets are against raw feeding.  I have a vet now who has told me on a number of occasions that I'm doing the best thing for my dogs. The vet I'd used for 18 years was very rude to me and had red flagged my file for the other vets in the practice to know that I was raw feeding (I looked at it). I'd always get ... well if you'd feed them a proper diet ... You'll develop a thick skin after awhile and won't mention the raw feeding. Some of the girls on my raw feeding list argue with the vets, it isn't worth it. If you're committed to raw feeding find a vet who doesn't give you grief.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I'm sure there are sensible vets out there who understand there is more food out there than what the food reps tell them.  Could be they want to make sure you are not going off some hippie site.  I, too, question who is putting out the raw food diet info.  You still have to do your own research.  <br>  <br>  Here is an actual experiment (although the sample size is small) that shows BARF fed dogs shed more salmonella in their stools and their saliva.  Doesn't sound like the body is killing it to me.  Great if they don't get an infection, but not-so-great if you have kids playing in the same yard your dog poops in.<br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=339295" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a><br>  <br>  Another website:<br>  <a href="http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/pbs/zoonoses/GIk9fel/Salmonella.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/pbs/zoonoses/...</a><br>  Mmm... still want Fido to lick your face?<br>  <br>  Abstract of an article published in 1989 that stated a majority of cultures from the ill cats in the study showed they were sick from salmonella:<br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2759883?ordinalpos=3&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27598...</a><br>  <br>  But if you want to believe the 10 year breeder of labradoodles who has a Ph.D. alright (in English) and a hubby who knows how to run a website over a vast array of scientists, go for it.<br>  <br>  When I finally graduate, have my own job, and have my own pets, they will be fed fresh ingredients, but I plan on cooking those ingredients.<br>  <br>  I'm betting in about 5-10 years, more studies are going to come out linking pet illnesses to the raw food diet.  Right now, people are going to be in denial about the newest fad.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I don't feed raw, but i do have a vet that is very progressive in the ways of dog food. <br>  <br>  My vet doesn't sell ANY Hills Brand or Purina crap in his clinic. he's taken independent animal nutrition courses and has studied on his own about food. he helped me find kibble that was of higher quality for my own dogs, which i feed solid gold.<br>  basically what he told me when i asked him the same thing (about raw and quality food) is that most vets take the food controversy very personally. They feel that since they've done the time in vet school, etc that they're word should be law on the subject. when a client comes in and starts second guessing their advice they feel threatened in a way. they forget that they are working for the pet owner, and that their job is to advise not dictate.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if i had a vet say to me on the phone before meeting them what that vet said to you, i'd probably tell her to forget the appointment i'd be taking my business elsewhere to a vet that understands that *I* will be choosing the diet for my pet.|`|XoknFyNvaa	Vet's are not properly educated on pet nutrition in veterinary college. The stuff that they do learn is taught by Science Diet spokespeople. They are cautious about raw because they aren't educated about raw. If you didn't know about something, you wouldn't be able to form a proper opinion on it. We took our dog into the vet and they looked at his teeth (which aren't bad for a 6 year old dog) and said "oh, he should be on Hills TD". They make money on every sale and get discounts from the manufacturer. They have a reason to promote their own food, but have no incentive to tell you that raw is good for your pet. In fact, the vets that do encourage raw usually have some sort of pet nutrition training or have researched the diet. Check out the source that I've listed if you want a veterinary opinion on a natural diet. I've been a raw feeder for about 10 years and would not even consider a vet brand food.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a cat owner, but I saw a show that said that cats should not be  eating any dry food. They were saying that there is too much grain in kibble and that every cat should at least be eating wet food.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	I work at a vet clinic. The doctors at my clinic aren't opposed to it - BUT, we have seen some problems from it when done improperly. So, if you do it responsibly with knowledge there isnt' a problem, but when done in ignorance (like most things) we can see problems.<br>  <br>  We have seen several animal die or become very sick from the RAW diet. Yes, they can get salmonella and e.coli. This can be prevented if the dog is properly transitioned to the diet. But, some people get the crazy idea that they can take a dog that's been on dog food for years and suddenly start feeding it raw food - YES, you will have problems. We also will see lots of people buy a puppy from a breeder that fed dog food and then they'll start feeding it raw food and within a week we have a very sick puppy.<br>  <br>  So, if the transition is done properly there isnt' a problem. We even have some handouts that my clinic has on different diets you can feed and how to transition the dog. If your cat has been transitioned for a long time and is doing fine...the vet really should not be one to complain!   Best wishes!
iXijnCxOaa	Hrmm...  <br>  <br>  Worst ~ one of the multiple times I've fallen in the ring.  1) I'm a klutz  2) I have MS and never know WHEN my large muscles will simply quit.  Happily, I've had professional "fall" training and am now as graceful as a fat lady can be falling while at a dead sprint.. as long as I remember "roll.. roll.. roll".<br>  <br>  Best ~ this past weekend.  While winning the 4 pt major and finishing my b*tch's championship was great.... the BEST part was showing her 2 6 mos old pups - beating some of the other b*tches in the bred by class with one of them, getting great comments on her from the judge AND most importantly, the judge's kindness and laughter in the puppy class when lil Miss Monica decided that one mat was EVIL and refused to go near it~ when the judge approached her, concerned she might have a temperament issue (shyness) she snoogled him and licked his chin.  We finally cut across the ring, avoiding that mat, she was great on the stand for exam, did a beautiful down and back (on a mat) and then balked at the EVIL mat... making the judge laugh.  It was just .. fun.. which is what shows should be.<br>  <br>  Gotta say.. the other Bests have been when my beloved Brat won 2 Best in Specialty Shows both from Veteran's class... once with my 12 year old daughter handling and once, when we handed her off (since *we* didn't believe an 11 year old b*tch was "competitive") and she won despite a handler she'd never worked with.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Well, I don't show dogs, but I showed Dairy Goats in 4H for about 14 years, so I have my fair share of show ring stories.<br>  <br>  Worst? Probably in my kid (baby goat) class, I had a totally unruly and undersocialized doe who wanted NOTHING to do with being in the show ring. She kicked and thrashed around and got loose! We had to pause the class for about 15 minutes before we caught her!<br>  <br>  Best? Most definitely my first Senior Showmanship class. My main doe that I used, Mona Lisa <a href="http://www.ramsfarm.com/mona.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramsfarm.com/mona.htm</a> is a 'picky' goat about who she likes or not. One of the showmanship tasks is to switch goats to see if you can actually handle all goats or just your own. When we switched, I handled my goat fine, but the person who got Mona Lisa had quite the ride. She began SCREAMING for me and fell to the ground and wouldn't move. I had never seen her act like that. We switched back and right away she was fine again. The judge was amazed by my bond with her. I did a great job in the class and I won first place! And then that same day we won best of breed, best doe in show AND Dam and Daughter, it was fantastic!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Worst? Isnt really my fault it was this jerks fault. Ok so it was a 2-3 day show in NJ i think. And so I have this male weimaraner who is the brother to my kira that i show. Yes he is a big male he is right at the standard though so he is not over. There is this pro handler in weims that shows the most gawd awful dogs i have ever seen been shown but he wins with them. One of the weims he was showing not only had an incorrect tail (it was docked so short it looked like a dobermans tail) he had poor gaiting and was just a mess, (this dog has taken the handler to the ground in the ring) <br>  <br>  Well see i beat him the day before with my dog and he was not too happy. SO the next day i kindof think something is up, because he and his whatever were talking alot and the one guy had a rule book. So we get in the ring and we are setting up our dogs and the judge is out in the middle of the ring getting a first look. Well then he was called to the table and they were talking for a good while. So i relaxed remy and i was getting a little PO'd cause at that point i think i realized what he was doing. They were calling for the wicket but oh no it wasnt the judge who called for it, it was the jackass handler. Reason i know it wasn't the judge the judge was setting it up for the handlers dog to be too small. The steward had to tell him it was for remy. <br>  <br>  Well the judge was kind with my because i had never been wicketed. So i set remy to wicketed and of course once that metal thing went over him he was scared to death. so naturally i lost that day because of that. It was underhanded and conniving i can not stand him to this day. <br>  <br>  I had to run over to another ring PO'd because i had a bulldog to show. <br>  <br>  There is more to the story but i dont feel like writing it all out now, If you want to know shoot me an email.<br>  <br>  Best? So far has to be when kira took BOB at 10 months old over two top 10 specials at the time. This was under Judge Everett Dean. <br>  <br>  It could also be winning the open class 2 days in a row with a class of 34 i think at a specialty. This was also with kira, unfortunately she did not win winners so i did not get the points. She would be finished today if she had.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Worst:<br>  <br>  I was taking my dog for a walk before going in the ring and, before I could stop him, he rolled in something incredibly evil smelling and sloppy.  I really, to this day, don't know what it was but I think it was some kind of faeces from a horse or cow with diarrhoea.  I was then frantically trying to wash this vile stuff off without getting the dog too wet, trying to get rid of / cover the smell and trying to have him dry enough to show him.  He was a Belgian Shepherd, Groenendael, so he had a lovely long coat to deal with.<br>  <br>  Best:  When the same dog took out Reserve in Show.  I was over the moon.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I've never shown my dogs...it's just not their thing.<br>  <br>  However, I know somebody who had the coolest Rottie ever named Inga.  Inga was one heck of a character.  During an obedience recall, Inga took a detour.  She jumped out of the ring, grabbed a hotdog off a spectators plate and while swallowing it whole she made her way back into the ring to her owner and with one last gulp she sat with a perfect front...waiting for the "finish" command.<br>  <br>  That ended Inga's show career...lol.  <br>  <br>  I will never forget the spunk that dog had - she had attitude like a true Rottie should...she's probably one of the biggest reasons I like the breed so much.<br>  <br>  <br>  Loki, just reading your story about leading with the inside leg made me cringe.  It may be the worst feeling in the world when your dog does everything right and you mess it up.  I do this all the time in rally (practice, we don't show).  I swear if I just sent the dog out by himself to do it, he'd be much better off...lol.  (it's a good thing dogs can't roll their eyes at us, mine would roll theirs right out of their heads)|`|54GBWTgoaa	well i cant show at crufts or anything due to the fact my husky girl is not kc, however as a part of the kennel club there are shows for pedigree non kc dogs, so we enrolled her in the junior show in our area, well it was just the practice actually (she hasn't done it yet, so we are training her in special classes provided by the kc) and when we finished and the Maureen was saying how well she did...she decided to pee :o.....rather embarrassing lol|`|cETQuE9waa	Wost time at a dog show: I had a Belgian Sheepdog jump up on me and try to attack my dog. I was holding my dog in my arms and the dog just jumped right up on me. I had to hold my dog up over my head so he wouldn't get bit.<br>  Also another time I was at a show and a bulldog tried to attack my dog. <br>  <br>  Best time: Taking BOS and also WB and Best Puppy.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Worst had to be when I had a 6 month old Flat coat Pup I was going to show in his class.<br>  I was out in the mezzanine and was coming through the doors to the ring area with the pup.<br>  Their was a table to the right of me that I had to walk past with a pro handler sitting on it he had an American Stafford Terrier that was sitting on leash.<br>  All of a sudden this dog lunged at my pup and simultaneously the pro handler screamed at his dog but the damage was done.<br>  My pup spent the next year and a half trying to work the fear out of itself at dog shows.<br>  To this day he has to be held in place just for the judge to go over him and has been excused from the ring several times for not letting the judge go over him.<br>  What a career killer! To this day I look for this guy just so that I can scare him.<br>  Best moments, taking BISS with one of my Aussies.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|AA10029366	Worst mistake: This is actually from the Obedience ring. I was at a specialty, and my dog had been *stellar* in Novice A...perfect off-lead. He was headed for High In Trial.<br>  <br>  Went to do the 1 minute Sit Stay, and I was so nervous (Novice A, one of my first trials) that I mumbled "stay..." and stepped off with my inside leg. Tigger stood up, knowing that inside leg = heel, but sure that he'd heard "Stay"...I heard the crowd go "Ohhhh...", turned, saw him standing in place and staring at me like, "Is this...right?"<br>  <br>  So we DQd what would have been a 195 score. His Down Stay was perfect.<br>  <br>  I could have killed myself. Totally my fault. Tigger was paying attention, and I wasn't. I will NEVER forget that mistake!!<br>  <br>  Best Experience: Finishing my first Champion. He was slow to mature (well, slow for a teenaged novice who only has 1 dog to show and wants to win!); he hit 2 years old, and picked up both majors and 14 points in the space of 3 months. That was a fun ride, and perfect timing...I was so frustrated with showing that I was near giving up.<br>  <br>  After Pal finished I was definitely hooked!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- worst- at a show this fall with a newbie SMT.  I am an amature owner/handler with the emphasis on amature.  LOL!  Anyway, she was the only SMT so we went right from breed to the group ring, full of professional handlers and my dog was dancing around, trying to play, basically being obnoxious.  I stepped on her foot by accident and she yelped.  The professional handler next to me was hissing at her dog 'murphy!  get away from that dog!  murphy!'  Ugh!  Best- when our DDB earned her first AKC CH point.  Yay!|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	Worst:<br>  <br>  Standing ringside with my b*tch when a guy walked by with a small child. The little boy (maybe 5) seemed like he'd been around dogs as he'd asked me and a few other exhibitors if he was allowed to pet their dog. He scratched my girl under the chin (which she just loves) and  moved on to the dog next to us (another female Dobe). He looked that dog right in the eye, and hauled off and slapped her on the head. Out of reflex, I stepped between him and the dog so quick the boy fell on his butt. The dad got all huffy about it, but everyone that saw what happened asked him to take is "sweet little boy and vacate the premises". That incident messed a few people up that day.<br>  <br>  Best: Our first BOB & a Group 1 in the same day!|`|Xa9esMTEaa	The only embarrassing thing would have to be when I was taking a young female for her BH and the judge accidentally poked her in the eye and she lunged after him...which in a working dog isn't a bad reflex but she was disqualified right off the bat, LOL. I don't think I have a single moment I could choose over another as the best  >.<|`|eDySIDPQaa	Worst day....easy<br>  <br>  When I had Pepper my beloved RIP baby, Min,. Schnauzer, we were in the group, judge entered ring, all the dogs she ask to go around right, okay, well, Pepper, stud as he was, and about 10 other studs would not round with us, the dog in the middle of us all was in heat, and we did not know it...<br>  <br>  We had dogs going nutts in the ring, well nutso, wanting to turn to her, the dogs behind her hurrying and pulling to get up behind her....<br>  <br>  The judge stopped the class, we all had to leave the ring, the female and handler was dismissed from the show, was not allowed to bring her back into the building......<br>  <br>  The larger studs all around her was going ape...and never seen so many dogs in one place wanting to say hello to one female, it was a mess.....my class was then put last for the day....<br>  <br>  Same judge came into the ring, she was smiling and said, okay are we ready to do this without a hitch and I see no female diapers, so we should be okay, we all laughed so hard.....it was an eventful day to say the least.<br>  <br>  The best day is when Pepper got BOS,,,his first one was wonderful.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	At an agility trial when running my Pom. Instead of the usual net snow fence that they use they just had single rope for the agility rings.  She went over the first 2 jumps and instead of turning and going over the 3rd, she went towards the tunnel.  I YELLED at her to stop and come.  She stopped alright, looked at me with that “How DARE you yell at me look”  gave me the paw and just took off,  First, she went to the pole setter Jumped on him, then the judge  Jumped on her a couple of times dancing around her.  Then teased me by going to the rope and stood there with two feet in the ring and 2 fee out, just daring me to do something about it.  I went to get her and she decided to run for it.  She took off thru the venue,  playing catch me if you can with everyone who tried to reach down to catch her.  If you have poms you know that unless they want to be caught, forget it.  She ran under the check in table,  Skipping up to people, then dashing away as soon as they reached for her,  having a dandy time making fools of everyone.  Finally, she decided she had punished me enough and ran up and sat in front of me.   Of course, this was just to point out to everyone who the fool was who owned her.    I was completely humiliated.  <br>  The next day she ran perfectly and got 2 first places.<br>  <br>  Best:  Any day when she works perfectly, no matter what the score or placement.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Congratulations Animal Artwork.|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Worst: It didn't involve me personally, but I was there ... A friend of mine just took a 4 point major, BOB (my dog won reserve), had his picture taken with the judge, then he suffered a coronary in the parking lot as he was putting his dog back in the car. He died en route to the hospital.<br>  Best: My girl Lylah took WB, BOS, and my boy Logan (Lylah's sire)  took BOB at the same show. We needed handling help that day, but we won all the ribbons.

LOL<br>  <br>  In all seriousness, I can read my Dobes body language, know them inside out & will ensure that they are properly controlled. In light of the draconian dangerous dogs act, which places the evidential burden firmly on the dog owner, it's just not worth taking the risk of employing someone.<br>  <br>  I wound *never* considering allowing a child to hold my Dobermanns lead. Yes, they are well behaved, but if anything frightened them there's no way a child could hold them.<br>  <br>  Edit: I would consider my Dobermanns in safe & capable hands if they were being exercised by Greekman/Curtis M.

If they were an established dog walker I would ask for references. I would go walking with them and my dog a few times first. They would not use and not want to use any harsh treatment with my dog, i.e. shaking, smacking, yanking, pet corrector, etc. My dog would also have to like them (not really an issue!) and they would have to like my dog (if they didn't show any enthusiasm around her I would not hire them).<br>  I would only use one if circumstances meant I couldn't get back at lunch time and no other arrangements could be made.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	For my dog? <br>  <br>  Lots of experience with large dogs, and no one wimpy<br>  16+<br>  Nah<br>  None<br>  A sort of mini-craigslist site we have for my city that people advertise their services and businesses on, or word of mouth, or advertisements on my vet office bulletin board.<br>  No<br>  Probably not, it would take alot for me to trust someone with my dog.

I simply wouldn't trust an unknown person with my dogs any younger than that, and I would have to walk with them first.<br>  <br>  Would you require them to have insurance or be bonded? what kind? No. <br>  <br>  What kind of references would you require if any? Personal references, and I would want them to have dogs that they have owned and walked for several years.<br>  <br>  Where would you go to look for a dog walker for your dog? Friends who use them.<br>  <br>  Have you ever used one before? No.<br>  <br>  Do you think you would ever use one? No. I just couldn't trust another person's ability to judge and gage my dog's reactions to certain situations, least of all a child. Also, I would want someone with the phyiscal ability to react in a situation. Someone calm who won't panic,  who has some kind of basic knowledge of what to do in an emergency situation(dog attack, car dog gets hit by a car, insect sting/ bite, paw cuts etc.)<br>  I honestly think it's easier to walk a dog yourself, and safer. If it's raining or I don't particularly feel like leaving the house, the dogs are comfortable using the treadmill we have, and they go on that for half an hour. I just hold their leashes, watch them, and make sure they don't get hurt. The big dog also has his own backpack, because his needs for exercise are greater than my own. He carries around bottles of water, for extra weight and work. He thinks he's just great for doing that.|`|e9i7RBrbaa	How old would they have to be? 13+<br>  Would you require them to have insurance or be bonded? what kind? No not if i trusted them.<br>  What kind of references would you require if any? Dog bags. thats about it on a walk.<br>  Where would you go to look for a dog walker for your dog? Around my neighborhood there are tons of teens here looking for a job and id be happy to help them. I get a walked dog and they get some extra pocket money i think it is smart.<br>  Have you ever used one before? Yes, i am using my 13 year old neighbor right now she is great! <br>  Do you think you would ever use one? See above^|`|0SHAY9TQaa	How old would they have to be? 16 or older<br>  <br>  Would you require them to have insurance or be bonded? what kind? Yes to insurance. I own 3 dogs----you never know what can happen!<br>  <br>  What kind of references would you require if any? References from their parents, adults, or work partners. Maybe even their teacher.<br>  <br>  Where would you go to look for a dog walker for your dog? I walk my own dogs! I have no idea where I would look.<br>  <br>  Have you ever used one before? No. <br>  <br>  Do you think you would ever use one? It depends. Yes, I would probably use one. But, if I go away on vacation, I have my best friend come and care for my dogs.|`|cETQuE9waa	If I was to hire a dog walker I would look for someone over the age of 20.<br>  They would have to have certification and at least 5 different references.  <br>  I would put up an ad for a dog walker and see who responded. I would do a back round check or two on them and also check their references.<br>  I don't have a dog walker and I would not use one. <br>  I care for my dogs myself. I am very picky when it comes to my animals and I really don't want anyone else caring for my dogs. <br>  Toy breeds can be quite tricky if the person doesn't understand them.
Jx1GDVF7aa	you are the human-he is the puppy!<br>  <br>  proper training technique is to take away the bad item and replace it with something appropriate.<br>  take away a shoe, give him a chew toy,....|`|Z1irqgc9aa	the puppy probably just wants to play. puppys love the attention.|`|lKbNLrRPaa	he's got an anger problem! calmly take the thing off him and when he goes for your leg hiss at him and shove him away.|`|ItFYVwlDaa	Because he can't reach your throat.|`|RyGjDgDpaa	that could be teething or viciousness. what breed is it?|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Well, that's what he can reach and yes, it's similar to a temper tantrum.  And it's totally normal puppy behavior.
P0Fjh59Eaa	Here's a site w/some information about this subject:<br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/16-questions-you-should-ask-the-breeder/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/16-question...</a><br>  <br>  be careful, Yorkies are in much "demand" right now (popular breed) and lots of unscrupulous breeders are trying to make a quick buck off them.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Have you thought about rescuing? There are a lot of positives to adopting a dog - there are all kinds of breeds and ages out there, a lot of them already trained and well-socialised.<br>  <br>  If you are going to insist on going to a breeder, you should be able to visit them in their home and see the mother, and the father if possible. You should check that health tests have been done and come back clear, and see if the mother seems healthy and happy, with a good temperament. <br>  <br>  A good breeder will not over breed her b*tch, will keep her in the home when she's too old to have any more puppies, and always take the puppies back if the new owner at some point cannot keep them. They should ideally home check and ask you for a reference. They should find homes for the puppies before they are born.<br>  <br>  I could go on...|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You should ask the breeder what the goal of their breeding program is.  If they don't have a clear goal that you can approve of, don't get the pup.  <br>  <br>  You should ask if they show their dogs and if they do any other things like obedience or agility with their dogs.  If they only show confirmation, I personally would look for another breeder, but for some people, with toy breeds, that's not a priority.  (You need to decide if performance is important to you, but they should at very least be showing in confirmation.)  <br>  <br>  You should ask what kinds of heath tests were done on the pups parents, what those tests mean and what the results are.  Them saying "we got their eyes certified" is one thing, being able to explain why they did is another.  They should be able to explain it all to you.<br>  <br>  Ask why they chose to breed that particular male to the female.  Again, their answer will tell you a lot.  If they don't have some clear reasons as to why this dog with that dog, move on to another breeder.<br>  <br>  Ask what clubs they belong to and if the pups will be able to be registered with both the parent club and AKC.  If they can't be registered in both, move on.  Even if having a registered dog isn't important to you.  This shows how involved they are with their breed.<br>  <br>  Ask about healthcare the pups will receive before being allowed to go home with you.<br>  <br>  Ask if you can contact them for help after you purchase the pup.<br>  <br>  Ask if they'll take the pup back if at any time you become unable to care for the pup.<br>  <br>  What they should ask you - they should ask you questions about the living situation for the pup and your plans for the pup.  They should also ask a bunch of questions about what you're looking for in a puppy.  If they're not asking this, they aren't trying to match you with the pup with the best temperment for you.<br>  <br>  All in all, a good breeder will yang your ear off about their breeding programs and their dogs in general.  Both the good and the bad!  And if you find a good breeder, you usually find someone you can be friends with for life.  And that's how it should be.  If you don't happen to like the breeder, no matter how good their breeding program is, move on.  It's a relationship that should be a good one and it should start off on a good foot!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0m6BgESXaa	How long have you been breeding Yorkshire Terriers?<br>  How did you get into breeding?<br>  How many litters do you have a year?<br>  Do you have any references from your vet and/or other puppy buyers?<br>  May I say the health certificates for your dogs?<br>  What are the health issues in your lines (if the breeder hasn't been breeding long, they may not have had any yet)?<br>  At what age do you let your puppies go home (for toy breeds, the answer should generally be between 12-14 weeks...I know some that keep their puppies until 16 weeks)?<br>  <br>  The breeder should be happy to answer any and ALL questions.  Look for show ribbons on the wall from conformation or other dog sports.  Ask if they participate in these things, and if they don't, ask why not (and then run the other way).<br>  <br>  The breeder should ask you about your living situation.  If there are any children in the home and their ages, if you have a fenced yard, how you plan to train and confine your puppy (housebreaking purposes).  Some will ask you if you will take your pup to a puppy class (some breeders require it).  They should also ask you why you WANT a Yorkie, and what your beginning interest in them was.  They should ask if you've ever had one before, or any other toy breed.  Do you have any pets in the house now, or have you before?<br>  <br>  Who will be the primary caretaker of the puppy?  If you're married or have kids, is everybody on board with this new addition?  Do you rent or own your home, and are there any breed or weight restrictions that apply?<br>  <br>  There's all sorts of questions, and there may be even more that crop up just during the conversation.<br>  <br>  Any breeder breeding "just for pets" should be avoided. They should have a PURPOSE in mind for breeding, not breeding just to supply an overflowing market.<br>  <br>  The breeder should (generally) also pick your pup for you.  They'll know the puppies and their personalities better than you will, and thus give you a better match. If you go to a good breeder, be prepared to be put on a waiting list.  You may have to wait for a year or more depending on the length of the list.|`|RyGjDgDpaa	see if the dog meets up to these standards on the site i put for sources
P0Fjh59Eaa	It depends on the quality of the breeder. <br>  <br>  if you do your research and find a reputable breeder that provides health testing on mom and dad dog and has many questions for you about what you are looking for and how your lifestyle will fits the breed. you will find that you will pay a reasonable price and you will get a healthy and happy puppy.<br>  <br>  if you don't do your research and find a dis-reputable breeder that will sell puppies to just anyone you can look at spending HUGE bucks because all that breeder cares about it money, and you might even be scammed into buying a dog that is labeled as "mini" or "teacup" (which is just a sickly runt) and it could end up costing you big time in the long run because of poor breeding.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Why do you want a male AND female Yorkie? I hope you're not thinking about breeding...|`|Bw18seFqaa	from a reputable breeder..  around $1200 each for pet quality with spay/neuter contracts..   $2,000-3,000 for show quality with a show/breeding contract.<br>  <br>  <br>  from a shelter or rescue around $300 or so each, maybe less.|`|VkFDAQ46aa	depending on how they are registered. health guarantees , ect.. i couldnt tell you for sure. but you could go to a shelter or a yorkie rescue and try to find one. they will most likely already be spayed and neutered. if you are planning on getting them for breeding do a little research and get only the best. anything less is not really worth breeding.|`|k6flESfNaa	again, get a phone. call some breeders. but you will most likely end up getting a omg-so-cute-puppymill-teacup-yorkie-rat.
C1eHfhrHaa	It's never too late to neuter your dog.  GO ahead and do it at 4 months. It won't hurt him and he will be healthier and happier.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I would say 6 months that's what all the vets tell me so you don't take things to early.|`|AA11896276	as soon as you see his gonads. <br>  They will "drop", at first his little sack should be flat  and empty but soon you'll notice  it has filled out. That's  when you have him fixed.<br>  They have to be there before  they can be removed so  to speak...lol|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I would just make the booking for 4 months old (approx. two months time). That is not too late.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Your vet said 4 months because the testicles in puppies don't always drop down out of the puppy until about 4-6 months.  If the puppy is very young and the testies have not dropped, you should wait a bit to see if they do.  Otherwise, it's a harder and more expensive surgery.  It's harder on the dog as well as the vet.<br>  <br>  There aren't any behavioral problems that the dog will develop waiting until it's 4 months old.  Then again, there is no reason why, if the dog is younger than that and the testies have dropped, that it can't be done sooner.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think waiting until 4 months is a good idea.  You can schedule your dog for the surgery, have the vet neuter them and give them their 16 week vaccinations all at the same time and ... that saves a visit to the vet and often times an extra office visit charge.  lol.  It's not that I'm cheap, it's that there's really no reason why a puppy needs to be neutered before that and ... it just keeps things on a nice schedule.<br>  <br>  That said, I guess if I was actually cheap, I'd take the pup to the low cost clinic instead of to his normal vet.  *shurg*  In the end it really doesn't matter so long as the pup gets neutered before he's about 6 months old and so long as he receives all his vaccinations on time.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I personally recommend after 6 months of age. but hon, i have had dogs fixed before 6 months and well after 6 months and i've not had any issues w/any dogs.<br>  <br>  I had a dog that was fixed at 12 weeks old as per the conditions of his adoption through my local pound (kill-shelter) and i've had a dog that was well over 2 yrs old before being fixed and he did just fine. <br>  <br>  6 months is the age i am most comfortable with because the puppy is older and can handle surgery better than such a young puppy.|`|RyGkqWvCaa	Well it's never to late to get your dog neutered. But its best to get it done at least after he is 6 months old no younger than 4 months. I would also recommend that you get it done at the vets instead of the human society. It might be cheaper but they don't have to follow the same amount of rules as a vet does during surgeries.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	the vets office that I work at suggests that they get all their booster shots before they get fixed.  but it is around 6 months that is the best to get the dog fixed.|`|PhJQJW7haa	Hello!<br>  <br>  I just got a husky/german shepherd cross and I've been asking about when to get him fixed.  <br>  <br>  I've heard from a dog trainer that you're supposed to wait until at least 9 months to a year because he needs his testosterone to develop his muscles properly.  My vet said six months but I think I might wait longer to make sure he's full grown before he gets it done.<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure if it would be the same for females, but I imagine that they probably do need their hormones to develop properly. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RT8LZy7gaa	You can get him done any time after the testicles descend.  Vets usually recommend 4 months because puppies are done with all their shots by then.  Our shelter will adopt out intact puppies but your contract says you have to show proof of spay/neuter by 6 months.<br>  <br>  A chow mix can be a very bullheaded dog. The earlier the better for that breed to avoid dominance issues.<br>  <br>  The shelter sounds like a good deal.  Just give them a quick call. At least you'll be on the list. At a price like that, the schedule probably fills up quickly.|`|jnQ5kbZVaa	I wouldn't recommend doing it any sooner than 4 months since the little guy's immune system won't be fully developed and the surgery can weaken it even further making him more susceptible to infections. My sister recently had her male kitten neutered at 2 months old and he died 4 days later from an infection. I had my husky/shepherd mix spayed at 4 months without any problems. Four months is a very good age to get it done. Hope all goes well!|`|paKkFWXSaa	I can only tell you what my personal vet recommended and she said at 6 months with both my male and female. That gave time to get all their series of shots taken care of. My male will be 2 in may and he hardly ever humps, only if he gets really riled up which is very rare. He hardly ever lifts his leg to pee he usually squats like a girl dog. He has never attempted to mark anything in our house (he is an inside dog) and the only time I have seen him lift his leg is when he smells another dog that has been around our house or when we take him somewhere he doesnt go all the time like mine or my husbands mothers houses. Whatever you do definately get him neutered because the health benefits to your new companion are numerous if you do.<br>  <br>  I agree get it done at a vet, they have higher standards. We had it done with our vet and even opted for an extra pain shot to help the little guy out and it only cost $75
UHIi8AuQaa	have you ever smelt a worms breath...........that my friend is the worst smelling breath.............|`|NYdxGC0naa	They should not have bad breath , Chicks swollow there food whole and do not chew and should not have anything sticking around in there mouths . Rabbits would have grassy breath , and that is sweet smelling- unless they have a rotton tooth or are sick with diabeties and the acid smell from there tummy is coming up . <br>  Bugs ?

Just like in humans, the bacteria lives on the top of the tongue and produces foul smelling compounds.  We can smell other peoples bad breath. We can smell the bad breath of animals, however, very few of us can smell our own bad breath.<br>  To learn more about the cause and cure of bad breaths see:<br>  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com/halitosis.php</a>|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	All the rabbits and chickens that I've gotten close to did not have bad breath.

Answers is to be negligent of your animal, who depends upon you for its every need.<br>  <br>  Get off the computer and go to the vet NOW!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Wait, your aunt took her to the vet.  I agree, it is very likely something she ingested, probably poison of some kind, but then again it could indeed be parvo, if she is not vaccinated against it.  However, parvo most often claims puppies and senior pets, not adults, but that doesn't mean it can't happen.  Clean everything your dog comes into contact with with mild bleach to be careful.|`|9Ute4yidaa	I dont know, the bestthing to do is just let the vets handle it. they know almost everything.

I pray that she will be alright. First of all, take her to the vet/pet ER NOW!!!! Or as soon as possible, it would be helpful if you could do it today. Now, she has symptoms for poisoning. Do you keep any plants in the garden that are on the following list? If so, she is most likely poisoned, and the vet will have to intervene. Ask your family and read this list VERY carefully. <br>  go to <a href="http://www.entirelypets.com/toxicfoods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.entirelypets.com/toxicfoods.h...</a> and see the list NOW!!!|`|3EaFjsA8aa	If she is not current on her shots and you recently had her around other dogs it could be parvo.  there is a nasty strain of it effecting adult dogs.<br>  <br>  OR it could be worms<br>  <br>  OR it could be the doggie flu.  for lack of better words. I had two dogs with it this winter<br>  <br>  OR she could have ate something that made her sick.|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	If your dogs at the vet its the best you can do.  My assumption is the dog ate something that did not digest well.<br>  <br>  eg. plastic or a chicken bone or something<br>  <br>  if thats the case she should be fine, just sick for a lil while|`|lKbNLrRPaa	it might be a twisted stomach. but it could just be somthing she ate. was there anything that she could reach, like floor cleaner?|`|l6zCApnqaa	Have you asked your vet if it is a symptom of some sort of disease.|`|knFrwCxcaa	Aww i hope shes ok um maybe shes eat something that she shouldn't of|`|8hgrkiK5aa	ummm? don't know probaby a worm. does it have all its shots? it probably ate some cleaning supplys|`|tgCUDJEJaa	My dog once did that, i panicked too but the vet knew just what to do and managed to sort out the problem. it turned out she had caught kennel cough. your problem sounds worse though and i dont know whats wrong but taking it to the vet was definetly the best idea <br>  <br>  I think there could be many reasons or cases that your dog might have because diarrhea and throwing up are things dogs might do as the result of even just dodgy food, they have very sensitive stomachs<br>  <br>  hope your dogs ok and recovers! :)
eDySIDPQaa	We have dogs all the time that have severe reactions to various vaccines and Parvo and Distemper and Kennel Cough can cause this, on the otherhand have seen Rabies also be a problem in some dogs after the  vaccination...now Kennel cough can be given in spray up the nose or the vaccination, the spray in the nose has been posing some problems, so our vets at the shelter has stopped those and will only  vaccinate for the kennel cough now.....<br>  <br>  Vets give the boosters, because in the last several years dogs that do not have the boosters have been contracting the diseases, thus vets would prefer dogs have the boosters.....and the shots after one yr old does not linger and last 7+ years........they tend to fade off after 2 yrs...<br>  <br>  Your dog is apparently having a reactoin to the shots, get him back to the vet,,,,,,,,,signs,,,,seizures,,,,,,drool... tongue can protrude out of mouth, labored breathing, visible weakness not able to stand, all of this can last up to 10 mins per eoisode, so the dog needs to be seen now......dont wait for him to settle down, the seizures could continue, and can cause serious damage to dogs brain, lungs, and kidneys..again this could be or not be from the vaccinations, but your vet needs to see him and get treated, pls do not wait<br>  <br>  have seen this happen before at our shelter.<br>  <br>  good luck so sorry your baby got sick<br>  <br>  I have and always will get my dogs boosters vaccinations, you never know when a dog they are around had not had it's shots and your dog will contract what they have.....and this does happen|`|K2QwEM4raa	Anything is possible but I had a dog that had seizures and it had nothing to do with the shots. I just sat with her till it was over and made sure she didn't hurt herself. I know it will bother you but when she was over it in a short time she was back to her normal self. I did find that baths sometime triggered it so I would get in the tub with her to keep her calm. My husband has them to and it is best just to stay calm.|`|k6flESfNaa	you need to take him in, he could be having a reaction to the shots!|`|yh3OBqyTaa	I have a 3 pound Chihuahua and while she's never had a seizure after vaccs, she's had anaphylactic reaction and had to have emergency service. Her throat became so swollen she had trouble breathing...fortunately I'd only gotten a block or so away from the vet and went right back so it could've become a seizure. They hooked up an IV and gave her all sorts of shots, it was quite expensive.  A high temp can cause a seizure. Not all vets believe in yearly vaccinations. There are many who feel it's unnecessary. If your dog eve has another seizure not related to vaccs, you should have him checked by vet.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	most of the time if the dog is going to have a reaction to any med. or shot that is given to them it will be within hours of the administration.  and it usually is swelling and hardness of breathing.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You need to take your dog to the vet to be checked out.  The seizure may not be related to the vaccinations at all which means your dog needs treatment.  And if they are because of the vaccinations, your vet needs to know your dog had a reaction that serious and put it on your dog's record.|`|fgxajTiBaa	It is possible, uncommon but it does happen. I used to work at Petsmart and this is one of the reasons that we won't take a dog who's had a vaccine within 48 hours of the appointment.<br>  <br>  Some vets say that once your dog has had it's whole set of puppy shots and then it's boosters around one year old they don't need shots anymore and will just do titers. Some vets recommend getting all vaccines every three years. The risk of seizures is low, so it's not really a reason to not give a shot. It's more of an allergic reaction than anything.
mfXDUkRYaa	That made me laugh.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what my dog would do (she is a Staffie, not a Golden) but I hope I don't ever find out!|`|yeu09pfOaa	My boxer is .... he is about 80 lbs of pure muscle and scares the **** out of most people ....|`|ujIinLzGaa	I have German Shepherds.

muPiBQ3Uaa	I don't know about dogs for the deaf, but for  my wife's Guide dog:<br>  <br>  No barking. No jumping up on people. No potty in the house. No noses in crotches. No being underfoot all the time. No growling except at playtime. In short, you should not even know the dog is there unless it is called or is working.<br>  <br>   We have gone into many places with my wife's Guide, and it was only after we got up to leave that other folks made comments like: "Oh, I didn't even know there was a dog in here", or " It was so good, just lying there ignoring everything happening around it."  That is our definition of well behaved.|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	Basic good manners really ... housetrained ...will sit on command .. will stay down on command  ...  not constantly barking ... walks to heel on the lead ...under control and safe with people and other animals ... that`s my definition  ...|`|s9haCi64aa	Basic manners for a start...no jumping, barging through doorways, on furniture<br>  <br>  Basic obedience covered also|`|12VQ4ETcaa	They want to know how you personally discipline an animal, to make sure you're not abusive but that you can also control the dog's behavior.<br>  <br>  Personally, I expect a well-behaved dog to sit and stay on command, come when he is called, and not beg at the table.  He shouldn't jump up on people or chew anything that isn't his food or a toy.  He shouldn't growl or snap at anyone.  If he starts barking in the yard, I expect him to come when I call him and to quit barking.  I think if you make your expectations clear and you are consistent, the dog will behave well.|`|Pefb1Amfaa	no dog is the same, but basic commands.. sit come heel down, and basic manners really.. eg. house broken, not jumping up etc.|`|44278221d0b910f7e2de63fcd827b10eaa	Its straight forward. What would you class as traits of a well behaved dog? I.E. not jumping up, coming when called, good around people etc.
fFtBqFB6aa	Sometimes my Boston, Winston, pees on his leg when he goes potty. And, if we don't go inside right away, he'll clean his leg off himself. (gross, i know) <br>  Maybe he's peeing on he legs.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Do you think he might have salt on them from the streets outside?|`|54GBWTgoaa	my girl has started doing it more often, exercise him A LOT, up date his chew toys, there's a good chance he's bored, by some super size Kong's, fill one with smooth, or tubed cheese and the other with peanut butter and put them in the freezer overnight and give them to him throughout the day, buy him his fave chew toys.<br>  they love challenging games, my biggest bet is he has developed a habitual quirk down to boredom, he's beagle and collie>>two very hyper breeds who are also working breeds, do you train him, take him to a obedience and agility class and enroll him, i guarantee you if you stimulate his body and mind you can shift this! make sure he gets at least 2 hours a day of exercise, even if the first hour is him running in your back yard, then take him on a long walk or trip to the park and play fetch with him.<br>  <br>  the only problem with foot licking and chewing is that it can result in sores, my girl licked and chewed so much she made it a bit red, so each time she does it i say "TSHHHH" and push her face away. <br>  <br>  then i relised i hadn't updated her toys since christmas :S, huskies need so much stimulation and i should really update her toys every 2 weeks because she's a puppy and will demolish everthing.<br>  <br>  So from now on, exercise him more, update toys with challenges like stuuffed Kongs, teach him new tricks, he's such an intelligent breed i.e collie/beagel, he will appreciate your time and effort.<br>   when you see him licking his feet for too long say hey and push his head away, don't shout at him or punish him, but let him know it's not ideal behaivour!<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  hmmm it may very well be a nervous habbit, socialize him to new thinks and do NOT allow him to lick everthing, get treats and work him in that ver environment, so say he's in the kennel, go there with some cubed cheese and make him sit and do tricks and totally nakker him out!put him on a collar or i would suggest a pinch (which does not harm them, it calms then down and blocks the mind from nervous habbits) so just correct (gently tug the lead) him when he licks anything>> i dont let my dog lick the ground or sniff all the time!!!! and people may be on to something about the food, taste of the wild is a great food for sensitive dogs|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes it could be a sign of an allergy. Take him to the vet and get an allergy test done. You may need to change his food or give him allergy meds depending on if its a food allergy or an environmental allergy.|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	It could be an allergy, you should consult your vet.|`|yKXxtrhsaa	It could be anxiety. My chihuahua obsessively nibbles his wrists (lol) and we think it's just a nervous habit.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Could be allergies. Have you checked for hives? I'd ask his vet.|`|RqcLxDesaa	Sometimes it's simply boredom or a bad habit. There are products that taste bad that supposedly will discourage, that you can try. In my experience, it won't stop them for long. Watch that he doesn't end up with a"lick granuloma" which is when they literally lick their hair off, and the skin becomes spongy and inflamed. I would almost recomend a companion, but what could happen is that he will lick the other dog instead! I would try adjusting his enviroment, in order to change his routine.|`|xEGB2rQ9aa	the dog might have an allergy to the food that they are eating.  what you can do is go get a grain free food. like instinct. and feed it to them for a few months and see if that helps.  you might also contact your vet to see if they have any ideas as to what else you can try|`|c4f3a255325dc603efdbbc2d4be0d01eaa	He might have a cut or something on his paw. Check it out for yourself, and if you see nothing, maybe call your vet and just ask what it might be. Maybe your dog just has OCD.|`|v3Motq8Iaa	Dogs love gross stuff.  As they walk along, their paws become little culinary sponges of delight that fulfill their taste buds' every fantasy.  It's what dogs do.  Like people, some enjoy tasting stuff more than others.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	He could have yeast in them, my dog has allergies and they say this is why he does it. But sometimes excessive licking is a behavior problem.|`|vahn499Raa	my dogs do that to, its normal|`|IkCwmq0Aaa	Wow....so many great answers.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal.  #1  reason  allergies.<br>  Allergies can come from anything.  Food(corn, wheat, grains in popular common dog food), grasses, floor cleaners, etc.   <br>   Some dogs produce yeast.<br>  Yeasty ears are very common in beagles and other  heavy or long eared dogs.  Yeasty paws also can occur but not usually.   <br>  <br>  Let's take it further.  Some of these dogs with allergies feel relief with licking or scratching their<br>  offending area.   Who wouldn't?   If changing foods (it takes weeks to notice) doesn't seem to help, and behavioral modifications won't work,<br>  It may mean that the dog has passed  the <br>  instant gratification part and gone on to obsessive compulsive behavior.   What I've seen work for this is the use of Paxil for a few weeks and behavior modification.   Together they work well at controlling and stopping the behavior. It does not mean the dog has to be on this medicine forever.<br>  <br>  Just remember with this dog and all hounds-<br>  they LOVE, LOVE, LOVE yucky smelly things and paws can be lovely yucky smelly things.  <br>  Wash and dry his paws (inside the pads! and between his toes!) and try to keep his mind occupied on some other smelly thing like a nice <br>  bone.  <br>  <br>  Finally to tell you the truth it may be something that will wax and wane. He may need to take med's now and again just to break a cycle.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	It's most likely food allergies. Make sure the food that you are giving him doesn't contain Corn, Wheat or/and soy. Corn and Wheat are the number 1 cause of allergies.<br>  Licking the paws constantly, irregular scratching and hot spots are signs of allergies. <br>  <br>  Foods that contain the grains are: Science Diet, Purina, Beneful, Ol'Roy, Iams, Eukanuba, Mighty Dog, Pedigree....and anything you can get at a grocery store or walmart.<br>  <br>  Foods that DON'T have grains and that are healthier are: Wellness, California Natural, Wysong, Merrick, Taste of the Wild, Orijen, and a lot more. Just read the 1st 5 ingredients.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|QZpZsc6jaa	Keep an eye on it, it may be due to allergies or some sort of skin condition. <br>  <br>  If it's not affecting his skin or damaging anything, you may want to try the "Tobasco" method. Just like a kid who bites their nails, you put a drop or two of Tobasco hot sauce or something bitter on his paws, so he gets a bad taste when he licks them....<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, call the Dog Whisperer. : )|`|fnk27F8xaa	My bulldog likes her paws to the point they bleed sometimes. Her thing is..she has a bad ear infection and since she can't reach her inner ear, obviously, she focuses her attention somewhere else. Its actually referred to as transferred pain.<br>  She could have an allergy or just dry skin. Or, she could have something wrong somewhere else, and she is doing this to cope with it.|`|5cBbi5pJaa	There's absolutely nothing wrong with him. I have two beagles and they are both polar opposites. One of them he loves to constantly lick his paws and our other dogs ears. It's just his senses if you really don't like it get this spray called bitter apple you can get it at your local pet store. i spray it on my dogs twice a day. it doesnt harm them but he def does not like the taste and prevents him from licking.|`|wQp9Y58maa	The only thing that comes to my mind is - go to the vet. It could be a couple of things, like a wound (mentioned previously), an allergy (ditto), or maybe a cold (my dog licked his paws and other things when he had a sore throat). Only a veterinarian will know for sure.|`|UkWXO9gXaa	my dog chews himself obsessively.maybe he has a cut or something stuck in his paw.If he doesnt then i would take him to the vet,just to be sure.<br>  <br>  maybe he has fleas or some kind of itching in his paw,then he kind of scratches it with his tongue?|`|Zn6GbAgjaa	I have a beagle also and he does the same thing. I think it is a trait that they do. Or their paw itches, or they think of their mother and drinking milk from them. that is what the veterinarian said....|`|1Is7u1wUaa	Check his paws for any wounds or anything stuck in them. Other than that I don't really know what could be wrong.|`|JSFCkne8aa	I don't know but our Schnauzer does the same thing so i'll be watching the other answers.|`|hcgaizJCaa	Allergies - i give my pooch a regular Benadryl and it helps immensely.|`|qEmDZomQaa	he lciks them because he probably touched some food he liked and starts licking it or he wants to clean himself|`|ovZyUulraa	He's cleaning him self|`|Pefb1Amfaa	our dog does it when he has a prickle in his paw. check it out.|`|lKbNLrRPaa	he's obsessive compulsive.|`|qrOcWawcaa	its completly normal they jsut have a sence to keep there selfs clean dont worrie|`|pdNRDN2kaa	he's hungry. feed him more food.
SbLeCOjZaa	Don't support BYB's! Adopt a puppy from a shelter for about the same amount and it will more than likely be UTD on shots and fixed (age permitting)!|`|fgxajTiBaa	If it doesn't include any shot WAY too much. Think about it like this. A dog at my shelter costs 145 dollars, this includes ALL shots, a heartworm test, microchipping, spay/neuter, temperment test, new leash and collar and a couple other things. These people who are selling this puppy are making a profit off of their own irresponsibility to spay/neuter their dogs.<br>  <br>  Tell them you'll pay $75.00 for a rehoming fee and you want that money to go towards them altering the parents of the dogs.<br>  <br>  Otherwise look elsewhere, and honestly if you want a mixed breed, check out your local shelter, there are a MILLION lab pit mixes.<br>  <br>  Add: Caeser's Mom, would you apply that same reasoning to buying from a pet store? Yes all dogs need love and a home, but by giving them money (that they are clearly making a profit on) you are only encouraging them to do it again.|`|cETQuE9waa	$50 at most. Any more then that and I would say forget it.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Well i was going to say 50-100dollars but since you said no shots, no more then 25 because you can get a dog at shelters with all shots and is spayed and neutered for about 60 dollars.|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	That sounds like a lot, you could probably get a pure breed Labrador for that much.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Maybe $50.  It's a mutt, of a type that is destroyed daily in animal shelters because there are so many unwanted ones.|`|KKCMIE04aa	Too much for mix with no vet services, Check petfinders,com  and get exactly what you want|`|YUQgyPT3aa	You are buying from someone basically that is too lazy to get their dogs spayed / neutered. Yes, buying a pup (with no shots or worming for that matter) for that amount of money from anything other than a shelter or rescue is highway robbery, <br>  <br>  On the other hand, If you like the pup, if you want to spend the money to have shots, new puppy exam, wormer, etc...on TOP of that $200-$250 and you are willing to have that pup spayed / neutered @ six months old, go for it..<br>  <br>  Face it folks....every pup needs a home, love ain't free.|`|Bw18seFqaa	way too much.  They are mixed breeds.. a very common mix at that.  They are only worth what vet care they have recieved.<br>  <br>  You can find the SAME THING at a shelter for much cheaper, that would have at least have shots and worming...  possibly also spay/neuter and microchip|`|K2QwEM4raa	Yes it is way to much. Go to a local shelter because they have many wonderful dogs to choose from and they will be free or have a very small adoption fee because they will have had all of their shots. Don't be taken advantage of!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	If you think it's too much then don't pay it.  If it has had shots, worming and a vet check, it's not too much.  I personally wouldn't because you can get a mix at the shelter for less.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Yes that is too much, I see pure breds going for 300-400. <br>  <br>  Our shelter has that same mix for 200 adoption fee (which I feel is high, because on top of that you have to pay for spay/neauter).|`|W0ZQQK4taa	If it is from your animal shelter, go for it. If it is from a Back Yard Breeder/Puppy Mill, then NO!|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	WAY too much for a mix breed. Go to the shelter, they are full of pit mixes that will die if no one takes them!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Those are some greedy back yard breeders. No way I would spend that much on a mix breed. It would be different if it was de-wormed, up to date on shots, and all good stuff...but the fact that they're trying to sell a mutt puppy that they haven't even taken care of is very selfish, sad and greedy on their part. No no no don't get the dog. I'm not going to be like all these other people and lecture you about going to a shelter, but they are right when they say that you can spend less than that on a shelter puppy that has all his shots, vet chck, etc.<br>  <br>  Geez whats with all the thumbs down on everyone?|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Honestly i wouldn't pay for a mutt from a person that allowed their dogs to breed irresponsibly, esp. a dog that they haven't even bothered to take to a vet for first shots...that's outrageous. i would however pay an adoption fee either at a local kill shelter or a local no-kill shelter and save a dog from death row. matter of fact, i have done that and will continue to do so for as long as i have dogs.|`|AA11962013	don't breed or buy while shelter animals die!!!   OH my gosh, why would you pay that kind of money for a MUTT,  not to mention you could probably go to your local pound or shelter and adopt the same mix breed pup.  You should report the people for back yard breeding as well,  I be they don't even have a "business license" to sell dogs.  So what is the $$$ covering if these pups haven't' even had shots?? It's pure GREED on the part of those that are trying to sell mutt puppies, and you might want to check City/County ordinances in your area to see if there are any rules for owning a pit or pit mix, many cities, counties and states have them ;o(  which is unfortunate for the breed, but are a fact.  Don't Shop, ADOPT  www.petfinder.com is a great place to start looking for the perfect fur kid!|`|ufU6JTAmaa	If this puppy doesn't come with shots or any records, then yes I would say that is too much. If you're going to pay that much for a puppy you should atleast make sure it comes with a clean bill of health and records of shots that it should get when it's that young.|`|3EaFjsA8aa	NO NO NO!  don't do it.  You can get a Lab/Pit mix around every corner from a rescue group.  For that kind of money you could get a dog who has first set of shots, has been de wormed, vet checked and will probably be fixed or there will be a contract that you bring the dog back to the rescue to get fixed when it is old enough.<br>  <br>  WHY BUY WHEN SO MANY DIE??<br>  <br>  www.petfinder.com <br>  <br>  www.1-800-save-a-pet.com|`|LIOW3GBWaa	Depends. You can go to a shelter and get the same breed and it will be vet checked, shots, and an alter scheduled. If it's from a private person, then it's too much, unless it comes with what I said above.|`|oNQeg4xWaa	only purchase from a breeder or animal shelter.a responsible breeder would of gave the puppies shots and more.that is to much for a mix breed without shots.these people are only trying to make money.go to petfinders.com.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I wouldn't pay for a dog like that ... <br>  <br>  If it hasn't had it's shots, it hasn't been cared for.|`|k6flESfNaa	i wouldn't pay anything for a mutt, let alone without any shots.

NYdxGC0naa	What you need to think about is what your energy level is , how much time you have to devote to your new pet , Where you live and if its even big enough for one of these breeds . Do you have enough $$ to devote to the dog , to buy crates, Vet care or Health insurance , Can you handle an aggressive dog like an Malamute or Chow ( not saying they all are but some can get aggressive if frustrated and not exercised)?  Every breed has there standard , and even in every breed there are exceptions - Can you really pick out the dog or puppy that is right for you by its personality ?<br>  Good luck !!|`|3b5aeacf5a033dd688f9dd10dbb61115aa	Malamute, they have a better temperament.

AA10029366	I'd recommend something like an aerial run/trolley that you suspend between two trees.<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent explanation of how to set one up:<br>  <a href="http://www.unchainyourdog.org/Trolley.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unchainyourdog.org/Trolley.ht...</a><br>  <br>  As long as you are supervising him, this should work.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend dog parks...primarily because they are filthy...but also because it's still a park, and you'll still be chasing your dog trying to catch him! ;)|`|0m6BgESXaa	Have you considered setting up a trolley line, or putting him on a longline to play?  Try and find a dog park (Fenced) in the area if he's not dog aggressive?|`|CXgPkEPFaa	I use a very long rope leash for my husky
C9djEwkfaa	i have two boxers and one ate eukanuba large breed puppy and the other one ate royal canin large breed puppy when they were puppies now they both eat eukanuba boxer food ... i know a lot people will say that its crap food but that what i have given them and they are doing fine on it ...  as far as chew toys you need something hard like a kong ... something they cant destroy ....you will have soo much fun with you boxer .....i wouldnt  get any other breed of dog after having them...|`|K2QwEM4raa	Walmart has a very good one in a reddish bag. I think it is called Purina One that has lamb and rice in it and I use to use it all the time. They also have their own brand.

From most to least.!|`|VfBaveaJaa	mine will only eat kibbles and chunks, as for play toys you will have to experiment with them all. mine loves remote control cars and trucks big ones not the little ones he will turn them over and throw them across the room. he also loves to chase the cats when they allow him to.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	We feed the Boxer at my work Healthwise.

Lamb was introduced into the market for dogs that had allergies to chicken or beef.  <br>  <br>  (As a food therapy it is a "hot" energetic food and puppies do not need that extra energy or warming if inside.  That is Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine, hope it didn't confuse you.)<br>  <br>  A Boxer puppy as ALL puppies should be on a natural food.  Eukanuba is a middle of the road food, but to ensure proper development, long term health, longevity and quality of life a better food would be best.<br>  <br>  I like Innova as a good basic puppy food.  It will cost maybe a little more, but maybe not.  You puppy will eat less of it, have less stool, and get everything that she needs.<br>  <br>  Boxers have a few issues that other dogs do not have due to being a Brachycephalic or smash faced dog.  Teeth detantion, heat intolerance, and breathing concerns.<br>  <br>  So toys that are easy on teeth are good.  Personally I like a frozen carrot, Kongs, and IF you get a natural Hemp rope toy becare not to play tug.  It may pull or break teeth.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|2qVcpkF3aa	Merrick is a good brand. Wellness, Chicken Soup, Taste of the wild, California Natural, Innova, Solid Gold, Timberwolf....anything that doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy. No use of Animal fat or meat by-products.<br>  <br>  Eukanuba, Science Diet, Iams, Purina, Beneful, anything at the grocery store or Walmart are nasty foods. The contain the above. You will see a BIG difference in your puppy! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Z1irqgc9aa	i feed my boxer purina dog food most of the time and she tears it up. i usually put dry purina food in her bowl and then pour in two cans of purina chicken with gravy. she loves it.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	Nutro|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Brand is less important than keeping her on a Large breed puppy kibble. Keep doing what you are doing and don't switch to something that is all life stages or even worse a regular puppy kibble. You can switch to an ALS formula anytime after 26 weeks.<br>  I go to Good Will and buy up all of the used 50 cent stuffed toys they have at the time and run them through the washer. The dogs love them and I don't go broke watching them rip them up.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Merrick is wonderful :)
f06Sy0dfaa	If your dog is eating that is a GREAT sign, although you need to encourage her to drink more to ensure that she doesn't dehydrate. Maybe try putting something that tastes good in some water, get an eye dropper and sqeeze it into her mouth. Tilt her head up some to help get her to swallow it. I had a puppy go through the worse case of parvo ever. I took him to the vet also, though he told me he was going to die. I didn't give up on him... I did the eye dropper, and made sure he drank water, every 30 mins. or so. Eventually, he got to where he could eat. Then he was able to re-gain his strength. So, yes, your dog is getting better, just make sure she drinks more than what she is now. <br>  :) Good Luck|`|xEyyFrPhaa	take her back to the vets.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	Go back to the vet.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Just give it time.  Your puppy just went through a traumatic experience that could have taken her life.  Be patient.  As long as she is eating and drinking and having normal stools, she's doing well.  Puppies that have Parvo and are treated almost always have an immunity to catching it again.  In all the time I've worked at our Vet's office I've never heard of a dog getting it twice.  My own dog went through it as a pup and the Vet told me that she could go into a room full of Parvo pups and I wouldn't have to worry.   But if you're concerned call and ask the Vet.|`|jfbF4MOOaa	That must have been a scary experience for you.  I am glad she is eating better.  She is probably still recovering.  However, it is a little scary that she is not drinking.  She could become dehydrated very quickly if she is not getting enough to drink.  I would call my vetrinarian and ask.  They should be able to give you an answer over the phone and let you know if you need to bring her back in.  Good luck!|`|v0RsFaAzaa	This is a question you should be asking your vet about, not us! The phone call to the vet is free, so just call! They will give you all the answers you need!|`|VtOj4kYdaa	I would bring the dog to the vet, and see what progress the dog has had if any on getting better The dog needs water Good Luck!|`|PRG25iDIaa	Dehydration is of key concern with PARVO, What did the Vet say or do, this is not something you kid around with . Usually requires antibiotics and IV's. The Parvo germ itself lives for 4-6 months in the kennel area where your dog was, you need to completely disinfect.|`|jf4UOCElaa	if they gave you meds and the dog is still taking the meds may be why its normal for then to not feel good as long as the dog is drinking dont worry to much its to soon to know anything give it till monday

It can be very dangerous for your pet, or a danger to somebody that decides to try and pet your pet!|`|H7HZXTaWaa	i don't know that it is illegal, but it is wrong.  your dog would rather stay at home safe while you go grocery shopping than be really hot/cold in a car by itself.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	it depends on how long but i think if its over 5 minutes it is illegal|`|Pefb1Amfaa	i live in england.. so i dont really know... but my advice is.. if your going to leave your dog in the car check him/her every 20 /30 mins. and leave windows and water in the car... also try and provide some shade. i thnk its pretty hot over there so, dont do it unles you really have to!|`|93ix6nyvaa	It depends on the weather and the amount of time the dog is spent in a car. If it's okay weather (not too hot, nor too cold), I believe leaving him in the car for no more than a half hour should be perfectly fine. Use your best judgement.

If he is real small be very careful about a a collar and leash because you can hurt their wind pipe by pulling on the leash. I know this for sure. Hope that the parents teeth were good because some of them are prone for bad teeth. If so, you will still love it and it would just have to eat soft dog food. So take care of them the best you can, such as regular vet visits and something to chew on. Good small hard dog food, toys, treats, water dish and wee wee pads if you are not going to take him out often. A brush and lots of love and you will always have a loving friend.Soft food only as a treat or if teeth become bad.

M3jRtq2Aaa	Sometimes a dog will have diarrhea before she goes into labor.  If she is in labor, are you sure it is stool and not from her vulva?  If it is from the vulva, is blackish green, and she hasn't had any puppy for a half hour, you should see your vet.  Puppies inside the womb can loose meconium when they are in distress.  That will cause blackish discharge from the vulva.  And an infection in the uterus can also cause blackish/greenish discharge.|`|PM23RDycaa	No that's not normal.

SbLeCOjZaa	They are notoriously good with kids but are very protective of their family which may or may not cause problems with the future introduction. It will be important for the dog to see that your sister is trusting of the family and the dog will learn that this is his family, too, so try not to be stearn with your sister when she comes home.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It sounds like your sister is an adult and can handle it herself.  Unless you don't allow her to. responsibility is part of growing up.|`|0m6BgESXaa	Don't apologize for asking questions.  You can't learn if you don'[t ask.<br>  <br>  They have the nickname of the "German Shedder" xD They shed a LOT. Dealing with it? Brush the dog and vacuum. Problem...minimized *ROFL*<br>  <br>  They are prone to:<br>  Hip Dysplasia<br>  Elbow Dysplasia<br>  Pannus<br>  Pano (not serious, just growing pains)<br>  Spondylosis<br>  Megaesophagus<br>  Degenerative Myelopathy<br>  Osteosarcoma<br>  Hermangio Sarcoma<br>  Perianal Fistulas<br>  <br>  and the list goes on, and on, and on....<br>  <br>  GSDs come in many different lines, sizes, and colors. The GSD is BY FAR the most diversified (and divided) breed of dog between lines AND people.<br>  <br>  There are East German working lines (I Plan on getting one from Eurosport K9), American Showlines, West German Showlines, West German Working lines, and Czech lines (also working).<br>  <br>  The GSD is not a dog for the faint of heart, no matter what line you get. You will also find people are extremely divided on the correct temperament of the GSD (most often leaning towards the Am line dog as most incorrect).<br>  <br>  These dogs require a lot of training, exercise, and dedication, and are not for the average dog owner who wants a Golden Retriever type animal.<br>  <br>  These dogs are fiercely loyal, BUT they are still no Golden. If you want a happy go lucky dog that willingly leans on everybody and immediately says "Hi!" to strangers, the GSD is not for you. They are supposed to be aloof to strangers, which most people think means unfriendly. That's not true. Aloof means when a stranger asks if they can pet your dog, and you say ok, the dog isn't going to give a whit, because the stranger doesn't own them. If you can't deal with people asking you why your dog "isn't friendly" a GSD is not for you.<br>  <br>  If you can't deal with a vocal dog, a GSD is NOT for you. I always tell people who are looking at shepherds for a pet "It is not a matter of whether or not a Shepherd talks, it's how much." Every GSD I have EVER known WILL talk in some capacity! My Old Man only talks when he feels something needed to be said. Strauss lets me know what's going on every single second of his life[8|]<br>  <br>  The GSD as a whole is a serious dog. They do have a good sense of humor, within their own family unit, but overall the picture presented is a steadfast, noble animal. They like to play, but again, are not the happy tail wagging nutso Labrador, and they WILL give the look of "Why are you being such a tard?" if they feel you're doing something beneath them<br>  <br>  Great with children, especially if raised with them. Naturally wary of strangers, one does not need to panic when their Shepherd meets a new person, but be aware of their temperament, and explain to those who wish to pet that when the dog shows disinterest, he is not unfriendly, he just simply does not care. If the stranger is not their human and they are not a threat, the dog feels no reason to show interest. The GSD is supposed to be an aloof animal, and any dog that is too friendly, too fearful, or too aggressive, is faulted in temperament. However, I will take the dog that is too friendly over the last two.<br>  <br>  I own/show dogs of every style but working (I don't have the room or money for one right now, or I'd sure have one xD).<br>  <br>  Socialization is also important, and because of the natural temperament of the breed is to be indifferent, there is no such thing as too much socialization. You should expose them to anything and everything (even though you will run into things you NEVER thought of....my Strauss is afraid of people in costumes if he can't see the face).<br>  <br>  This is a breed that loves to learn, and they are incredibly easy to shape and teach because of their willingness to please. Highly biddable and multifunctional, there is no better breed, in my opinion.|`|SnAsZapMaa	[wildfyre]:<br>  Although much of what you said can be true, I down-thumbed you for using the word "prone". That's like saying that humans are prone to broken legs and bankruptcy and nose-bleeds. In all my years I have had just one pup that might have had achalasia (which leads to mega-oesophaus) and he was put down. My last case of HD was born in 1983 and was not planned by ME - a 4 month pup was allowed to run unsupervised with his dam because he was too small to reach her "target" and anyway he was too young to be fertile - yeah, right! And so on. Genuine breeders provide guarantees - but they can't afford to do that if they haven't reduced the genetic risk to absolute minimum. I guarantee my breeding/show-quality pups to gain at least BS.Cl.2 provided the owner does the appropriate training.<br>  <br>  However, almost any pooch from a rescue situation is an unknown quantity, genetically. People who accept a rescue dog get a marvellously low-cost pet but have to accept that there will be work needed, and sometimes that will involve horrendous vet bills.<br>  <br>  [ridingis...]<br>  Your sister did not buy a German Shephard. Yahoo's spell-checker told you that there is no such thing.<br>  <br>  You are crying over spilt milk.<br>  You have less "say" in the future of your sister's pet than you do in who your sister chooses to marry or shack-up with (if she chooses to do either).<br>  The pup is your SISTER's dog, not yours, not your father's, and it is up to HER to house it and train it and feed it and give it the booster shot at 16 weeks old, plus rabies shots every 3 years if that is a requirement in her area, plus constant heartworm treatment if she is in a heartworm area. It should already have been given the 8 weeks and 12 weeks shots, & neutered, if she  got it from a genuine rescue group/shelter, although 12 weeks is FAR too early for neutering and can lead to deformed bones and other problems - see <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/links/Neutering_001198315291/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a> - but neutering BEFORE sale is the only way that rescue groups can make sure that the pup can't be used as a puppy factory.<br>  <br>  It will be your parents' decision as to whether they allow your sister to bring a dog with her, and it will be her decision as to whether she wants to come back to live there.<br>  If your sister is sensible, the junior GSD she has in 12 months' time will be well behaved and under control, a far cry from the impetuous baby it is at present.<br>  If your sister isn't sensible and her pet is unruly in 12 months' time, your parents will have to issue an ultimatum THEN, not NOW.<br>  <br>  It is your SISTER's dog, and while it remains HER dog it lives where SHE does.<br>  I cannot predict anything about a shelter dog, not even that it has the correct breed name - one of my acquaintances fosters for the SPCA, and among what she has looked after and put some training into is an alleged GSD that looked reMARKably like a Dachshund....<br>  <br>  A GSD pup can learn in one day where it is allowed to go toilet (but idiots who prefer "crate training" can need 8+months to reach that stage) and which rooms it is allowed to go into, which are forbidden to it. An adult GSD can be friends to everyone except the bastards who have a reputation for mistreating horses or women or children (don't ask me how they can tell, but they can) or they can hate everyone except their owner; they can play delightfully with other dogs or they can kill them - everything is a combination of genetics and up-bringing. We have no idea as to the genetics of your sister's pet. We have no idea as to how well or poorly your sister will raise her pet.<br>  Que sera, sera. (What will be, will be.)<br>  <br>  I have had a brood smash through a window to attack the kennel-mate who was "auntie"-ing the litter while a couple of neighbouring children were playing with the pups. The children were never in any peril, although the 3 year old THOUGHT she was. I grabbed the dam and dragged her to her pen, then the 6 year old brought the "auntie" down for me. On the other hand, that dam bit the person who quietly opened the side gate to reach the open door then knocked on it while she & I were snoozing in the early afternoon heat. It was only a glancing bite, as she realised at the last microsecond that she KNEW the caller (although not well), but even a glancing bite inflicts considerable damage when delivered by a fast dog. GSDs are VERY territorial, and very strong on pack-order/status.<br>  I've had an everyone's-friend show-winner throw himself off the 8-9 foot high top terrace to chase a chap who'd let himself in through that side gate - he hit the gate so hard that the whole house shook. But when WE came out and opened the gate he took our word for it that the visitor was okay. (Later events proved that the chap WASN'T okay...)<br>  <br>  Any dog can turn on its owner -  but is your sister the cruel sort who would provoke a dog to turn on her? The only times any of my dogs have bitten me have been in a 3-on-1 fight situation where the 1|`|ZQS2Q6cXaa	your going to run into bonding problems, GSD's are very bonded to their owners, and very protective of them. if this dog decides your sister is its master for good, it will be upset with departing from her, but it will also not enjoy sharing the house with another dog, or being limited, its a tough call but the best bet is for it to live with you.good around kids and protective of them, and your sister should start really trying to help him understand that people are the owners, the masters, and we chose the dogs limits. its not easy to do, but has to be done.

The way you originally asked the question made it sound like you were planning on doing something irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Didn't your vet give you advice for helping your dog to gain weight?  Trying to get your dog to very quickly gain weight could be dangerous. It's best for your dog to gain weight at a steady, reasonable pace.|`|GKZPxAaPaa	Feed your dog carbs along with meat. Don't do a grain-free diet. Give your dog healthy kibble that has good grains, and add some good human-grade canned food. Dogs usually love the canned food.

Otherwise it is likely the dog would continue wanting the unhealthy treats and you could end up with an obese dog.  They do make dog foods that are higher in fat and protein content.  They even make a canned food that most vets sell in their office.

Most processed foods contain a lot of water and crap that are of no nutritional benefit.<br>  <br>  Things like chicken wings and meaty bones are good and help keep the dog's teeth clean. Other foods you can give are raw salmon (rich in omega 3) and things like chopped ox heart, liver and meat. I'm not sure what products are available where you are but also look for raw meat rolls. These are good because they are just meat and have added nutrients like sea weed and vitamins and minerals. Raw eggs and their shells are also good. It's just a matter of what your dog will eat.<br>  <br>  As for dogs and raw foods. Dog's evolved from wolves and what do they eat?

Just sit with your son and make sure if he is holding his puppy he is sitting down.. I think puppys do an amazing thing for toddlers.. and vice versa.. But i guess thats just my personal opinion..

I7DfD8kyaa	Check with the breeder, there may be other puppies that have the same neurological issues. Our Maltipoo came from yourtinypuppy.com and has been diagnosed with Distemper. A urine test can tell you if she's been exposed to Distemper. Some puppies can live with it for a while anyway, some don't last long. Stress does make the seizures or convulsions worse. Liver shunts can also cause seizure-behavior. A blood panal and liver bile test will tell you. I wish you the best, if you bought the pup from Bianca Suwanasung in San Antonio TX then definately have some tests done!!!

P0Fjh59Eaa	Has he been neutered? <br>  <br>  this could be a major issue, prostate problem or something. i would leave him alone and get him to a vet ASAP.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sorry I can't think of anything. Call the vet for advise
ZT0K3q2Aaa	Heres a video recording the bite forces of the rottweiler, german shepherd, and the American Pitbull Terrier<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbwMs7cjK0Y&feature=PlayList&p=914B7D54E87954A5&playnext=1&index=37" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbwMs7cjK...</a><br>  <br>  The rottweiler had the highest|`|yVlYuxPVaa	They have a high bite force, but when playing they know exactly when to stop before you get hurt. It is amazing!|`|GpiRaSvPaa	As the first answer says, I was going to tell you that I had read about a test done on an APBT, a GSD and a Rottie where the Rottie had the highest bite force of the 3 and the APBT had the least. However, there is no way to tell you an exact bite force for ANY breed. Every single dog is different, even dogs of the same breed. Not to mention, even when a dog is tested, it's hard to come up with an exact bite force simply because a dog could bite with a different amount of pressure for each bite.

0m6BgESXaa	DEFINITELY too young for a toy breed!<br>  <br>  I would feel comfortable spaying a toy at 8 or 9 months, but would prefer to wait until at least a year.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Lots of shelter dogs are spayed/neutered at 8 weeks, I don't feel that 13 weeks old was THAT young to be spayed. Most vets around the country say around 6 months that way they have some time to grow, but don't generally hit their first heat.<br>  <br>  You might want to question more of the competence of the vet who was doing the spay, accidents do happen, but spays and neuters are very routine procedures with limited risk.|`|p7swtBYzaa	4 months would be the earliest, 6 months more likely.<br>  Why was it done so soon?|`|AA11244754	Those vets and clinics suck!  Don't ever take another dog to one again!  They rip people off and give unneccessary shots that a dog doesn't need just to jip you!  They probably f8cked up with the gas that they put the puppy under with or didn't oxygenate correctly.  I would NEVER take a dog of mine to one of those places!  I hope you took the puppy's body to a completely different vet clinic for the necropsy because they are going to cover their @sses if you are letting them do it!  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/showReview.cgi?id=39306" rel="nofollow">http://www.my3cents.com/showReview.cgi?i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/banfield-c104617.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaint...</a><br>  <a href="http://denver.citysearch.com/review/37189888?brand=yellowbot_nm" rel="nofollow">http://denver.citysearch.com/review/3718...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722499188" rel="nofollow">http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3722499188</a>|`|Z9eH58d7aa	I think for a dog that is only 3lbs that they should have had you wait until she was at least six months old. I feel so bad for you and can imagine how you feel. The vet should not have spayed such a tiny dog at so young.|`|AA10400143	WOW! that is young. My vet will not spay until at least 6 months and recommend to wait longer for small dogs. Sorry to hear of your loss:(|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Between 4-6 months. Most vets won't spay anything younger unless it weighs more than 4lbs.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	13 weeks is a bit young.  Typically they're only done at that age by humane societies that need to find the animals homes asap.  At my vet clinic, we typically tell people to wait until the animal is 5-6 months old.  For small breed dogs (like shih tzus) we see a lot of retained baby teeth, so we try to encourage people to wait untill 6-7 months of age to spay them so we don't have to do a second surgery if all of the baby teeth don't fall out.  It is very difficult to maintain anesthesia on a 3 pound patient.<br>  <br>  I am very sorry for your loss.  I do think that banfield should have atleast discussed with you the reasons for spaying at such an early age and the associated risks.  That is really sad - breaks my heart.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best...
LfZk2NGBaa	If you live in an apartment I would say neither. But if I had to pick it would be the bulldog. Bostons need a lot of room.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	English Bull dog will do just fine in an apartment there pretty lazy dogs.

I have a dog like a terrier, and they dont need that much a yard. But if u got a Jack Russel dog, then those r high energy.|`|jjO3KPjgaa	English Bulldog would be best in an apartment because lots of excercise is not necessary but if you are looking for high energy a Boston Terrier is great.
56a572fde5f78c1444702e92a41b54faaa	KLMcats is correct:  tuna is one of the worst allergens known for cats.  It even tops grains/glutens on the "do not consume" list.<br>  <br>  The oil probably did make your cat vomit--oil coating the food, it more or less slid right back up.<br>  <br>  Remember:  no fish, no milk.  Keep an eye on kitty, but s/he should be fine.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Fish is an allergen. Some cats simply cannot tolerate it in any way shape or form.<br>  <br>  I have had cats that if it went in one end it promptly squirted out the other end.<br>  <br>  I had one nursing mother cat that my kids gave a can to lick out just the juices... she got so sick she lost all her kittens.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Most likely. If it was a can of tuna meant for humans, they add so much extra salt into that and it can make cats sick. Also the type of oil used may have been a major factor.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	yep. next time get the tuna with water.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Probably. Try tuna in water and give him the water. The oil can be too rich for his stomach.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Very possible. Any abrupt change in your cats diet can cause stomach upset.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, tuna is NOT good for cats. The vegetable oil in tuna is polysaturated fat, which is too difficult for a cat to metabolize. Tuna is also high in mineral salts that can form bladder stones. It also robs the cat's body of vitamin E. If enough of this vitamin is depleted the cat becomes at risk of developing a painful condition called "steatitis." This condition causes the fat in a cat's body to become hard. The first visual signs include a greasy, dull coat. The lumps of fat begin to develop under the skin. As the condition progresses the cat becomes extremely sensitive to being touched and movement is painful. A cat who becomes a "tuna junkie" will eventually refuse to eat anything else. It's not unusual for tuna-addicted cats to become nervous or aggressive.
9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Yeah they get lost but not sure if they get sad because  they are babies. However kittens and puppies cry for their parents. <br>  <br>   It's the parents who get really upset. I have seen this all the time. There are also cases of parents getting so depressed they pluck out all their feathers.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	If I was a baby finch I would miss my mom...|`|ZBK8IbxEaa	well i know with cockatiels atleast, sometimes the mother will sort of freak out because she can't find her babies, and the babies might call for her a little bit... but they get over it in about a day or two, seeing as birds have small attention spans
yMbw0Osnaa	if they are eating by themselves and fully feathered then yes they are old enough to be sold
gonBJhGNaa	There are definitely more non-venomous snakes than venomous. According to the site linked to in the source, there are 2500-3000 species of snake worldwide and only about 500 of these are venomous. Do the math and that is a 1:5 to 1:6 ratio of venomous snakes to non-venomous snakes; or about 17% to 20% venomous snakes.<br>  <br>  Also, careful not use "venomous" interchangeably with "poisonous" - the two terms are not the same. Venomous refers to an organism that injects poison. Poisonous refers to an organism that poisons through touch or ingestion. Snakes are nearly always venomous, not poisonous.|`|e7773rspaa	The true answer to this is much more complicated than you would expect.  Venom is a basal novel characteristic that formed before the current snakes radiated.  The evolution of venom delivery devices led to the snakes most people consider "venomous."  See the link below for more details.<br>  <br>  As for poisonous snakes, there aren't too many.  I've only heard of one... the Natricine Snake of Japan.
