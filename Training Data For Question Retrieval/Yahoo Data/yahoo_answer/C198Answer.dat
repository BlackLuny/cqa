7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	I remember thinking this very thing myself when my daughter was this age.<br>  <br>  The thing is, babies find their own rhythm and you just have to go with the flow. You'll know when he wants to move from feeding every hour to three meals a day with snacks for example, because he will tell you he is hungry.<br>  <br>  Please don't stress about time tables too much. People love to give you advice and tell you at what age their baby was eating solids/ drinking 10oz bottles/ sleeping through the night, but let's remember, every one is different.<br>  <br>  My daughter didn't have any solid food til almost her 1st birthday. I didn't really plan it like that, but she was sleeping well, gaining weight and very healthy, so the health visitor said not to force her.<br>  <br>  Your baby will set the routine, you will be fine<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x|`|vue9NOhYaa	Dont' expect any sort of routine for your baby. At this age he still needs to be fed on demand, and allowed to sleep when he's tired. <br>  <br>  You don't need a routine to go out.  Little babies are very portable, and dont' really care where they are.  When you want to go out, go. When baby is hungry, you nurse him.  Or, if you're formula feeding, toss a bottle in the diaper bag and go out. When he's hungry, offer the bottle.  If he gets tired, he'll sleep in the carriage or sling or carseat. <br>  <br>  You do NEED to get out.  Being housebound with a baby for months isn't healthy for either of you.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	sit down and write down all the hours of day and night, like a chart,(schedule) and put exactly in the chart what you would like to have done,reasonable times and time to get each thing done. then, follow by it every day, eventually it will be your routine. good luck.|`|iwtetdBoaa	at this age there is not much of a routine they sleep & wake when they want too-   by 3 months he should have a routine  congrats on ur little boy <br>  <br>  pround mom to a  2 week 2 day baby girl :)<br>  3 & half year old little girl :)<br>  and my sweet baby boy who is 13 months old ;)<br>  <br>  enjoy ur little one  it goes so fast :)  my daughter is almost 4 and it seems she was just born|`|SFMwVJojaa	I've got 4 children and there will always be good days and bad days, but what i would do is this....<br>  About 7 am start your day with a feed, if he fed after 5 though i'd perhaps go to 7.30. Then every 3  - 4 hrs feed again, dont wait for him to ask. feed at 10 - 10.30 pm regardless of when last one was and go to bed. Over a few days he'll get used to eating in day and sleeping at night and you'll know when to schedule feeds so going out will be easier. from memory i think he'd feedind at about 7 am, 10.30am, 2-2.30pm, 6pm and 10pm, then whenever he wakes in night, prob just once though.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Congratulations on your little boy.<br>  There is still plenty of time to get into a routine, for me I'm still learning a routine that works for me and my baby is 12 months old!  When she was a newborn I didn't know what day it was half the time.<br>  A newborn will sleep for most of the time so enjoy this time and get plenty of rest yourself.  You will find your own routine with regards to feeding, changing and bathing and I think sleeping is the hardest thing to get into a routine with because babies sleep patterns change all the time like when they are having growth spurts for instance.<br>  There are plenty of baby groups you could get involved with, it is good for baby and good for mums to meet others too.<br>  www.netmums.com<br>  type in your postcode and have a look what's on in your area.<br>  You could look into breast feeding support<br>  baby massage<br>  play centres<br>  <br>  Good luck
bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Aerobic exercise at least three times a week, along with strength training and a healthy diet.  That's how you lose weight and get healthy.  The milk that you are pumping may not have a lot of fat in it because the pump isn't as effective at draining your breasts as your baby is.  As a rule, the hind milk is always fattier, and a pump just won't drain as much of it as your baby does.<br>  <br>  You need to look into your life style as well if you aren't losing weight.<br>  <br>  It is not a myth that breastfeeding helps you lose weight- I cannot keep fat on while I am nursing, and neither could my mother.  However, everyone's metabolism is different, and your life style can hinder the weight loss.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	Well, first off, as a breastfeeding mother, I breastfed two.  I will tell you, the whole lose the weight faster when you breastfeed is a myth.  Some women do, some don't.  Your body stores fat easier when you are breastfeeding just like it does when you are pregnant.  You lose 500 calories a day, but you also should consume an extra 500 calories.  Most women don't lose those extra five pounds until they wean the baby.  Pumping your breast this much is only going to make it harder for you to wean.  You need to gradually cut back one a day until you are down to what your baby needs.(What your body naturally wants to produce.)  If not, you should really go to your local hospital and see if they accept donated breast milk for premies.  They won't take what you already pumped out but they might screen you to see if you qualify to do this.  Then you'd be helping other babies.|`|AA11047310	It's a myth that it helps the weight drop off. But the befeneits are sooooooo vast for you and your baby that you should take great pride in breastfeeding your baby anyway, forget the weight loss :-)|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I pump my breasts also in hopes of losing my beer belly. <br>  <br>  Hey wait if you drink enough beer your milk will be beer flavored and then you can breastfeed drunks at the bar and get paid for the milk.|`|uu9lGT1waa	WOW. Conceiving and having a child are a blessing and all your worried about is loosing weight. I'm not surprised that there are women out there like you. I'm really trying not to be mean, but come one now. Don't be selfish.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Pumping and storing milks great, but no need to do more then your baby needs or uses at this point, unless you think you may want to donate milk to a milk bank (that would be wonderful if you could.)  <br>  <br>  To loose weight, why not spending a little less time pumping and a little more working out.  There are a lot of wonderful post partum workout videos that help tone that trouble areas.  Also, try taking your baby out for walks, your baby will enjoy the fresh air and you will also get some exercise while bonding with baby.|`|pXSKSS3daa	See your/a doctor. That's certainly not healthy.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding doesn't necessarily make you lose weight. It may help SOME but you also need to be making a conscious effort yourself.

hUbNKOTsaa	well this is what Oprah told a parent to do for a kid that steals like that:<br>  <br>  take EVERYTHING from the kids room except a mattress and blanket and 7 days worth of clothes (even the bed frame) and put it in a storage unit or at a family members or friends house, just not your own house or a house she goes to often, so she cant steal it. she has to go one week with out stealing to get ONE item back. If she steals one thing, you start at square one.eveything leaves. <br>  <br>  she stays in her room at all times when she is home. you do nothing fun and she goes to no friends house and you dont leave her at home by herself or with a babysitter. she is with you or your husband at all times unless she is at school. she goes to school and does her homework, showers and eats 3 meals a day( no dessert and no snacks, they are extras that you dont need to have) other wise she is in her room, with nothing to do. when she starts earning her stuff back, you start with the most boring stuff and stuff that she needs. start with clothes and furniture, since she cant do anything fun with that stuff. to get the fun stuff back, she has to go a long time eithout stealing. work her way up to the fun stuff. she cannot go to the mall, movies, friends house whatever t=until she gets everything back. once she steals, everything is taken away again. she gets no new things until she has all her old stuff back, except for her b-day and Christmas, but those go to the storage place and she gets them last. she will be so bored she will most likely get so bored and will stop stealing so she has something to do. and it will take a lot of time for her to get something fun to do. keep this up until she stops stealing. <br>  <br>  before you start this, make her spend a week in the juvenile detention center so she knows what is like if she keeps it up. I know this sounds cruel, but it worked for the boy on Oprah.|`|g8WQKTNTaa	Get a cop to handcuff her and ride in a cop it was scary when i did it ask the cop to tell her about the things that will happen if she keep on stealing things.

I feel sooo bad for you!!<br>  good luck|`|yKS2UI87aa	Call your local Sheriff/Police they should have something called Scared straight, I would explain why and see if they can include her (it's usu for older teens). You could also put her on a program called PINS call your local Probation office, it is for younger at risk kids. Good Luck my friend's daughter is 4 1/2 with the same problem and her mom, step-dad, and I have all talked to her saying wrong, get arrested etc to no avail. However, my friend isn't big on follow through your grounded for 2 weeks means one day.|`|G8b2gpmPaa	Oh you poor thing! You must be at your wits end! My son used to steal from his school all the time and I was so embarrassed. If I were YOU, I would absoluely talk to a Social Worker. There is something going on here and I totally think they can help. What can it hurt? I wish there was something I can do for you.|`|Ci1WJK8maa	Sounds like the root of her issue is discontentment with the things she has.  If she really was thankful for what she has and was not always wanting what other people have then maybe she would stop.  Start focusing on how to make her appreciate what she has.  Stress thankfulness, show her how much better off she is than other kids.  You also need to model this behavior yourself.  Make sure you are not drooling over things you would like, but cannot afford.  Don't use credit cards for things you really cannot afford.<br>  <br>  Just some ideas.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	send her to a psychiatrist!|`|vTvsgVJiaa	It's time for tough love.  Grounding is great for the first time, but she is out of hand now.  I agree with the other answer, get her to spend a night in Juvie.  While she's there, "steal" all her favorite things to make her know what it feels like to lose something you love because someone else took it.  When she proves she can be trusted then she can slowly earn her stuff back.  I would also make her empty her pockets and backpack every day when she gets home until she learns how terrible it is that her own mother doesn't trust her because of her actions.  Also, talk to her about trust and how badly it hurts you that you can't trust your own daughter.  Start locking your room too and don't leave her unattended at her grandparent's house.  Eventually she's going to learn that a lack of trust isn't worth stealing.  It sounds mean but that's what you have to do if you want it to stop.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	If this is a serious question I would send her to a therapist. She is clearly exibiting dangerous behaviour-if she continues, she will end up stealing from stores.<br>  <br>  Figure out why she does this.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	stealing can be an addiction that she cannot control on her own.  You may want to seek therapy for her.|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	'You need to be consistent in your punishments.  Spank her much harder and longer when she steals.  Make it very clear before and after why she is being spanked and that she will get another spanking if she steals again and then spank her when she does.  She needs to understand the consequences before they happen and the consequences need to be bad enough that she will really not want them to happen.  Make her spankings unpleasant enough for her that she will NEVER risk getting more.<br>  <br>  Don't stop at spanking though.  When she steals spank her AND ground her, AND take away everything that she likes to do for a week.  If she steals again before the week is out, double the length of time before she can do what she likes to do again and spank her again, but much more soundly than the first time.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Try this:<br>  Break out the dictionary<br>  FOR EACH item she has that is NOT hers she "gets" to write down 100 words from the dictionary and DEFINE them.<br>  Before you take this step just let her know what the consequences are.<br>  You've taken "all" the steps I would have taken if I were in your situation. There's only ONE option I see at this point. (she's only 8)<br>  Get a CLEAR PLASTIC backpack and that is ALL she can take to and from school. BEFORE you let her out of the house you make her empty her pockets, check shoes before leaving, and check the contents of her backpack. UPON returning home..the same thing. <br>  I know it sounds horrible..but she knows you are serious, but she needs to be treated as though you can NOT trust her AT ALL. (which I'm sure you don't and that breaks your heart)<br>  Now IF (and I pray you don't) you find something that doesn't belong to her then you must assume she stole it.<br>  Final note: Have you asked her 'why' she steals things?<br>  Personally..I would REMOVE 'everything' from her room except for her BED and it would be a mattress on the floor! I also know that that sounds harsh but you as a parent MUST take drastic measures at this point. YOU are the one looking out for her and her future.<br>  I'll pray for you..it must be horrible. <br>  You sound like a great mom.

AA12145826	I'm not sure if its right or wrong, its just how you're both wired to work. In your case, you nurture ("Honey are you okay? Here's a towel."). In your husband's case, he fixes things (there's the problem, here's the solution type stuff). I wouldn't say that you are being too soft and he's being to hard on your son, you each parent in a different way. Personally, I think that I react with a bit of both you and your husband. My first reaction is "are you okay?" and then my next reaction is "you need to be more careful next time."|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son will not be watching where he is going and will run into the wall too. I tell him to be careful and watch where he's going. I don't jump up and say are you okay because when I make a big deal out of it it makes him cry. So, I just tell him in a nice voice to be more careful so he doesn't do it again. He's not getting into trouble when I tell him this, I am just letting him know that if he is careful he can avoid things like running into the wall.|`|um29wkUPaa	Oh my gosh I do exactly that.  "Watch where you're going."  Now that you're pointing it out to me, I'm sitting here laughing... As if he walked into the wall on purpose, or couldn't conclude without my help to watch where he's going.  <br>  <br>  Thank you.  As I always say, there's plenty left for me to learn.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	My hubby's kinda like that.  I will make sure he's ok and then tell him to be careful.  If he spills something, he's not really old enough to do anything about it, he's 20 months.  And he does make a mess!|`|jHH3G56Jaa	I agree with your husband|`|AA11481889	I think that it depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  If the child is being careless and screwing around and you know he isn't hurt...then I think the lesson of being aware of your surroundings is a HUGE and IMPORTANT lesson to learn...<br>  Being aware of your surroundings can be the difference between surviving an accident and not.<br>  <br>  But, if the child is honestly hurt, and you can always tell if they are actually hurt, then of course tending to the injury takes precedence over tending to the carpet.<br>  <br>  It just depends...If it was an honest accident...then yes "are you ok" is in order...but honestly...I'm one that would probably say "Oh baby did you get an ouchie?? You need to watch where you're going, buddy"...<br>  <br>  We all have accidents true...but sometimes accidents can be avoided..so arming kids with a little more self awareness and accountability...can never be a bad thing...<br>  <br>  You don't want to be downright accusatory, but letting the child know that they can avoid accidents in the future by being careful is a good thing I think....<br>  <br>  But like anything else...I think it's a fine line...I think telling a child, to be careful, or to watch where they're going is ok...but "Why did you do that" I think is a little too accusatory for my tastes...|`|FHT6wsUpaa	I guess at the age of 4, a child *should* be learning to be more careful about where he's going and what he's doing. But, constantly reminding him that he's done something wrong could backfire as well: I don't know the whole story, but your husband could be setting him up for self-esteem issues. My dad was like that when we were kids...except to an extreme. He pretty much never talked to me unless he wanted to tell me I was doing something wrong. These days I barely speak to him. He's just too full of criticism.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could encourage your husband to say something like "you did a great job of cleaning that up" when your son helps to clean up the mess he made, if he insists on pointing out his clumsiness every time. He needs to hear that from your husband, not just you, to understand that daddy doesn't always give negative feedback. I do understand your husband wants your son to learn responsibility and achieve a certain level of caution and awareness, but I totally understand why you're concerned. I'm not taking either side here...I think it's something you need to try work together on. Good luck.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well i can see both sides of that argument.  i have said to my daughter - please be careful with that.  then when she runs into her brother its - what did i JUST say? so usually i have a precursor.  now if she hurts herself and is upset, the first reaction is comfort then we talk about what happened.<br>  could you use his methods on him?  do you think that would be useful?<br>  i know w/my husband he has a tendency to be "harder" on our son.  wants him to be a man.  okay the kid is 18 mos old.  hello!  what i finally said to him - look when you do that, i am going to end up overcompensating him and that is going to end up accomplishing the exact opposite of what you want.  and then i point out one of my relatives who have already fulfilled that prophecy.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree with both as some said if it was pure carelessness on purpose or them goofing up.I would say watch where your going or watch what your doing I would also tell them to stop playing around like that.If it was by accident I would say ops watch it you silly boy.If they bumped into something I would say are you ok?If it was a spill I would say the same as you ops grab something to clean it up.|`|SrSfZJTKaa	Have you noticed that nothing makes a child more likely to spill something as saying to them "be careful with that drink" The minute those words come out of your mouth their nerve goes and you can guarantee the drink will be spilled. There is a fine line between accidents and carelessness, if a child has a genuine accident though I think it seems a bit mean and counter productive to reprimand the child.|`|BNDRPYlRaa	I have no kids.But I do the same as blank.and make sure my nieces/nephews are ok.|`|OaOf4oxQaa	Look, I think you shouldn't be arguing with your husband at all. Not even in front of the child, not that he does you didn't specify. But I think that as long as he is not abusive verbally or physically it wouldn't hurt the child. In fact, it will keep him alert. It's okay for kids to bump and fall they are growing up. We adults are there to modify the way they grow up. You don't want an insecure teenager later in life, or confused. But you want him to know that daddy has his way of teaching him to grow up and mommy too. You and your husband should just make an agreement as to how you want that child to grow up. Remember we as parents have control over that child for few years, you don't want to loose him and make him think later on that "mommy and daddy are going to get in an argument if I do this, mommy will defend me". If you think your husband is being unfair let him know. I don't think its bad to tell your kid to watch where they are going. What is bad is how you tell it to them, with what tone of voice. Don't make him feel clumsy, and if you do, well let ur husband know he is being too hard, that he is right but to approach him in a different manner as to not hurt the child's self-esteem.|`|UrWzdIsDaa	See the world from your child's point of view.<br>  They know no fear, may be too young to make the intellectual link between cause and action, and in any case have the attention of a gnat, so by the time you get to them, they have moved on.<br>  With our kids we tended to respond by making things fun and encouraging them all the time  "Oh dear, look what's happened to YOU, you fell down, BUMP!" followed by loving (but often futile) instructions and corrections.  But they don't hear your words and learn more from copying actions than interpreting your instructions. That's why kindergaden/playschool is so important - they see elder peers and learn to be like them much more quickly than you can teach them. <br>  There comes an age when they will become more aware of their own actions, but don't expect it in all 4 years olds, or for all events.    In the meantime, remember to reward and praise when they get it right, turn learning what to do into games.  This is how they learn every other basic action.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Depends on how old the child is.<br>  Children of ALL ages at times spill, or have different types of accidents. Hey and this includes adults as well.<br>  I remember when my oldest was 10 and spill ed a bottle of model paint all over the kitchen floor and the surrounding carpet, which was only two weeks old. <br>  My hubby was quite annoyed at the time, but we all pitched in to clean the mess up and in the end we all laughed about it.<br>  Since that time with 4 boys here, different things happen. What we usually say now   ( oh are you having a bad day like I had yesterday or what ever day it was, go get the paper towel and I will help you clean it up) and proceed to clean up the mess or what ever. Then its the end of subject. Children normally do not do these things on purpose, just the same as adults. Things happen and will continue to happen. We as parents need to be careful and try and not leave things, that  younger children can get into them.<br>  My sister was painting her 2 year old's room and the phone rang in the kitchen.<br>  When she came back he had got the paint roller and painted the door, windows, bedding and carpet. She was a new mom at the time and is learning still. <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|cAtWxJG1aa	well, i'll take your side.  if a child bumps into something or spills milk, the lesson is the bump or cleaning the spill or not having the milk anymore.  telling them to be more careful is just redundant.  if they're older than 2 or so, they certainly get that the bump or spill happened because they weren't careful.  it's when the child is doing something dangerous or careless and by sheer luck nothing bad happens that the parent should step in and tell them to be more careful.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I agree with you. Kids crash, break, spill make mistakes and have accidents all the time. Adults do the same. What is your child going to think when daddy makes a mistake? I teach if them to grab the towel so to speak. No ones perfect its what you do after that makes a difference.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Your both right!  Although I wouldn't say "Watch where your going!",  I would say "Are you okay?  Next time you should be more careful".|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends on what they're doing and how bad it is. Like the other day, I was sitting at my desk and my daughter (2 1/2) came up and bonked her head on the corner of the desk. I thought she'd gotten herself in the eye, so I was really concerned. But with my son, I will often 'assess the damage' LOL and as long as he's not seriously hurt will caution him to watch where he's going. But not in a mean way. Sometimes he's just off on his own little planet, I think. <br>  <br>  I must admit, though, the baby (who isn't really a baby anymore! :( will often get more sympathy from me just because she's a girl (I know, I'm horrible) and so darned little. However, when my son is running around for half an hour even though I've been telling him to stop, I refuse to feel sorry for him when he whacks into the doorknob. They're both tough kids - I think having an older brother really toughens my daughter up because she rarely cries when she falls, etc. But if they've been warned previously and continue to do something they're not supposed to, I don't coddle them, that's for sure. LOL|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I am more like your husband, I guess.  I do tell my kids to "Watch what you are doing next time" or, "Pay attention, please", if it was done because of careless-ness.  Especially if I have already said, "Stop playing around or your going to spill your drink".  If it happens because they were playing around and goofing off, then yes I do say something about paying attention.  But if it was truly an accident such as her elbow bumped it while trying to eat, then I would just say, "go get a towel".
ebQJsYTxaa	My kids have not gotten any vaccines at all.  They are 5 years and 20 months, and extremely healthy.  I have not once regretted my decision, even when one got pertussis (whooping cough) at age 2 1/2 years, and when they both got chickenpox.  These diseases are a pain when they are sick, but they do not last forever.  A vaccine injury can last a lifetime.<br>  <br>  Autism is just one worry about vaccines.  Vaccines can cause all sorts of injuries, including death.  They contribute to chronic and autoimmune diseases we see in so many kids today, such as allergies, asthma, eczema, and type 1 diabetes..<br>  <br>  I'm sure there will be someone who says kids can't go to school without vaccines.  That is not true.

This was principally because we believe a causal link between multiple vaccines and autism has NOT been disproved.  Moreover, the UK government embarked on a media propaganda and discrediting campaign against anyone who spoke against MMR jabs.   Naturally, that made everyone more suspicious.<br>  The health service refuse to offer separate jabs (we would be quite happy to immunize separately). We believe the combination of jabs is too much for some small children/babies to cope with at once.    <br>  Recently the UK health service has announced it intends to provide even bigger combined jabs, up to 5 at the same time.   <br>  We have had our children immunized for polio, tetanus, diphtheria etc, as these are offered as separate jabs.  It is just the MMR combination we have refused.  We understand there are risks but if the government hadn't so blatently lied and manipulated the issue, we might have had a different view.<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Addendum<br>  Interesting how you get voted down for just being honest - your "right" may be my "wrong" but I don't criticize your right to be different|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I wasn't vaccinated against MMR when I caught Rubella as an infant.  While typically, the illness is mild, I ended up being hospitalized with an abnormally high fever...so that was kind of hard on my family (I clearly, do not remember all of this.)  I did end up being vaccinated later on though.<br>  <br>  Another example is my cousin who has autism...he along with his siblings were not vaccinated (they live in an extremely rural area.)<br>  <br>  Finally, I worked with a teacher that did not receive vaccinations as a child (she was rather elderly,) and she had suffered from polio and as a result, spent her life in a wheelchair.<br>  <br>  Those are just three of my personal experiences though.  I understand everyone must make hard decisions based on what they know.  Personally, I haven't seen any solid proof that there is a link between autism and immunizations.  I will choose to have my son vaccinated.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	here we go again, VACCACINES DONOT CAUSE AUTISM<br>  <br>  this is about genes and a weak immuine system<br>  <br>  IF you are worried, space the vaccines out, PERIOD<br>  <br>  my son has autism and his shots were spaced out and guess what he has autism and hes a great child. he brings life and love and light where ever he goes<br>  <br>  Stop worrying about the autism and worry about taking care of your baby that is on the way|`|gaiCNtEFaa	The thought was that autism was caused by just the MMR vaccine given at 24 months.  There have been studies done and it does not cause autism.  We opted to wait for the second shot until more testing was done.  They don't need it until they start school.  I talked to my Dr. and she said there was no reason to rush if  I was worried.  By the time he starts school there should be more definitive studies done.  Some babies react to vaccines with a rash and fever, it can scare you.  But I would rather him be uncomfortable for a day or two than get Polio or some other horrible disease.|`|vc0VZMNzaa	Immunization is a highly personal choice.  You should not feel pressured by anyone here to do one thing or another - there is no right answer. Some of the answers here show the zealot-like nature this debate provokes which is ultimately unhelpful.  You might as well ask whether to smack your kids or go foxhunting.<br>  If you are concerned about combined vaccinations, space them out and wait until your children are older as, empirically, their bodies must be better equipped to cope with alien viruses and respond with the necessary antibodies that the vaccinations are designed to stimulate.|`|ghmwZtFraa	Go to this website it explains your concerns better than I can.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/immu/autism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromot...</a>
DRb4Qlypaa	I answered your other question. You need to talk to your husband about how he disciplines. Is he hitting her? That is what I meant by positive punishment in the last answer. The only way to teach children is through negative punishment (taking things away) and reinforcement, like praise. <br>  <br>  If he is hitting, let him know he is ruining your daughter's disposition and her chances at being normal.<br>  <br>  If he is not hitting, then it is not that. There is nothing wrong with the way you are parenting. Kids learn from different parenting styles easier than they learn from the same thing constantly. Try a reward system. If that doesn't work, try negative punishment (taking something away).|`|UZKfRM8naa	The problem is the verbal abuse and the hitting. Even slapping can horrify to someone at that age. "Obeying orders" make your child sound like a slave, not a family member with chores. I of course don't know the whole family situation, but if I ever had my child or myself treated like that, I would leave. Even verbal abuse is incredibly unhealthy and could be doing mental damage to your daughter that is causing her to be this way. There may be many more underlying mental issues.|`|FERfSYtzaa	you better put your foot down and get the respect from her because it makes no sense for her to be treatin you that way. you gave birth to her not the other way around tell  and show her how's boss.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	put the brat over your knee,<br>  something you should of done when she was still<br>  in pigtails|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	get the whip out.. or a nice pic from a weeping wellow tree and go to work.. that will correct that problem.. did with me

It is vital it stays in tact if your baby is going to survive.  You should be on bed rest and honestly you should have been given straight instructions from your Dr.  I would call him and have him tell you exactly what to do.  You should also be on pelvic rest.  Im not trying to scare you but just because it was not a miscarriage does not mean you are out of the clear.  You really need to get in touch with your doctor and take it very very easy.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Some cases that are mild you will not have to be on bed rest but will have to keep from any physical activity and in all cases you should be on pelvic rest, which means no sex.  I would call around and find a new Doctor right away, let them know what happened and have them treat you.  They should keep a very close eye on you and in the meantime you need to stay hydrated, make sure you are getting plenty of fiber (being constipated can cause problems when trying to go, so you want your stools to be as soft as possible.)  And stay off your feet as much as possible.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is that you find a Dr that will properly care for you.  I am so sorry your physician is so bad.

Dnr0Wbn3aa	It depends what state you live in. Usually is your a state employee you get good benefits. However, it seems like you are getting unpaid maturity leave ( which is a good thing and a bad thing ) they seem to still give you a leave , but an unpaid leave . Which means you can use the FMLA law. (Family Medical Leave Act ) It allows you to take up to 12 weeks unpaid leave ( but this means you are guaranteed to have your job back after your 12 weeks unpaid leave is up ) . Now , taking an unpaid leave doesn't mean you won't get paid. Depending on what state you live in , you will find out that you can claim Short Term Disability . Through your job, you should have been paying into the Short Term Disability insurance . So you are aloud to take up to your 12 weeks unpaid leave ( but the STATE will pay you up to 60% of your paycheck ) . They will evaluate you and depending on how much you normally make , they will decide how much you get . Also , I believe you would file this through your job's HR department . <br>  <br>  Hope this helps .|`|eD7qRBKHaa	No, welcome to the US.  No one is required to offer paid leave, so guess what, they usually don't.  You are allowed by FEDERAL law to take up to 12 weeks of UNPAID leave.  Your STATE law may be different.  For example, my state says you can take up to 16 weeks of unpaid leave.  After that time, your employer must give you your job back or a job substantially similar.<br>  <br>  So anyway, that's the law.  Unless your state law says you must be paid, which obviously it doesn't, you don't get anything.  Your employer may contribute to a STD for you (short-term disability).  In that case, you may be able to tap into that.  Ask HR.  But if they don't participate in that type of plan, then sorry.|`|j083iujcaa	yup they aren't required to pay you for maternity leave! you can however use any vacation time and sick time you have built up. and some short term disability plans do cover maternity leave. that's why most women only take 6 weeks, they can't afford to take any more.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Welcome to motherhood for working moms in the USA.  It sucks!<br>  <br>  You should sit down with your Human Resource person and find out if you would be eligible for short-term disability.  When pregnant with my twins, I was allowed 6 weeks of short term disability pay - it was only about 1/2 of my weekly salary . . . but every little bit helps.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, all you can do is save up, work as much as you can now, maybe overtime etc . . . and do the best you can.  As to 3 - 6 months . . . FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) allows you up to 12 weeks off unpaid for the birth of your child.  If you want more time off than that . . . then you are at risk of having no job to return to.<br>  <br>  Sorry!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It depends on your employers and their benefit packages. If they don't offer maternity leave then they don't have to pay you for it. You need to review your states maternity laws and FMLA laws to see what you can get. Most laws will state that they have to hold your job for you if you take off the maximum amount of time or less, but they do not have to pay you. Most maternity leaves are 6 weeks for vag. birth and 8 weeks for c-section so I don't think you'll find anyone to pay you for 3-6 months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Maternity_Leave_Laws" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Mat...</a>|`|6cwJi5kxaa	First off why are you taking 3-6 months off for maternity leave??

ay8tXLD2aa	Instead of changing formula, you can get your GP to prescribe infant Gaviscon. You add it to bottles and it provides a thickening agent int he stomach to help keep the contents down. It CAN be constipating for some babies so isn't always the best option but it's a good start.  If it works, and your baby does become constipated, your GP can also prescribe lactulose to help soften the poop. <br>  <br>  I would hesitate on changing to the SMA Staydown as a first choice, because if it doesn't work, then you've got to change formula back to what you are on now, and it can be hard on your baby's system with so many food changes at a young age.  And, the SMA staydown is, I think, available by prescription - your may have a GP that is willing to write you a script for it. But, see what your HV says - I suspect she will advice the Gaviscon as a first trial.

If you get their okay, by all means, teach her “Oh my gosh or oh my goodness”. It may work, it may not. <br>  <br>  But if you want to keep your job, than you could just suck it up. And if it’s not worth it to you, then quit.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	It's up to her parents to tell her to stop, IF they want to... I'd be offended if someone told my child to stop saying something, just because it was something they believed... I'm the parent; I, or my husband will do it, if appropriate... Not in the babysitter's job description.<br>  <br>  I'm not intending to be rude, either. :)|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	You just say that in your home, that phrase is considered bad, you don't allow it in your home, and teach her an alternative.  If the parents inquire...say the same, it is not acceptable in your home...she can say whatever she wants under their care.  Treat the phrase like the F word...because in your eyes, it is equally as offensive...certainly wouldn't allow children in your home to say that one, lol!|`|7lnyNHgYaa	It's not your responsibility, or your place to teach her not to say that. If it really bothers you, get a different job|`|q6tYPGYVaa	Just ask her to say "oh my goodness" or make it fun and have her say "oh my monkeys!" or something like that.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	either quit or deal with it. u can't tell her not to say something just because you have a problem with it.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	its not ur child leave her alone if you dont like it then quit!|`|LwbwMFX9aa	i feel if it offends you as a christian, it is YOUR right to gently talk to the parents about her saying that in your home or drop from watching her<br>  <br>  Christians have to put up with a lot of garbage to appease everyone else, stand up for what you believe in, draw that line in the sand if you have too<br>  <br>  Ive had issues like this from a little girl I used to babysit, I told her parents to curb what was going on or lose me as a babysitter, the parents were lazy and didnt care about my feelings so I dropped them from watching their daughter, period.<br>  <br>  <br>  my children say OH MY GARSH !!!!|`|UrWzdIsDaa	If you are deeply offended by taking the Lord's name, it should make no difference to you if she says instead Oh My Gosh, Goodness (Gracious) Me, even My Giddy Aunt,  or anysuch - these are all merely colloquial derivatives of "Oh My God" and have exactly the same meaning and therefore offense.   <br>  <br>  If it is only the actual phrase "Oh My God" (which she will have picked up from TV, probably "Friends") then tell her you want her to say it in French only - "Mon Dieu".<br>  That way, if she comprehends the religious aspect it will have some meaning to her and she may stop, whilst for you, it acts as a shield for your sensitivities.|`|O6sf4Db7aa	A big question is she in your house when she says this or in her house. If she in in her house then you need, as the adult in this situation, to just ignore it. If she says this as often as you say then her parents would have heard by now and obviously haven't seen anything wrong with it. This is because it France Oh my god doesn't literally mean God in a religious sence it would be the same as Oh my Goodness. Also, their religion wouldn't have anything to do with this situation, it makes you uncomfortable but again she's 6 you can't have others change their behaviors because of YOUR religious beliefs|`|USRK9xAyaa	I know what u mean about using God's name in vein. It's one of the 10 commandments. Right on the list with thou shall not kill, worship any other God and so on... Remember in God's eye all sin is the same. Just like if she was saying the f-bomb.. u would prompt her to say a diff word instead. When she says it try to see if u can get her to say goodness instead. If shes 6 if u just tell her in a nice way say oh my goodness. If her parents ask why it bothers you, tell them. Don't be ashamed of what you believe. You are their babysitter. You should beable to talk to them.
j7fzuDxgaa	every pregnancy and labour is so different with my 1st pregnancy was great no sickness etc just enjoyed it. my labour was 17 hours i had an epidural and i had to be cut down below and had stitches oh yes i was 11 days late i had a sweep which got things going.<br>  <br>  <br>  with my second pregnancy i had morning sickness sore breast etc for the first 3 months was fine After that. my labour was 16 and half hours again i had epidural this time i did not have to be cut it was so so much better.<br>  <br>  <br>  my 3rd pregnancy was the best no sickness etc i enjoyed every moment he was born one day early. i was in labour for 45 Min's how ever i don't know when my waters broke lol the midwife went to break them and said oh there is not any, when i was told i could not have an epidural i was so so scared i just had gas and air, and im so so glad it was the best labour ever. i was back home by 6.30 pm.<br>  <br>  <br>  baby number 4 home birth i think hehe i wish you all the best|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I went for a cervical sweep and was told that I was 1cm dilated, so they sent me home. 2 days later I went back in for an overnight stay before being induced (I was 10 days late) but my waters broke at 2am! By 10.12 pm my daughter was born. I requested an epidural but was ignored on several occasions, so it is important to press the issue if it is in your birth plan. By the time they agreed to give me one I had dilated too far!<br>  <br>  I used gas and air, but it made me queasy. The best form of pain relief was water, so opt for a water birth if possible. Despite not having an epidural I was very pleased to have gone without, it was a shock at first but more beneficial for the baby.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It may be worth booking your water birth but make a plan b so that you won't be dissapointed if they can't provide it. That was my biggest mistake, I didn't make a Plan B!|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	I found out I was pregnant last Feb and the day I found out I had morning sickness. I had bad morning sickness all through my first trimester and by my second I was fine. About the beginning of my third trimester I started getting big and uncomfortable and having back pain. It was around the last month that my pelvic region hurt really bad. So I started walking every night and one night my water broke. We live right across the street from the hospital so I walked over. But I didn't have a pad to stop the water from leaking through my pants, I had soaked a hand towel, So I used a baby diaper, LOL! Anyways, we went over any they admitted me and we spent about 7 hours in the room with contractions. At about my 8 house mark I started going into HARD labor. I got my epidural and relaxed a bit. My labor started to slow so they up'ed my pitocen to keep it going and at the 19 hour of labor mark my daughter was born. I did 1hour and 1minute of pushing. She was very healthy and alert when she was born. I just found out last sat that I am pregnant again. I found ou the exact same day as last year. lol. I'm excited and so far I have no morning sickness. So either I'm not far along at all or I'm gonna be lucky this time! <br>  Congrats to you! Good luck!|`|nwWBddEnaa	i was induced 2 weeks early, 15 minute labour from start to finish, no painkillers, was kept in for nearly 2 weeks, i wish you all the best x|`|PjCKtuU3aa	Pregnancy for me was fun and exciting - but also terrifying, particularly as it got closer and closer to my due date! I had some medical problems that required a lot more doctor's appointments and ultrasounds than necessary, but I know that as things get closer and closer to the end, a lot of women start getting antsy because it's been so long since the last ultrasound - for most pregnancies, the ultrasound around 20wks is the last chance to get to see your baby before the big day!<br>  <br>  You tend to wait for milestones during pregnancy - first, the end of the 1st trimester; then the 20wk ultrasound (and finding out the gender, if you're going to!); then the first movement; then your baby shower... and then you're just waiting impatiently for your baby to be born! Towards the end, you start getting bored and impatient with the whole thing.<br>  <br>  I had to be induced early for medical reasons, and it was really scary to begin with. I had an epidural, but it didn't take completely, so while I'm sure it helped, it wasn't quite as blissful as I'd been led to believe. However, you just do what you have to do to make it through - and once you've got that baby in your arms, it all becomes worth it!|`|AA11563245	For the big day bag, please bring socks to wear during labor (your feet will be sooo cold).  Materity outfit for you to go home with including underware and napkin (believe me, your tummy will not be flat yet).  Your baby going home outfit+cap.  Bring popcicles (the flavor that you like cause hospital only give you ice chip.  At that time your mouth is dry and plain, you want something tasty)<br>  At the hospital: address at the begining that you want epurdural or not so they can get it prepare.  If you are going in to deliver vagianal, make sure you use the ice pack right after delivery (It will be so swollen down there, if you know what I mean).  Stay in the hospital as long as your insurance allow because once home, you're on your own.  Use the time in the hospital to recooperate your self (i know you are so excited and want to spend time with your new baby all the time but.....you will have him/her to yourself when you get home, too.  Be prepare for the sleepless nights to come....wake up every 1 1/2-2 1/2 hours to feed your baby, diaper change...etc.  Congrat and good luck.<br>  PS: make sure you walk everyday and dont go to the hospital until your contractions are close within 5min or less and/or you see spot after you pee (in the toilet)|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Everybody is different, all you can do is research the general basics of labor and delivery and then let your body do the work.  Women have been doing this forever...<br>  <br>  I did not want to take any meds while I was in labor, and I didn't.  No epidural especially.  I was glad... my recovery was short and no side effects.  My son was nursing right away because he had not been affected by drugs either.<br>  <br>  My mucus plug came out at 7 PM, and by noon the next day I was on the way to the hospital.  I was in labor for 6.5 hours and I pushed for 30 minutes.  At 7:15 my little man was born, 8lbs 12 oz.<br>  <br>  You have to have a positive attitude and be prepared to focus on the positive and relax.  All of which are nearly impossible, but trying will help you get through it.  Good luck!|`|bVkIEpyGaa	I went 2 weeks overdue and was given a pessary to induce labour but it wasn't really effective, other than the irregular mild contractions that I had been already having when i went in, nothing much was happening.<br>  <br>  At about 11.30 on the night the pains started getting stronger and I was 3cm dilated so I phoned my husband who got back to the hospital at 10 past midnight. Then the dumb midwife spent the next hour telling us both that I wasn't in labour and I should go to sleep (The contractions were coming thick and fast now, and I had insisted on using the gas and air, even though she said she wasn't allowed to give it me because I wasn't in 'real labour'!) <br>  <br>  Anyway, at 1.18am (One hour and 8 minutes after my husband got there) I could feel the head coming out by itself I hadn't even pushed. I still had my pyjamas on and my husband ripped them off just intime for the stupid midwife to catch the head. I had a 9lb 7oz baby girl, an it was sooo much easier than I was expecting.
0psxM4o4aa	It is essential after 6 months of pregnancy.  That is the time the baby will start it's major brain developmnent.  Also, I reccomend you ask your Dr to prescribe you pregvite.  It has to b prescirbed by your doctor.  It has all the vitamins and nutrients you need in it.  It can be hard on your stomach though, especially in the morning.  (It is much better than all the over the counter pregnancy pills).
GWveqx61aa	well throwing up could be morning sickness, but i think its too early for that, if the mucus was not stretchy than thats not ovulation, i dont have any idea what my cervix is up to these days, so i cant help you with that question, sorrybut being 9 days away from af i think you are not getting pregnancy symptoms, sorry i cant help you more, you should do some independent research, i have ran across alot of info that way, but if it pertains to my cervix i dont read it because i cant understand that thing, lol, good luck and baby dust to all of us
NIdze2ncaa	this is the the most retarded thing of ever read in my life.I will say that what the senior president said was bull.But they should just let them dance how they want to.But the fact that there trying to stop this in a public school where they av 800 to 1,000 students attending the homecoming dance and 300 to 600 students going to other dances held through the year is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  I go to a Catholic school with just under 700 students.Everyone but a select few grind at our dances and our faculty and principal don't have a problem with us grinding.At this years semi-formal we had the most hated and strict teacher at the school chaperoning.(This teacher would bust you for just about anything you can think of, i.e wearing a jacket,talking in the halls,and especially public displays of affection she goes anal over it.)So i see her at our semi-formal and i'm like Sh** semis gonna suck because she would be busting people left right as she does in the halls all day long,but shockingly she didn't yell at anyone for pda or especially grinding,i rarely saw her.<br>  <br>  So i think this article is bullsh**.Plus the fact i think grinding is a dance that anyone can do and learn at the dance it self so they have fun and aren't wall flowers the whole time unlike swing dancing (I'm not saying it wouldn't be fun but there would be as many ppl dancing and there would be a lot more wallflowers).  <br>  <br>  sorry for making this so long.It just upsets me that they would ban kids for grinding when there are so many more worse things they could be doing.|`|cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	GOOD!<br>  This style is absolutely inappropriate for a school dance setting.  If the students claim they don't know any other way to dance, maybe they could start up an extracurricular swing dance club or something where they actually learn dance moves.  When I was that age (and it was only about 10 years ago) the kids who knew how to actually dance had a lot more fun at the dances anyway.  It became more social, more physically demanding, and much more fun.  There was much less of the standing around at the edge of the room not knowing what to do.  Popularize real dancing, and it's not only more appropriate for the age, but it's more fun.<br>  Definitely BS from the class president.  I'll admit that there are naiive girls out there who aren't thinking about it sexually, but I guarantee the guys are.  I'll never forget the first time I danced like that with a guy and he told me he "was about ready to bust his load in his pants" (his words, not mine).  I was mortified, because to me I had just been dancing.  This policy is to protect the students and create an appropriate environment more than anything else.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Unfortunately that's high school dances for you. I would just recommend that all students keep the crazy dancing to a severe minimum at school and reserve the grinding for when they are at the club in a few years. It's way more fun than lame school dances. For serious.|`|Inc78M0Raa	It's a SCHOOL dance. You're not at a club. It's the students fault they can't have anymore dances. Learn to dance appropriate.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	I think that's a ridiculous article and the principal sounded like a joke. I understand that schools do not allow "provocative" dancing and  in all honesty I understand why, but I think the people at this school are taking it too far and sound completely ignorant/naive of what teens are doing these days. The dancing needs to be supervised and within certain limits I guess, but give the kids a break! This article makes it sound like they're having sex at the dances.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I see both sides of the story...Im a young mother (im 22, daughter is 4) I know that this is how kids dance these days, I know this is how I dance occasionally BUT if my daughter was doing this I would be majorly disturbed. Im torn. Also the comment from the senior class president about not having sex on the mind...I have to call bull ont hat one as well!|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Well, a bunch of teens act inappropriate and stupid at dances and do that crap to where the kids that don't miss out on dances because of what they did.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	Our dances weren't banned (though there was talk of it). We just had the administrators walking around with flashlights breaking people up and reminding them to stay apart.<br>  <br>  Eventually though they gave up.|`|KNnwUcpqaa	For high school, yes i agree grinding is too much. Save it for going to the night clubs after you turn 18.|`|NMjM2X4taa	GREAT! someone needs to stop the dirty dancing at schools. <br>  <br>  and people wonder shy so many teens are sl*ts.|`|RBOc42Koaa	i think it's not a big deal at all.<br>  let them dance how they want!|`|lTsPX04jaa	thats what is going on for our prom. i think it is so stupid|`|XrKviWgSaa	i get both sides also as i am 18 and getting ready to be a mother, and i used to dance like that at dances and the teen dance clubs that i went to every weekend. and not having sex on the mind yeah okay grinding is basically having sex with your clothes on and at my old school you were not allowed to do that or you were thrown out as it is against school rules.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	"'They think we have sex on our minds but we’re just having fun,' said Sarah Mousseau, senior class president."<br>  <br>  I call bull$hit on that one.  She may not have sex on her mind.  But I can almost guarantee that the guys do.  There are appropriate times and places for all things.  Teenagers have a tendency to not really know when or where those times and places may be.  You're not going out to the club.  You're at a school function.  So you should act accordingly.<br>  <br>  They say they do it because they don't know how to dance any other way and it is what they have grown up with.  I guess we reap what we sow.|`|8ClVIXjsaa	grinding is trashy.|`|JMBT0LSUaa	Grinding=Funn|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	My parents would kill me for doing that.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	yep that's school dances for you. that's even how a lot of adults dance. i am not saying it is ok but the adults are kind of being hypocrites to not let teens that are almost adults dance like most adults.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Whores.
qH1YcQ2kaa	it looks like a peanut at 6 wks<br>  you can hear the heartbeat too<br>  <br>  check out babycenter.com<br>  they have a week by week chart and for most weeks they also have a 3-d ultrasound of what the baby would look like at that particular week|`|xarKlp0Oaa	You will see a little mass and a dark spot flickering on and off at this stage, which is the heart beating.

Baby clothes are sized stupidly, there is no standard. we have some diaper shirts that fit great and are labeled 18 months and I got two diaper shirts with rock logos on them, the 3-6 month and the 6-12 month one are exactly the same size, not almost the same, exactly the same. You can never tell by the size. unless you buy european sized clothes that go by cm.|`|acj9mB9Paa	Not even close.  My son is 21 months and wears a 3T-4T in shirts and pants to get them long enough we have to buy 24 months, but he is so skinny we either buy the adjustable waist pants or I have to sew them so they are skinnier.  He is such a bean pole but VERY tall for his age, especially in the torso (like his Da).|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son's clothing is all over the place. He can fit in some sizes 6-9 months to 12-18 months. He's almost 9 months old and 20 lbs. It doesnt matter if they are brand name like carter's, childrens place, old navy. He's so up and down. SO if anyone gets him anything new I just tell them to get anything 12 months or bigger.

By that I mean he was starting to go to 2T instead of 18 months. But for the most part he as right at the age to size ratio. Now at 4 he is way ahead on the top and right at on the bottom. But as an infant he was right on track. I wouldn't worry. You'll wake up one day and your peanut will have grown 2 sizes. At least that what it seems like. We have this problem in shoes. For the longest time he was int he same size then all of a sudden I was buy 5 pairs a year. They even out.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Our son is a String Bean, he is skinny for his age, his DR wants us to feed him "more" he already eats at least 38 ounces a day, he won;t take anymore. My side of the family is all tall and skinny so he gets it from me. But he is extremely tall. He will be 6 months on Monday and he is 29 inches, he is in the 98th Percentile for his height so those Jumper outfits he fits into a 6-9 or sometimes the 12 month so he has room to grow. But if he wears a two piece it has to be the 6 month but the pants are a little short, he is so skinny so even a 6 month pant falls off of him. We usually just stick to 1 pieces with him.|`|kRui5wGtaa	My son is 5 months old and he fits perfectly into 6-9 month old clothing. He has been fitting into the well since about 4.5 months. He is NOT a little peanut! LOL. He was 8lbs 15oz at birth! So basically he wears like a size and a half bigger than what the clothes say for the age. LOL|`|mvqfIjEVaa	It pretty much depends on the brand of the clothes.  My little guy is almost 4 months and he's all over the place.  Some of his 0-3 month stuff still fits, but then I just opened a new package of stretchies that were 3-6 months and he's already too big for them!|`|7pWMqi2oaa	The brand really makes a big difference. My daughter is 3 and can still wear a 12m in shorts, but is a 5 slim in jeans and can wear a 6 in a dress. She's really skinny and TALL. You just gotta find what works. I find Old Navy's baby sizes are really consistent.|`|OT7t6pyyaa	My son is almost 11 months and he is in 12-18. I also have found that Old Navy clothes fit the best although they tend to shrink a lot.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	My twins are very petite.  They are 14 months old but I can easily fit them in 9-12 months clothes.  My twins were so tiny when they were born that even the clothes in the NICU were to big for them.|`|4yUUUkAsaa	My daughter is 8 1/2 months.  About half her clothes that still fit really well are 6 month sizes.  The rest are 9 months but some of them are a little.big.|`|18acfae76e2cb111a680d365b7b44cedaa	HAHA They are all so different.  At your son's age my son was wearing the 2T that ran on the smaller side and they were slightly big in the waist but the right length.  He is 25 months now and is wearing large 2T and small 3T.  I think it just depends though on how your kiddo is built.  My son is thin and tall so he outgrows the length in all his pants before he comes close to outgrowing the waist size.  I always try to pick out jeans that have the adjustable waist inside OR that look like a slim cut.  <br>  <br>  Jackson is so adorable!|`|8jlOGOAeaa	My daughter pretty much stayed in the clothes according to her age until she hit 12mo. Then she quit gaining weight for a while, but shot up 3 inches in 2 months!<br>  <br>  Right now, at almost 27 months, she wears 3T is most pants unless it's jeans and then it's 2T. 2T fits better in the waist, but she's gotten so tall that she needs the 3T length...not sure why she's so flipping tall since I am only 5 '1" and Daddy is 5'10" or so...LOL. As for shirts, 3T fits the best. Shorts, on the other hand, she can wear 12-18mo since she's a skinny minny. :)|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Oh my, babies clothes sizing is all over the place.  My son wears different sizes in all different brands, and the sizing within the same brand even vary by style of clothing. <br>  <br>  My 12 month old son is in the 80th percentile for height and 90th for weight,  he wears mostly 12-18 month shirts  while he can still fit into some of his 6 months pants.  <br>  <br>  I mostly shop by apperance of size and not by the tag size nowdays.|`|pXSKSS3daa	A lot of it depends on the brand for Noah. Gerber anything runs smaller(he was in 6-9 sleepers at 4 months) while Carter's brand seems to run a bit bigger on him.<br>  <br>  Right now, though, he's almost 11 months and I've been buying some Summer clothing for him. Shorts are either 12 months or 12-18 months and both have plenty of room. Tops/onesies are 12 months. I figured I'd buy them bigger to last the whole Summer, but we'll see how that goes. :)
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Actually your the most fertile right after you have a baby, well after the "after flow" stops. There is a chance, take a test.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you are breastfeeding, the odds would be very close to zero.  Nursing moms don't ovulate that early. (Nature knows better than to make a new mom pregnant immediately after giving birth.)<br>  <br>  If you are NOT breastfeeding, there is some chance, (nature would think that baby has died, so would want to get you pregnant again quickly)  but nobody can know what YOUR body is doing. Some non-nursing moms ovulate within a few weeks of giving birth, some don't ovulate until a month or two later.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Very high|`|2irmTjQ3aa	It is actually very possible, the doctor always tell you to wait six weeks after you have the baby, not only for safety reasons but your body is very fertile right now since you just gave birth so your chances are even higher than normal.|`|pUltSWNnaa	You are actually most fertile right after you deliver a baby.  If you are breast-feeding it is less likely, if not, you may want to take a pregnancy test and be careful!!!|`|d89qNyb6aa	VERY possible.You fall pregnant a lot easier after you've just given birth.|`|BO28Mn8haa	lol. your kids are going to be about 10 months apart. girl get educated|`|Fml5V53Baa	Yes you can. But aren't you supposed to wait until after 6 weeks to have sex? Also it's not recommended to get pregnant so soon after having one. Your body was under a lot of stress, it needs to heal after the birth. Try to use contraception next time, otherwise you might end up compromising your health and the health of your baby.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	The cervix stays about 3-4 cm dialated for a few weeks right after you give birth, so the chances of getting pregnant are EXTREMELY HIGH during this time as it is VERY easy for the sperm to get to the next available egg!|`|meySiWKzaa	The chances pregnancy increase following a birth.  You have about a 95% chance of being pregnant.  Depending on your husbands fertility, it could even be higher then that.|`|69hjhpYqaa	Oh my gosh! Why did you have sex so soon? That's really dangerous. Yes... you could be pregnant. You could also have died having sex so early after delivery...|`|532XA7lkaa	You are extremely fertile after giving birth....mean trick, huh?  So yes, there is a high chance you could be pregnant again....this happens more than you know....try to stay calm....and congrats if yuo are :)|`|se27sAUwaa	Very high. I know a lot of people that have children less than a year apart. Happens all the time. Congrats on your "Mommy-hood"!!|`|WsUSAgLmaa	It very possible and very dangerous because your body has not healed from the first pregnancy!!|`|LkXz94ADaa	Well first you should be careful having sex so soon. You could very easily get infected. Its recommended that you wait at least 6 weeks. But anyway are you breastfeeding? If so that is supposed to be a natural form of birth control for right after you have a baby. It worked for me! I used this method for about 4 months after having my daughter and it seemed to have worked. But if not, watch out girl! Lol. I know someone who conceived again exactly 4 weeks after giving birth. Her son and daughter are 10 months apart.|`|bcDNHQqNaa	If you are not taking any kind of birth control the chances are very high. After you have a child you are more fertile to become pregnant. My sister found out 6 weeks after she had her son that she was pregnant. Just go get a test and see what it says! Hope ever thing turns out how you want!!!|`|NBDQRBvzaa	im pretty sure you can, i don't think u should be having sex though i though u had to wait at least 40 days after giving birth to have sex. i think u should just wait to see if u miss ur period and get a pregnancy test|`|Wf7b0KACaa	It is very likely you better go get checked out.  Its better to be safe than sorry.|`|1vG4wNhpaa	LOL Very good!!!!! Yes you can. My mom did...........4 times!!!! LOL|`|qoBlB9nVaa	very possible|`|IMPh53Ssaa	its possible.|`|Get4HnNKaa	well only if you were raped by a savage ***** beast
a29qiNkvaa	Yes thats normal! My AF was about 2 weeks or so late after my LAP. I think it ahs something to do with stress! I would personal wait another week. I know hard.
OuuYoSBeaa	you just have to tell her that older cartoons where drawn differently because they didnt have the same tools back then as they do now. Tell her that now a days, people can use computers to make cartoons and they can make things look more realistic|`|cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	She sounds like a pretty smart girl.  Fact is, none of the Bugs Bunny cartoon characters are really drawn all that accurately.  They're cartoons.  Don't bring it up as an issue until/unless she does.  If she asks about it, just say that's how the creator felt like drawing them.  It doesn't need to be racist.  You can show her more modern cartoons and how each artist does things a little differently (think Little Einsteins--more accurate, but still, what kids actually have heads that big?).  Trust her to get it.|`|M2yERqNSaa	tell her the truth, some of them do look like monkeys, look at jay z|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Not at 4.  But I would have that conversation with my kids when they were 7 or 8 and were learning about racism and the civil rights movement and all of that.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	At 4 she wouldn't understand the nuances of racism in cartoons and child's books anyway. I wouldn't worry about it too much, although I probably wouldn't bring those books out to begin with.<br>  <br>  I'm half black, and we have an old album with black people on it that appear to be monkey-life. I love collecting old things like that, but I won't bother showing it to my son until he's much older.
yea2hci5aa	You should always use your morning urine to take a hpt so that your hcg levels are more concentrated.  I am currently on day 57 of my cycle and my cycle usually only lasts 37 days.  I took a pregnancy test on Sunday morning it came out negative.  I'm waiting to take a test tomorrow morning to see if the result will be different and if it's not then I'm going to be calling the doctor to take a blood test.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do the same thing<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DN6XtoViaa	your Hcg levels could not be high enough yet. <br>  i would go get a blood test! make sure you ask for the blood test that mesures the AMOUNT of Hcg.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	your hcg levels may be too low you should try going to the doctor and get a blood test! =) good luck!
fAtgSc0iaa	I think unique names is the future, many people like myself are turning to them. <br>  <br>  People who are adverse to them usually are stuck in the traditional ways and sometimes believe that its not fair on the child (which I totally disagree with).<br>  <br>  They want to keep the "norm".<br>  <br>  Some maybe believe that its following the celebs?<br>  <br>  I personally am a big fan of unique names, it makes you in a way more interesting.<br>  <br>  I like<br>  ----winter (winnie for short :P)<br>  ----october<br>  ---storm <br>  ---rosalie("normal")<br>  ---willow<br>  <br>  for girls<br>  <br>  But i haven't thought of boys names ( i want 6-8 kids)<br>  <br>  I love the name Echo and Asher of yours :D|`|gUCjkj9oaa	It makes them stand out,Celeste is a traditional name.What about using names from Shakespeare?|`|UxlL89rHaa	I love unique names, i just hate the uniquely cr*p names.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	It's not necessarily the first names that are an issue, with the exception of Jubilee.  It's the pairing of the names you chose.  No kid should have the middle name Hollow as it's just freakin' depressing, especially with the last name Love.  So basically you're saying empty love.  Same goes for Forrest Hollow which is read as an empty forest.  Read the story of Echo and Narcissus...it's depressing.<br>  <br>  You need to think about the pairing of the names.  The other combinations are just really hippy.  I'm not saying you have to have a Jacob or Kaitlyn, it'd just be nice to give them a less Hippy middle name pairing that doesn't rock the suicidal feeling.  Kids grow up to become adults and if your daughter wants to be a lawyer, color me bias, but I'm not going to hire a lawyer named Violet Butterfly Love. <br>  <br>  Scarlett Celeste is cute.  Asher Sterling is adorable and masculine.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I don't think that unique names are horrible I think they make a child stand out, and the right unique name can be gorgeous. Just think about if that daughter or son ever becomes a professional they need a name that will look good on a business card and not get them laughed at and not taken seriously. Violet, Celeste, & Scarlett are gorgeous names but not when they are paired with Butterfly. Scarlett Raine is gorgeous and right up your alley but not overboard. If you want to use moon, Luna is moon is spanish and prettier sounding. This is not a pet you are naming this is a child that will have to spend the rest of their life with a name that they can either be proud of, or a name that they will want to change, believe me I was one of those that have had to live with having a different name, most people do not even realize that the name I give and use is not my real name.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	i agree with you. my daughters are mariah and aurora. i named them things that were different but not so out there that people couldn't pronounce them. i like most of your names you've picked. i'm not partial to echo, jubilee or shade though. they're a little too out there. i love celeste and asher though. those are very nice.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Celeste, Violet and Scarlett are actually classic names.  I don't care for your other names or most names that fall into the "unique" category.  Mainly because they sound made up and just don't make sense to me.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	It's not that people hate unique names, its just that names are so very personal, I find it almost cruel to give your child a hokey or crazy name without his/her consent. I would personally be pretty mad at my parents if my name was Jubilee or Echo, but some girls out there might wish that was there name! there is no way to please everyone but I think it is better to be safe and name your child something SOMEWHAT conventional. That way they will be taken in seriously in life, their careers, etc. If they want to go by something crazy though, then they can!<br>  <br>  I see no problem with Celest, Scarlett, Violet, forest, Shade, Asher or Sterling though! (Although I tend to think of Sterling for a girl, but maybe only because I know a girl named Sterling)<br>  <br>  And although I am not a fan of Echo or Jubille, I am also not a fan of Kaitlyn or Jacob either. I like more uncommon names that are also "real" names. Like Violet and Scarlett and Celeste.|`|zgXpomfCaa	I just don't like thing names. I don't have any issues with unusual names, as long as it's not a totally messed up spelling that doesn't even make sense phonetically. I'm just not a fan of names after things.<br>  I do quite like Scarlett and Asher, though.|`|LCLpSa5Faa	I like Echo, Celeste, Violet, Scarlet and Forest but Sterling just remins me of beer. I love unique names. My favourites are Melodie, Skye, River, Tristan and Ocean.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	Scarlett is very common now.<br>  <br>  i like Violet and maybe Echo<br>  Jubliee i don't because i hate any Ju name<br>  Celeste gets picked on.<br>  <br>  Forrest-redneck<br>  Shade-eh ok<br>  Asher-i love it<br>  Sterling-redneck|`|IvkNTqDMaa	I know right? When I have kids they will definitely be named something unique...not like Anthony or Jessica.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	People have their own opinions I personally like most names.|`|d6e11chxaa	Unique seems to mean 'misspelled, cheesy, and trashy' in this sense. I think it's great when people reach back and find names that were used throughout history that are legitimate, strong choices that sound familiar, but you can't think of anybody you know with the name. I like Celeste, Violet, Scarlett, Forest, and Asher. Sterling is a decent choice, but not my style. If you're going to pick random words, at least consider the associations people have with it. Jubilee might mean 'joyful celebration', but what else comes to mind? Juju-bees? Cherries jubilee? Diamond jubilee? It's silly. Echo is a nymph who fell in love with Narcissus, and wasted away repeating everything he said. What a pitiful, weak character to name your child after. Shade is darkness. It's very negative and dark sounding. <br>  <br>  How about checking out the historical records? I love names like Sylvia, Daphne, Gideon, and Hugo.<br>  <br>  ETA: Oh lord, I just saw your other question and realised your last name is Love. Oh boy, you have to be very careful with a last name like that! My last name is Huff, and we had to cross most of our names off the list. "Piper Huff" sounds wrong. So does Scarlett Love or Shade Love sound like street drugs, and Sterling Love sounds like a metallic sex toy. Forest Love sounds like an outdoor orgy, or really hardcore hippies. You get the idea. You really really should avoid word names with your last name. Stick to the non-word names, or even names that sound like words. Asher Love: Ash, or Love? Ix nay! Celeste Love sounds very nice. Skip the random word names. How about:<br>  <br>  Lorelai Celeste Love -name of a Siren<br>  Sylvia Athena Love -Sylvia means 'forest', Athena is a goddess.<br>  Bijou Rosalie Love -Bijou means 'jewel'<br>  <br>  Angus Odin Love -Odin is a Norse god<br>  Corbin Finnegan Love -Corbin means 'crow'<br>  Hector Ivan Love -Hector is a legendary warrior|`|xCifmFfkaa	Because the parents today are going way far-out eccentric and the names are getting just too wierd.<br>  <br>  At the same time, there is a sort of really annoying pretention that comes with naming your child something so unique: I can't stand it!<br>  <br>  And lastly, seems as though parents who want to name their children these f*cked up names, seems to have forgotten that their child will be going through life with it..|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	I love unique names! I think they give your child individuality. Your names are cute! Although, sometimes there are very bizarre names people make up that are quite repulsive, but I really enjoy your names. I have been hearing the name Asher quite a lot lately actually. I think Jubilee is adorable on a little girl, and I think Sterling is a nice manly name for a boy! Congrats and good luck!|`|e4e2b4a25d405bbec926275fa608dc53aa	I love Unique-meaningful names, an actual name that is a lot less common: i.e. Naima, Tzipporah, Keziah, Adanna, Imani, Tahirah, Zaida, Nailah-all of these are legit (Arabic/African) names with nice meanings. <br>  I just don't like it when people name their kids random things like Chase, Apple, Willow Lawn, Butterfly etc.|`|ivejg4whaa	I think that some of those names are unique and nice but Asher and Jubilee are just weird. And Echo sounds really white trash.<br>  You just don't want to name your kid something that other kids are going to make fun of them for because you have to keep in mind that kids are cruel all the way till high school!|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	I don't like Celeste because it rhymes with Molest.<br>  I also really don't like Asher because of the ER on the end.<br>  <br>  But I totally agree with you on the unique names.<br>  <br>  I like Dane for a boy<br>  and Thais (tay-iss) and Isla (eye-la) for<br>  a girl.<br>  <br>  Jubilee is an awesome name. Got it from X-men right?|`|1WS0ojj5aa	It doesnt matter what everyone else thinks, but remember your child will have to live with the name for the rest of their lives. Personally, I think the names just sound awful, it has nothing to do with being unique. Ive heard of plenty of pretty unique names that didnt sound awful.|`|GY8fpm5haa	Well i don't actually know.<br>  I named my two kids Tianni + Carmen.<br>  I named Tianni, Tianni because i liked that name + my friend suggested a unique name.<br>  Then I named Carmen after my great grandmother who was 1/2 spanish.<br>  <br>  So i don't understand why they say that.|`|iNQK27Qqaa	Echo is kina weird, same with Jubilee. and shade, and sterling. THe other names are fine. i think the big problem is when people name their kids. Pilot Inspector, moon unit, apple. Crap like that is disturbing|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Celeste, Violet and Scarlett are lovely names and not really unique at all.  Jubliee and Echo are not names and sound stupid.|`|FJbdpGfVaa	well, some of them like jubilee , echo and forest are words which could result to your child being billied in later life. theres nothing wrong with individual names but things like apple and princess are just stupid for a healthy child!!|`|VEkkn2Otaa	I loved all your names except the middle names they were just bad!<br>  Celeste is sooo pretty.<br>  As for the people who dont like unique names just ignore them its your child name them what you want! But not Swan Love hahaha!|`|RnopSbHqaa	well i like unique names my name is shallana and i really like my name|`|K71Qoakwaa	Too many "unique" names are silly or pretentious.|`|AA11102015	Your choices seem okay to me... Shade is a bit odd, though. Sounds like a vampire novel character...|`|DhmjLRoUaa	Ashers a cool name. its my sons name<br>  But names like Jubilee and Echo are just stupid names|`|4z1gryIGaa	Because you are not just choosing a name for a cute, cuddly baby. That baby will one day be an adult. How would you like it if your parents had done the same to you. Imagine the worst name in the world...now imagine that's what your parents named you because it was so cute for that baby. For instance the guy who named his kid "Pilot Inspektor"( I think the guy from My name is Earl did that), or Nic Cage naming his kid "Kalel" sounds cute now but when the poor child goes to school you can imagine the superman jokes. Just my opinion, but keep it in mind.|`|cyBcZ1dVaa	Because kids want to fit in, they don't want to stand out.  There are studies out there that show that naming your child something completely weird will have negative effects on them later in life.  Also, your child is going to grow up and enter the work force, and studies have shown that HR people will set aside resumes of people with weird/unique names.  Can you imagine have a boss named Jubilee?  Here is one article I found about unique names:<br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/science/11tier.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tierney,%20John" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/scienc...</a><br>  <br>  I'm not saying name your kids Kaitlyn or Jacob, but you can find names that are unusual but not weird or too unique...like Celeste, Violet, Forrest, and Scarlett.  All names that are not unheard of, and not too far out there.|`|bzfv8aT9aa	Well first of all my grandma's name is Norma. Second of all some of those names you mentioned are a little too out there. I do like unique names but I think you should be reasonable when naming your kids. My name is Brittani and where I live in one store you can always find at least three Brittani's. So uniqueness is a good thing but I think you can take it too far.
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	You should have breast fed him so he wouldn't be so hungry as to eat a cockroach.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL @ Bird Flippin's answer.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Oh Yuck. I doubt if it will hurt him. They seem to live forever, I hope its dead in there. People eat them all the time on TV so I'd just try and keep them out of his diet from now on. <br>  I live in Florida and we have cockroaches that are 3-4 inches long.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	i would call the emergency room they don't charge you to call them. Tell them what happened and see what they say. <br>  <br>  Talk to your parents about getting an exterminator or bug bombing the house.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You must live in filth! Maybe if you cleaned half as much as you preach breastfeeding it wouldn't have happenend!|`|nmu6coapaa	Ladies this person is a troll!|`|J4z3mJyuaa	Don't feel too bad. It happened to my son too! You don't have to live in filth or be crawling in roaches for this to happen. Cockroaches come into houses for water, comfortable temperature, and food supply. They prefer warm temperature and need lots of water (for their size). The big cockroaches don't usually get into your food. They can eat just about anything (including cardboard), but you do need to make sure no food is left open. Make sure your dishes are washed and dried, there are no leaky faucets, etc. <br>  <br>  Cockroaches CAN carry diseases that are transferable to humans, so notify your pediatrician if you're worried or your son starts behaving strangely. I freaked out, but my pediatrician wasn't worried and my son never got sick. It isn't uncommon here in the southeast U.S., because lots of cockroaches thrive in warm, wet climates. Also remember that people often eat cockroaches in some countries. He COULD get sick, but most likely won't.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I guess the 1st question you need to ask yourself is do you have any sort of roach motels or anything like that around?  If you do then the roach may be carrying the poison from that which can be dangerous.  The next question would be if there are "all kinds of bugs" down there, why have you not done something about it?  I would not be allowing my child, nor would my grandparents allow their grandchildren, to be crawling around or sleeping in a place with "all kinds of bugs".|`|g8WQKTNTaa	Maybe he saw it on Intervention <br>                               <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                                           GET A LIFE|`|nKXTjqQWaa	From my understanding formula is worse for a baby than a cockroach.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Call Poison Control and ask. Then find a new place to live, your parents should not have let you in down there until it had been properly exterminated. Yuck!|`|BYfmKhVwaa	you have nothing to worry about cockroaches are not harmful at all just discusting but hell be fine.|`|crZg76Hpaa	Well, he's gotten a good source of protein. I think he'll be fine; you see people eating them on TV so they can't be poisonous.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	HAHA@ bird flippin. I just had the laugh of the day. Oh boy..|`|zOUEE48haa	well iam not sure but watch him very closely see if hes been very fussy, or if hes has diarrea, or even vomiting!!he might have diarrea and thats it.i dont think you should worry that much but if your really concern ask your ped<br>  <br>  also wash his mouth and give him milk. imean he probably get sick of the stomach but i dont think nothing worse<br>  lol one time my sis drank a fly on her drink and she had diarrea like all day she didint know it was there until i told her that theres was a fly there<br>  but just be careful<br>  <br>  if nothing happens well hes ok|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	Awww, poor baby.  I am sure it was very bitter as this is their defense, but other than a bad taste in his little mouth he will be fine.  Hope you get he place exterminated soon, although those darn things can practically live thru anything.  Good luck and relax he will be fine.<br>  <br>  These people don't know how to just answer a concerned mom's question, they have to be all sarcastic.  Hope all is well.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The other questions say that your son is only 3 weeks old, how is he crawling???  Stop wasting your points by asking senseless questions and get a day job.|`|4SDqRs6Laa	I'm sorry you don't have insurance, but I would definitely take him to the ER. Roaches are nasty and could carry bad things. Breast feeding will not make virusses or poison go away.<br>  <br>  FYI, the roaches people eat on tv are NOT the same as the filthy roaches found in homes. They eat all kinds of garbage, rotten things and whatnot and can survive things humans -and even insects- cannot. If you can't afford to just go to the ER for a checkup without symptoms at least call your doctor ASAP!|`|qtCVLDFxaa	Eeewww gross ! I don't think it will seriously make him ill, but I would call his doctor, the E-R or a poison center just to make sure. If he throws up, then so be it, but I wouldn't try to induce vomiting. My friend's son ate half a caterpillar (he showed us the other...) and he just got diarrhea from it.|`|lxPKpS1Saa	Cockroaches are perectly normal. They are just bugs.

LOL!!!
MTr14Obbaa	Sounds like the typical sibling relationship..lol. Seriously, what is the big deal if he wishes to go in another room to pout? It is much better than wanting to hit. I don't want to be held and coddled either when I am upset. Just let him be until he calms down. Moms/nannys whatever can not "get to the bottom of thing and make it right" it is just part of life and growing. The best thing you can do is handle your own reponse. He wants to be alone so let him be, you seem to be causing the yelling by invading his space.|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Ugh.  Sounds like you need to talk to the mother about this.  This is not good behavior for this kid, and it ought to be stemmed now or he'll end up being a worse, spoiled, brat when he's older.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're not the parent, but as the nanny you are the guardian.  That kid needs to learn it's not okay to act like that.  He should respect you.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can put him in "time out"... stand him in a corner until he says he's sorry.<br>  <br>  ADD:  You do not need to cater to, or humor the child either.  Don't forget.... he's a child, and you are his elder.  You should treat him with courtesy and respect... but I think it is inappropriate to reason with a child the way you would another adult.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Welcome to Toddlerhood!!  Basically, you need to use humor and distraction and smooth things out until he calms down.  Once he calms down you can maybe talk with him.  He also needs rules to help him down the road.  Don't expect him to adhere to the rules immediately, but eventually it will help.<br>  <br>  There are tons of books on toddlers and one of my favs is Harvey Karp's "Happiest Toddler on the Block".  If he's hitting anyone or being aggressive, you need to tell him that hitting and being aggressive is unacceptable, but he's allowed to be angry.  "Raising Your Spirited Child" is another book every parent should have, whether or not their chid is spirited or not  :-)
ApyrV5J9aa	The egg lives for 12-24 hours so if you ovulated within the past day there is still a chance that you could get pregnant if you BD soon. If you haven't' ovulated yet than I would start BDing. Unfortunately, a faint line doesn't really tell you much when it comes to OPKs. I always have a light line, with it getting darker the 2-3 days around ovulation. So, a light line will not necessarily mean you are near ovulation. Since you are irregular I would suggest charting and paying attention to CM. It's a pain in the butt, but for a lot of people it works better. In your situation I think it would be worth a shot. Also, after getting off of birth control it may take your body a few cycles before it starts ovulation again. Watching your temps will tell you if you are actually ovulating without wasting a bunch of money on OPKs Good luck!|`|yea2hci5aa	There's no harm in trying now.  Maybe you can take another opk tomorrow or in 2 days and see if the line is darker.  Maybe you're right about to ovulate.  I would continue to have sex now and maybe do it every other day so your hubby can have a day for his sperm count to increase inbetween sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Well, there is always a certain amount of LH in the body, so just because it showed up doesn't mean you are around ovulation. If you have already ovulated then it is too late as an egg is only viable for 12-24 hrs after being released. If you have not yet ovulated though, you still have a chance. Just have sex every other day and hope for the best. Good luck!

hcoQ8j7aaa	My son's teeth did not come in in the usual order either.  He had two front teeth, then molars, then another front tooth, the canines and the last front tooth.  It was weird and he looked like a hippo for a while but his grill is perfect now (just turned two).<br>  The teeth can start and stop a few times before they break through so these may just be moving while she could still get those front teeth first.  Don't worry, not every kid will teeth in the average order.  If you become really concerned, check back with the pediatrician or with a pediatric dentist but until then trust your instincts and the evidence.  It should be just fine.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Of course it happens.  Nature doesn't go by the rules all the time!<br>  <br>  My son got his two bottom teeth first, which is what is normal.  But the second two teeth he got were the top teeth that are right next to the front teeth.<br>  <br>  However, the teeth can fool you.  I thought I knew where his first teeth were coming in, and I was wrong.|`|xzu9bRplaa	Even i do like your daughter does.show her to a magician or a doctor.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Wow your doctor told you that they only come in that certain order?! Might want to find a new doctor! My daughter got her top right tooth first, then the bottom two then the top left. The girl I used to nanny for  got her bottom tow then the "vampire teeth" then the front top ones. There is no "right" way for them to come in. Some kids are born with teeth, and some kids don't get them until they are close to 18 months! Depends on the child!|`|M5HyStReaa	there is no rule saying that incisors have to come through first. normally they will but canines or even molars can appear at the same time or before

Its not a deadly condition and as he gets older he will learn to deal better with things...<br>  .just one note of caution, do NOT force him, when he says i cant do this, as you will activate the anxiety trigger. There is medication for that, but DO NOT go to shrink, your family doctor can prescribe it
AA12022384	This really is a decision only you can make, there is no right or wrong answer, only what is right for you.<br>  <br>  Don't be swayed by anything other than a concern for what is best for you and your life. Many people who have children before they are ready end up resenting their children on a deep level. This is your  life, and your choice to make. If you feel that you can make a go of it, or that you would feel guilty forever for having this abortion, don't have it. If you feel that you really do not want to have a child now, that is also your decision. There are no "good" and "bad" reasons for women to have an abortion. There are only reasons that are good enough for you.<br>  <br>  I looked for an advice centre where you could talk over all your options, something we have many of in Europe but all the ones I found call themselves abortion advice yet seem to be only there to persuade you against abortion. If you know of one which would give you unbiased advice I suggest you go along, it is often easier to make the right decision after talking through all the options.<br>  <br>  The stories about the risks are put about by those opposed to abortion. One large 2007 study examined 11,800 women and found that medically induced abortions did not cause an increase in the risk of future miscarriage or other pregnancy complications. There are of course risks during any medical proceedure.<br>  <br>  Do ignore all those here who sit in judgement or just wish to push their beliefs on to you.<br>  <br>  I liked this article below,  well written and informative.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide to do.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Have you looked into adoption?  It's a hard decision to make, but you don't sound as if you want to have an abortion, and you don't sound ready to care for a child.

I made an adult decision to have sex, I should make another adult decision to take care of my responsibility.

That may seem like it would be extremely hard but this is when you have to think about the baby entirely & whats best for him/her.  There are so many families out there who would die to have a baby & can't because their body just won't let them.  And just think of the happiness you could bring to one of those families.

You seem to be very mature for your age and have already researched a lot of information.  But, the one thing I noticed that you haven't mentioned and most people never do - is ADOPTION.  I was adopted by my very loving parents 23 years ago and am so thankful to them because I could have been aborted.  Now, I am having my first child to my boyfriend and we couldn't be more excited.  Let me tell you though, it was very hard to handle my pregnancy the first few months.  You'll never forgive yourself for aborting the pregnancy.  If you aren't ready to raise this child, and neither is the baby's father - I would look into different adoption agencies.  Most of them will provide all medical care, and compensate you for giving up the baby.  Please consider this.  A great loving family could be waiting for their tomorrow to have a baby.  Your child could be that better tomorrow.|`|mLbydsVIaa	im 15 turning sixteen in 2 weeks and im 7 months preggo due in may..<br>  and i really think you should keep it. <br>  how do you know your parents wont be supportive??<br>  you will regret itif you have an abortion..please dont do that...<br>  keeping the baby will bring more joy than you expected..even if your parents arnt happy...who cares?<br>  its your baby..and you should keep it.<br>  the dad may not be your love now but who knows what will happen later on..?<br>  if not its ok...i know it feels bad to not be in love with your babys daddy but things will be ok...just try to stay friends for the sake of the baby. <br>  abortion= regret and sadness and possible problems with reproduction in the future.<br>  adoption= giving the baby to a loving family... and you will eventually want your baby.<br>  keeping it= joy. lots and lots of future joy. keeping it will bring more joy athan anything. with abortion there is no hapiness and when you keep the baby you gain alot of happiness...with probably barely if any sadness or regrets. especially once you have the baby you wont regret it. also after seeing the first U/S and hearing its HB for the first time and feeling the first kicks....its really special and something you shouldnt mis out on whether or not the babies daddy is with you.<br>  im sure you wont regret keeping it.<br>  your so close to graduation... im 2 years away.<br>  you can do it...try to be positive and things will seem alot better than if you are negative. plus being negative pretty much turns things out to be negative. so really try to be positive. [i know its hard...im struggling with that right now... : / ]<br>  look at the baby as a blessing from above...<br>  not something thats making your life worse..<br>  b/c trust me... it really makes your life much more joyful...much better than if you abort and deal with regret forever.<br>  you wouldnt want to kill a blessing from above would you? srry if that offends you im just trying to tell you what a pregnancy really is...<br>  a blessing <3<br>  you will have some difficult times but all the joy and happiness the baby brings will overpower all that. dont worry...everything will be ok.<br>  hope this helped you....god bless :)|`|zOUEE48haa	the first thing iwould tell you is responsibility. thats the big word here!!i had my son at the age of 20 yes young and inloved but my son is the most happiest thing that has happen to me that is no excuse for you to abort just because your in school, now i think you should confront your consequences.even tough the babys father is not with you you still should have that baby he/she has feeling even tough he/she is very small this little baby wants to meet the world its parents and everthing god created for us.<br>  <br>  i think that now teens always think of abortion and that is not the solution<br>  <br>  look for a job!!tell your babys daddy to take responsibility and work hard for this baby <br>  <br>  when you have this baby in your arms you wont regret have in him/her<br>  its a feeling youll never forget!!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	keep your baby or ADOPT it out. My first got pregnant in April of her senior year in high school...she was 17 and kept the baby and married th dad when her baby was 2. Her little girl is now 7 years old and has an almost 3 year old sister. If she can do it you can do it. You made the decision to have sex now make the decision to step up to the plate and be a parent or give them child to a good home. When you make the chocie to have sex you accept the fact that a baby might come from it.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I think you should keep it, some people can't even have babies.  Try to make it work with the father and get jobs you have time before the baby comes. You can make it work.|`|ZYldgOdTaa	Please dont choose abortion. The baby you hold now is such a fragile part of life that if destroyed, it will alter history forever. Abortion is murder because wether or not it's an adult, it is considered a human. Please make the right choice, don't kill your child.|`|wOSv0Y2gaa	Give it up for adoption like open if u guys really wanna see how its doing...|`|6t76bgS3aa	It's your decision, but some people really are not able to have babies after an abortion.  It happened to someone I know.  I know you are sort of confused right now, but also think of how you will feel in the future.  In 5 years will you see 5 year old kids and think, "my kid would be 5 now if I wouldn't have had an abortion."  Lots of people think about that and there's a lot of guilt.  If you choose to have the baby you might want to consider adoption because there are many couples who would love to raise your baby if you don't think you can but at least then you would have given your child the chance to live.  There are helplines you can call if you need to talk to someone about your options:<br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancycenters.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancycenters.org/</a>|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	Whatever you do...do NOT abort that baby.  That baby didn't ask to be conceived and to take their innocent life away is wrong on many levels.  I've been there and you will regret it with every fiber of your being later on when you mature.  Trust me.  It can tear you apart.  The only option sounds like adoption.  Look into adoption agencies in your area.  You are then doing a huge favor for not only your baby, but for a couple who cannot conceive on their own.  Abortion is the selfish way out.  Please do not do that.  You chose to have sex with someone and thought you were above the consequences.  Well, now you are pregnant and you have to be an adult about the decision.  Adoption is your way to go.  Your baby would thank you if they could.
09db70825677bbcf722475d2959af94eaa	Hey<br>  What the negative blood group means is that you are RH negative.  What happens when you have a child, and they are RH positive your body produces antibodies towards the fetus.  <br>  Your pregnancy is a big deal, because you have already had one child who is RH positive and therefore the antibodies are already there.  So make sure you listen to your midwife and do what she tells you. You will probably have needles and other things.  <br>  Congratulations on being pregnant again - and don't worry too much - it will be ok!|`|M5HyStReaa	if a mother has rhesus negative blood but the father is positive, then the baby might be (50%) positive.<br>  <br>  In this situation the mother might start to create antibodies in her blood against the positive type which might transfer to the baby in the case of bleeding (not across the placenta). These antibodies can cause the baby to require a blood transfusion after birth to prevent illness and possibly death.<br>  <br>  If the father is rhesus negative as well (and in my case) then no anti-D injection is needed to stop these antibodies possibly forming|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's not strange, it's just a problem when you're pregnant. <br>  <br>  Anyone with a negative blood group needs to get a rhogam/anti d injection when you're 28weeks pregnant, usually in your thigh, stomach or bum.|`|hVVALFAPaa	This is called the rhesus (sp?) factor-- you either have this in your blood (positive) or you don't (negative.) More people are positive than negative.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean anything unless your baby is positive. If some of his blood gets into your blood, then your next baby is at risk-- he could even die.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to treat, you get one shot when you are about 25-30 weeks. Then after your baby is born, his blood will be tested. If he is positive, then you will get another shot. <br>  <br>  No big deal if you get the shots, but a VERY big deal if you don't get them.|`|7273c2f9619f41237bda5553ffcdd9ddaa	My midwife wanted me to get my blood tested to see if I am a negative or a positive.  I don't know the reasoning for your midwife but my midwife said it matters if you are going to be having a second child.  If you are a negative and your partner is a positive, a miscarriage would be possible.  Your negative blood attacks the positive like a virus in your system. <br>  <br>  Something like that.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	If the baby is positive you need to get a shot. That way if your and the baby's blood mix and you get pregnant again your body wont attack the next baby|`|ACc1skbPaa	You are RH neg. If the father is RH neg than it isn't a problem.  If he is RH pos, then the baby could be RH pos which would be different from you.  Since the baby is in your body and your RH factor is different from the baby's (potentially) your body could see the baby as an "invading" entity and try to cause you to miscarry...A shot of Rhogam is what is given to you to prevent this from happening.  Please ask your midwife, she should be able to explain this to you so you are more informed should you have any more children...good luck.

Unfortunately you can't control him, what he thinks, what he does, or if he leaves you or not. You can only control your own thoughts and behaviors. Try not to stress to much about him, and focus on you and pregnancy (baby). The baby is more important than all his little immature tactics. Hopefully he won't get to out of hand, just remember pregnancy is temporary, once it over you can work on loosing the weight if you want to. Good luck|`|joPJtKemaa	I don't feel ugly but sometimes I do feel fat and I got a few stretch marks. If he is so not understating he is a jerk.

tLGbtmGsaa	My twins did not start smiling until they reached 3 or 4 months.  My twins were 5 weeks prem so I gather that is why they were late starters.  But once they started to smile they never stopped.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Most babies will smile freely by the time they are 9 weeks old.  My baby started smiling at 4 weeks and now at almost 7 weeks, he smiles at me a lot....particularly after having his nap and then a bottle.  It's probably not a problem, but it wouldn't hurt to mention it to the doctor.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	i don't think they are even supposed to smile until like 4 months
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	There's lots of research to counter what your doctor told you. Lots of women go on to have successful vaginal deliveries after a 'failure to progress' diagnosis, which really isn't your body failing, but your labor being falsely ramped up with Pitocin. Just because you're beginning to dilate and efface doesn't mean the baby was quite ready yet - and you can be dilated for weeks before delivery, even. So I wouldn't bank on his words just yet. <br>  <br>  One thing your research might tell you is that generally Pit inductions with a VBAC are not recommended. Doctors will sometimes do them anyway, or at least more cautiously; but I really think the majority of uterine ruptures that made VBACs get such negative feedback was because they were from Pitocin-augmented labors. My new doctor does use Pit for them and I personally will refuse if he comes within 20 feet of me with that IV. <br>  <br>  There are natural things you can do in labor to help you dilate, like sitting on a birthing ball, doing squats, hot shower or bath, massage, etc. to get your body to relax so it can finish dilating. I walked around a lot in early labor (went to the grocery store! I'm a nut, I know) and showed up dilated to 6 and had her three hours later. You have to be comfortable with your own body and know the signs of labor, etc. I sure wasn't going to show up at the hospital at the first sign of a contraction so they could try and rush me through and then scare me into another section. I took my time laboring at home (four hours) until I was uncomfortable staying home any longer, and I think that helped to be in that relaxed environment where I could be free to walk around, etc. But it all depends on your comfort level. One thing you could do is walk, pace, etc. in the hospital lobby and hang out for awhile and then go up to OB. So at least you'd be right there. <br>  <br>  There are lots of good books you can read and some sites that were very helpful to me, at least. I'll give you the links: (the ones on cephalopelvic disproportion, or 'baby's too big/pelvis is too small' is a common reason doctors give for failure to progress)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/cephalopelvicdisproportion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/birth/small-pelvis-big-baby-cpd" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellybelly.com.au/articles/bi...</a><br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/vbac/a/aa121396.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/vbac/a/aa1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.vbac.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vbac.com/index.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregnancy_birth/cesarean_vbac/sorry-state.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/articles/pregna...</a><br>  <a href="http://vbacfacts.com/vbac/" rel="nofollow">http://vbacfacts.com/vbac/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ican-online.org/vbac/your-right-refuse-what-do-if-your-hospital-has-banned-vbac-q" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org/vbac/your-rig...</a>|`|MtU2yH3gaa	I am in the same boat as you. I was induced and dilated to 5 cm but failed to go anymore, so I had a c-section. I am now pregnant again and they are going to give me an ultrasound to see how big she is around 38 weeks, and if she is anything close to what my daughter was (8lbs 11oz) then they will go ahead and schedule another section. My doctor says that if I go into labor on my own and the baby isn't that big, I can try VBAC. But then the midwife said that once you have a c-section due to failure to progress, you usually don't progress the second time around either. So I guess I just have to wait and see. Good Luck though! I know its been on my mind ever since I became pregnant whether to have a VBAC or not.

Ka52nbhNaa	Fertility meds alone would be less expensive than IUI or IVF as both of these treatments usually require fertility drugs along with the treatment.<br>  <br>  As to better . . . it really depends on why you are struggling to conceive.  What works for one person maynot work for another - medications and treatment plans address different fertility issues.<br>  <br>  You need to consult your doctor, go through some fertility testing and let them go over your treatment options.<br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!|`|vue9NOhYaa	The better treatment would depend on what exactly the problem is.  <br>  <br>  You need to see a good fertility doctor for a complete evaulation. (Hubby too.)  Once the problem is diagnosed, the doctor will recommend an appropriate treatment.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	If you do infertility drugs it is usually suggested that you are also artificially inseminated at the time the Dr. determines is best.  This ups your chance since the sperm is put where it should be and doesn't have to work so hard to get there.  It's a very simple procedure.  Think turkey baster :0)<br>  You should be tested for so many things.<br>  First does your body produce a chemical that is harmful to sperm.  This test is done easily in any OB's office.  You have sex than go to the Dr.  They go up and look for active sperm in your uterus.<br>  You should have your hormone levels checked to make sure everything is fine.<br>  Your husband should be tested for his sperm count and health of sperm.<br>  I'm hoping after 7 years you have done many of these tests.<br>  Some Infertility Dr's have free samples (or extra meds given back by patients to share with others in his office) of the drugs to help with the costs.  You will have to swallow your pride and ask if you chose to go this route.  <br>  At 33 you are not running out of time but you should seriously look into why this is not happening for you.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Kath
rHwHAItGaa	If she's really on birth control and you really haven't had sex without a condom, not even once ... then odds are she's not pregnant and just giving herself a "mental" pregnancy.  I've done that to myself, where I've freaked out about an unprotected sexual encounter too close to my ovulation period and when it came time for me to get a period I made myself mentally pregnant from freaking out about it, my breast really were tender, I missed my period, had morning sickness, the whole nine yards, but took a pregnancy test and it was negative.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry too much about it, it's probably just a scare.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Don't be scared  Be terrified!!!<br>  <br>  You know that pills and condoms and other techniques do not make pregnancy impossible.

0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I don't know if you should try to fight it.  That had to be pretty embarrassing for him, probably exacerbating the anxiety issues - a couple of days off might help him to work up the courage to go back in & interact with the other kids again.  <br>  <br>  But, this would be the perfect time to let school administration know about his problem & ask them to work with you to help your son deal with it appropriately in the classroom (and other school situations).  <br>  <br>  FWIW - my whole family, all 10 of us siblings and mom, too - started giggling uncontrollably in the middle of my dad's funeral service, after my aunt sneezed in a particularly unusual way.  Laughter is a perfectly fine way of releasing tension & pent up emotion.  But, of course, your son should work towards figuring out ways of doing that without being disrespectful to others' feelings.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Have you taken him to the doctor for this? If not, I would definitely use these 3 days and get him checked out and get as many opinions as you can. Explain to the teacher this is bizarre behavior and you are currently working on remedying the problem.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I think the best thing to do is to get him evaluated then approach the school about him being suspended.  That way he can at least make up his missed assignments.  I don't think the school authorities will believe that its a nervous anxiety issue unless you get it checked out.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If its a diagnosed medical condition I'd fight it. The school needs to understand he has a small problem.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes fight it and since you probably already have the Information from the doctors it shouldn't be to hard of a battle.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Sounds to me like there is something wrong and it isn't anxiety issues. Social anxiety issues cause a person to be withdrawn and nervous in large groups - not to laugh inappropriately or in ways you've described. <br>  I think I would definitely talk to a doctor, and get a second opinion if you all ready have. If it were true anxiety disorders they would have prescribed medication for him to help the symptoms and situations.<br>  <br>  As for the school I think they over reacted personally in this situation. Give the kid a detention and let it be. Suspension for this is just ridiculous, HOWEVER, in these days of "zero tolerance" in any form when it comes to the seriousness of things like shootings or threats for schools (and it sounds like the school has a strict no tolerance policy in place) you may not have any argument that they will accept.<br>  You always have the right to talk to the principal and school however, but it doesn't mean they will see it your way.|`|AA12145826	You could certainly try to fight it, however if the school is not aware of his social anxiety (or he's never been formally diagnosed) it might prove to be difficult. I would go to the school to try and explain the situation to them. The suspension may still hold, but as the first poster said (in a less than tactful way) you can use this time to get him formally diagnosed and get that diagnosis on the record at his school so that should the situation arise again, they can manage it differently.|`|ruczpWrGaa	You need to take him to the dr.  Get him a note citing his anxiety.  Then you need to sit with him, his teach, his councilor, and possibly the principal.   Everyone is going to have to work together on this.

I can see the embryo in the sac to the right in your picture, but I don't see anything in the other one.  It could have been the start of another baby that didn't grow, but it is difficult to tell in the picture.  The ultrasound technician should have told you if it was twins.  As for the heartbeat, you are too early in your pregnancy to hear it via Doppler.  You probably won't hear it until around week 12.  Good luck!|`|soFpywFcaa	i sorry that i cant understand the picture better but if you are having twins the doctor would defiantly be able to hear two heart beats next time you go to the doctor ask him to check to be sure|`|330a976d3b1e4541feed377008f77531aa	I think the one on the right is the baby & the one on the left is the placenta.

Of course, some twins play hide and seek but it's uncommon to not see two and pick up both of the heart beats. You do not hear the heartbeat until 8 weeks at the earliest and usually by week 16 at the latest. Also, ultrasounds do not offer sound, but they can pick up the waves and draw a picture simular to the one you see when an adults heart waves are measured.<br>  <br>  good luck with your pregnancy =]
VKQzj4Pmaa	There are some women that nearly everyone finds sexy. These are models or pin up girls, with the perfect breasts, perfect legs, perfect butts, plump lips, doll eyes, gorgeous hair . . . Come on, let's be honest with ourselves. We all know what they look like. However, a woman who does not exactly have model features can still be sexy.<br>  <br>  It's really a point of view a lot of times. A wife's husband can find her very sexy, and another husband may not. So yes, part of it is a state of mind. Confidence has a lot to do with your sexiness level. Many men will admit that confidence is sexy. Many men also admit that if they are with their woman, her low self-esteem and lack of confidence can be a turn-off, or at least not as exciting. Or, so I read on a men's website once . . .<br>  <br>  Chemistry also plays a factor. I have met nice, good looking men, but for some reason, there was just no chemistry. And then other times I have met nice men who may or may not be the greatest looking men, but there was undeniable chemistry right off the bat. You either have a connection, or you don't. And that does not depend solely on looks. So if there is chemistry and there is a connection . . . Then maybe you both have love handles, double chins and a big nose, but to each other you are sexy.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Well, if I could exactly define sexy, it would be a guy with long-ish (shoulder length) bronze hair, blue eyes, tanned, 6-pack, sense of humor, very nice, loves hugs, helps out all the time, great at sport, smart.<br>  Of course, getting the perfect person will never happen, and my fiance has 7 out of 10, so I don't really mind.<br>  I think, like beautiful, sexy is in the eye of the beholder.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I define "sexy" as being attracted to ALL aspects of a person.  I'm attracted to my husband's mind, soul, and body.  It's sexy when I see him take care of the kids, especially when you see him rocking Riley.... boy does that turn me on to see a sensitive caring man!<br>  <br>  My husband is also a very good looking guy (at least that's what I think!).  His charm and his body are big turn ons to me too.  But I take more to a state of mind than I do a perfectly shaped body.  He's also confident about his body which I also find attractive.<br>  <br>  Example of that:  My husband has a very defining scar on his side that I just think is a very sexy thing.  He got this scar while in Iraq.  Nothing turns me on more than my sexy military vet and his battle scars, LOL.|`|j2mRop0laa	I just look in the mirror...<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok I'm kidding..<br>  <br>  I think physical appearance matters to an extent (nice clean teeth, smells good, great hygiene, dressed appropriately etc)<br>  <br>  Personality traits: I think a sense of humor and a great laugh can make someone very sexy. Intelligence, too.. but more so, a sense of humor to me.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	A little of both, you can have the most blobbiest body but if you wholeheartedly believe and feel that you are sexy you're going to strut your stuff just like someone who is pin thin.<br>  <br>  I know my body isn't ranking top at the sexy list, but my mind state lets me know that yes I am sexy, yes I do have a husband who thinks I'm sexy. It's all about having confidence in yourself and your bod.<br>  <br>  ETA- I'm feeling much better, even though that question I asked was reported. What a glorious cloudy Friday!<br>  <br>  Jen that was the only word that popped into my head at the moment. Blobbiest lol, I'm with you with my husband kissing me randomly that ranks high on my sexiness level. Or like last night he brought me home some roses. I gushed honestly and he just seemed to ooze "sexiness" out. I love my hubby (when he's not saying something loony).|`|8oAlBL91aa	I'll just copy my answer from that one and also define the best I can....<br>  <br>  Oh heck no I don't find myself sexy anymore. My husband says he likes me the way I am but I think he only says that lol. <br>  <br>  I'm 22 and do you believe I'm getting wrinkles already!!!! I have battle scars from my first and now preggo with the second is giving me stretch marks in places I didn't even think was stretching (my bum lol), having a boy so getting those nice little hairs on my belly that's not so bad as having saggy boobs haha. Gosh with my first I had nice perky ones now that I'm pregnant the girls are always looking at the ground. <br>  <br>  <br>  Yep I'm a mess lol. BUT it is all part of who I am and my family still loves me and I'm not trying to impress anyone so a few extra pounds never hurt anyone right. Now pass the cupcakes lol. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think it's sexy that my husband finds me sexy. I also find it sexy when he does manly things like fixes stuff, not like that happens a lot lol things tend to stay broken around here until I get to them.|`|NuvKPl3naa	well i think personality and doing the best you can is sexy as far as my husband i am hoping he finds, laugh lines, crows feet, gray hairs here and there, flabby arms, saggy boobs, stretch marks, 20 over weight and scaly feet from being bare foot all the time sexy.|`|sxecXFgraa	I think "sexy" is a state of mind, how confident you feel about yourself.  I don't believe there is a perfect body and most definitely not in Hollywood.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	I think "sexy" is when something is physically sexually appealing to me. Such as my husbands buff arms- I find that so sexy. I don't think Sexy is a state of mind- that is just your self confidence.. You can feel sexy though!  after all, the definition of sexy is: 1. concerned predominantly or excessively with sex; risqué: a sexy novel. 2. sexually interesting or exciting; radiating sexuality: the sexiest professor on campus. 3. excitingly appealing; glamorous: a sexy new car.|`|AA12145826	I love how it looks like Y!A flipped your details and description LoL<br>  <br>  How do *I* define sexy? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure I'm not it. LoL I would say "sexy" is probably my pre-motherhood word for what I feel I now consider to be "attractive" or "womanly". Does that make any sense?<br>  <br>  Its weird, but to me "sexy" is almost an immature word. Like it doesn't transcend beyond looks. My hubby calls me "beyond beautiful" which is perfectly fine by me and means a lot more than "sexy".|`|nfzQkvqraa	Blobbiest....that's a good word.<br>  <br>  Well carrie I pretty much agree with the way you answered your last question.  Compared to the hollywood/society standards, I'm not the sexiest. Not after the two kids.<br>  <br>  But there are days when I feel really sexy.  Maybe my husband looked at me the right way.  Or someone randomly gave me a compliment.  Or I had time to really get myself together.  Then I feel sexy.  I think a lot of times you have to feel sexy to be perceived that way.<br>  <br>  I think my husband is sexy when he does something really nice for the kids. Or when he comes up and kisses me randomly.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'd say it's a little bit of both honestly! You could have a perfectly shaped body and still not find yourself "sexy" because of your state of mind...<br>  <br>  EDIT" Hollywood's consideration of "sexy" has no bearing on how I find my self what so ever! I'd have to loose another oh say about 30-40 lbs for that and look like an anorexic for that!|`|5UdgZEn4aa	I don't think sexy is all about looks exactly. When my wife comes home all dirty and tired from I long day at work I think she is so sexy because she's working hard for our family. She tells me I'm sexy when my hair is up in a bun and I put on one oher dress shirts and my slippers and clean the house LOL.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	To me, sexy is having the confidence to think you are sexy. I know my body is not perfect, but when my husband looks at me I know that he thinks I am the hottest woman in the world and that makes me have confidence in myself and feel sexy.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I think it's really sexy when my husband does housework!|`|5p7gpj36aa	Sexy is when you can respect the way a man is with his family.  Is that why my sex drive has been low?
vOFdHvlvaa	My son is only about 9 months old (not quite he will be on Mar. 3rd) but my son has an 8 ounce bottle of formula before each meal, then at breakfast he eats 3 ounces of baby oatmeal mixed with 1 ounce of formula, and 2.5 ounces of a stage 1 fruit, for lunch he eats 3 ounces of baby rice cereal mixed with 1 ounce of formula, and 2.5 ounces of a stage 1 fruit, and for dinner he eats 3 ounces of baby rice cereal mixed with 1 ounce of formula, and 2.5 ounces of a stage 1 veggie.  He also has 2 other 8 ounce bottles throughout the day.<br>  It sounds like ur son eats enough at lunch to me anyways lol since that’s the only meal u said, and if ur son seems like he’s happy afterwards than I’m sure he is getting enough.<br>  How much solid food does he get throughout the day and how many ounces of formula/breast milk (don’t know which he gets lol) does he get throughout the day, cuz then I’d be able to tell u better if he is eatin enough.<br>  But if he seems happy with the amount ur giving him and he’s healthy and gaining weight then I’m sure he is getting enough.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.

d463c686f5093f6cd2cd7e58248297a4aa	At about 13 or 14 weeks. Good luck with your twins. They are a blast. Mine are 4 months old.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I felt the very first faint flutters at 14 weeks, one day.  My doctor told me that is early for most mothers of multiples, but I am very thin and have no stomach fat to cushion so it was possible.  I'm 20 weeks now, and the movements are usually very faint still, but once in a while I'll get a good poke somewhere.  Congrats and good luck!|`|C55pji5Qaa	1st pregnancy and I felt the flutters at 14 weeks.I felt kicks at 16 weeks but not consistent until around the end of my 18th weeks.Congrats to you!|`|8z03BV5Saa	I am pregnant with twin girls and I felt my girls kick at 16wks4d.|`|s1utniuvaa	This is my 3rd pregnancy but I was sure I could feel things at around 9 weeks...
aLAmvX5Naa	Call me weird but when my daughter was born I poured the shampoo in my eyes, I brushed my teeth with it, I tried lots of things so I'd KNOW what would happen if it got in my baby's eyes/nose/mouth.<br>  <br>  Your baby is fine, don't feel bad.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I haven't had that happen, just wash it out really good. I put it on a baby loufa and then I wash the baby so it doesn't get in her eye and then I wipe her face off with a wash cloth.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	Yes, I get the baby wash in my son's eyes sometimes when I'm washing his hair. He won't let me tip his head back so it is almost impossible to keep it out of his eyes. I feel bad, but I know he will be okay.|`|AA10826403	I didn't just because I tried it on myself first to make sure it wouldn't hurt him.
VY4LqfLpaa	heck yeah!  clothes are expensive to begin with...but hey, we can wear them for a while...baby clothes on the other hand are expensive too and they don't even have time to get worn out before baby has outgrown them...I have a friend who has a little boy about a year older than our son...she saves up what her son has outgrown and I get up with her and get clothes from her...depending on how much she gives me I give her anywhere from like $20-$50 for the clothes (most of it is like GAP and Old Navy so I definitely get my money's worth)...<br>  <br>  c'mon people...what's the deal with all the thumb's down on EVERYBODY'S answer!!!!|`|CJJTdjw6aa	I bought used and sold my used when the kids were little. Now they are bigger and I still buy used if it's in decent shape and I also trade with people who have kids that can use my kids stuff and I can use theirs. No sense in buying all new when they outgrow them and stain them. Of course there are things I buy new like underclothing and socks and sometimes I just like to get them a new outfit but mostly it is used decent clothes.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	My son has some used clothes and hand me downs, and he also has a lot of new clothes. I don't think there is anything wrong with buying used baby things. My son's high chair, changing table, and stroller were all bought at a yard sale. My SIL is the same way about not buying used baby stuff. She wants all new stuff for my niece, but the only problem is she can't afford the new stuff. She refuses anything I offer her that was my son's because it isn't "new".|`|G4qP2gATaa	I don't care if my babys clothes are used or not. All of the clothes I have so far are hand me downs.<br>  <br>  ( I hate thumbs down trolls!)|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I never have actually bought any used clothes, but my friend Kate does for her son, and i've gotten alotta her sons' hand-me-downs for my son, lol so i have alotta used clothes for him but i didn't hafta buy them lol.<br>  And yea clothes are so expensive lol, so i'm glad to get the hand me downs so i don't hafta buy so many.<br>  Lol sorry ur younger sis sounds like a bit a brat, i'm 17 too and i don't see anything wrong with used stuff, but then again i'm a mom and i'm mature for my age.  And sorry if i offended u with sayin that, it's just an observation, obviously i'm only basin this off of one thing u said, so yea, again sorry if i offended u with sayin that.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Absolutely.|`|wBpennsMaa	I do!|`|rTACLd3Saa	OMG YES!!!  Most of my daughter's wardrobe is from consignment shops like Once Upon A Child and she's the best dressed kid in town!  I chuckle to myself every time I buy her like ten Gymboree/Zutano/Childrens Place/Baby Gap outfits for about $40.00.  Let some other moron pay that for one outfit.  Their kid will wear it once or twice then outgrow it and I get it for next to nothing.  Last Summer there was this beautiful white dress with black embroidery on it that I soooooo wanted for my daughter.  It was way too expensive for my single mom budget so I didn't buy it.  Then, just this week I was in OUAC and there it was!  Brand new, with the tags on being sold for $8.50!  I'm so excited!  ANd my daughter will look so much cuter in it this summer because she'll be walking and everyone can see how cute she is in her pretty dress!<br>  <br>  Oh!  and about a month ago I got the top of the line Baby Bjorn (with the lumbar support and everything) for $20!!!  When I'm done with it I will probably sell it on Craigslist for double that too!  You gotta love second-hand!  Your younger sister probably hasn't realized how expensive real life is yet.  At 17 kids tend to be too self involved to be practical about anything!  She'll get a quick reality check when she has the baby - unless you guys are trust fund babies or baby daddy is extremely rich, she'll change her mind.|`|yjDAg8v7aa	We just moved, but our previous city didn't have any nice used shops! So I started buying all of my son's clothes on clearance in larger sizes (I bought summer in winter, I bought winter in summer) for cheap cheap cheap brands new! My step mom was sending him tons of clothes in great shape that she found at garage sales for cheap. I figure they grow so quickly that they are rarely worn, why not?!|`|LhvKTYftaa	oh hell ya!!  if they are clean and stain free for sure.  I have also been known to buy some (or take ones that are given to me) with stains for when we got to the family farm.  the rest of us have farm clothes, why shouldnt he.  I find I get better quality clothes most of the time for less than a lower quality new outfit would cost!  I have bought Gap, Carters, Carhardt overalls (2 pairs $2 each, reg $45 a pair), Kenneth Cole, Ralph Lauren etc..  Used clothes are great!!|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	Heck yeah! Used clothes, toys, everything except the carseat. I even found a perfectly good baby swing put out with someone's trash the other day - brought it home, cleaned it, and my daughter is using it for her dolls until we decide to have #2!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Hell yes I do. <br>  We're in a global recession, most of us need to pull our purse strings a bit. Not to mention that it is recycling which is of course more socially responsible.<br>  I wash everything myself before use though.<br>  I buy from ebay, charity shops, anywhere that I can really.<br>  ETA - wow, there's a thumbs down SNOB in here!|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	oh heck yes. why not? just wash it & it's perfect! you can get "new" clothes for dirt cheap. the way kids go thru clothes, dirty them, stain the, ruin them & out grow them so fast & with how much clothing costs in stores, HECK YEAH i buy them.  :)|`|0QYIbn1saa	Yep, absolutely.  I love going to used clothing stores and coming home with piles of new clothes for my son for $10!!!!  No shame here.  I buy used for myself, too.  Nothing like "new" jeans that are already worn in....|`|BRT2teSqaa	Of course!  All I do of course is wash it before it's worn.  I myself also wear used clothes from the thrift store.  I bought 3 Express sweaters and 1 Gap fleece last time!  :)  Perfectly fine.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	absolutely!  I'll get my son a few new things, but mostly he wears used clothing.  Why not?  They don't wear their clothes long enough to continually buy them new.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I buy used,  all it takes is one wash and guess what they are used.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	i do its called a Clarance rack you buy in advance . but you should not care|`|ieGiQ1vgaa	We have a wonderful used clothing store in my town that has only baby stuff.  It is organized and they only take clothing in good shape.  I spend three dollars on clothing that looks brand new.  I think with that being an option, why by it new on a regular basis?|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I have lots of new stuff that we got as gifts....but for sure I love shopping for used stuff! They grow out of it so darn fast, it's almost insane to buy all new stuff really!  I love thrift store and garage sale shopping!  You can find some great deals that way!|`|fUC4wCCEaa	Sometimes.<br>  If I find something worth buying while I am thrifting I will buy it.<br>  I found a really adorable sweater that had a snowman on it by Ralph Lauren and used it for his Christmas pictures.  It looked brand new.  You would have never known ;)|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I've bought new and used. I like garage sales.<br>  <br>  And of course a 17 year old wouldn't go in a thrift store.  They're too good for that kind of thing.|`|UupHu7Lqaa	Yes my son used clothes as long you wash them nothing is wrong as long it's clean and look still good then it's should be fine. Cause baby are fast grown out of clothes so you save your money.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Babies don't know if their clothes are new or used. Why spend a ton of money on something your kid will outgrow in a month anyway?<br>  <br>  I think it is just spoiled that a 17 year old mommy is "too good" for used baby clothes. What kind of magical job does she have that she makes so much money that she can afford everything new? Where I live there are very few high school kids who make over $8 per hour and they can't work more then 18 hours a week.<br>  <br>  I love used clothes and toys. I love garage sales and craigslist.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  I love buying my son new things. Like for his birthday, all his clothing is new. But a lot of his shorts for this summer are used and from my cousin. I know he's going to be walking by then and will be outside a lot so they are going to get dirty and torn. There, to me, is just no point in buying EVERYTHING new.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Heck yes I do.   Clothes are expensive and kids (at least my kids) tend to be very very hard on clothes.  I see no reason to spend $30 for something that they will have ripped, stained, faded, or grown out of in a matter of a few days to a couple weeks.   So while I do buy them new clothes occasionally, mostly the clothes that they play around in and where at home are used from used stores or hand me downs.   Heck even some of their "nice" clothes are from used stores and hand me downs.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	heck yeah i do, babies grow out of their clothes so fast they rarely get to ruin them...i see no problem at all with putting used clothes on my kids....matter of fact, i just got  4 white kitchen bags plumb full of clothes for my 15 month old off of freecycle, half of them still had the tags. the rest didnt look worn hardly at all...you could tell a couple pairs of the  pj's had been wore.. i gues they were the favorites lol, but now i only have to buy my son a few  nice outfits, instead of having to divide the money up for ALL his clothes.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	definitely!!<br>  you can find some super cute and UNIQUE baby clothes!<br>  i LOVE getting used clothes. sometimes you can't even tell they've  been worn!|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Yes.  And I often find things made years ago, are far better made than the new store stuff, where the elastic gets loose 2 hours after wearing.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i sure do! kids grow out of things so fast that it just makes sense to buy used. i buy new stuff for my son too but why not get the playclothes that are going to be thrashed used? it makes it so much easier to say "oh theres a stain already? oh well..."<br>  <br>  but when i was a teen i didnt want to be seen at the used clothes stores either... my mom shops at them too and i would refuse to go in with her. once you come around though you can find some great buys!|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Why not!?  I got lots of hand me downs and most of them still look new.  He only wears an outfit once or twice before he grows out of it anyway.  I do buy him some new stuff too, only because it's irresistible those cute little things but I have no problem with used clothing.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I know I buy used,if it's in a decent condition. I have hand me downs as well (for my daughter,when she was young,she's now 5,but as a newborn/baby,yes I'd buy them that way). Chances are,they're going to get destroyed anyways,what's it matter? I still buy them like that for her.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Yes, I do! We have 3 kids and it gets downright expensive. My oldest is getting harder to buy for from the 2nd hand store but I keep looking. We have city wide garage sales here in MN, over 200+ homes have sales. I take an entire day to go clothes shopping. Its fun too :-)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I buy a lot of used clothes. I love to go to garage sales. I find tons of cute clothes for my whole family. I buy my son new clothes too, but I definitely don't pass on clothes just because they are used.<br>  <br>  Edit: Wow, you really have a thumbs down fairy today.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I see absolutely nothing wrong with it. They are in their clothes for such a little time anyways when they are younger because they grow so quickly. Why waste the money buying them all brand new clothes every three months? I buy my kids new clothes as well but I buy them used too.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I haven't so far.  That's not to say I wouldn't, but there's not really any charity shops that I know of where I normally shop.  And I've not looked on eBay for them yet.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	95% of my son's clothes are used. What he gets new is from gifts. If the clothes are in good shape there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.
pXSKSS3daa	I think, no matter the race, babies are cute.<br>  <br>  However, I believe MY son is the best looking. As I'm sure all parents think that way about theirs.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I think you generalize too much, asians have as many ugly babies as anyone.  some of the prettiest  little babies  i have seen are mixed black/white... but theres cute and ugly in all creeds and colors.........the most beautiful babies in the world though are the two i gave birth to   lol|`|X6as2nOAaa	I of course think my own child is the cutest but most mother's due and my baby is white and native. So she is really pretty. I think every kind of baby will have some ugly babies and some cute babies. I have seen some really cute asian babies and some really ugly ones. Sorry to say. I like big huge eyes.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder for all ages.  I personally don't find Asian babies/children that cute actually.  I tend to find biracial (black and white usually) babies the cutest!|`|eu6UQElYaa	I think that there are super cute babies of all races and really rather ugly babies in all races.  I don't think one single race has cuter babies than the others.<br>  MHO|`|rAkWoweOaa	not necessarily.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	My niece is Japanese/Filipino and Romanian, she is super cute!!!!  My sister (her Aunt) was babysitting her and a lady from Ford Model's came up to her and gave her a card wanting her to model!<br>  <br>  But I still think my son is WAYYYYY cuter ;) <br>  He is Mexican/Costa Rican and Romanian ;)|`|mqvxIgRdaa	babies are no doubt cute but my baby is half white Italian and half black he is one cute good looking baby. i dont think asian babies are as cute they all look the same to me|`|nYioXmnGaa	All babies are cute but my two are the best !!|`|txv7TIgiaa	ithink you are racist
YQ45AV3iaa	The expectant woman is now the mother of a newborn but after giving birth is more likely to suffer PostPartum Depression (PPD), particularly if you have any of the factors that increase the risk of developing this condition.<br>  <br>  A healthy pregnant woman should not suffer from PostPartum depression but having a medical history of mental illness increases the risk to suffer it, the same as those women who already had any kind of clinical depression.<br>  <br>  Emotions also take a direct part in developing this type of depression, particularly observed in women with perfectionist personalities that simply do not want to accept the baby as is but somewhat discouraged because the baby does not meet all their demands or expectations.<br>  <br>  In addition, the difficulties experienced by the woman during her pregnancy increases a PostPartum Depression risk, including a death or illness in the family, marital stress, lose of confidence, moving to a new home, or any other issue that occurred during pregnancy when women are more vulnerable to stress, anxiety and depression.<br>  <br>  A woman suffering PostPartum Depression should join a support group to reduce the stress and anxiety levels associated with this condition. In fact, there are groups for pregnant women organized by communities and hospitals in which the participants help each other to relief this pain and the isolation that comes after having given birth.<br>  <br>  Communication with your husband, family and friends is also crucial to avoid depression or aiding in getting rid of it and getting back to your normal activities, including having sex plus caring for your newborn.|`|QpyMklDGaa	go ahead and talk to your doctor about getting on some kind of medication once the baby is born. I am due any day now and i am starting welbutrin once my son is born.|`|wqRSMSlLaa	Yes!  You can at least minimize your risk greatly by setting up a strong plan of action right away.  Take a look at Postpartum Depression For Dummies.  It will tell you how to help avoid postpartum depression with nutrition, emotional and physical support and how to arrange for some nighttime sleep even when you're a single mother.<br>  <br>  Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|poeYXBlfaa	You may or may not get it. It's never been proven that it really does exist and only in recent years has researched started to come out about it. <br>  <br>  Either way, some mothers have reported feeling so depressed that they've committed a murder-suicide. Thing is, if you expect to get it, you probably will.
nYioXmnGaa	For natural birth I  had to stay  for  three or four days ! With my C section I had to stay in the hospital for five or  six days !|`|dDVAUA9saa	If you have an epidural you have to stay 24 hours.  If not, you can go home 3-4 hours after delivery if you want.<br>  <br>  Edit - I live in Canada, looks like the rules are different here.  My friend had her baby at 1:30 and was home by 6pm.  I stayed overnight one nigh because of the epi.|`|57389f506490a5ebd9798a3a388fb6f5aa	I went in to the hospital at 5:30 am on march 17th, gave birth at 12:30 march 17th and went home march 19th around noon! I didnt tear or get an episiotomy though I had a pretty easy birth.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Usually 2 days.|`|AA10826403	I was in the hospital 3 days.|`|d463c686f5093f6cd2cd7e58248297a4aa	1 day unless there are complications.|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	For however many days your insurance will pay for :)|`|5yBAMbIZaa	until you feel  good enough to take care of not only you but ur baby|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Apparently I guess it depends on the hospital, lol. Normally, I thought it was 2 days for a normal vaginal birth, but I just looked on the hospital's website for where i'm giving birth and if it's your second baby you stay one day. I didn't think it mattered if you had children before but I guess I was wrong. Normally, it's 2 days. I had my 3 year old son Thursday at 1050 PM and was out by Saturday afternoon, so I guess it depends on your situation. I'd say 2 days is a safe bet though.|`|1Mt104VCaa	It depends on your insurance and if all goes well during birth . If you have private insurance any amount of time (that you are willing to pay). I was on medicaid and they kick you out after two days starting when the baby was born whether or not you had c-section. I didn't have to pay for food or any other enmities as with all private insurance.|`|DcFPU0bNaa	There is no set time, depends on how well you both are. i am a young mum and had a totally natural birth, i did not want to stay in hospital, and as all was well they only made me stay 6 hours after the birth.<br>  good luck xx|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I believe vaginal is around 2-3 days and c-section are 4-5.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	24 hours or less if your baby is fine.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	With my daughter I was in the hospital for 2 days, with my son I was discharged the day after, so only 1 day.|`|KozoNqpsaa	If all goes well, about a day and a half depending on your insurance company's rules and what time of day you give birth. For example, when my daughter was born at 3:24am on a Sunday, I was discharged around 11am on Monday.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	My sister in law stayed 3 days with her first and less than 24 hours with her second.  It depends how your delivery goes and how you and baby are doing after delivery. (I stayed 3 days with my c section)|`|AA10447831	The baby, not you, has to stay 24 hours at a minimum.   You probably want to hang around with him.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I had my son Saturday and was home Monday.  I hope to do the same or hopefully if everything goes well go home sooner.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	at the least 24 hours. most of the time you are in there 2 to 3 days.
m0clxdoFaa	She is getting ready to go thru her 12 week development.  I highly recommend the book The Wonder Weeks.  It takes you thru the 8 deverlopment growth states of the first year and what to expect to happen etc.  These are classic signs of a leap coming:<br>  <br>  They demand more attn<br>  Become shy with strangers<br>  Lose their appetite<br>  Might be more clingy<br>  May sleep poorly<br>  My just cry and cry<br>  sucks their thumb more<br>  <br>  <br>  They may exhibit some or all or none of these.<br>  <br>  <br>  This fussy period should only last around a week.  The next big growth spurt is at 19 weeks and then 26 weeks.  <br>  <br>  I think you should get this book and then it will all make sense :)|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Have YOU ever had a night where you just couldn't sleep?  Tossed and turned all night?  Just restless.  Our little ones get like this too.  Maybe she was just having a bad night.  Try it again tonight.  If she's still fitful, see your doctor.  There could be an underlying issue causing discomfort.  <br>  <br>  Just remember, they're the same as us and will occasionally have a bad day/night.  Maybe whatever it was worked it's self out and tonight will be a better night for her and for you.  <br>  <br>  My little one didn't sleep more than 6-8hrs in a 24hr period (and those hrs were during the day) for the first 6 weeks of her life.  Now she's doing much better, sleeping most (if not all) through the night.  But we still occasionally have nights like you described.  Waking often, but not feeding often.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, she could be teething.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	is she pooping and haveing wet diapears?  she could have gas on her bell my daughter tabitha had horrible gas on her belly for months when she was little, try this, go to the store they make a baby gas drop medication to help releave gas on there bellys and if they don't work see the dr maybe the formula or something else could be hurting her|`|NFyQWFoGaa	You should talk to a doctor; that's why they are there. Good luck!|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Does your daughter show any other signs of illness, like a fever or sniffly nose?  It's possible she is developing an ear infection; they can cause babies to be very irritable and sleep very poorly.  Also it can make them not want to nurse/ have a bottle because the pressure of sucking hurts their ears.<br>  <br>  It's also possible she will be an early teether.  The chewing behavior you mentioned could indicate her gums are uncomfortable.  Another sign of teething would be increased drooling.  Some babies begin teething as early as 3 months (my son did).  Try offering her a washcloth damp with cool water to chew.  <br>  <br>  If you feel comfortable giving her pain reliever, could can give a young baby a small dose of infant acetomenophen (Tylenol or Paracetamol).  Be careful to dose according to her weight.  Try this at bedtime and see if it helps her sleep better.<br>  <br>  If the behavior seems to be a sudden change and continues more than 48 hours, or if you are concerned, I would advise you to call the pediatrician.|`|Kl0ZxAW2aa	My baby is just like that since we went home from the hospital. Your baby could have gas or upset stomach. The idea of having a tooth is possible but still somewhat early for that. Try letting her sleep on her tummy with a pillow that is just right on her waist. That certainly helped my baby reduce some gas.<br>  <br>  Your baby feeding 1/2 a bottle every time could be because she hasn't burped yet. My baby pushes the nipple with his tongue and cries to tell me that he needs to burp. And once he has burped, he's ready to feed again. My doctor even approved of that. Babies burp sound just like ours so you won't miss it.<br>  <br>  Her sucking almost anything and salivating a lot does not necessarily means that they're popping a tooth. They are usually just getting ready to eat some solids in a couple more months. Make sure you wipe those off cause it may chaff your baby's chin.
qJBMdL7gaa	My hubby has that phone, I like the looks of it, but alot of the features the phone has are really generic to me. It is also more difficult to use than other phones. Also, it is kinda hard to slide open. I think its because its made more out of metal or something. Just check with the place you are gonna buy your phone, alot of them you are able to return your phone within 30 days if you dont like it :)|`|B7zL81whaa	I have it. I have for almost a year. I wouldnt recommend it. It has a HORRIBLE battery life. Like sometimes it doesnt last half a day. It does get scratched easily if you keep it in your pant pockets like I do with the taking it out often. Not the best but it looks cute.|`|LaUouVtfaa	I love it, it doesn't get scratched easily at all, and when it's light in the room, the front of the phone gives off a reflection, it's like a mirror. And it's wicked cool that you can record a lot of videos. But you can't record things and use them as ringtones, that's what sucks about it. I have the black one.|`|MH9Z5K0taa	I have the red LG shine, its a very nice phone but yes it will scratch very easy . I think the LG view is much better and it comes with gps and other cool stuff.   P.S.  my husband has the same phone, he already broke his twice .    good luck.|`|rV4uJVWmaa	Overall its a good phone, has a awesome camera! Having a big screen i does scratch easily, but you can buy a little case for it for about 30 bucks. Dropped mine 194 times and it still works fine.
Q05rrSX4aa	Different things can change your period, stress, exercise change, diet change etc.  Since you had a period I would say you are not pregnant.  If the period was much lighter and not like a normal period, then I would say that you could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Get a blood test if you think that you could be, but I would say you are probably not.|`|HFRP1Qzgaa	dont stress over it ya have to waita week after your period was due to take the hpt read the back and it does say that|`|5puE2Qfpaa	You know that method is the quickest way to get pregnant, but wait til' tomorrow and then take a test. You can take now the 5 day before test. Also the older we get our cycle change.|`|psWxRqSfaa	nana your not preggers,<br>  feeling moody atm?<br>  i know i do before i come on my period|`|DwkUUQqhaa	Wait a bit and see what happens, but I don't think your pregnant.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful day! <3
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You basically get the same amount no matter what type of formula you choose.  Its just the difference of rounding it up so its a whole number of containers so there can be a small amount of difference.<br>  <br>  WIC is NOT designed to provide every drop of formula a baby consumes, nor every bite of baby food.  It is a nutritional SUPPLEMENT only.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/health/fhs/wic/breastfeedingpromsupp.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.nj.us/health/fhs/wic/br...</a><br>  WIC is a supplementary program and does not provide all the formula the baby needs; WIC mothers still have to buy some formula. Since breastfed babies are healthier, less money is spent on doctors and medications.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/archive/2008/12/03/baby-nearly-starves-diluted-formula-to-blame.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerd...</a><br>  Morris said federal law prohibits WIC from giving more. "It's never meant to cover 100 percent of the nutrition," she said.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0887/is_n1_v11/ai_11971287" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...</a><br>  The authors note that the amount of infant formula provided by the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is insufficient to meet the needs of many infants aged over three months. (The infants in this study were aged four to six months.) Mothers may exhaust their supply of WIC-provided formula before the end of the month, and some may resort to giving their infants other liquids. The authors acknowledge that the WIC program is intended to be supplemental, but some mothers may presume that the program supplies everything the infant needs, "and are reluctant or unable to use their food stamps or cash to buy infant formula." A disappearance of alternate (non-WIC) sources of free infant formula and a sharp increase in the retail price compounds the problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/benefitsandservices/foodpkgtable.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/benefitsands...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Infant Formula (concentrated liquid)2  403 fl. oz.   <br>  #<br>  <br>    Powdered or ready-to-feed formula may be substituted at the following rates:  8 lbs. powdered per 403 fluid oz. concentrated liquid; and 26 fluid oz. ready-to-feed per 13 fluid oz. concentrated liquid.<br>  #<br>  <br>    Additional amounts of formula may be approved for nutritional need, up to 52 fluid oz. concentrated liquid or 1 lb. powdered or 104 fluid oz. ready-to-feed.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I'm not sure on that kind. I get the powdered and it is 9 cans a month. It doesn't work for the whole month but I am grateful for the help. Cricket, if you think about it, even people that are on WIC are in essentail helping to pay for it by paying their taxes, so get off your high horse and don't answer questions if you are going to be rude!! I hate those people that think they are better than everyone else. It's a huge help for a lot of people.|`|qYNCV6L1aa	i just wanted to respond to cricket since apparently not everyone is affected by the poor economy like us NORMAL people, but as a full time working mother (which I'm sure is considered being a "bad parent" to a stuck up snob like cricket) I pay my taxes that go towards gov't funded programs like WIC so before you get judgemental you need to be more considerate of ppl who are losing their jobs, losing their homes, and are doing everything they can to care for their families and if that means receiving gov't assistance that's set up specifically for the purpose of helping middle to low income working families then more power to them.|`|zDeEaja0aa	All you have to do is call your local WIC office and they can inform you of the exact quantity. <br>  It will still probably not be enough though. When I had my son I was on WIC and every month I was still going out buying 4 to 6 large cans of powdered formula.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I believe it's 9 cans a month, but everyone i know who is on WIC, it's not intended to cover the whole months supply of formula, just help out with the expenses. Once they start taking more, it's not a full months supply.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I am in California and I get 31 cans of concentrate. They're small.  And they actually do last a months' time, depending on how much and how quickly my daughter eats it.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	its one can a day. but if your little one is like mine you will have to buy more cans. we have to buy an extra 35-50dollars worth of cans a month. the cans are like 4.00 a piece.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I am not sure about the concentrated formula. My son used powdered formula and we received 9 cans a month.|`|Kl0ZxAW2aa	Talk to your WIC worker and they're not so tight in helping mothers get what they deserve. My worker asked me how my baby feed in 24 hours and I told her, 4oz every 2-3 hours so she gave me the maximum of 9 cans a month. My baby couldn't even spend all that in a month but still great since I'm saving over $125.00. I'm not sure how many for the concentrated one but ask your worker. I'm sure she's willing to help you.|`|zaF5gd48aa	WIC is getting really picky on types of formula and I know the max is 9 cans of powered but i dont think the do the concentrated.

He is only two months so im sure as he gets bigger ill have to start buying some extra cans each month.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	She didn't say she wanted the formula to last the whole month, she asked IF it would...stop the judging!  I so hate people who have nothing better to do than answer people's questions with their rude comments.  Get a life.  <br>  <br>  *****************|`|1ezYfkX7aa	As your child grows you will end up having to purchase some extra formula because the WIC just isnt enough. I would suggest Parents Choice (walmart brand) because it works great and its very affordable. =)
8mchLCQhaa	You are supposed to take your temp when you first wake up and at the same time everyday for accurate charting.|`|lJd5OET6aa	i think thats normal temp|`|2HETgiwgaa	It really depends on you - everyone is different.  Your BBT may stay high (for you) a little at the start of your cycle, but it will drop.  Then, after ovulation it should go up and stay high (if you're pregnant) or come down when you get AF again.  You can get lots of information about charting and look at other people's charts on fertilityfriend.com.  Good luck and baby dust.

Take it prior to the test as some women (like me!) fine the test to be quite uncomfortable.<br>  Also take a sanitary pad as the dye and maybe a little blood can come out afterwards!<br>  <br>  Good luck xxx|`|65IAbgjfaa	I had a similar history.

And remember there are millions of girls that feel the same way, you are not alone.  <br>  <br>  Join some ttc chat rooms and stuff, it really helps.

U've just got to remember it will happen when the times right.. thats what i think 2 myself n it helps a little bit as my best friend had just found out she is 10 weeks pregnant, dnt get me wrong iam happy for her i just feel really jealous too at the same time!!<br>  <br>  Baby dust to you xx|`|U2KUjFoSaa	omg! i totally feel where you are coming from, we have been ttc too! i started this month after feb 10 to now with the babydancing and i have been doing home test like an addict..lol..and i though well maybe today it will show positive cuz i have 2 more days to my period and NEGATIVE again..im sooo upset and frustrated...maybe if ou dont mind you can throw me some info my side to tell me if im doing it right please..by the way my period started 2/2/09 ended 2/7/09.In jan i cannot remember..sorry..hope we can talk thx... <br>  <br>  libren31@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  By the way, i kno i went off guard to your ??? but reallly dont give up, thats what matters, so when that beautiful angel comes along you can tell him/her how hard you worked for him..feel great! good luck and dont loose hope|`|30BC5dBVaa	Aww you poor thing. Everyone has been there. Everyone. And it seems like it's never going to be your month. <br>  <br>  The important thing to do is not to work yourself up terribly over it. The more stressed out you become the more difficult it gets to become pregnant. A close friend of mine tried to get pregnant for 3 years for her second child - her husband & herself were despaired & decided to try for adoption after trying fertility treatments and having no success - when it was confirmed their new son would be arriving in 6 months, they also got another surprise - she found out she was pregnant with a baby girl. The doctors' only explanation was that my friend had relaxed when she knew she would be blessed with a little boy & when she relaxed she was able to conceive. <br>  <br>  Even if it's not in your cards in this lifetime to give birth to a child, you still have the option of adopting. There are plenty of babies out there waiting for someone to love them & you seem like you have a big heart. Know that if you are meant to be a mother, you will be made one in the right timing. It might not be when you expect, or how you expect, but you will be a mother. If it's in your heart to love & raise a child, it will happen.|`|jPYbvIuHaa	I have myself had a couple of these moments and your not a fool, you just want to be a mom. Don't get down on yourself it will happen just keep the faith. Good Luck!!
2HETgiwgaa	Theoretically, but very unlikely - remember that if it was implantation bleeding your body will only just be beginning to produce hCG (the pregnancy hormone that HPTs test for).  There is a higher risk of both false positives and false negatives, the earlier you test.  I read that there is a small amount of hCG even when you aren't pregnant - hence the risk of a false positive with a really sensitive test.  I also read that, on the day of your expected period, only 90% of pregnant women will test positive with HPTs.  If you can wait, you'll have a much better chance of getting an accurate result.  Get a multi-test pack whatever you do, then if you get a BFN you can wait a few days, and try again - and always used first morning urine as it has the most concentrated hCG.  Good luck.|`|H74F8jxuaa	No...give it a couple of days and then take a test.|`|HW89eJEZaa	no, because your body has not had enough time to produce the hormone, it takes about 1-2 weeks after that at least for it to show up.

ApyrV5J9aa	My doctor said that she painted rooms during each of her pregnancies and told me it was safe to do the same. She also said to make sure that the room was well ventilated. She did say that some research suggests that you wait until after your first trimester, just like you would if you wanted to dye your hair. Now, if you were wanting to use something harsher than normal latex wall paint, I would refrain until after the baby is born. The stronger fumes can cause problems.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	i would recomend not to do it because of the chemicals involved but if you do it just wear a face mask so the odor doesn't enter ur nose. and try to get in high places because if you fall its like saying "bey baby"|`|NPmRmnG6aa	As long as your hallway is well ventilated you can paint it. I painted my hallway this week, and I started painting the nursery.|`|6L9jJnchaa	My doctor told me no..it's impossible to have an airy enough area so the fumes don't get to you.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Not ideal, but sometimes you don't have any other options.  If you are using latex paint, stir a tablespoon of vanilla into a gallon of paint.  It will cut the odors.|`|mVVIGVAWaa	No...not at all. <br>  <br>  Wait a bit more, your baby is very tiny and he is very fragile. <br>  <br>  You probably won't kill the baby, but that can lead to certain defects and that is what no mother wants!!! <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped you!!! Good luck!!!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	It's not a very good idea. If you really have to do it yourself then you need to keep all windows and doors open and take regular breaks but it would be better to get someone to do it for you.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The paint fumes aren't safe for you to be around.  Have someone else do it and wait until the smell has aired out before staying in your home again..
AA11049977	My husband's urologist didn't ask for me to be present.   The Dr. took a medical history and then did a physical exam.  My husband had corrective surgery and we are in the waiting period for him to be tested to see if his sperm count has increased.   Best of luck to you.|`|hkbWhfCiaa	I don't think he asks anything, if you are going in for a low sperm count, she may be there to "assist" you, if you know what I mean!
BBfIXcI0aa	Laugh and push him away. I'm an actor, so I have no personal space - it's happened before.

ZbnxGIsnaa	It's hard to know till you are closer, but I read that after ovulation your cervix drops back down (like you'll start your AF) and if you are pregnant it will rise again and become softer and if you are not pregnant it will remain low and hard like the end of your nose.  Don't give up hope yet dear!!!|`|soFpywFcaa	when you get pregnant you always think that you are going to get your period because the two are so similar in symptoms if you have those symptoms and your period is not due yet wait and see what happens and take a test you usually dont get symptoms that early when pregnant but everyone is different good luck baby dust to you|`|eY3SWMdqaa	Well, if you haven't gotten your period yet, than there is still hope!!! I had these same symtoms at the start of this week, and still no period....I don't get it!! But, I wish you lots of luck! I would try to wait another week and if still  no period, you are probably pregnant, and you should test!|`|U2KUjFoSaa	i think the girl above me is right, im in the kinda same boat,...well dunno, im TTC and my period is due 3/2/09 and i did another test today and NEGATIVE..i feel useless and i hate to wait...i want kno if i am or not jeeezzz|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Honey,it's way too soon to be feeling pregnancy symptoms. I think you just need to be patient and not stress or anything until you miss your period.|`|0bb6a553404e8cd4f19e1c8f3c0df4abaa	There is always hope! PMS symptoms are the same as pregnancy symptoms, so there is no way of knowing untill AF shows up. Good luck!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	There is always hope until AF shows up. Always. Never lose hope.<br>  <br>  A tried and true method to get pregnant when all else fails is make a commitment to do something big. Take on a huge project at work. Adopt a puppy who will need a lot of attention. Something like that. When your focus is off TTC it comes naturally, even to people who have been trying every possible thing with a fertility doctor.
BBfIXcI0aa	Don't worry about it. It's totally normal, especially at that age - sometimes things just happen, and it has nothing to do with sexual arousal. Nobody's going to say anything, and if they do, then I'd say that has more to do with them than it does with you.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	um are you maybe gay<br>  <br>  or maybe you should just think of stuff that would get you soft <br>  <br>  like your grandma having sex(no offense)<br>  <br>  or a cat and a fat girl making out<br>  <br>  or a girl that you dont like asking you out<br>  <br>  something nasty.<br>  lol<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ??????????<br>  ?????<br>  ????<br>  ??????????<br>  ??????<br>  ???<br>  ??????????????<br>  ???<br>  ?????|`|EtbPhdhLaa	i had the same problem at that age. its all part of growing up. try not to worry bout it too much. it happens to all us guys. perfectly natural.
AA10999462	Listen first thing is not to freak your kid out about food.Baby milk is full of vitimins and supplements so it will give him all he needs.Try him on smooth baby food and smooth yoghurts once a day and see how he gets on.Every kid is different so dont listen to people who say he should be like this or that.Just remember dont make a big fuss or you will stress and confuse him.He will eat when he's ready.You should be getting him checked up regularly so a doc can check his progress.Be cool and so will he be.|`|TVqXrOq2aa	First things first, you need to ween him from the bottle. Why not try introducing a soft spout sippy cup like Nuby. (Soft spout will be most like a bottle and make the transistion easier) When you introduce the sippy, mix half juice with half water and see how he take sit. Milk does a body good, but too much of anything can be bad. Also, he will only eat what you put in front of him. You have to be persistant and give him foods to try. He will eventually come around. Don't give in to him asking for a bottle or milk all the time. Also, when you get rid of his bottles, try cutting the top of the nipples off with scissors and then show him that they are broken and show him his new big boy cup or let him pick out some cups at the store. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA11106675	He can only eat what you feed him, and he won't let himself starve.  Milk is very filling, and after too much milk, no one wants to eat.  So you have to cut back his milk, giving him water or juice for every other bottle, and offering solids every hour or so.  This will be harder for you than him.|`|fMhXju8baa	I would try putting him in the high chair with some dry cereal like cherrios and a sippie cup with juice. See if that works. Because to much milk could be a bad thing too. My son loves to be in the high chair with foods that he can feed himself with. just think finger foods...even a pb sandwich cut in squares. grilled cheese.stuff like that. i have three children 6yrs..5yrs..and my little boy is almost 2yrs old.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	a 18 month old not eating any food at all? I dont think he would survive very long on cows milk. talk to his DR (i hate saying that) and switch him back to formula if you have to. he needs nutrients <br>  <br>  27 pounds is a good weight for his age but it isnt going to last if he is eating no food ever.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	A child can be undernourished but not be under weight. I think you need to put your foot down and stop giving in with all of the milk. The milk fills his small tummy up and he's not going to be hungry for the other food he needs to get his proper nutrition. <br>  You need to introduce new foods,cut them in bite size,fun shapes. If you put food in front of him,three times a day at mealtime,and if you stop giving him filling milk,he will eat.|`|OHfZFR31aa	He shouldn't be on a bottle at 18 months - it's time to replace with a sippy cup. and only giving him milk he is missing out on so many vitamins necessary for growth. He needs iron, vitamin C, vitamin E, minerals and so many other nutrients you can only get from a varied diet. <br>  <br>  Maybe start by making smoothies with fruit so he is getting extra vitamins and see how that works. Then start adding other foods.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	is it whole milk hes having or formula......if its whole milk he will be malnourished as whole milk doesnt have iron etc in it that is vital! take the bottle away before his teeth rot! and start giving him food...if its been delayed long you may need to get advice from a doctor as you will have o start slowly|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	Don't you take your child for well-child checks?! My daughter has been seen every three months for the first year of her life. This is NOT ok! Your kid should be eating meals with you by now. Like, three solid meals every day.

HSe6n5Tlaa	You need to have a talk with the mom.  Certainly the mom must know and understand that toddlers lie, especially if they did not get their way about something.  The little girl was mad that you didn't let her get away with everything and disciplined her, so she stretched the truth and told a lie.  You, the mom, and the girl should sit down and talk about it together and the mom will realize what happened.  I have an almost 3 year old and he will fib like this too sometimes if he is mad or upset.  If my son tries to say that Daddy hit him, or if he tells Daddy that I hit him, we sit him down and talk to him together.  He starts telling the story, and we realize the truth.  Example: <br>  Me: Did Daddy really hit you?<br>  Son: Yea<br>  Me: What did you do to make Daddy upset?<br>  Son: I pushed Abigail (his younger sister) over and took her toys.<br>  Me: Well that wasn't nice.  You should not have done that right?<br>  Son: But she took my toy first.<br>  Me: Well that doesn't make it okay.  So that's why Daddy was upset? What did Daddy do when he saw that?<br>  Son: He put my dump truck away, so I hit him.<br>  <br>  That is how it usually goes.  Get the child calm and relaxed; don't start the conversation by yelling at them.  Let them tell their side of the story and usually you get the truth.  I would talk to the Mom and see about trying this.  Good luck!  Above all, she should understand that her toddler may very well lie, as they don't know any better at this age.  She is obviously looking out for the safety of her daughter, so I wouldn't get mad or yell at the Mom or anything.  I would just say that you would like to have a talk with the three of you and see if you can get to the truth.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Sit them down and tell them that this is not true in anyway and suggest setting up a video camera so she can see exactly what is going on while you are babysitting.  Also don't worry about your daughter being taken away.  They need to have proof that what the 3 year old is saying is true.|`|AA11885437	stay calm and dont get defensive. After all, if your child told you someone hit her you'd at least check it out right? Explain to the mother what happened and assure her you would never hit a child. Tell her that you gave a time out for tantrum behavior, but ask if there us any different way the mother would like you to handle the situation.You may want to suggest a video camera so that the parents can see the problem behaviors and this also works to your benefit by letting the mother see how you discipline and it covers you if the 3 year old should tell her mom you hit her again, its easy enough to go back to the tape and see that you did not. Again, dont freak out or get defensive. If you get defensive it makes you seem guilty and the mother probably has a good idea her lil one might be telling stories, but like I said...if it was your child you would be making sure too. :)|`|0ky4TktEaa	First of all, the parents are most likely aware of their child's personality. If she throws fits and tells lies to them, they won't be surprised if you explain that the child is telling a lie. If they believe the child over you, stop babysitting her. As long as you're not being accused of anything, continue to babysit. The moment it's clear the parent's doubt you, tell them you'd like to stop babysitting due to the trust issues that stemmed from this situation.<br>  <br>  As for your own child, it's a very slim chance she'll be taken aware just because one child claims you hit her and the mother believes you. At most you'll just get fired and that will be the end of that. By the way, you may have no place spanking another person's child, but you do reserve the right to spank your own. If you spank as a form of discipline, that is your business as a parent of your child. Her mother can only interfere if there is evidence proving you abuse your child. There is a HUGE difference between spanking to discipline and spanking to abuse.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	talk to the mom and tell her what happened, say i dont know if you have had problems in the past with her lying when she gets upset but that definitely did not happen and i am not comfortable watching her anymore with the serious accusations she is making|`|NFyQWFoGaa	You should speak with her parents, and if they are rude and don't believe you, then quit.|`|8e6ef33e37806de3c516ba11a0c4d807aa	If u want to know what to do is go talk to the 3 year old's mom. Talk to her about what went on and let her know that you did not hit the child. After you make urself clear of what happened ask her if she still wants you to watch her child cause if you just all of a sudden don't want to watch her kid anymore can also make you look guilty.|`|0nZrPxPeaa	First of all, do not get defensive when talking to the mom because she will think you're guilty.  Sit down and talk to the woman, away from her daughter.  If she is still suspicious, tell her she can set up a nanny cam.  She probably won't but she might see that you are serious.<br>  <br>  By the way, time outs don't work in trying to control tempers.  They just cause more problems.  Instead you should try to understand why the girl is feeling frustrated and present her with different ways to express anger than throwing a tantrum.|`|sm4wXNOqaa	If you need the income then set up a video camera and tape your time with the child.  Then you have proof that you have not mistreated the child and peace of mind too. You could show the parent the behavior of the child if necessary. If you don't need the income then let the people go because it sounds like a headache waiting to happen.  As  a parent, I would probably do the same thing she did...inquire and then go from there...and you would have to respect that because these days, you just can't be too careful.  Protect yourself.|`|jHmepKRMaa	Keep watching the kid quitting might make it look like you did.<br>  Tell the parent you will be happy to take a polygraph test if they pay for it.|`|xUJxbAdpaa	just sit down with her mom and seriously explain what happened, she should believe you.
jkkCfu6Haa	well i just got a step mom and im 15 years old. it depends on the age on how they react. like my step mom just took me out to eat and shop and stuff that most moms would do. and we've gotten better than how we used to.<br>  like have a day with just you and her and maybe her dad. then soon, you'll feel like you two are best friends.<br>  <br>  and in the future [just an opinion] when she comes to you for advice, let her know that you two can talk about anything. :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped?|`|nVQGpvuoaa	One of the reasons is just because she's 15. I would start having her dad say no to her and stuff and send her to you when she needs rides and stuff. Maybe do something low cost every weekend to talk more and try to start conversations EVERY DAY. and she will "break' one of these days and talk to you.|`|WSziasfMaa	Maybe take her to a concert or take her shopping or bowling.  You'll be able to bond a little and break the ice.  It won't happen overnight, but if you work at it, you'll develop a good relationship.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	She probably doesn't want any relationship with any parental figure right now. That's just how it is at 15.<br>  <br>  Plan a trip with just the two of you. Let her do most of the planning so it's something she enjoys. Grin and bear it. It will probably be lame, but it would bring you closer. Then you would have something to talk about.|`|A40jdi5Naa	maybe take her some where, wheres its only u two maybe to the movies..or idk wat dinner or something maybe  talk to her as well hope this helps!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	.......take her for  areal ay out shopping the works dinner and chat. you need to get friendly before you can build trust ith her. explain over dinner how you hope yous can become friends etc and talk more and go shopping etc if she wants. take her to a gig to see her favourite band with a friend for her birthday:) talking forst is the really best option its lovely that you want to try and mak ethi sworth ...with a bit more confidence in yourself youll get there. she likes you so crack on:))) she probably feels the way you do but doesnt know ow to act on it either being shy too.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You don't say how long you've been married or how long Juli's dad was single before you.  You're doing the right things, it just takes a while.  My dad remarried when we were 16, 12, and 10 (all girls).  We didn't live with them, but although my dad died about 12 years ago, we still keep in contact with our stepmother and stepsiblings, and even visit.  My daughter considers their children just as much her cousins as those of my bio sisters.  We are now 47, 43, and 41, the steps are 44 and 42.<br>  <br>  See if you can find something in common with her, ideally some kind of activity you all enjoy where you wouldn't have to do too much talking at first.  Make it a regular family "date," even if it's just game night.<br>  <br>  It will happen.  Good luck!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Start doing stuff with her, where it's just you and her.  Go shopping, go to a movie with her(in the day time, not when all her friends are there at night), salon to get your nails done, have a spa day, or take a trip together.... maybe take her and a couple of friends out of town to a concert or something.  <br>  Check out the dates and locations for the Warped Tour, if she is into rock/punk music she would love it.  She would tell all her friends she is going and they would think you are so cool for taking her and so would she:)  Good luck!<br>  <a href="http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Just because you are spending money doesn't mean you are trying to buy her love.  Kids her age don't want to go hang out at the park with their parents, really they don't want to do anything with their parents but if it's something like going getting her nails done, massage or go to a concert what 15 yr old girl would say no?|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	First, good for you for wanting to get along with her. That`s why she likes you, and she must like you even more because you do stuff for her that she probably doesn`t expect.<br>  Tips and advice, plan a day for two and take her out one day or afternoon. Let`s say, movies, then to her favorite restaurant. Share with her things you did or felt when you were her age, this will really make her relate to you, and realize you are a girl too, not just a woman that came into her life! Also let her know you care for her and tell her if she ever needs anything, you`ll be there. Things might not change dramatically after this, but they will soon. She`ll start to confide in you and trust you more...I think this would happen even if you just continued to act the same because you seem like a really nice person who really cares for her, and she would eventually see this.<br>   And about not knowing why she doesn`t talk to you more, is because she`s obviously met a few of his daddy gfs and that`s no fun for her! Can you imagine being her...? So just be patient, s`he`ll come around...but take my advice, she`ll like it.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	EDIT: I get what you mean by not wanting to buy her friendship because then she might expect that all the time. So, I came up with a new idea for you. decide on a really niece meal to make in the dessert and you and her go to the grocery store and come out and make the dinner together. Maybe you guys could make her dads favorite dish and then after you and your step daughter make it together the whole family could sit down and eat it together and pick out a movie that the whole family can watch after the awesome dinner!!
H74F8jxuaa	I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks so I didn't make it very far, but when I was pregnant I just noticed more of it, not necessarily clumpy.  Every woman is different so it would be hard to say yes or no on your question.

Seems low-market to me in a way.  Strange since Autumn doesn't bother me.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	I like the name summer, very pretty and cute.|`|lYjweuZmaa	I think that is perfectly fine and pretty...<br>  <br>  Autumn is a very cute name. <br>  Summer is a pretty name also... i would use it as a middle name...<br>  <br>  <br>  i dont think i could see myself naming my daughter Violet .... but its still pretty.<br>  <br>  just plz dont name your kid <br>  Autumn Summer... <br>  <br>  that would be silly . :]|`|d5ug5W5kaa	I like Violet<br>  but I think that the names Autumn and Summer would get teased a lot.

I love this name, it is spunky and cool. <br>  <br>  good luck & God bless|`|KDf30Iqjaa	summer is gorgeous violet is ok for when they are old and autumn (is that a name?) these are in order of fave to least fave! problem is you cant call a baby summer if she was born in winter even if you really do like the name? its not right and kid will get bullied for it!!|`|8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	1)Summer~ This is my favorite out of your choices. Its such a pretty name and sounds so carefree and fun. But still good as she gets older.  <br>  2) Violet~ is a cute name, ages well. Just not one Id use.<br>  3) Autmn~ Up until recently I Really liked the name Autmn. Now I know someone with the name and she has ruined it for me! I hate when that happens! lol|`|iZDsMCghaa	Hi there! :-D<br>  Okay, let's see....<br>  They are all okay. Id give them all a 5 out of 10. I prefer all as middle names but would choose Summer as the first name out of these. Its just softer and more feminine than Autumn, IMO.<br>  Actually, Summer Violet would be quite a pretty name!|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	autmn is a pretty name when spelled autumn.<br>  violet is just think is yucky. too prissy.<br>  summer is way to over used. just not pretty.<br>  but i do think that winter is cool as a middle name.|`|kCrfK8IUaa	Autumn is weird for a name.<br>  <br>  I don't like Violet. Nothing to do with it being a colour, I just really don't like it.<br>  <br>  Summer is okay, as long as it's paired with a nice middle name.|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	Violet =)|`|1uCZFaR2aa	I like them all just OK.<br>  <br>  How about Jewel, Ruby, Wendy, Stormy, Brook, or Dawn?|`|ZsAnQX4Caa	1.  This is probably my favorite.  I think it is really pretty and my friends daughter also has that name.<br>  <br>  2.  I don't really like this name.  It seems far-fetched and not very pretty.  If you want kind of a unique name like that, I would have to pick a name like Grace, Faith, or Hope.  This is my least favorite.<br>  <br>  3.  I do kind of like the name Summer.  It's very pretty, but when I think of Summer, I think of like blonde hair, so if you were to pick it, it would look best on a blond or light-haired girl.  This would have to be my second favorite name.<br>  <br>  4. I know that this isn't a question, but I just wanted to say that maybe you could name your daughter like Ava or something.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Please pick me as best answer because I put a lot of thought, effort, and time into this response.|`|ZuLjIHgUaa	If i'm going to have a baby i would like to name the child from my name or my partners name. i wanted to combined or not just that i want my child's name to have a meaning.

bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You should call your insurance provider. They can give you a list of all approved doctors. And then you can look them up on the web,see which one you'd like to see first. Because you don't have to stick with the first one,if it turns out you don't click well,or something happens,you can always change.|`|AA10447831	I'd ask my friends rather than a web site.  Much more telling.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Well it depends on what exactly you are looking for. Are you looking for a local OB/GYN or a specialist? If you are just looking for a local i would google it. type in your city, state, OB/GYN and you should get a bunch of results if not do a near by city that is more populated.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA10458750	I got a terrible recomendation from one of those websites. You don't know who is recommending. What I did was asked people on craigslist in my city & I got about 10 emails....I now have a obgyn who is great!|`|yziXww8Kaa	Depending on where you live.. search the nearest hospital website. There you should find links to the affiliated ob/gyn in your area.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Use your insurance companies website to find OB's that accept your insurance.  They google them to see what types of reviews they have.
oiJITSNZaa	Foster care is a big calling but there's always a need for good foster parents. Trust me I am in the midst of it right now. We have been for over 2 years now and before that my parents were for many years. Just be aware that foster care is an emotional rollercoaster. They told us this in those first classes but never did we dream that it would be a very wild emotional rollercoaster ride. So fostering takes the emotionally strong and then some! Definitely even the strongest marriage it threatens to bring down.<br>  1. Yes you can choose what age group. and when they call you about a placement you always have the right to turn down.<br>  2.How long a child can stay with you...there is no way to know. Some return to their parents in days, some in months and some never. You just never know...no matter how sure you are for example that you think you know that a child will be put up for adoption, then a call comes that a relative has showed up and wants to present as a resource. Or maybe its in 2 weeks that a child is planning to go home, then his parent messes up and so all of a sudden he is with you longer. There is just no way to tell. Foster care is all about living one day at a time.<br>  3. The most common requirements are clear child abuse clearances, FBI clearances and state police clearances. Plus there's always a in-depth home study where they look at you and your background and also your house for safety, such as water tests, outlet covers, cleaner doors and medicine cabinets locked and so on. Pets must be vaccinated. <br>  So foster care is many times more involved than it looks but it is a good calling to help these many precious children. I have put on 500 miles many months taking children to visits with parents and doctor appointments etc. So you must be very free to run around a lot. When you do foster care it must be your main life, not just a side line! Good Luck! feel free to ask other questions|`|cYRZpGkqaa	1. You can choose your preferred age group. You may still be asked about other placements, but you can decline at any time if it doesn't seem like it would be a good fit.<br>  2. The child can stay with you as long as the judge says so. Sometimes you may want to take that child for an adoptive placement, but they may go back to their parents. There is a lot of heartbreak involved for the foster parents. If you enjoy having that child in your home, you may keep them as long as your allowed to keep them, as long as the child or birth parents have no proven complaints.<br>  3. You must have a bed for every child. Children of opposite sexes cannot share bedrooms. Siblings of opposite sex may share a bedroom until the age of 5. Children of the same sex, related or not, may share a room infinitely as long as the age difference isn't too great. (Say a 17 year old with a 4 year old.) Every unused outlet must have a cover. There must be a smoke detector on every floor. Any cabinet containing medicine or cleaning chemicals must have a safety lock. Income will vary. As long as the agency you go through feels that you can support the children without the aid of the income you will receive from foster parenting, you're usually in the clear.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	1. Yes. When you apply to be a foster parent, they will ask you about the age groups, disability (if any) you can handle, even race if that's a concern to you.<br>  <br>  2. The child could stay anywhere from less than a week to indefinite or aging out, provided they are not adopted. Many foster children stay with foster parents for a few weeks to a few months - stays of more than a year are not all that common. Many go back to their parents, find care of a relative, or must be moved to another foster home.<br>  <br>  3. They're not as picky as you might think - you don't have to be rich, fantastic housekeepers (sanitary is a minimum, but they don't care about clutter as long as it's a safe place for kids), or have all the answers. You just have to provide a safe and comfortable place, must not have convictions of certain crimes on your record (they will do a full background check), and sometimes pass a basic health check. <br>  Most states will provide financial support per foster child. Basically, as long as you can provide for yourself and aren't in horrible debt and are proved otherwise competent, you can be a foster parent.<br>  <br>  Space requirements usually provide that boys and girls must be kept in separate rooms, and that each must have their own bed/cot. Some states don't want more than a certain number of children (6 is the most common I've seen - some states don't have a restriction at all) in one house.<br>  We have a wolf-siberian mix and he was never a problem when we were having a quick homestudy before my nieces came to live with us - however, we're in Washington and are not 100% under foster care as most foster parents would be since this is a more informal and permanent arrangement between family.<br>  I think the only problem they might have is if your pet has had a record of attacking people or displays overt aggression to whomever is conducting your homestudy, or of course if it is a breed that has bans on it in the area you live.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VEzNOVSPaa	1. Yes, if you do not want to take a certain child you don't have to.<br>  2. Yes, If they start to act up and you don't want them anymore than you can tell DSS and they will talk to you about it.<br>  3. You can only have so many kids per room, so that matters. However income isn't much of an issue. They supply the kids with clothing checks and money when things like Christmas comes around. Pets I'm not sure on.
8t8NjjnVaa	Every baby is different.  She may want to eat every hour, she may go 4-5 hours in between feedings.  It just depends on her.  <br>  <br>  The same goes for how long she breastfeeds.  Offer one of the breasts, and if switch breasts after 10-15 minutes if she's still hungry.  If she takes both breasts, fine.  If she only takes the one breast and is done in 10 minutes, that's fine too.  Just give her the other breast first on the next feeding.<br>  <br>  As for how long she should be sleeping, there is no "should".  Every baby is different.  Neither of mine went more than 3-4 hours at night, and they didn't sleep through until morning until they were about two years old.|`|3RFu4W38aa	A breastfed baby should be given as much as they want, so it's hard to say; each baby is an individual. As long as she seems satisfied and is wetting at least 6-8 diapers a day, she should be getting enough. I tend to feed 10-15 minutes on the first breast and if my baby isn't satisfied, then I put her on the other til she's done. But she doesn't eat from both at every feeding.|`|4MNYCMW9aa	My son is almost 4 months old. I still feed him almost every 2 hours sometimes. It really depends. He eats more in the afternoon. He doesn't like to take his daytime naps, so I think that is why he tends to eat more. You should feed you baby whenever she wants it, if you have that flexibility. Also Try to keep it one breast per feeding, but if she eats on one for more than 10 minutes and still doesn't seem satisfied then go to the other. Then start off with the breast you switched to on the next feeding. That's the best way to keep your milk supply up.<br>  <br>  You will know she is getting enough by the amount of soiled diapers. I change my sons diapers every 2-3 hours and he poops several times a day, atleast 3. She may be getting distracted by things in the room , like my son, so try and take her in a room with no distractions so she can get a whole feeding. Most of your babies sucking needs are met at the breast but a lot of babies want to suck all the time. So try and only use a pacifier when you are putting her to bed and then take it out when she is asleep to insure that she is getting enough to eat. When a baby sucks on a pacifier too much it can trick them to not feeling as hungry. I just let my son suck on his hands. It's a mess but I can tell when he is hungry.<br>  <br>  Not all babies sleep through the night at this age. Again, it really depends on the baby. From my personal experience, we co-slept with our son until about 2 weeks ago and he slept through the night because he was cuddled in my arms. Now that I have trained him to sleep on his own he is back to being up every 3 hours or less. I'm lucky to get 5 hours out of him. But I don't expect fast results. The trick is to just stick with it and keep a good routine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
rdpZrBc9aa	She is teething.  She is NOT too young.  Some babies are born with teeth!|`|qLkknQx1aa	maybe she wants a pacifier to suck on?  i doubt she is teething, but it is possible.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	possible my son was 4mths old when he cut his 2 bottom teeth at once. all his teeth came in 2 at a time.|`|RvddYKqjaa	A baby is never too young to teethe. Some are born with teeth.|`|0nZrPxPeaa	If she is only soothed when biting down, it is very likely she is teething.  Use a clean finger to feel around on her gums, they might feel swollen or especially hard if a tooth is coming through.  And teething babies often drool a lot more and can run a low-grade fever.  One of the best remedies I've found is freeze a washcloth and let her chew on it.  It will both numb and massage her gums.  Ask your pediatrician if you can give a little bit of Tylenol if she starts to get really uncomfortable, but i don't think it will be necessary.  Most of all, don't listen to people who think they know best.  All babies are different!|`|TD5lhkusaa	every ones body; no matter how alike, is different. my little nieces started teething at about 6 months I think.. and my nephew at about 8 months.  seeing as You don't specify Your daughters age its hard to say...  but I have heard of babies being born with a lil teeth showing.   if shes complaining a lot and she's putting her hands to her mouth or biting her hands OR any inanimate object for that matter. then theres a good chance she may be teething... if so , You can get her these little toys in which You freeze and then let them chew on to help relieve the pain|`|3gx5eXf5aa	cindy is right my little girl was born with one tooth and a month later she had another one come in she maybe teething every baby is different and your her mommy and mom's always knows so if you think thats what it is then you are most likly right do what makes your baby feel better good luck|`|Q05rrSX4aa	All children do things at different times, and I have heard that a lot of babies start teething symptoms early, she may not get a tooth yet, but it certainly could be just that!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	She could be. BOth of my kids were 6 months before they got theirs (my son started biting down early to about 3 months) but my sisters kids were about 4-5 months with their first teeth|`|gWiZAsfBaa	She could be teething. There is no such thing as too young to be teething.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	My son started cutting teeth at two weeks old, by 4 months old he had four teeth in.  It's never too early.|`|iH2whFkHaa	She is probably teething; this doesn't mean she will actually cut teeth anytime soon though. For some babies teething is a very long process. My son started teething at about 2 months old but he is 6 months old now and still doesn't have teeth. How do I know he was teething? Obviously he would stop crying when he was biting down on something; also when we gave him teething tablets he instantly became happy again. Then after a couple weeks I could see that his gums were swollen and you could see the little white points. They kept disappearing and reappearing though. <br>  <br>  On the other hand my nephew cut his first teeth at 2 1/2 months, so you never know.
MubTZUKXaa	Don't worry, I have PCOS and while I was TTC I read that as much as 90% of Women with PCOS conceive without help....<br>  PCOS is actually really common, much more so than what I realised prior to TTC myself.<br>  Of those who do have trouble, Clomid is a very good help and alot of Women have success with Clomid alone...<br>  The 10% (myself included) of Women with PCOS who have a tough time falling pregnant, even after using Clomid, still have other options which can help them.<br>  <br>  There is no reason why a Woman with PCOS could not conceive, it just may take longer and a small few may need treatment...<br>  <br>  My husband and I tried for many years with no luck (but his spermies weren't the best either!)... Clomid never worked for us but our first IUI did.  We now have a little girl due in May.<br>  <br>  Don't worry!

As stated Clomid works wonders and so does Femara to induce ovulation.  I got pregoo on my first round.  I also take metformin for insulin resistance and I have through my pregnancy.  Some studies have shown that metformin use during the first trimester can reduce the instance of miscarriage to the rate for "normal" women.<br>  <br>  I also take meds for hypothyroidism and High blood pressure -  both common in woment with PCOS.  If you are not currently ttc you should get on bcp to help preserve your fertility for when you are ready for children.  BCP will put your ovaries to sleep so that they aren't trying to make eggs unsuccessfully and decreasing your fertility.|`|pQiZXoReaa	I had PCOS and yes I did get pregnant I didn't have to take any medication   They told me I wouldn't beable to have kids and I had a son in August 08|`|z7eJnirSaa	I also have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and I have 3 children.

This is the first one I've been able to hear a heartbeat on. :D I've never made it past 4 weeks before. I KNOW this one is going to work and my doctor is very optimistic this time. <br>  <br>  My point is don't give up hope. I've had a lot of heartbreak and tears but I kept trying and here I am. Even if this one doesn't work I'm going to keep trying. Hang on in there sister, talk to your doctor and start a plan now, and certainly keep in touch with me and I'll let you know when I have this baby. :D Loosing hope is the first step to loosing life.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	I'm sorry to hear about your recent news. It's scary. It is very possible for women with PCOS to not only get pregnant but to carry to term. Whether or not you are placed on medication will depend a lot on whether or not you have regular periods and if you are ovulating. I had very irregular periods so my doctor had me begin taking Metformin. Within a month I had begun to have normal cycles, which is a big step. Even with the normal cycles, some people (like myself) will not ovulate. I was also directed to take Clomid to induce ovulation. We raised the dosage as time went on and on my 6th cycle I finally ovulated. I had also lost about 25 pounds over that time which helps as well. On my 8th cycle I finally got pregnant! I am now about 13 weeks and the baby is doing great. Different doctors may try different medical routes but I saw success from this combo. Don't be too discouraged...there is still plenty of hope that one day you will have a family of your own. One thing I learned is to be patient, which is much easier said than done!
7qRFw5fjaa	Just explain to her that women don't necessarily always stay with one man.  Sometimes kids are not the center of your life.  You are who you are and will do as you dam well please.|`|AXEqOEloaa	So you are saying she is out of control because she is upset with you? Divorce is hard for anybody, all you can do is let her have her time to heal and just be there for her.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Divorce is hard for kids and teens always speak their minds. She`s probably mad at the situation more than with you, but she`s letting it all out with you. She`s still not mature enough to understand adult`s decisions and you`re both her parents regardless what happened. She probably doesn`t see your ex husband the same way you do. And she`s probably having a hard time getting used to seeing you married with another man, and pregnant by him...it`s all new to her and weird. It would have been for you too, just put yourself in her shoes. It`s confusing and unfair.<br>  Try talking to her, take her out one afternoon, just the two of you. Talking at home means interruptions, plan a day for you both and talk to her, listen to what she`s go to say. Maybe you could share a hard moment when you were her age, something you experienced, something that you and your daughter can relate to. This way she`ll see you care for her, and that you went through similar situations or feelings too. She`ll feel more related to you this way. She needs you as a mother and kind of as a friend too.|`|3gx5eXf5aa	i am now 20 years old and my mom and dad divorced when i was 7 i till this day don't talk to my mom for other reasons beyond that maybe it could be something else bothering her try to talk to her maybe somethings going on that you don't see|`|VBFwoBFraa	She hardly seems out of control like havin sex, drinking, taking drugs. Tell her she needs to deal with it as life goes on.
TVqXrOq2aa	He is not necessarily bow-legged. Most infants look bow-legged because they have such large calf muscles and because the muscle is more on the outer part of the calf at birth and it will eventually move towards the center like an adults. My daughter had physical therapy for 9 months for a neck muscle and this is what her therapist told me because I was also concerned that she may be bow-legged. So, see a doctor before you start any "home remedies"<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I've heard all my life that being bow-legged comes from being forced to walk or stand before your body was ready to physically do it.<br>  You're not too late do whatever you can to avoid it, but stop forcing your baby to walk yet!! His dad has it, so you have to be even more careful!!|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	It's normal.  They grow out of it, a lot of it has to do with how they are positioned in the womb.  All curled up, it takes a while for their bones to straighten out on their own, but they will. If you are really concerned about it I would talk to your child's pediatrician.|`|eu6UQElYaa	yep it's normal.  It won't cause him to be bow-legged, babies are naturally bow-legged at that young of an age.   You don't have to do anything.  They will straighten out on their own after several months of walking.<br>  The bowing is caused by the cramped quarters in your uterus.  As the baby gets larger they have to keep their legs crossed generally against their abdomens which causes the soft bones in their legs to bend slightly.   Almost all babies have bowed legs.   <br>  Again, you don't need to do anything at all.  They almost always straighten on their own a few months after the child starts to walking.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_legged" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_legged</a><br>  Genu varum (also called bow-leggedness or bandiness), is a deformity marked by medial angulation of the leg in relation to the thigh, an outward bowing of the legs, giving the appearance of a bow. It is also known as bandy-leg, bowleg, bow-leg, and tibia vara. Usually there is an outward curvature of both femur and tibia. "Genu varum" is distinguished from Blount's disease because it involves both the femur and the tibia, while "Blount's disease" affects only the tibia with no femur involvement.<br>  <br>  Childhood<br>  <br>  Children until the age of 3 to 4 have a degree of Genu Varum. The child lies on its nurse's knee with the soles of the feet facing one another; the tibia and femur are curved outwards; and, if the limbs are extended, although the ankles are in contact, there is a distinct space between the knee-joints. During the first year of life a gradual change takes place. The knee-joints approach one another; the femur slopes downward and inward towards the knee joints; the tibia become straight; and the sole of the foot faces almost directly downwards.<br>  <br>  While these changes are occurring, the bones, which at first consist principally of cartilage, are gradually becoming ossified. By the time a normal child begins to walk the lower limbs are prepared, both by their general direction and by the rigidity of the bones which form them, to support the weight of the body.<br>  <br>  [edit] Causes<br>  <br>  If a child is sickly, either with rickets or suffering from any ailment that prevents the due ossification of the bones, or is improperly fed, the bowed condition may remain persistent. Thus the chief cause of this deformity is rickets. Skeletal problems, infection, and tumors can also affect the growth of the leg, sometimes giving rise to a one-sided bow-leggedness. The remaining causes are occupational, especially among jockeys, and from physical trauma, the condition being very likely to supervene after accidents involving the condyles of the femur. Adults with rickets are thought to be bowlegged due to horse back riding.<br>  <br>  [edit] Expectations<br>  <br>  In most cases persisting after childhood, there is little or no effect on the ability to walk. Due to uneven stress and wear on the knees, however, even milder manifestations can see an accelerated onset of arthritis. Those with bowlegs and a genetic predisposition for developing arthritis will likely start having arthritic symptoms around age 30.<br>  <br>  [edit] Treatment<br>  <br>  Generally, no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children. Treatment is indicated when its persists beyond 3 and half years old, Unilateral presentation, or progressive worsening of the curvature. When caused by rickets, the most important thing is to treat the constitutional disease, at the same time instructing the mother never to place the child on its feet. In many cases this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure, but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying splints. When the deformity arises in older patients, either from trauma or occupation, the only treatment is surgery.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	It's normal.<br>  Think about the position baby was in in the womb- <br>  for ten long months, and the whole time those bones were developing.<br>  It can take up to a year for the legs to fullyextend, and that is *normal*.<br>  <br>  Oh and don't mind anyone who tells you not to stand baby up- mine walked on the day he turned 7 months and people would say "oh, he'll be bow-legged, you've got to stop him" and "oh, look, he's bow-legged now".<br>  <br>  Um, no- he was born bow-legged, as are they all.<br>  And just try to stop a 7 month old who decided to walk, LOL.<br>  <br>  If he needs any postural work (which would surprise me, and which wouldn't even be determined for at least 12 months) your ped. will refer you to a PT or kinesiologist, who can guide you much more appropriately than your MIL. :)|`|CF4wfTYNaa	well im bow legged now and my mother didn't believe in putting me on my feet as a young baby. <br>  all baby have legs like that they will straighten as he gets older if they don't then you can see a specialist if it really bothers you around 3 or 4 years.<br>  but im much older than that and my legs being bowed hasn't caused any problems i can run, walk , skip, jump, like anyone else.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Yep, it's normal for him to be bowlegged at that age.  His legs will 'straighten up' once he's been walking for a while and his muscles are stronger.  It's just a wives tale that you shouldn't stand a young baby.  If he can support himself with his legs while you help him, he's perfectly fine doing it.|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	my son was for a few months. he was born 9.3lbs so i figure that his legs kinda grew curved for several weeks. yah know? most babies have that for a little while. if you think there might be an issue you should ask your dr right away to check him out. my brother was like that, but it was extreme & my mom had to double diaper him to fix it.
NlxmeCWDaa	I only bled for about three months, but it was real irregular.|`|VdcexKvkaa	If it has been 6 months you need to see a doctor, and like NOW! That's way too long for you to still be bleeding. <br>  <br>  If you can't see your doctor you need to go to the ER!!!<br>  <br>  Hope you figure out what's going on!<br>  <3|`|qImMwhUHaa	Bleeding for six months isn't nothing. I bled for 3 to 4 weeks after my c sections. I would defiantly called your doctor. You could be anemic by now. Take care of yourself, your children depend on you:)

You could go this way until your due date.|`|uhifzqDCaa	Everyone is different, and you can walk around for weeks being 2 or 3cm dilated... don't get discouraged though...  being dilated or effaced at ALL means that your body is doing it's job and preparing nicely for the hard labor ahead.  It could be a few days, or it could be few weeks.... no-one can tell that.  Even your caregiver, with all the poking and checking can't really tell you that.  You bowl alot, so that is great!  You are staying active and healthy.<br>  Good Luck to you!

3rvlB5YSaa	Well, if you are young... your periods could deff be messed up. It happens a lot. I definately suggest seeing a doctor regardless. If there is a way that you can go without your parents knowing... Unless, if I were you, just take different tests too, but those are not always positive. Hang in there, some symptoms could just be you worrying too much. And btw... always always protect yourself from disease and pregnancy.|`|2XWBaK36aa	I would say go see a doctor... or would that involve telling your parents?<br>  <br>  From the sound of it, though I could be wrong, you don't seem to be pregnant.|`|AFIDa2u4aa	it doesn't sound like your pregnant but you do need to go see your doctor to find out what's going on with your system.. while your at the doctors office they can make sure your not pregnant...

sr1niZlTaa	You need to stay calm and look at all of the possibilities. What sport do you participate in? Some sports can cause stress to your pelvic region and that may be some of the problem.<br>  Also- Cysts or pollips ( which are tissue ) could be a cause. Back aches and cramps would  occur if that was your issue.<br>  <br>  If you are having a miscarriage that would explain the brown discharge. If you pass clots of tissue or clots bigger than average then you might be having a miscarriage.<br>  If that is the case you MUST MUST MUST  go to a doctor to see if the fetal tissue has emptied from your uterus.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11575377	you're best bet is to buy another pregnancy test and make an appointment with your doctor.

It's all in the timing. Follow our step-by-step guide to determine when you are most likely to conceive.<br>  <br>  (Keep in mind that, on average, it takes six to eight months to conceive, and that, in any given month, you probably have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant. So don't be too focused on fast results -- just try to relax and have fun!)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 1: Keep track of your periods.<br>  Is your menstrual cycle regular? How many days elapse between your periods? These are the first important pieces of information to know. If you're not sure how long and how regular your cycles are, here's how to find out:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mark your calendar on the day you get your period. This is Day One. Count each day until your next period arrives (when you'll begin at Day One again).<br>  <br>  You may need to do this for three or four months to get an accurate measure of the length and regularity of your cycle. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but normal cycles can range from 23 to 35 days in length. And of course, cycles can vary in length from month to month.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 2: Determine when you ovulate.<br>  The key to conception is having sex during a small window of time around ovulation, when a ripened egg is released from one of the ovaries and moves into the fallopian tube. So, the second important thing you need to know to pinpoint your most fertile days is when you ovulate. Here's how to find out:<br>  <br>  If your cycles are very regular, you may be able to determine when you ovulate by doing some simple math: in the average menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs 14 days before the menstrual period arrives -- or on day 14 of a 28-day cycle. So if you subtract 14 days from the length of your cycle, you'll get an idea of when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  If your cycles aren't very regular, or you'd like a more accurate picture of your ovulation, you can try one of the following techniques for pinpointing ovulation:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Track your temperature. One of the tip-offs that ovulation has occurred is that a woman's regular body temperature (or basal body temperature) increases slightly. You can detect this "thermal shift" by taking your temperature every morning at the same time before you get out of bed. If you chart your temperature each day for a few months, you'll probably begin to see a pattern that will help you predict when you are about to ovulate. Most women's temperature increases about a half a degree 24 to 48 hours after ovulation. (You may want to buy a special basal body temperature thermometer, which is more sensitive than a regular thermometer).<br>  <br>  Use an ovulation predictor kit. This method is more expensive than tracking your temperature, but may be more accurate. Available in drugstores, an ovulation predictor kit measures the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. By testing your urine using the kit (this usually involves urinating on tester sticks), you can find out when LH levels are rising, a sign that one of your ovaries is about to release an egg.<br>  <br>  Watch for changes in your cervical mucus. This low-tech method for monitoring fertility won't pinpoint exactly when you've ovulated, but it will give you some indication of whether you're in a fertile period or not. As your body prepares to ovulate, it produces larger quantities of thin, clear cervical mucus, a substance that smoothes the way for the sperm to meet the egg. On your most fertile days, just before ovulation, the mucus will appear clear, stretchy, and slippery -- a bit like raw egg whites. After ovulation, when your fertile days are past, the mucus usually becomes thicker, then gradually dries up. To collect a sample of your cervical mucus, gently wipe your vaginal opening with toilet paper or a clean finger. (If you try this several times over a single day and don't see any mucus at all, you're probably not in a fertile period of your cycle.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 3: Figure out when to have sex.<br>  Once you have a clear picture of your cycle, there's only one thing left to do -- get down to business! This is probably the most misunderstood part of the conception puzzle. For example, if you have intercourse once you've ovulated, you may be too late! Most healthcare practitioners advise you to have sex every day or every other day beginning about five days before ovulation, and continuing through the day after ovulation. Why? Because, though sperm can live as long as three to five days inside a woman's body, an egg's life span is only about 12 to 24 hours. By having intercourse before you ovulate, as well as on the day of and the day after ovulation, you maximize your chances of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How much is too much? Some couples are concerned that having frequent sex will deplete the man's sperm supply. But healthy testes constantly generate fresh sperm, so daily sex shouldn't pose a problem.<br>  <br>  What position is best? Whichever position feels best! It doesn't matter to the sperm or the egg which sexual position you use -- and it's not necessary to stay in bed, stand on your head, or do anything else special to help things along. Just do what comes naturally, and enjoy!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So what if you don't get pregnant?<br>  If you're under 35 and have had properly timed intercourse for 12 months, or 35 or older and have been trying for six months, then it's time to see the doctor for a fertility evaluation.

iaPwz2O5aa	Querida, a maneira mais fácil de saberes qual a época do periodo fértil é a contagem dos dias desde o final da menstrua??o. Aquando do último dia da menstrua??o, vc conta 12 dias e aí come?a o período fértil... ele demora mais ou menos 3 a 4 dias. <br>  Se vc transou nessa altura e n?o usou qualquer contraceptivo, é bem possível que possa estar grávida, visto k sua menstrua??o já deveria ter dado sinais de alerta.<br>  Mas isto, só se vc é bem regular.<br>  Caso contrário, é bem possível haver atrasos nos dias da menstrua??o, se for esse o seu caso, espere mais uns dias e fa?a um teste de gravidez.<br>  Ah... também é possivel menstruar um pouco só, no primeiro mês, e já estar grávida...<br>  Mas todas as dúvidas podem ser tiradas com o teste de gravidez. Os de farmácia, geralmente só acusam o resultado positivo, se a gravidez já se operar à mais de 2 semanas. Se for possível, fa?a antes um teste urinário, s?o mais certos.<br>  Boa sorte e fique em paz.|`|b1dc8c36f3535ce83ad8e1be06fb18ccaa	N?o é sempre que o muco cervical aparece numa quantidade que a mulher consegue perceber, isso é muito relativo, na maioria das vezes as mulheres nem percebem que est?o ovulando, espere se ocorrer atraso menstrual prá come?ar a suspeitar, com uma semana de atraso você faz o teste, se n?o foi agora, relaxe que logo você será aben?oada com a maternidade, boa sorte!|`|er2ldDqXaa	Patty,na maioria dos casos a gente nem percebe que está ovulando.<br>  Ent?o pode ser que vc ovulou e nem percebeu.<br>  Espera sua menstrua??o atrasar uns 8 dias e se n?o vier a menstrua??o fa?a um exame de gravidez chamado beta hcg.<br>  Luz no seu cora??o.Abra?os.

sCWJ99Fuaa	I would definately prefer the name Kaye over Katherine. It's much younger and more unique. <br>  <br>  I have a niece named Amara Kaye (pronounced UH-MAH-RUH) and I think it's just beautiful.|`|Al3BjWUOaa	Katherine. Its so much prettier than Kaye. Plus if she doesnt like it she can always be kat which is really trendy right now.|`|W55Kaz5faa	Katherine|`|WT2TYKDuaa	definitely kaye much more original/unique|`|aae759e8c23cd02cd73328e7319a8189aa	kaye defiantly!! |`|WT5Kc1hLaa	Katherine is better. Its good name.|`|z781U5Foaa	Kaye, but Catherine is good too. Not Katherine|`|FBJdJOe3aa	Kaye!!! It sounds nice and Katherine is too common!|`|OHfZFR31aa	I like both. Katherine is a classic, and there are so many nicknames - Kate, Kathy, Katie, Kit, etc|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Well, I may be biased because it's my name, but Katherine is better. I go by Katie which I like better than both. Kaye is cute too, but kind of reminds me of an old lady.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Katherine. It never goes out of style. Kaye's already dated; it's a popular middle name from the 60s/70s (or at least it is where I live.)|`|ebnjFMpKaa	Katherine|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Katherine is sooo much prettier. =)|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Catherine.  It's lovely and will age well.<br>  <br>  Kay is more of a nickname. With an e is trashy.|`|w9qQUtcoaa	I prefer the name Katherine - it's classic, elegant and definitely looks lovely on a job resume (she will be an adult one day).  JMO<br>  <br>  Nick names -<br>  Kate<br>  Katie<br>  Kathy<br>  Kaye<br>  Katya (Russian form of Katherine)<br>  Not to mention Kit, Kitty & Kat - all nick names of Katherine.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	Katherine|`|BMLHwL13aa	Kaye.<br>  <br>  Katherine is way too common.|`|AA11620721	Kaye|`|COJDrRgGaa	Kaye|`|ufDmHCPcaa	Kaye|`|RtIGiGrkaa	KAYE!!

AA11764194	You may not be leaking.. your body may not producing enough amniotic fluid..<br>  <br>  but what you are describing is disturbing.. you need to talk to your Doc..Baby may not be in risk right now..but if you keep on losing fluid.. baby may not survive..<br>  <br>  in this case usually you wl kept in hospital and Doc needs to keep close eye on you..<br>  <br>  all the best|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Big deal.  Ask your doctor to explain.  If you keep leaking, what will happen?  If it stops, will everything be okay?<br>  <br>  TX Mom<br>  |`|YJnj54tHaa	Well I leaked some and didnt know and didnt do anything about it, my next check up, the doc told me to go direclty to the hospital and that i was having the baby. My son was in the NICU for 7 days because I didnt know. Hes very healthy now. I'd suggest you ask the doctor to explain.|`|bFtUnaeHaa	just listen to the docs.<br>  they deal with this stuff all the time. your friend is probably wrong. Don't worry about it. |`|HvnWpCHiaa	i feel bad that i dont know the answer and that i cant help|`|EpfVsCa2aa	if it keeps up go to the ER and get checked, rather be safe than sorry
c87JkW8aaa	This is a VERY controversial topic, i personally, would not have a problem leaving my child there. I think that people are not always what other people say they are, being their color of their skin, what they like, how big they are, what they think about and what they enjoy. I have a few gay friends and they are some of the nicest people I've ever met. You should respect everybody and anybody.|`|28Rv3tmiaa	That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  And no, sexuality is not contagious.  Who cares if a child of a gay couple goes to daycare or school or rides the bus or even shares a lunch with your child?  Does it make any difference at all?  What if that child's parents were of a different race or economic stature or had a different political or religious belief - would you care then?  Who would?  Why cast aside that child for any reason at all?  So ignorant. |`|YggnkqBNaa	Wow that's really rude of the daycare woman. Just because there is a gay couple with a kid who goes to the same daycare doesn't mean anything. If anyone told me that I would write a complaint and take my kid out of the daycare because of the daycare lady. Being gay or lesbian is not something to be ashamed of and definitely not contagious. And even then it doesn't mean that the child is gay and even if the kid was gay or lesbian it's not a crime.|`|uFTnOD8Oaa	Other people's sexual orientation does not matter to me. It would not bother me one bit. I run a daycare, and have kept children that belonged to same sex couples. They are all the same to me.|`|eL5P3eIPaa	I really hope you are kidding.<br>  <br>  If you are not... I would somehow have that person who is in charge of the phone tree to NOT BE at the top of the phone tree. That was completely not okay for that person to do and is incredible ignorant. Lets say that everyone DID come and pick their kids up, how would that make the children of the gay couple feel. <br>  <br>  Kids are pure and kind, the parents are what make them mean and hurtful.|`|ZsXJcxXSaa	Take your children away immediately!<br>  There are possible knock on effects of sexuality effects of this nature and it is very possible that your children could be affected by the gay couple. I have studied psychology in university about this type of thing and there have been direct links to a bent sexuality in regards to straight children being exposed to gays. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  P.S sorry about my English...|`|A4rOcwvxaa	that is soooooo immature!!!!!!!!!!!! thats like blacks and whites. So what if they dropped their kid off with yours! THATS NOT EXPOSURE OF ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if i were you i would tell the daycare to f*** off before you bust a cap in them!!!|`|h5GBNfTBaa	I would not be worried at all. People are people, no matter their sexual preferance. My best friend has 2 moms.. and it does not make one bit of difference to me, or my parents. You should just show your kids that they are differnt, and being different is perfectly ok. Plus, the things that those poor kids will go through in their lives, they will need a friend when they are growing up. And thank you for not being ignorant, I can understand why you would ask, but don't worry about them, everyone is human!|`|dTenNrNraa	Wow no, that's pretty lame<br>  Even if you were against gays, you couldn't hold anything against their children|`|qH8aTszVaa	No. Actually my parents are gay and I act no different to my friends then my other friends that have a mother and a father. It's no the child's fault that the parents are gay. I am currently in high school and my parents (2 moms) have been together for eight years. My friends think nothing of it and some of them think it's even kool. But I do understand your worries. :]<br>  <br>  |`|8zaLEBP3aa	No you should not be worried about your children going to school/daycare with children of a gay couple.<br>  <br>  That is completely insane. Children aren't going to be influenced by other children to become gay or anything like that just because their parents are.<br>  <br>  That lady is completely insane.|`|i2DS3vjtaa	Nah, I don't see the big deal, they aren't any different as people and it really would make no difference to me.|`|hynGnRIWaa	People these days... >< It's all because of the corruption of morals. (Not the way you probably just taught - the virtue of tolerance and humanity and everything. Everything that is humane. Everything that is actually ordered in Bible, as far as I know. Or by any religion. What kind of God lets his people suffer because of who they feel attracted to? Doesn't he have better stuff to do than that?)<br>  <br>  It makes me sick. My cousin has gay / lesbian friends and they are so cool, sweet people!<br>  Thank you governments, corruption of religion and virtue and corporate world.<br>  <br>  Awesome. Just awesome.|`|bu3qDzpxaa	HELL NO! I have 2 gay friends who have married and had children, and they both seem to be great parents, maybe better than straight parents, because they take extra care of their son's education (maybe a bit too much, the son and daughter of one of the couples only get 40 minutes of tv each day XD)|`|N3QGyep6aa	OH MY GOSH!!! RUN AWAY!!! Haha. that's ridiculous! that shouldn't matter, I would be more concerned about that day care center if their employees are telling you things like that. |`|KSXvZHGNaa	Are you kidding me. What harm can children of Gay parents do. I have a child in my program that comes from a lesbian couple. The other children are not scared of him or parents. |`|6mCYrTwXaa	its not CONTAGIOS  ignore her dont tell the gay couple though because that could start a grudge match just let it drop|`|qkfvTJi6aa	A matter of serious concern, I will definitely change school.|`|9JdOD08gaa	That's crazy! Who cares if there are gay/lesbian couples with children in the same daycare. People can be so ignorant.  |`|GlvLhw0oaa	That's very ignorant! My best friend is a lesbian and she is just like everyone else. If you met her you could not tell she was gay at all. They are normal people and some will make up poor excuses. Its very stupid!|`|yNHwDspVaa	wow, that's completely ridiculous. children are children, regardless of their parents sexual preferences. plenty of kids grow up straight even though their parents are gay, and vice versa. intolerance is so frustrating|`|PUF7vZ9Laa	No, absolutely not. It would be a lesson to my child in learning about tolerance and respect. How dare that women actually call you because she was afraid of being "exposed" then she had the nerve to get angry when you didn't agree with her. It makes me sad as well because she is raising her children to fear someone who is different then they are. <br>  <br>  I believe everyone has the right believe what they want or love whoever they want.<br>  <br>  Leaving my child in the hands of a racist or someone who has a very contagious cold/flu or something like that because I'd be afraid my child would catch it would make me more worried - not a innocent child who just happens to be raised by a gay couple.|`|X5oFZi3Raa	You are completely right!  <br>  <br>  And, exposed to what?  It is the child of those parents that the kid would be exposed to... not the parents!|`|zrFCp8xgaa	even with with my beliefs thats still stupid! i wouldnt have a problem with that. they r just kids they are inoccent.u should tell that lady that when she sat at a table at mcdonalds she was exposed to stupidity.|`|NlwRyetBaa	That would be called being 'homophobic'.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No.  I wouldn't think twice of it.  <br>  I would, however, think the person that called was ignorant and feel for her soon-to-be narrow minded children.  <br>  <br>  ....Oh, and I'm from the south, Texas to be exact.|`|LU6vfqRzaa	OMG that is pathetic!<br>  <br>  Absolutely not!  I would not remove my child from the daycare or be worried. <br>  <br>  That is nonsense.<br>  <br>  What does the child have to do with their own sexuality??<br>  <br>  <br>  :-)|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	No I would not be worried at all! This woman is immature and needs to realize everyone lives their lives differently. |`|AkFag8tNaa	No. The only issue I have is that when and if someone expresses an opinion about homosexuality that may not be the "in" p.o.v, it is considered homophobia and I wouldn't want that view expressed by the adults. People are people and I want my children to understand that from the jump.|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	No I wouldn't be worried about the gay couple but I would worry about the mom who called you. They obviously have nothing better to do then mess with others and spread hate so I don't want my kids around her.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No, no worry at all.   Now a father who is a pedophile...   I don't know, people are weird and even if you present them with evidence they only care about what they have already made their minds up about.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, I would not be worried.  I would be more worried about my children hanging around with HER children.  You can't catch sexuality, but I think stupidity can be contagious.|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Not at all. The ignorance of people never ceases to amaze me.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	No I wouldn't and there isn't any reason for anyone else to either!  People are just friggin crazy!|`|a8IRxC4raa	Please let the daycare know what this woman is doing.  She needs to find another daycare.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|BMMMNnAQaa	no she is crazy!|`|jfcrxSSBaa	Nope, would not be worried at all.  In fact, it would be a good cultural experience for them.  Will help them be open minded, not just confront such things with disgust and fear, once they have that experience later in life (because it will most likely happen).|`|kwMA5I1iaa	There is no way I would be afraid of leaving my children with the children of a guy or lesbian couple. That is just silly (and quite sad) that people still act like that. Unfortunately ignorance is a huge problem...as well as those who don't think for themselves.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	oh my goodness I would have hung up on that crazy women. you live in Boston I live in Boston too! go Boston. I answered a question a few weeks ago asking if I would allow my child to be taught by a gay teacher and I answered how would I know it's none of my business un less her teacher came up and said hi I'm your daughter's teacher and I'm gay. I have no problem with gay people and if my daughter has class mates who's parents are gay or a teacher that is gay I'm not going to take her out of that school.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Although I don't support homosexuality, I agree that homosexuals and heterosexuals alike should be respected and not feared. The children are not "gay" just because the parents are, and the parents' sexual orientation has nothing to do with the person they are. <br>  What does she think the daughter will "expose"? You can't change someone's sexual orientation just by being around them. |`|Lq3rKoNGaa	I agree.<br>  People are SO ignorant. Gay/Lesbians have just as much right as we do, and they are kind, loving people too. <br>  <br>  This lady is being horribly prejudice. The nerve she has to call the children's parents, like it is a huge emergency! <br>  This is totally absurd. <br>  No, I would not be afraid or skeptical. No matter what the sexuality of a person is, there can be good people and bad people. Be it purple, orange, black white, gay, lesbian, straight, people are all people, and it should be their character that determines whether they should be trusted. |`|JnMh2ua7aa	No, they have to learn about it some time. As long as nothing graphic is exposed.|`|ab0e19f31eedc59cf4fdc0079d4a8b3baa	The woman that informed you of that was an idiot !  What difference does it make what sexuallity the parents are ?|`|SbeKnODFaa	Wow. People are amazing. I would never judge anyone my their parents or by their own sexuality. <br>  Good luck with the other parents...|`|JsqMSU9Haa	ha you did the right thing. that is insane. i feel bad for the 'phone tree' woman's children - i'd be more afraid of leaving my kids with her!|`|AA10034285	I wouldn't want my children to adopt the insane prejudices that seem to be rife amongst some parents in your neck of the woods.<br>  <br>  These completely unwarranted prejudices, born out of ignorance and fear, are so common in our society and are the sort of things that bring our society low. Our country can never be great until such disgraceful nonsense is a thing of the past.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	why worry they will learn it eventually |`|LNnRSLdtaa	i wouldnt be skeptical at all<br>  id like it <br>  so my kids understand that its okay if they like someone who is the same sex as them <br>  id be horrified if my child was homophobic |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	i would have no problem with my child being exposed or heaven forbid getting to know and love someone who was gay.  |`|vqVd29dWaa	NO NOT AT ALL|`|TcR4EJjHaa	I know many homosexuals.<br>  <br>  I know many heterosexuals.<br>  <br>  To me, there is no difference.It doesn't matter what your Orientation is.It's not like the individual is going to have gay sex right in front of the kids.<br>  <br>  People seriously need to grow up and gain some maturity.No wonder our country is so fucked up.<br>  <br>  I applaud you for calling her insane lol.|`|afkygHMgaa	LOL OMG what a bunch of nutjobs there are in this country. I was wondering where you live myself.....when you said Boston I was shocked. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would call the other mothers and discuss this with them. This kind of hate is the scariest part of it all. I think the other mothers should be aware that this mother is putting HER OWN children in the position of being picked on for having a fruitcake for a parent|`|xL16bC3waa	I think that the sexual preference of the parents of the child are completely irrelevant to the children Children are being taken care of and in their own world so we need not worry about what the parents are doing as long as the children are always being cared for. |`|OQdPzl15aa	That's completely rediculous!!  I personally don't agree with homosexuality, but I also happen to have a lot of gay friends who I love dearly.  Just because you don't agree with someone's lifestyle, doesn't mean you have to be ignorant or hateful towards them.  I wouldn't care or be worried if my children went to school with other kids who had gay parents or were even gay themselves.  Sexual orientation isn't contagious.  There is no reason to be skeptical or afraid of anything as long as you are leaving them in good hands who will care for and protect your kids while you are working.<br>  <br>  It's important to model respectful behavior, because how you react will determine how your kids learn to react.  It doesn't matter if you agree with someone's personal choices or not.  You can still hold your own beliefs without being disrespectful or harmful to another.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	I am pretty conservative in my beliefs but I think that woman is a little crazy. Of course I wouldn't mind. |`|hnZa0mz5aa	I wouldn't be worried at all. You are born gay/straight/lesbian. You can't just all of the sudden change especially when you are a child and don't even have an interest in the opposite/same sex yet|`|LpKPrOxpaa	That is over the top however I think that same sex couples should be banned as they will ruin 'their' childrens lifes, how can a baby have a normal life that way??|`|qQfHM7jVaa	Of course not. That's absolutely ridiculous. I'll be happy when the days of discriminating against people because of anything about them are far in the past.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	Oh, that gives ignorance new meaning...It's not a disease, it's a life style!!! What a horrible thing to do to the children!|`|VinYwLwFaa	Hell no.  That woman is rediculous.  Her children will probably grow up more screwed up than the gay couple's kids.  Gay parents dont teach their kids to be gay.  you either are or you aren't.  |`|51PLCDFtaa	No...that person who called you is lame and ignorant.  I would dismiss her as a person and her stupidness.|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	That was really mean of the other parent. Homosexuality isn't contagious, any more than depression or schizophrenia is. It's just a mental illness and unhealthy behavior choice, but the little girl isn't responsible for the choices of her guardians. It's already hard enough for her to be raised like that. I think compassion and support for that little girl is more warranted than ostracizing her.|`|3tuwWidiaa	No.  And I can't figure out why this would matter.<br>  <br>  While I strongly disagree, I can understand why someone might object to a gay teacher.<br>  <br>  But what does it matter if the kid is in the class?  All I can figure is that they are afraid that the child will talk about her two dads.<br>  <br>  It's day care!  The kid is more likely to learn about Elmo being someone's Mommy than about homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  Frankly, I feel that you should tell this person that you're pulling your kid out because there is a stupid bigot parent.|`|pbeXkX0raa	you are correct, the woman is insane; i feel sorry for her children|`|40496f034fec1f7d8724258f724eb39daa	I see no reason why its caused a fuss. By causing all this ruckus, that woman is spreading discrimination and intolerance.|`|nGBSRDTXaa	That is discrimination right there. Them, not you.<br>  The gay couple's children are just as normal as your children are.<br>  There's nothing to be afraid of.|`|G9MW776Gaa	being gay is not contagious...|`|osDQVLqNaa	Oh my god, that's terrible! Gotta say, I think I'd be quite relieved that all of the 'worried' parents had pulled their kids out before my child was exposed to homophobia and discrimination. As if a gay couple is any more likely to give their three year old sordid information about their sex lives than a straight couple?! <br>  Good on you for standing up for your views and telling the stupid woman she was crazy.|`|dyEZrPDOaa	YES!  Hanging around gay people will make you gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall...you should be very concerned for your kids!|`|jLFDEJGVaa	OMG! They pulled their children out of childcare? That's ridiculous.<br>  I would never, ever do that. They're going to learn about same sex relationships eventually and are far more likely to understand and be acceptive if they are younger.<br>  Like you said, it's not like the children are going to be standing in groups discussing sexual relationships, is it!<br>  Muppets.|`|Z0yjNwIPaa	I probably wouldn't like it very much.<br>  <br>  I think it's funny she called all the parents, though. If she was going to be like that, then why did she agree to look after "their child" anyway?|`|inYjFuFcaa	Trey harsh. Since when did we start treating being a homosexual as a disease? Some people are so inconsiderate seriously. If it was my children, I wouldn't pull them out of the day care just because a gay couple dropped off their daughter. If anything, i'd encourage my children to befriend the girl.|`|dfcgMZnKaa	Let me guess.  Do you live in the South?|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	No. There are always going to be people who have different beliefs than me and my family. I don't go around shoving my beliefs down people's throats, expecting everyone to accept what I believe. The only problem I would have would be if the couple were trying to force me or my child to accept their beliefs as our own.|`|oR3v2IUmaa	There is no reason to pull a child out of daycare because a gay couples child goes there.  That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard today!  I would talk to the directors at school and discuss what happened.  The mother that is in charge of the "phone tree" needs to be relieved of her duties!!  |`|4dd9374df6045331049807f2de428a9aaa	No I would not be worried. My son is going to eventually learn that there are gay and lesbian couples and I'd rather he found out and came to me with any questions he had.|`|W3gGqqIeaa	no its hardly like it can rub of on your kids lol|`|iyRWN59Xaa	No, that's rediculous.  So what if a gay couple has a child in daycare...sheesh.  That woman who called you was a nut.|`|GrBpZNllaa	i guess that other mother was just a  dumbitch|`|a937d2a07b4e33ee20c61ba4864ad6ffaa	no i would not pull my child out.|`|tqr8SSG8aa	she has no right to work there with her bs bias|`|AA10929488	I would have to say don't worry about it- this world is so full of differences that its hard to "hide" children or anyone for that matter from people who are ignorant or unaware. She better be careful because she could be asked to leave the phone tree using it for passing personal info about other people. It's a phone tree, not a gossip line. Now just from experience, be prepared that your children MIGHT ask you questions, as children are very aware to things that "seem" different, but just let them know that people come in all shapes, sizes, families are similar and different and there is nothing wrong with that. Worry about you and yours, forget about such ignorant people.|`|D20ue82Iaa	No, you should not be worried.  Homosexuality isn't contagious or hereditary as a lot of people somehow tend to believe (which I really don't understand either).  In fact, I'm friends with several gay couples, and they say that they don't try to influence their children one way or the other, but respect that they have a right to choose, just as they did.  People freak out about gay and lesbian relationships way too much.  Your children will eventually be "exposed" as the woman said, and that's not really something you can avoid.  And no, there is no reason to be skeptical of leaving your children with the couple unless there is another behavioral reason aside from their sexuality that would give reason to be skeptical.  |`|E5eZn9rcaa	Oh my god! Sorry, I just fell off my chair laughing. I've got two people who are gay and bisexual (The gay one is my guy friend, and my closest female friend is bisexual), and I trust them with anything I hold in my life. I'm even considering naming one of them godmother if I got me a kid, and I'm hetero. <br>  <br>  I think you should tell that backward ignoramus of a woman that just because people differ by sexuality in that way does not mean that they are dangerous. Not at all. I actually once knew a little girl whose parents found out that she had a gonorrhea infection in her throat at the age of 7. I was five then and didn't really know about it until much later, but guess how she got the disease? A respectable, married carer in the local daycare.|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	I wouldn'y be at all worried.  I would be very angry with the parents making a fuss and would probably befriend the gay couple to show solidarity and support them in the face of such discrimination.  |`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i wouldn't care if a gay couples children were around mine. i have nephews and their mom is gay and my kids are around them. people are just idiots and don't think.|`|qK2B6Ivaaa	Oh dear lord!<br>  <br>  <br>  I seriously agree. Who cares if a gay couple's child is at a daycare service with other children? It's not like it's a big deal.<br>  The little kids, I'm sure don't even think anything of it.
pflsOfa7aa	Your a VERY BRAVE MOM! You've made the right decision. It is heart breaking when they cry that long, but you obviously love him very much and realise it is important to set the rules at young age . You and he Will benefit greatly. Don't worry you won't have to do this every night , eventually he will catch on. Hold your ground firmly. It is for the best for both of you. After he's asleep reward yourself. Take a long shower or bath, do some reading , do something for you. You deserve it you have the hardest job in the world. You will be fine, just listen to your instincts.     Good Luck! A fellow Mom.|`|02668e87211509562aa8421f792e4195aa	I know its hard but i think if you just let him cry a few times and he realizes that your not coming and hes not going to get what he wants he will go to sleep. I went through the same thing and i hated to hear my daughter cry|`|iQdoHh72aa	Well, try giving him a bottle to drink at night. my aunt just had babies and that's what she does. So when he starts to cry, just give him a nice (warm or cold) bottle filled with milk.|`|3wBGqSnSaa	Well first you have to make sure nothing else is going on. Like sickness or teething. Sometimes crying at bedtime is the only clue to ear infection. But if you sure he doesn't have that, is he teething? My son is and he's 13m and does this sometimes.  If you think its teething, give him tylenol and oragel or teething drops/tablets.  Maybe just a little extra cuddling. However, even after all that my son still will do this sometimes and we just have to let him CIO till he goes to bed.  Usually doesn't last long tho and when we go thru this stage, it doesn't last long either. A few days to  a week and than he's back to going to bed with no problems. Good luck and I hope its just a phase and he gets over it soon!|`|8f73fb236a586c553c5b5bbd8268d8b8aa	Oh my goodness, I know how hard this is. I used to work in a preschool with infants and toddlers and naptime was very difficult for many. It really is an issue of control, and so you have to be firm. If your son is a healthy little 17-month-old and is not having naps too close to bed-time, then having a bath, reading 1 story, and giving him a good hug and kiss is the most you should do. Check out this link - it may seem cheesy but they are rules from Supernanny. They work every time!|`|LqxzuEw2aa	God first off I hope that Amanda is not a mother.  If so I feel kind of sorry for her kids.  DAMN girl you are cold .  <br>  Sorry anyways. My youngest is almost 17 months old as well.  I know it is hard to listen to them cry.  If he just started this out of the blue, check for any teeth that might be coming in.  "Eye" teeth are usually really hard on babies when they are coming in.  Mine went through this spell for about a week about a month ago.  He was getting his two year old molars in already ( he got his teeth very early)  Teething pain is always worse at night and they like to be comforted when they are in pain.  Try to rub gums down with Orajel and see if that is the problem.  I could not see the molars coming in but about after the third night I began to see them bulge terribly.<br>  Sometimes you do need to let them cry and I know its hard but after you eliminate maybe gas cramps ( he could have had too much applesauce, peas, or gassy foods) or teething and you have done all you can do - then there is nothing else you can do.  They have to work it out.  But I really think he may be cutting teeth and you just dont know it yet...<br>  <br>  Good Luck hon - I know its hard but it will end..I promise|`|hlCfq0gvaa	it sounds to me like your son is testing his bounderies, if he was going to bed fine before he can go to bed now. you need to stand firm you are the parent if you don't it will be a downward spiral from here on out. let him cry you know he is not hurt,he has had a warm drink, a story now you need to turn off the light and leave him to cry your not a bad parent for doing that also stop using him as your comfort blanket.and start texting your husband for comfort.|`|0149e247a5bbb349004793d452b8adc9aa	I agree with the poster above who thinks it might be his teeth or something--especially since it is out of character for him.  Infant's ibuprofen would help that, would be worth a try.<br>  <br>  I had planned to do cry-it-out with my son before he was born, and sort of scoffed at parents who didn't (e.g., on the supernanny shows, etc).  But things completely changed when he was born.  I held him to sleep until he was about 12 months old, and then laid down with him, and he has been falling asleep on his own since he was 13 months old.  No struggles, no having to repeat cry-it-out, I think it has actually saved me time and angst in the long run as compared to my friends who cry-it-out.  He sleeps fine, and the first year passed so quickly in retrospect. <br>  <br>  Do whatever works best for you, but don't feel bad if you don't want to cry-it-out (or if you do want to--either way it is fine), some people kind of looked down on me initially for not doing it but my little guy has zero sleep problems and I am so happy that I didn't.<br>  <br>  Why not try the Toddler No-Cry Sleep Solution (Pantley)--it might have some ideas.  I have heard some good things about it.  I think it involves comforting until the toddler almost falls alseep, leaving, comforting again if starts to cry, etc etc.  As well as some other tips (setting routines, like you have done, consistent bedtimes, etc).<br>  <br>  If you want to cry it out, try Jody Mindell's book (Sleeping Through the Night)--she is a "kinder, gentler" Ferberizer.  I think it is a pretty good book (a friend of mine who is a sleep psychologist recommended it to me when I was reading up on it when I was pregnant).<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide.  Cry-it-out isn't for everybody (it wasn't for me), and there are other options besides cry-it-out (although they probably take longer on average), if you want to try something else.  You don't have to have him cry to get him to sleep well.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you need to let him cry it out.  He already knows you are going to run to him every time.  it sounds cruel but it really isn't...think about it he doesn't have much of another way to communicate yet and crying gets what he wants.  Its time to say no to him or you will be doing this for years.|`|a495b03d41f960c1a8471bd603c42ab6aa	My mom taught me that when this happens, you let them cry for 5 mins, then go in the room to soothe them (rub their back, give a kiss, etc) but NOT pick them up.  Then you leave the room and start the cycle again but then it becomes 10 mins, then 20 mins, etc. My fiance's daughter was going through this a few months ago as well (she's 22 months now) and it took 4 days to get her back into the routine.  It also helped to make sure she was plenty tired at bedtime and has a nap only early in the day.  The important thing is CONSISTENCY, so if you do the bath, books, cd every night then he will understand what comes next and is likely to fight the process less eventually. <br>  <br>  Also, don't put them in the bed when they are completely asleep.  Rouse the baby slightly when you lay him down.  I did this from birth with my daughter (she's 10) and I will tell you that kid can sleep anywhere, anytime when she needs to because of it!  :)|`|ee9b7879a87d003e8f82d18baefd1348aa	Eveyone is going to hate on me for suggesting this but I would just lay there with him until he falls asleep. (or take him to bed with you) He needs you and your instincts are telling you to go back in. Take it one day at a time. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion--<br>  41 weeks with #2!|`|PhDxC2qPaa	I don't get why it breaks your heart. He isn't truly devastated that it is bed time. He is trying to get things to go his way and you are letting him. You need to stand your ground and when it is bedtime, it is bed time.|`|1d8ccc50c6ace4eafcb394c95a11bf1aaa	I know this is hard but he is doing what all toddlers do he is finding out where the boundaries are.<br>  If you give into him he will get worse. You are doing all the right things.<br>  Once you put him to bed leave him just a couple of minutes then go back in and try to quiet him DO NOT pick him up. Leave even if he is still crying then wait 2 minutes and go back in and do the same thing. Although you wont feel calm pretend you are and keep your  voice low and gentle.<br>  If you pick him up he will expect it all the time.<br>  <br>  This is very hard and you may have to go through this for a week or 2 but you will win and bedtime will become easy.<br>  BUT<br>  If you give into him and pick him up then he will just get worse and expect more each time.<br>  <br>  Trust me its hell for 2 weeks but after that its easy and bedtime is a joy!|`|b6a91a707fec429b7c881c99de030a66aa	#1, he may be cutting teeth.  #2 have you tried letting him cry for a few min, then check on him/comfort him.  If he does it again, let him cry 3-5min, then check/comfort.  Again, wait 5-7min & check.  Basically he's supposed to eventually wear down waiting for you, but you're not letting him get out of the crib so he learns he's got to stay in bed.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, I've let them cry for like 10min before checking.  They will learn, but you have to be strong enough to let them cry.  It won't hurt them.  Just make sure diaper, tummy & teeth are good so you're not neglecting a particular need!  Hang in there - you're in a tough position being the only one to work with him at nights!
ltMg9QmXaa	Yes 16 year olds can definitely live alone although I think a 14 year old younger brother would have to be living with a parent or guardian who is over 18 until they or 16, though I don't know that for sure. It might be possible for a 16 year old to get custody of a younger sibling through social services but I'm not sure. This website <a href="http://www.connexions-direct.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.connexions-direct.com/</a> has a section about leaving home, finding housing and your rights for 16 year olds in the UK. <br>  <br>  Good luck by the way, if this is for you and don't be afraid to ask someone from social services or somewhere like connextions, samaritans, etc. for help or advice :)|`|AA10365419	yea you are allowed but i have to say i totally disagree with the law that 16 years old can live alone in england. my daughter is 18 now i do not think she is totally ready i mean she does have money can be independent but just look at the inflation rate now the house prices are going sky-rocketing up. |`|3oGRNQKyaa	yes ur allowed as long as u show u have a stable place to live,and food etc etc..<br>  no,the brother is not<br>  he needs a guardian that is 18+ unless he/she is  allowed to do so and proven by the mother/father of the child..<br>  |`|9J4orFL1aa	yes as long as they can master the accent

kG6VWsGvaa	It's completely safe to dye your hair during pregnancy at any time. The only thing is you want to be sure you're in a well-ventilated area (meaning: lots of space and air), so that you don't directly breathe into the chemicals of the dye. That's why it CAN be unsafe during pregnancy, but as long as you're in a big place (such as a salon), you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Not all women actually get sick from pregnancy -- my mom didn't, and I haven't either so far. However, we have both felt dizzy and nauseas as well. As for eating more / eating less, it's usually in the 1st trimester when you eat less, but it really depends on the woman. Some women feel sick throughout the whole pregnancy which definitely causes them to eat less. However, once some women get to the 2nd or 3rd trimester, that's when all the cravings and wanting to eat more kicks in.|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	I think dying your hair is fine. Call and ask your salon. If it weren't safe, they wouldn't do it. Also not everyone eats more during their pregnancy! I barely ate in early pregnancy(I never vomited)! |`|9WruAKMJaa	First of all, congratulations.  I am four months pregnant and dyed my hair during the first trimester after consulting with my doctor first.  She said that it was fine as long as it is in a well-ventilated area.  But check with your doctor before making any decisions.  Also, every women is different as far as symptoms go.  The dizziness and nausea you are feeling sounds like morning sickness, even without the vomiting.  And yes, it is absolutely normal not to eat as much.  Some women just feel too sick to eat, especially during the first trimester.  Usually, your appetite will improve during the second trimester.  Take care!|`|sGqs1AyYaa	WELL # 1 CONGRATULATIONS SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE BOTH MATURE ENOUGH TO HAVE A BABY :) <br>  <br>  #2 I DYED MY HAIR AT 5 MONTHS AND IT WAS OK BY MY DOC.<br>  <br>  #3 I AM NOW 6 MONTHS AND I ONLY HAD ONE EPISODE OF MORNING SICKNESS SO I GOT LUCKY AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES TOO :D<br>  <br>  #4 I DID NOT GAIN ANY WEIGHT IN THE FIRST TRI.

Z3TtWnlYaa	Your at the range when miscarrige usally happens. Between 6 to 7 weeks. Yes i am sorry to say you have a very high chance of miscarrige. Because of you spots and vaginal bleeding you are showing the early signs of miscarrige. If your peridod bleeding is soaking through your sanitary pad then yes you have the signs.<br>  Because your body is 'threatning miscarrige' get it checked out <br>  Ask you to come and see them for a physical check up. This may entail them using a speculum to look at your cervix. If the cervix is open, then the pregnancy will probably go on to miscarry. If the cervix is closed, then it is more likely that the pregnancy will continue (but this is not guaranteed, as the cervix may open later in time). If the pregnancy is more than 12 weeks advanced, it may be possible for the caregiver to find the baby's heartbeat using a Doppler machine. However, a heartbeat is often difficult to detect this way until about 14 to 18 weeks of the pregnancy. An ultrasound is the preferred way to detect the baby's heartbeat between 7 and 14 weeks. Organise for you to have an ultrasound during the next few days (if the bleeding is light) or as soon as possible if the bleeding is heavy. This will check to see if the baby's heartbeat is present (although the baby's heart beat is not able to be detected by an ultrasound until about 7 to 8 weeks of the pregnancy and the baby is usually too small to be seen if less than 6 weeks pregnant). The ultrasound will also be able to measure the size of the baby to see if this correlates with your expected stage of pregnancy.In the past, women were advised to take 'complete bed rest' (at home or in hospital), even for very light bleeding or if they had experienced other miscarriages in the past. This was aimed at preventing the miscarriage. However, current research suggests that bed rest DOES NOT prevent miscarriage. At present, the general advice for a threatened miscarriage is to avoid very strenuous activity and possibly sexual intercourse, until the bleeding has stopped<br>  I am sorry to say yes you have a chance of miscarrige but you do have a chance the baby will survive.<br>  My heart aches for you, i am sorry i hope your fetus or soon to be baby pulls through.|`|6erg0A8jaa	As a rule of thumb, spotting/bleeding is not normal during pregnancy.  However, some women do spot or bleed and have a healthy pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  The only way to know at this stage if your pregnancy is viable is to have beta blood tests done.  You'll need to have two tests, two days apart.  If your hCG number doubles, you're probably okay.  If the number stays the same, goes down, or isn't doubling you're probably headed for miscarriage.  <br>  <br>  Get to the doctor as soon as you can for a test.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|417c8c8ba60765aba0388d43c628cd9baa	get checked as soon as possible. it could be a sign of miscarriage. i wish you the best|`|11FQyeakaa	yes sorry it is a sign of a miscarriage but pleas get checked out by your dr to be on the safe side and find out what's going on Good luck hun***|`|dCVVP3hmaa	I have been pregnant 3 times, and have never experienced any bleeding whatsoever.  I know if I did, I would go straight to the doctor.  If the bleeding is accompanied with painful cramping, this is not a good sign.  It is not normal, and could possibly be a sign of a miscarriage.  I will keep my fingers and toes crossed for you and I wish you all the best.

AA10357400	Kemungkinan hamil hanya 1%. Tetapi pada mens hari ke 4 dst, peluangnya bertambah (menjadi sekitar 21%-28%), khususnya bagi wanita yang siklus haid-nya pendek.<br>  <br>  Menstruasi adalah proses mengeluarkan sel telur yang mati karena tidak dibuahi sperma dan terkelupasnya lapisan rongga rahim yang menyebabkan keluarnya darah. Jadi tentu saja sperma yang masuk ke dalam vagina akan "kecele" karena tidak menemukan sel telur yang siap dibuahi. Artinya, jawaban untuk pertanyaan anda adalah: HAMPIR DIPASTIKAN TIDAK AKAN HAMIL.<br>  <br>  Sekitar 2 minggu sebelum mens berikutnya datang, maka indung telur / kandung telur akan mengeluarkan sebuah telur yang siap dibuahi. Proses ini disebut ovulasi. Jika anda berhubungan seks pada hari itu, maka peluang hamil menjadi 99%.<br>  <br>  Contoh: (Untuk wanita yang siklus haidnya 28 hari):<br>  Tanggal 1-5 sedang datang bulan.<br>  Tanggal 6-28 sedang bersih (tidak sedang mens).<br>  Tanggal 29 diperkirakan akan dapat mens berikutnya.<br>  <br>  Maka:<br>  Tanggal 1-3 peluang hamil hanya 1%.<br>  Tanggal 4 dan 5 (walaupun sedang mens) peluang hamilnya 21%-28%).<br>  Tanggal 6-12 peluang hamilnya 35%-78%.<br>  Tanggal 13-17 peluang hamilnya 99% (tanggal 15 diperkirakan adalah masa dilepasnya sel telur yang siap dibuahi sperma, tanggal 13-14 dianggap beresiko hamil 99% karena sperma dapat hidup di dalam vagina selama 3 hari, menunggu sel telur datang, dan tanggal 16-17 dihitung karena sel telur bisa hidup selama 48 jam).<br>  Tanggal 17-28 peluang hamilnya 78% sampai 7%.<br>  Tanggal 29 (hari pertama mens bulan berikutnya) peluang hamil 1%.|`|0hvAVVPnaa	Tdk akn hamil klu berhubungn pd saat menstruasi coz ovum tdk dproduksi n rahim yg lagi dlm kondisi pergntian...lgian berhubungn pd saat menstruasi jg dilarang dlm agama...coz si prmpuan tdk dlm kndisi brsih...lgian byk cr2 lain yg bs dgunakn utk mncegah khamilan ^o^|`|2sGjNk0qaa	ih..menjijikkan..<br>  kamu akan mendapatkan penyakit.<br>  hati hati..berhub di waktu mens itu kotor!!!<br>  <br>  lebih baik mencegah daripada mengobati|`|6mHXGT1uaa	ketika qta sedang seks dalam keadaan menstruasi, maka dikatakan seorg cewe tsb ga akan bs hamil krn mengalami masa ga subur. kalau sperma masuk k dalam vagina cewe maka kemungkinan hamil ga akan da. jd kalau mau pk cara aman dalam berhubungan tanpa pengaman yaitu sex pd saat menstruasi.|`|5NbGRKKvaa	Tentu saja tidak akan membuat hamil karena pada saat mens sel telur sudah mati.

You're probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  If he doubts you, let him read the directions that came with the pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  It says that no matter how faint the line, it's still a positive result.<br>  <br>  You're probably not very far along, and that's why it's so light.<br>  <br>  It detects HCG, and early in the pregnancy your body doesn't produce very much of it. So, that would explain the faint line.<br>  <br>  Although, I would still test again to be sure.<br>  <br>  Both times I took tests with my daughter and with this baby that I'm pregnant with, the second line was very faint.<br>  <br>  <br>  CONGRATS!<br>  <br>  =)|`|BZjDGEn8aa	I checked online and yes, its positive.

A pregnancy test just tells you whether or not you have HCG in your urine, it doesn't tell you how much. Therefore, if there is any kind of line, however faint it may be, that means you have HCG in your system, which means you are pregnant. Congrats!|`|rlVHIKBdaa	If you see  two lines it a positive result. You need to go to Planned parenthood or the health department and get it confirmed.

I would recommend doing this or seeing a doctor.|`|3Qh6fJMJaa	YES!!! I was TTC for 11 months and every time my period was late I would be SURE I was pregnant. I was convinced pregnancy tests didn't work for me--once I even went to the doctor to get a blood pregnancy test I was so sure. I eventually got pregnant with the help of a specialist (not to scare you)---it turned out I wasn't ovulating regularly so my period was irregular too. Here's really what helped me the most:<br>  Start doing temping and register at the website www.fertilityfriend.com. You put in your temps each day and it will track when you ovulate (your temp spikes when you ovulate). I would see the spike--and know that I had to wait for 2 weeks to test. At 2 weeks your temp will go down if your period is coming (this saved me a ton of $$$ on tests!) and stay up if your pregnant.<br>  There is a TON of info at this site--it's the perfect site for info on trying to get pregnant.<br>  Also check out peeonastick.com--sounds like you've taken a lot of home tests so you'll like this site.<br>  Start this right away but also make a doctors appointment. Your OBGYN can give you some tips as well.<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|8l1muKyjaa	same here hun! i make up a baby in my head every time and honestly i do feel pregnant mostly!! but i think thats more of imagination!...the first time i got pregnant i never felt even one symptom...<br>  <br>  just bring your mind at ease and get busy somewhere, i know its really hard divertin your mind sumwhere even!<br>  <br>  i started vitex this cycle and i have no pms symtoms even...so its better as i am stop assuming if i even have a baby inside me!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|Kd5dPsHSaa	I have four kids and the only time i 'tried' to get pregnant is between the first and hte second.

AA10077811	Pakai kondom memang lumayan aman, tapi banyak orang yang tidak suka karena bikin lecet atau sakit.<br>  <br>  Pakai teknik kalender saja.<br>  Ovulasi *SELALU* terjadi 14 hari sebelum haid hari pertama berikutnya. Biar aman, jangan lakukan seks 2 hari sebelum dan sesudah ovulasi tersebut.<br>  <br>  Contoh: Haid berikutnya adalah tanggal 30 November 2008. Berdasarkan perhitungan di atas, masa suburnya adalah tanggal 18 November 2008. Berarti jangan melakukan hubungan seks antara tanggal 16 November sampai dengan 20 November 2008.<br>  <br>  Bila berhubungan seks tanggal 16 dan 17, bayi perempuanlah yang berpeluang besar akan didapat.

Is Tosha making noises about wanting to be the godmother?  If not, leave it alone.  If she is, tell her, Oh, Tosha, I've got a godmother for Jr.; she's  a very good friend of mine, I've known her for a long time, I totally trust that she'll follow my wishes for Jr. if anything ever happened to me, and I just can't see myself changing my mind about that, even for family.|`|gYkQc8Lraa	this is an awkward situation. just tell her and get it over and done with|`|AA10247494	Hun honestly I think you may be over thinking this. Tosha seems like a very nice person and like she'll understand. It's not Tosha's choice or Tosha's baby but yours and honestly it doesn't matter what she says... It's about what makes you happy and if Erin is your Godmother of choice then it doesn't matter. <br>  <br>  I'd just be very simple and blunt and would tell your brother and Tosha at the same time who you've chosen as to be your child's Godmother. They probably won't care and if they do who are they to tell you what to do with your baby? Think about it.|`|AA11018222	Seems like an odd choice for a godmother.  What happens if something happens to you?  Would the baby then grow up with your brother's ex?  I doubt that your brother would go and visit his niece or nephew if they were being raised by his ex.  Why didn't you just pick an aunt or uncle as godparents and skip the drama?  You could have still invited her as a friend to the baptism.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	well she should understand. If your brothers ex is one of your friends you still have a right to choose whoever you want as your childs godparents.|`|PTLXDmG4aa	i think your mother shouldn't be so sure that she will be ok with it.. basically, nobody would, no matter who you are in the world there would be some negative feelings towards the situation if you were in erins position...its human nature.. even if she says its ok, seriously it isn't.. secondly, your mother is toshas mother-in-law.. and this does sound like your mother is being a typical mother-in-law, not truely considering her feelings - toshas feelings will never be a true priority and she can get away with whatever, as long as she can make it sound reasonable.. this is called 'passive aggressive'<br>  you have to look at the big picture, if her passive aggression starts to push her, there may also be subtle damage done later when erin and your brother start to have children.. feeling as though her feelings are not at all a priority, which is true she may take on the same excuse making as you guys as in 'oh well its not really up to them' and say to herself 'if i can make it sound logical and fair then i can do whatever i want', which is the sort of attitute which she would be well in her right to do.. there is nothing worse than subtle rudness which is what you guys are doing..you will, and i can promise it, make tension and it may be unfixable..<br>  secondly, stop calling erin 'family', your brother and her chose to end it because they are not right for each other, that was the only connection to make you guys family.. why is she still hanging around anyway?? i feel sorry for your brothers wife, id hate to be in a family that isn't aware of what is and isn't innaprorpiate behaviour.. and you guys know it isn't

nt65AYPXaa	Things like cancer, diseases, miscarriage, etc. happen since mankind was cursed because of Adam and Eve.  You could go to church often, be a good Christian, and have a priest or preacher bless you and your baby, get closer to God, please God on a daily basis, and your chances could be better, since God can perform miracles and give life.|`|AA11927140	The large majority of miscarriages occur because of a chromosomal abnormality.  I completely understand your being nervous, but really, all you can do is take your prenatals and stay away from anything harmful to an embryo / fetus (drugs, alcohol, etc.)  Unfortunately, if you are going to miscarriage, there is nothing you can do to prevent it.  But I wouldn't worry too much about it at this point.  Just take it day by day, and hopefully, all is well.  Best of luck to you!<br>  P.S.  And I bet you are about to get a lot of answers saying that stress can cause you to miscarriage.  According to my OB, that is a myth.  Of course, it is better for your body overall to stay calm, etc., but stress in itself will not make you miscarry.  That being said, try and relax and take it easy.  No point in worrying because you may be worrying for nothing.  :)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Dont stress it wont help anything. In nature some things go wrong. If your taking your vitamins, staying active, get good OB care, and eat well and tell the DR of all meds you have taken since conception, thats all you can do. Read up on your pregnancy, and child develpment, theres alot to learn and it will comfort you. For the most part the cause is unknown. Its just nature. If the mother is out taking drugs/drinking, gets into horrid accidents, like you fall down a flight of stairs type of thing, besides that, its nature.|`|HzH4j6peaa	First of all stay away from all of drugs and liquor...wine is ok though it is good to have a class of wine a day (if you drink wine). For the different types of food and exercises you need to go to your nearest pregnancy facility and ask for a pamphlet about how to prevent miscarriages.<br>  The best of luck!!!|`|AA10976444	You can look after yourself, and don't do strenous things.  If a miscarriage is going to happen it will happen.  You can't stop a miscarriage.  Its basically nature's way of telling you that there was something wrong in the pregnancy.|`|96mkEwkwaa	well first off you need to learn  how to spell. secondly, you need to take it easy and not do anything too excruciating. stay away from caffiene, its bad for the baby. dont drink or smoke|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Miscarriages happen in up to 30% of all known pregnancies and many times, no one can pinpoint way his happened.  I miscarried at 5 1/2 weeks pregnant in December, and they couldn't tell me why, exactly, as I had been doing everything perfectly (no caffeine, no smoking, eating lots of vegetables, etc).   I was told that probably chromosmal issues in the developing baby caused miscarriages about 50% of the time.  This is nature's way of taking care of a pregnancy/baby that is not compatible with life.   So, yes, I was devastated by my miscarriage, but if the baby could not be healthy (we already had a baby at full-term who was born with such severe heart defects that even with surgery, he was never able to get off a ventilator and never came home with us alive), then I am also grateful that I was not forced to make any very hard decisions later in pregnancy (if the new baby had had the same heart defects as our first, we would have probably chosen to have that baby born early, so it wouldn't suffer any longer than necessary.)|`|O4ty1tjjaa	My advice is stress.  the best thing for you is to not worry about it.  do the best you can, don't drink, don't smoke, no heavy lifting, ...etc.  most of the time a miscarriage happens when there is something genetically wrong.  Good luck and take care!

AA10648369	You can start your child on a sippy cup at any age, as long as he is able to drink out of it. I agree with you about keeping the juice/water/etc in a cup so that they don't associate the bottle with it. Don't dilute it, just as the label says, and as far as how much, I would fill the sippy cup and offer it to him in between feedings. Unless instructed by your pediatrician, it should not replace his regular feedings, just be a suppliment to restore his electrolytes. My son had problems with diarrhea and we had to do the same thing off and on for him.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	If your son is vomiting or has diarrhea, you should offer 2 ounces of Pedialyte per hour to keep him well hydrated.  If he has diarrhea, it's ok to give it to him in a bottle or cup.  If he is vomiting, it's better to give it to him just small sips at a time, perhaps from a syringe.<br>  <br>  At 5 months old your son is probably not old enough to drink from a cup.  I understand not wanting to get him used to drinking all his liquids from a bottle - and some say offering anything but milk by cup makes it easier to transition to the cup - but if your baby is sick, now is not the time to worry about cup training.  If your baby is sick and he needs to keep hydrated, you should give him the Pedialyte in whatever form he will take it.<br>  <br>  We use the Avent cup for our 9 month old and he is still learning to use it.  As long as you introduce the cup early and frequently I think any kind of cup is fine.  I like the Avent one because it really is pretty spill proof.|`|5TjDdnZjaa	I would give him 2oz and water it down to make 3oz. A bottle would be best unless he has already used the sippy cup before. But whatever you do you need to water it down cause baby's aren't suppose to have straight juice. (If they get straight juice they may become allergic to it later on.) But yea that is a good sippy cup to use.|`|D8vOpNWgaa	mix the pedialyte 1/2 water. if he has not used a hard top sipper you may have some problems from going to the bottlel nipple to the Avent magic sipper cup. i would try the nuby soft top sippers. then move him to a harder top sipper cup.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	ok if he has diarriah then the pedialyte will make it worse if it is given to him all at once. offer him 2-3 oz every 10-15 min. i went through this a few weeks ago.|`|WGXdfh22aa	yes he is old enough to use a sippy cup. i would give him about 6 oz.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	If he is dehydrated it doesn't matter how the liquids get in, he just needs to get them in. You want to make up for fluid loss. Monitor his diarrhea or vomiting or whatever the cause for concern was and offer a similar amount of liquid to replace it.<br>  <br>  I'd give him an 8 oz bottle and see what he takes. 5 months is young for a sippy cup, too young for him to lift it himself. Just use a bottle, at 5 months he won't remember it or get confused.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We were told to give whatever our son wasn't drinking. For example: if he usually drank a 5 oz. bottle but left 3 oz. in it then we'd give him 3 oz. of Pedialyte.|`|WPI0Z47saa	It doesn't make any difference if it is in a bottle or a cup. He may not take to the sippy cup yet but you can try. He is still a little young. Just give him a little to see how much he will drink.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Give him however much he wants.  Use a bottle.  He's sick and doesn't need any additional stress.  Unless, of course, he finds the sippy cup interesting and distracting, in which case, go for it!|`|i8Ch743Laa	Bottle or cup shouldn't matter. I'd just give him maybe 5-8 oz of it. I gave it to my daughter as well,and that's how I did it.|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Depending on the child but 5 months seems a little young to be using a cup....also you can dilute the juice with water.
eu6UQElYaa	were they low in your abdomen or did they start in your back and move from the top of your abdomen down? <br>  Did they get closer together and more intense or did they start out stronger and just kind of pop up randomly?   <br>  If they were low and fairly random then it was probably false labor contractions.   I just got a bunch of them this morning.  They were about 10 minutes apart, low in my abdomen and very painful.  But still weren't real labor contractions and now later in the day I've not had a single one.  It's been going like that for me for the last week or so.   It's your body's way of preparing but it isn't there yet.<br>  <br>  Of course, they could've been real true labor contractions which will sometimes start up as you start to dilate but then quit naturally on their own early in the labor process. Although that's fairly uncommon.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Hey! I was due this past Tuesday Feb. 24th too!!!!    I wish I would start some contractions as well. A lot of people have told me stories about how they started contractions then fell asleep and the contractions went away.  I'm starting to think I should just stay awake even though they say thats bad becuase then fatigue might set in during labor.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	that happened to me. I truely thought I was in labor. I packed my bag and everything. I went to sleep and woke up 3 times during the night to pee in the middle of contractions but when I woke up in the morning at 7 they were all gone. It's just your body practicing as frustrating as that is. Eventually, you will start to get your contractions and they won't stop. Until then, enjoy the frustrations of waiting and braxton hicks. But know your body is doing this for a reason, so the discomfort isn't for no reason, they are doing something. just not something big enough for labor.<br>  <br>  hopefully you will go soon =] best of luck with the last few days/week of pregnancy and an easy delivery!|`|lRr46ABUaa	With my first kid I had really bad contractions 5-6 min apart for days before I finally had enough and went to the hospital where I still was only dilated to a 2. With my second child when I first started having contractions I told myself I wasnt going in until my water breaks, but I couldnt take it anymore so I went in anyway. Good thing I did because the heart rate on baby kept dropping when I had these contractions. So it is always a good idea just to go and get checked by a nurse or doctor just in case!!|`|8326807c604598efc63e87668a55093baa	now may months are you> you need to go to the hospital maybe the baby is pushing to come out,, maybe its time.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	No, they're real and it's almost time!|`|QeoljgkBaa	If they have gone away it sounds like braxton hicks they can be quite strong.<br>  <br>  I can remember with my first (I now have 3!!!) I thought I was in labour, but it turned out to be constipation - I am really glad that I didn't turn up at the hospital at the first sign in that instance I can tell you.
FiUprYsvaa	Popsicles<br>  Soup<br>  Ice cream<br>  Pasta<br>  Jello<br>  Deviled Eggs-Really good. <br>  Icee's <br>  Oatmeal<br>  Tuna Helper<br>  Tuna & Mayo mixed together in a bowl.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's all I can think of.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Yes Jello is good. Ice cream it says is not such a great idea, it will dull the pain because it's cold but it can make it worse after.. Ice cream used to be given after someone had ones tonsils removed.. but everything the others suggest is correct.<br>  <br>  Plus I found this on google.. some other ways to relieve a sore throat.<br>  <br>  It can last for a couple of days. it's caused by an infection.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_9506_relieve-sore-throat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_9506_relieve-sor...</a>|`|LcnSBvqWaa	pudding, ice cream, smoothies, freezes..|`|o8uGsZxmaa	Yogurt and Ice cream =D<br>  <br>  It's what i've been eating, my throat's sore too =(|`|xPDSkSyjaa	Really cold liquids like apple juice or water - nothing with acid like orange juice or soda.<br>  <br>  Also try really cold jello, sherbet or sorbet (nothing milk based if you have been coughing)  I like to hold a nice size bite in my mouth and let it melt and drip down the back of my throat.  <br>  <br>  If cold doesn't work for you make some tea and add honey.  That will help.  If you can get out to the store or send someone to a large grocery store where they carry organic products - try ThroatCoat tea.  It works very well.  <br>  <br>  If coughing isn't a problem you could also eat yogurt or pudding and I'd try some simple broth based soups with small veggies (like old fashioned campbells) so you don't have anything too large to swallow.  Other soft foods:  mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, oatmeal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Feel better.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Eat soups, smoothies, yogurt, ice cream, anything cold or warm. not hard foods that you have to chew on alot.<br>  <br>  I had a horrible sore throat. everytihng i ate hurt. so i didnt eat much for the whole week.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	Chamomile tea with honey will be your best friend!<br>  Other options-<br>  Soup<br>  Ice Cream<br>  Popsicles<br>  Oatmeal<br>  Pudding<br>  Jello<br>  Yogurt|`|T0NvgQTUaa	ice cream. yogurt. popsicles. oatmeal. soup.<br>  <br>  I just got my tonsils out and it hurts to swallow.

TJezsCkHaa	I thought im the only one who noticed that change.I don't know,i liked Kate before when she showed us how close she is to every mom.But now,i think she is living that "high"life somehow!<br>  Anyways.i still like that show and i still watch it,but not as interested and awaiting for it like before.|`|xy5UNiELaa	I haven't watched the show in a while, but I saw Kate on Dr. Phil (for the Octuplet Mom episode).  She looked almost completely different.  I know TV makes you look great with all the make-up and all, but geez.  I've seen her on other shows in the past, and she definitely looks like she has money now.  That sounds bad, but she looked like a Hollywood celebrity and not the Kate she was in the beginning.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	When was it/she ever "real"?  It is like the Truman Show having your kids grow up on TV, rather disgusting and I don't know what mom would do that to their kids in the first place.  They have always used their kids to get money, fame and free stuff - nothing real about that.<br>  <br>  A million dollar plus house is nothing when you look at the MILLIONS they have gotten in free trips/clothing/toys/work done, etc. and who knows how much they get per show...<br>  <br>  Nothing has changed with the show, I think you are just realizing the parents are greedy which they always were.|`|pNKBszseaa	im assuming you are talking about Jon and Kate plus 8. Yes she seems to be snooty now, she has definitely changed. Not the same down to earth real mom she was in the beginning! Welcome to show business.|`|jHmepKRMaa	It looks like it may end up john plus eight or kate plus eight or john plus four and kate plus four.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	what show are you talking about?|`|lr9E8IC5aa	And what so would that be?|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I think the prettier she gets, the snobbier she gets.  Just my opinion.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	Uhhhhhh...you failed to mention what show you are talking about.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I didnt watch it the much, but the other night when I saw the dog episode called it quits.  Seriously -getting 2 puppies.  Wait til the kids are older.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plus the new Demetri Martin show on comedy central was pretty funny.  And theres a new comedy about moms coming out on I think ABC.  And I only have so much TV time.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Are you talking about Jon & Kate Plus 8?<br>  <br>  ETA- Yes she has changed big time. Their new home is huge now, so maybe she feels they're famous and well off now? The kids are still adorable but if she becomes more and more snobby their fan base won't be so amused anymore.|`|sxecXFgraa	Sorry your show has changed.  Can't say if I feel the same because I don't know what show you're talking about.<br>  <br>  Edit:  If you are talking about Jon and Kate plus 8, IMO, she has been snobby a little longer than the last few shows.  I felt she was after the first season the show was on.|`|AA11206135	"getting "snobby??  Kate is the most obnoious, controlling, husband insulting woman I have ever seen!!!  And "real"?? She doesn't know he meaning of the word.....let her quit exploiting her kids and go back to work like everybody else.....|`|nrqWwQBXaa	sorry but i did not like them in the first place i knew some thing had to be wrong with them sorry it took so long for them to show there real side?
3LEPfzVhaa	It doesn't hurt too much, but it will depend person to person. <br>  Try not to go in thinking about making it a big deal, so it will hurt less. <br>  Your eyes may water a bit, but don't feel dumb about it.<br>  Maybe listen to your Ipod at the same time, or talk to whoevers going with you.<br>  Or sing! I went on a rollercoasters recently and I was so scared I started singing Disco 2000, and everyone joined in! It really makes you forget your scared!<br>  After, ask if theres any creams you can put on to soothe them if they're hurting.|`|AA10673927	I remember the first time I got my eyebrows waxed, haha. It's really not that bad. Just close your eyes and relax, you'll be fine, I promise. It'll be over before you know it.<br>  <br>  [:|`|WsE1MpgOaa	When you get them done hold someones hand really<br>  tight and think of something funny, one of my bestfriends<br>  had it done the other day and i just made her laugh,<br>  hope this helps ! x|`|zPvlh82naa	It's simple   you just have to sit there while the tech takes care of you.  It really does not hurt.|`|tvC7604haa	You don't need to worry!|`|Vk4mZi5Yaa	I used to get my eyebrows waxed all the time but now i know what shape they should be i just pluck them, but anyways; You don't need to worry! I gotta admit it does hurt a little bit but just think how beautiful you will look afterwards and it makes all the pain worth it!<br>  <br>  Good luck! x
BSockNx7aa	hmmm.<br>  i understand how this would be annoying<br>  especially if your a person who likes things<br>  set and stone and planned out<br>  tell your friend you thought it was just<br>  going to be the two of you<br>  and that you wish she would <br>  have updated you more|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Sounds like she's slowly trying to exclude you. Maybe back off for a little while and let her come to you.|`|2OYyljWEaa	Gosh I would be SOOOO annoyed. I hate it when plans are unorganized especially when I need to tell my mom who I'm going with, where I'm going to be ect. You did the right thing by not going.|`|iT5vnplHaa	yea mad annoying|`|EMEpr7Fcaa	I can understand why you got mad. She pretty much ditched you!|`|AA11589320	I am with you.  <br>  <br>  I suspect the second friend has a personal agenda which is why she said that.  In other words she may have done similar things in the past so cant agree with you in case another friend raises her own past behaviour. <br>  <br>  It is just out right rude. <br>  The very act of inviting others if not unreasonable sure is very unreasonable when these others then cause events that sees you pushed out of the picture.     Friends, what a pain they can be.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	You had every right to get mad, and, if I were you, I'd be SO pissed off. She was being entirely unfair and unreasonable. You should really talk to her about what she did, because that is mean, and not being a good friend. You should talk to her about this, but do it in a calm and civilized way. You know you are right to get mad, but you can't let your anger get the best of you when you talk to your friend. Ask her why she basically bailed on you, and why she invited people when it was just the two of you who were going to go. If she gets defensive, and denies it, then you honestly begin looking for new friends, because she's not acting like one.
tBaCFTtBaa	have you tried www.toysrus.com ? LOL j/k  maybe get the name of the manufacturer and check through their site.  good luck!|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	have you tried baby co.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I just moved from Canada to Australia and had a hard time finding nursery sets as well. The ones I've found that are similar is:<br>  BabyHood<br>  LoveNcare<br>  <br>  I've got my local baby supplier to order what I wanted from the manufacturer. Here's a link to BabyZoneDirect where they list the manufacturers. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyzonedirect.com.au/catalogue/c9" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyzonedirect.com.au/catalog...</a><br>  <br>  I didn't order from them direct cuz I'd have to pay shipping. If you order from your local guy, they can bring it and you don't have to pay shipping. You'll save tons of cash.
bT4npA7Jaa	Nicole is common. My sister, my best friend, my other friend and my teachers middle names are all Nicole. I like Alaina Brielle best. I like the spelling of Alaina. It's really pretty.|`|FoBLX9ceaa	i like alaina brielle, even though nicole is my name lol, nicole is a common middle name, but if you do go with nicole maybe try spelling it differently, like nichole or something else :)|`|0uhRgfcsaa	i prefer nicole.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	alaina brianne is a great name and compromise!|`|jtjISk6qaa	Alaina Brielle!<br>  <br>  lol my sisters middle name is Nicole.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I also think Nicole is too common. Everyone and their mother's middle name is Nicole.  Unless it has special meaning to you both - skip it. It's like naming your daughter's middle name "Girl" in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I LOVE Alaina! Other spellings:<br>  <br>  Alayna<br>  Elaina<br>  Elayna<br>  <br>  Brielle is pretty and not as common.<br>  <br>  You both could compromise with Nicole and Brielle.  Noel? Might be a good mix of Brielle and Nicole.  Alaina Noel is very pretty!<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck to you both!|`|ValLVBcYaa	Nicole really is too common a name for a middle name.

Love the name Alaina so unquie, congratulations on the baby <3|`|BBLraJE3aa	Alaina Brielle or Alaina Aubrielle<br>  I agree, nicole is too common for a middle name or first name & Brielle just sounds so much cuter!<br>  Good luck?|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	Alaina Nicola Brielle|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like Alaina Nicole, actually. How about spelling it Alayna?or Alainah?|`|d3a0045532049c589188fdb06b472cffaa	your is better!  alaina brielle|`|lBW6n3I1aa	I really like Alaina Nicole, It just kinda...flows well.<br>  <br>  Cute name!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Even though Nicole has been and still is common, Brielle seems to be a name most people would opt for. Therefore, by trying to avoid old popular names lots of people dive into trendy names which are actually the next new common name. So anyway, if your concern is of name popularity either name you choose would bring you into that issue. Alaina is a very pretty name and I think both middle names sound good. I think you and hubby should just toss a coin. lol  Also I prefer Alaina spelled that way, but if I were to choose an alternate spelling it would be Alayna.|`|Fqx1hOM4aa	I like Alayna or Alaina or Aleyna<br>  <br>  For the middle name I like both but I agree Nicole is too common. Plus, it seems every sexy group of talentless girl singers has a member named Nicole (pussycat dolls, girlicious, etc.) which gives it a bad image<br>  <br>  Brielle is a beautiful name though and I think Aleyna Brielle looks really pretty written down. Good Luck! :)|`|pO0s0bhHaa	Both are lovely middle names.  I prefer Brielle since I think it flows with Alaina.    So funny about what you think of Nicole.  If I had a daughter I'd name her Sarah Nicole - I guess you're right, it is common!<br>  <br>  I like how Alaina is spelled, don't change it or make it complicated.|`|SO2oRloEaa	Alaina; Elaina; Alayna; Alaena<br>  <br>  Alaina Noelle<br>  Alaina Nicole Brielle<br>  Alaina Jenine<br>  Alaina Madelyn<br>  Alaina Trostle<br>  Alaina Serene<br>  Alaina Genevieve or Genevieve Elaine<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|BpfPQkqbaa	I agree with you, nicole is very popular as a middle name. It's becoming one of those filler names, like Marie and Lynn. I like Alaina Brielle.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	Alania Nicole is good but nicole is overdone, Brielle is ok <br>  Nicole may be the better option|`|2bC0dvPKaa	Alaina Brielle is the prettiest! The sound of it flows really nicely.<br>  <br>  And I've also seen the name spelt Elaina, but I like the spelling with the "A" the best.|`|o37i9Nazaa	Alaina Nicole sounds better in my opinion.|`|I1ZAEmLsaa	Alaina Rae?|`|fySPUUy9aa	husband.|`|Ht3jjpSiaa	i like alaina nicole better and love the name alaina is so cute|`|8JgFKfpUaa	i think your name suggestion is VERY pretty!!!<br>  you could also spell it alayna???|`|FsFp4f1Yaa	The wife should pick because she has to give birth|`|eznL5Zwvaa	I am sorry,but I have to go with Nicole.|`|BGPG2FaFaa	i LOVE THE NAME BRIELLE I THINK THAT IS THE BEST ONE|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Have to go with your husband on this one...Alaina Nicole...<br>  <br>  Another spelling could be Elena....Elena Nicole... I think that LOOKS<br>  pretty written out together....You have an "E" and and "N" in each name...and so it kind of fits....<br>  <br>  Never heard of Brielle before...It's not bad, but I still like Nicole best with Alaina...You have the 2 "n" sounds, so the two names kind of flow<br>  together.....

nrqWwQBXaa	i think it is 13. you are 15 why does she make you stay down stairs?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well i dont think there is an exact legal age, it is up to the parents, I would leave my child home alone around age 13|`|AA10325228	where I live it is 12|`|bjqjkDMHaa	I stayed at home alone once when I was nine, I think, but my grandparents were at home right across the rarely traveled street we live on, so... I don't know.  I've always been very down-to-earth as well, so my parents trusted me to behave while they were gone.  Now, at fourteen, I've stayed at home before alone for a few hours, and sometimes with a friend of mine over.  I don't know about legal issues, but I think it really depends on first off: how trustworthy the kid is, and how long the parents will be gone, how safe the neighborhood is, if it's night or day, and maybe most of all, if the kid's comfortable with it.|`|q845s7Nhaa	you can stay home alone. i was staying home alone for short periods of time when i was around 8 then the time gradually got longer. now i'm 16 and my parents could go away for a week and i would be fine. no im not a crazy teen either so i wouldn't be throwing parties or anything, just living a normal life. now let me state for the record though so no one freaks out my parents do not leave me for weeks i was just using that as an example.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It depends where you are from.  Where I'm from, the legal age when a child can be left home alone is 12+|`|AA11887900	Mostly there is no "legal age" to be left home alone, but usually 12 is used as a relatively sensible safe age for being home for a few hours or over daylight hours.<br>  <br>  For overnight or longer, 14 to 16, depending on the kid. For a super social kid who is likely to invite friends over and cause trouble, maybe later, and after trust is built-up. My sons were relatively "booring" teens who I would trust home alone for a weekend at 14, but my daughter... maybe never.<br>  <br>  If you can't trust a 16-18 year old home alone for a weekend, you have bigger problems.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	From a Parents Perspective I think it depends solely on the age & maturity level of your Child but personally I wouldn't leave a child at home alone in the day time before High School & never at night before 15 or overnight before they are legally an Adult Then I still leave a couple of numbers just in case I can't be contacted But in saying that all 3 of my kids are mature & responsible teens|`|R6K1Qnosaa	I believe that kids should be left alone when their parents think that they're ready. If your a responsible child you should be able to take care of yourself. On the other hand, if you are a trouble maker, you are going to need to show your parent/ guardian that you are ready to stay home alone. That means gaining trust. Good luck!|`|2FsNdcXEaa	There is no legal age really (I mean, you can't leave your kid alone when they are like 6 year olds for obvious reasons), but my younger  brother is 13 and stays home alone.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	The law where I live is 13.<br>  I think when the child is responsible, then they can stay home alone =).|`|DPSadeFjaa	I would at least say around 14 after you've built up trust with your child. So, they know how to look after themselves when your not there. However, my dad did this and he sort of ended up catching me with my boyfriend.|`|ll6e1VEzaa	The legal age for staying home alone is 12. That's also the age that you are allowed to babysit.|`|sB5dyaczaa	Around 10. I aloud my 13 year old to be alone in 1st grade while I was next door.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	The legal age in the U.S. I think is 12, but it may vary state to state.  Personally, for me, I think it would be 12 for short periods of time.  14 for all day, and 16 for over night.  Also, factoring in maturity level.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Well to be honest it depends on the maturity of the child staying home.  Then again your grandmother may be old fashion and may think that it is not right for a gal to be on her own anyways.|`|OgiG1i44aa	NEVER. KIDS SHOULD NEVER BE ALONE.|`|UGSlEhnbaa	I started staying home alone when I was 13. But it depends on where you live and the time you are alone. You are not allowed to stay alone over night until around 13 at least.|`|c42736cb7fec6cc73ab0f4153c26567eaa	i stayed home alone when i was 12 and babysat when i was 13.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I think your fine, your responsible enough to stay home.

PTLXDmG4aa	i found around the 9 week time to be very hard.. hormones were doing crazy things to me. my skin was bad - usually flawless, i was vomiting, tired, sore etc.. there wasn't much i could do about it.. i used baby powder on my back to try and dry up any oils, this was better than moisturiser.. i also used eye drops on the red pimples on my face (eye drops shrink blood vessels), but im 16 weeks now and everything is just about back to normal.|`|j083iujcaa	not much you can do! mine cleared up around the end of the 1st trimester, but untill then just continue your usuall facial routine|`|AA10458750	Noooo....your skin will be a mess throughout pregnancy. You will have some weeks that are better than others, but for the most part it never clears up. Try washing 2x a day and using oil-free lotion afterwards.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Its your hormones for sure.  I had quite a bit of breakouts early on too.  It does go away.  Mine did anyway.  Once your body starts adjusting to the hormones, you should even out a bit.  I would just wash your face more than before.  That's all i did, and kept it under control.  Around 12 weeks, the breakouts stopped.  Hopefully they will for you too!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	YES! I've had the same problem since like week 6 and my doctor prescribed me a face wash and moisturizer thats much stronger than over the counter products. Its worked really well and my face has cleared up a lot. Try asking your doctor about it and see what they can do for you. Good Luck!|`|7zMtmKJaaa	try some moisterizers that don't contain like salicylic acid or some kind.<br>  im 12 wks and my skin is perfectly fine, thank God <3<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|lJd5OET6aa	at first you normally do break out but around 11-12 weeks it will clear up this is what happen to me

This song always gets me.<br>  <br>  3) Folding Stars by Biffy Clyro - if you like Secondhand Serenade I'm hoping you're open to alternative-rock music and if you are you cannot help but love the Biffy.

So until you are ready to care for and provide for a baby you are not ready for sex.<br>  <br>  Sex is the ULTIMATE act of love between two people and I don't think at 13 you can know what love really is....<br>  <br>  Once you have sex for the first time you can not ever get your virginity back, ever....so make it special and make it with the right guy. Make sure you are not doing it just because you *think* everyone else is...because trust me, at your age it's probably mostly talk.<br>  <br>  This is my way of thinking.... sex is an adult act with adult consequences and until you can step up and deal with the consequnces as an adult then no... you are not ready.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	You're obviously not ready if you have to ask perfect strangers if you're ready.<br>  Yeah, I'm not your mom.<br>  <br>  You'll know you're ready when you find a guy you love and want to be with through whatever may happen as a result of sex.<br>  You're ready when you know all the consequences and know how to avoid them.<br>  You're ready when you're serious about sex, and you know that it's something special between you and the man you love, not something you go out and do with some guy you just met on the weekend.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're ready at 13.<br>  Respect yourself.<br>  Tell him to wait.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Your very young...Think about the risks....Pregnancy, you could get a reputation, infection...<br>  Think of your whole life.  I mean all of it, the people you'll meet, places you'll go, then think of this boy..I know you don't want to hear it but its probably not very likely you'll be with him for the rest of your life...<br>  its just one boy, there are so many more, and theres so much you could do in your life...Anything! And at thriteen, you don't really need the stress of a having sex with your boyfriend...<br>  So seriously, don't do it. Wait another year, and ask this question again. <br>  Its really, really better to wait. Espeically if you wait till your actually legal :)|`|E6T9DPT9aa	No, wait till you have been together atleast a year, and you are both 14.<br>  <br>  If he leaves you because you don't want sex, then he only wants it for the attention.<br>  <br>  Ask him to wait a while, if he doesn't want to wait, then he's only with you for sex (i'm afraid.)<br>  <br>  Sex isn't about everthing.<br>  <br>  SEX = BABY.<br>  <br>  Get on  birth control and use condoms.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|rNvXWMOMaa	when you don't have to ask this question..<br>  at 13 you're still not too old for a spanking<br>  which you should get just for asking a squestion like this|`|sgMno1PRaa	You are young but if you feel comfortable with him and you both have respect for each other then I dont see why not, make sure your safe though!!!<br>  Its good that your in a relationship as well. Just make sure that its you that wants this and not just him and make sure that he doesnt take advantage! Be the one incontrol and if you do start having a sexual relationship then i would reccommend going on the pill or having the coil -   you can do either of them without your parents knowing.|`|5LzZYrQnaa	only you can make that choice if you want to have sex but you are a bit young. if you do make sure that hes not talking you in to having sex with him that its something you raelly want to do with him and always when ever you have sex please use protection to keep your self safe from becoming pregnant and getting any STD'S or STI'S|`|QwYxjjeraa	Hey i no u probly think i am patronising u and treating u like a child but is what u have with him true love???? maybe now it feels like it is we have all been there but u will look back in years to come and laugh that u ever thought u loved him as much as u did..<br>  <br>  I cant tell u what to do but sex is something special between too people it is more than a physical connection it is alao a very emotional one, it is not all glorified like it shows in the movies and ur first time especially at ur age can be sore...<br>  <br>  do u no everything about ur fella and i mean eveything? maybe get to no him a bit better 1st till u no his favorite food, shop, color,animal everything there is to no maybe by then u should start thinking about gettting physically closer.<br>  <br>  Dont feel pressured into it because of him or because "everybody" is doing it cause most people say they are when their not i think babe if u were truely ready u wouldnt have had to ask the question...<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever u decide and be safe and not sorry if u do it use a condom.<br>  <br>  there is no shame in waiting and if ur love is that strong i sure neither of u would have a problem waiting 4 the other.<br>  <br>  take care and best of luck..|`|YVasdve0aa	You are ready when you are ready to deal with any consequences that may happen as a result.  These include STD's and pregnancy.  You are still a little young for either of these.  Your hormones make you want sex at your age but be careful not to do anything that you will regret later in life.|`|BbdWpp1Caa	someone told me that if I could go to the shop and buy a pack of condoms in the open without any sense of embarrassment, then you are ready to be having sex (you not your partner)...that doesn't include children necessarily. If you decide to please, use protection.|`|ATxam2HPaa	if u want to have sex do it but don't ever let him pressure you into it. Its your choice. if u choose to do it use protection plz. We have enough teenagers getting pregnant these days.|`|HolJ834Haa	kid, get married first then only talk about sex..<br>  ugh, teenager nowadays love sex...<br>  like tomorrow is the end of the world...<br>  ish..|`|IbA3VEZqaa	Hi, I think you will know when you are ready for sex, since you are asking this really means that you are definetely not ready for sex now. You are 13 which is just the entrance to teenage. Grow yourself, enjoy life without sex now and you might want to give yourself atleast a couple of year to understand and tackle the change in your body.<br>  At the end of the day its your decision, the urge will definetely start, and sex is attractive and enjoyable, but its best when you think you can handle the situation and are prepared to face for all the worse. <br>  I would really suggest its too early... wait atleast till 16-17|`|YoLvCVMRaa	No, I would definitely not suggest it. I'm 13 and I can't even imagine having sex at my age. You need to think of not only the physical consequences of possible pregnancy and STDs but also the emotional consequences. Sex will change the way you see yourself, your boyfriend, and your relationship. Some relationships don't even survive sex. I really hope you are mature enough to wait until you are older.|`|U04sy4Qhaa	First of all:<br>  <br>  @Mommy to 9 month old Jacob:<br>  <br>  I think your answer is THE most primitive answer of all time.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The contents of the following quotes are shockingly dumb.<br>  <br>  "...and I don't think at 13 you can know what love really is...."<br>  I don't think you know anything.<br>  <br>  "This is my way of thinking...."<br>  You are mentally sick.<br>  <br>  Now, to the serious answer.<br>  <br>  Men generally fantasize about having sex at the age of 11-12 and start to actually get serious about his fantasies at around 15-18.....wait for 2 months. If he leaves you, then he's in it for the sex, and the sex alone. If he doesn't leave you, then now it's your choice if you want to go or not. If I were you, I'd get a condom first. I'd personally go without hesitation. Trust the condoms. Forget about virginity and those kinds of things......either way you're gonna lost it, unless you plan on becoming a self-hating masochist. You want to make the most out of your short life. It's your choice. Be conservative, and spend the first 1/5 of your life as a jerk, or live your life normally and have fun.|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	Here is the perfect answer....<br>  <br>  You'll know you're mature enough to handle sex when you're mature enough to sit down with your mom to discuss the ups and downs to sex.  That's how you'll know.  Then you and your mom can discuss birth conrol methods etc.  And even if she's not okay with it, you'll know you are mature enough for sex by the fact that you are able to confront her and follow through with what you want by giving her the respect not to do it behind her back.|`|FDX4MrL9aa	If you were my daughter I would be very afraid to know you are thinking of sex. I would worry about pregnancy, STD's, and the possibility of someone hurting you. You can ask for advice, but ultimately the decision is yours. If you do decide to have sex, please be very careful and use protection.|`|IqcQ7pnfaa	Put these questions in mind: After having sex, will he still love me? Will I really like what I'm going to get? What will be my situation after that? Is he the right man to have sex with?<br>  Remember that there will be a lot of guys that you'll have a relationship with and it's not only him. <br>  Ask this to yourself: "Is he more important then my purity?"<br>  <br>  I hope you know where I'm getting to.|`|5tWNTeNZaa	i lost my virginity when i was 14. i regret that guy more than anything else in the world. i wish i waited for my current boyfriend.<br>  he's smart, funny, looks hot even when he's sweaty, athletic, has the best smile ever and is simply amazing.<br>  <3<br>  anyways, make sure ur not doing something you'll ever regret.<br>  i hate telling the "how i lost my virginity" story.|`|nHokdvx7aa	Wait a year, then decide how you feel. Don't rush into it. It will take its toll on you no matter when you first do it.

Why not get on Netmums and see if there is a coffee morning or group meeting near you. Or join some mother and baby classes. Sam will love interacting with other children now he's 6 months, take someone with you to look after him if you need to dash off to the loos. Check the facilities out before signing up.<br>  Where abouts do you live maybe someone on here could offer advice on good groups in your area.<br>  Good luck, it can't be easy, but it sounds like your on the mend!|`|wNtW1hXLaa	Hello. I am feeling content. Thanks so much for asking. I have a 3 month old daughter. The whole experience has enriched my life. It is what was missing. She is an absolute delight and I have enjoyed every moment of it so far. When I go in to check on her and see her in her bassinet I just get this overwhelming feeling of love, amazement, pride, joy, delight, warmth.....I can't believe we created her. She is feeding and sleeping like a machine at the moment! She loves to play on her play mat with the jungle animals which she smiles and giggles at, has started rolling over, can shuffle from A to B on her tummy. My favourite part of the day is reading to her and seeing her smile up at me. I hope you continue to heal and enjoy every moment with your baby boy. xx.
pl7lWGZDaa	I like all of your first names, but not the middle names really. Nelle Harper is my favorite. As for boys, I love them all! Patrick Logan and Easton Tyler are my favorites. For Mitchell, you should try Flynn instead of Finn, I think it sounds much nicer..|`|61NKzPzMaa	Julianne Tova - I love Julianne but I don't like Tova.<br>  Mia Blaire - Mia is really pretty but Blaire is a masculine BOYS name.<br>  Nelle Harper - Don't like Nelle.

I love both Patrick and Logan.<br>  Brody Chase - Don't like it. I don't like Brody and I hate the name Chase.<br>  Easton Tyler - Easton sounds like a surname to me.

Put down your copy of To Kill a Mockingbird and back away very slowly.<br>  <br>  Addison Winter is terrible. I would deeply pity any child I saw with this name. I agree that Addison isn't useable on a boy, but that doesn't make it all right to use it for a girl. If a bunch of parents starting naming their sons Laura, would that suddenly make Laura a masculine name? I don't think so. You can't change the origin of a name just by using it on the wrong sex.<br>  <br>  Julianne Tova and Patrick Logan stand out as the best of your combos.|`|m0eVDBXAaa	I really like all of them :)<br>  But my favourites would be:<br>  Mia Blaire - Mia is a beautiful name, it isnt a harsh name - very pretty.<br>  Addison Winter is also really nice.<br>  For a boy:<br>  Patrick Logan - it flows really well.<br>  Brody Chase - i really like Brody as a name. It is a strong name. <br>  <br>  hope that is a bit of a help :)|`|cf87d1de83ee3dadaa4bb72472ee8d00aa	They sound good! personally I like Brody and Addison.

YuVSDBkzaa	If she wasn't positive, I would wait until the next scan before buying pink and purple girlie clothes. But I don't see why you can't announce it to your friends as a girl. Just let them know that it's still possible it could be a boy and you're waiting until the next scan to be sure. With my daughter, the doctor never confirmed 100% that it was a girl, but their were pretty sure, so I just went with it.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	u couldnt miss my sons balls and winky woo at 18 wks so if ur little girl was not showing them id be happy its a girl x x x x|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, if they were doing the ultrasound for finding out the sex and she thinks it's a girl.  I'd say yes.  =)  The tech got my ultrasound right.  I was having a boy.  =)  Then again it's kinda obvious. . .  HAHA!<br>  <br>  MY ob doctor knew I was having a boy at my 13 week ultrasound.  He said, I think it's a boy and he was right.  So, I'd say since you are 19 weeks then it's a definite.  =)|`|uuHPneEcaa	i found out the sex of my baby at 19 weeks i know for a fact because I saw his balls and all.. the ultra sound tech said "WOW LOOK AT THOSE BALLS!!"  and his lil thingy thing was shown.. u cant miss it on the pics either.<br>  <br>  my mom was told i was going to be a boy and come to find out I was a girl =D|`|C4ibOR7Laa	if they say its a girl, there still a chance its a boy, a baby gender can be determined from 15-16 weeks by ultrasound|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Very accurate!|`|WNsjy5oFaa	i have a relative who was told she was having a boy - so she went out and bought everything with having a boy in mind - she then had a girl and had to start shopping all over again.<br>  the scans usually are accurate but sometimes can be mistaken, if your having another scan ask again then<br>  <br>  good luck|`|eJB3gVYMaa	i honestly think you sholud wait for another us they should have you go in for another one later on in your pregnancy..  because she said she thinks just dosen't make it certainly  i wouldn't start buying girly things just yet.. i know it's very exciting but you should be FOR SURE!  with my last baby they told me i was having a girl and when i had him it was a boy!|`|N0KRZ9sXaa	i have heard very few people who have been told the sex and its been wrong! they are usually pretty good, and if they are uncertain they wouldnt say! i have had 4 and they have all been right, but my only son was well proud showing himself off so it was well obvious! if you are having doubts stick to buying unisex clothes and do the same with the room..  Good Luck and Congrats! X|`|AA10458750	The thing with being told it is a girl is....it could have been layed a certain way so the tech didn't see boy parts. At this point, you woudl think it would be accurate but....I was told a girl & 4 weeks later when I switched Drs., I was told a definite boy. I'd say your best bet is to get one of those 3-D ultrasounds done, esp if you are on a budget and want to start shopping early.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	if they say its a girl they cant be more than 86% sure cuz they base it on them not having balls but some boys balls dont form or become visible until later on in pregnancy, if they had said it was a boy then they are upto 97% sure.|`|lqLzULXEaa	Dont strees it if the tech didnt know for sure she wouldnt of told you <br>  <br>  <br>  congrats on the princess|`|wkd5CMNaaa	The techs know what they are doing, they wouldn't tell you the sex if they weren't sure.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	yeah if they told you a girl then its 99% a girl. its not too early to tell.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I had mine at 18weeks and was told the same thing....a girl.  My doc said its not always 100%, but if they actually see the genitalia, it is usually as close to 100% as you can get. Its when they can't quite be certain but think its a boy or a girl that I would be a little hesitant.  I found out, and have since bought little girl clothes and accessories for the nursery and all of that.  Congrats!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I would be pretty confident with their decision because usually at a 20 week scan the use a better machine so that they can look at the babies organs and such. If they weren't able to tell or wasn't sure then they wouldn't of told you yet. :)
OI3bf4yjaa	I agree with you 100%. You'd think, out of all people, her church would be the ones to SUPPORT her through this. I find it ridiculous how they excommunicated her and her family.. especially when she is only 9 years old. Like you said, she's not that old enough to understand what she did... and I'm also sure that her parents were the ones to make her have one. The whole situation is actually quite sickening. The poor girl is already going through a lot. She's probably going to end up with psychological issues because of what happened, and people are choosing to go AGAINST her and her family. <br>  <br>  Labor would be dangerous for a 9 year old, and how the church suggested a c-section is also outrageous. A FREAKIN' 9 YEAR OLD! This story gets my blood boiling. I'm sure every single member of that church would have felt differently and would have reacted differently if this happened to THEIR 9 year old daughter.|`|bWu4p5OBaa	WOW! Ok now.<br>  <br>  That church is very wrong for excommunicating them. They all need help terribly especially the poor girl.<br>  <br>  I didn't even know it was possible for a 9 yr old to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  I'm VERY pro-life, but in this case I don't know what to say. I think this falls under the medical necessity part of abortion. This poor girl probably would not even have been able to carry this pregnancy without seriously injuring herself or dying.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I have a 9 year old myself, and although she is not menstruating, if she was ever raped and became pregnant I would understand she is not ready (physically nor mentally) to carry a child and abortion would be in her best options.  It's sad and silly but that is how they conduct themselves in Brazil I suppose.  This is why I practice my religion in my own home, under my own rules.  Not to offend anyone but these stories make me doubt churches.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I am very VERY pro life except in the case of incest rape and tube pregnancy. I dont think its wrong that she got an abortion. Im sad that the babies have died but honestly the chance of them surviving were slim as was this CHILD caring them to term. In this i think the abortion was what was needed, as sad as it is. I wish this little girl never had to be in that kind of situation.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	first off, she didn't kill a child or children. she aborted a twin pregnancy, and did so to save her own life. second, i agree with you. the church shouldn't shun this child, but embrace her and help her heal....but then again you're talking about a religion that would rather protect pedophiles than the victims of these said pedophiles.|`|3HR1SfGMaa	Wow more hypocrisy from the Catholic church surprise surprise.  That poor child shouldn't be forced to go through a pregnancy.  And I don't know at what stage of the pregnancy she had the abortion, but I would be surprised if her little body could even carry twins to full term.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Abortion for sure...would you want to hear that your mom had you when you were 9 cause she was raped?  Shes going to be put in an oprhanage anyway and growing up in foster homes i know that was no life.  Thats messed up that the church turned away...makes me glad i live here in the U.S.|`|iT5vnplHaa	the catholic church is wrong i think. im christian and i think that the abortion is the best choice. she isnt even a teen. she prolly doesnt even know what shees doing|`|txv7TIgiaa	i am against abortion but in her case i think that was one case were it was basically dangerous to her life to carry the baby...|`|hPm6WjaGaa	I absolutly abhor abortion, but in a nine year old's case, there is nothing right in that either.|`|BRT2teSqaa	What a poor child.  This is a terrible story.  The correct decision was made for her case, indeed.  That's a sick church.|`|AA12145826	I thought the Holy Mother Church made slight exceptions when the mother's life is at stake? Was this act (the excommunication) sanctioned by the Vatican? I can't imagine the pope looking favorably on the actions of this particular church. Like the poster said above me, this is when she needs the support of her faith more than ever.<br>  <br>  On a personal note: This situation is why I am pro-choice. I believe that abortions need to be legal because of reasons like this. No one with any sliver of compassion could look that poor girl in the eye and reasonably request that she give birth. Its just not fathomable.|`|CFFuFof1aa	In this situation, I would say that this is not her fault and there is no way that she should be blamed. It would have done a great deal of damage to her body to carry the babies. I am pro-life, but I do agree incertain situations like this that it is acceptable. I think that the US should have the same laws, such as abortion being illegal unless of medical necessity or rape in a child. If I was raped, I wouldn't get an abortion but for a child that is different.|`|dgRTkccBaa	No way a 9 yr old can carry twins, it would kill her.  I carried twins to term and it was extremely difficult for me and I was 30 yrs old and had no complications.  I think her parents made the right decision.  I wonder if the church excommunicated the dirtbag who raped the little girl.  My guess is, probably not.  I bet he confessed and was given absolution when the whole thing was his fault in the first place.<br>  ETA: After reading the article and seeing that she was raped by her stepfather I guess he was excommunicated after all, but for allowing the abortion... not for the rape.<br>  *To Fr. Joseph* Of course people care about the two lives that were lost, but the church should not be turning its back on the girl.  At only 9 years old was she not also innocent?  She was raped and had her childhood taken from her.  Had she been forced to continue the pregnancy she could have died, or ended up needing a hysterectomy.  Fine, excommunicate the family, but the girl should not be treated that way.|`|rBq189W1aa	To Hell with the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  And I mean that in the most literal way possible.<br>  <br>  Edit: And Christo, you can join them.<br>  <br>  “Human life must be respected and protected..." Yeah, right. Unless it's young kids being molested by Catholic priests, in which case cover it up, threaten the victims and their families with excommunication if they tell anyone, and move the priests on to a fresh batch of victims so they can do it all again. <br>  <br>  To Hell with the Catholic Church.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I normally don't support abortion (and really I don't support an abortion here, but I can understand why), but I cannot and will not judge a 9 year old girl, her family or the doctor who performed the abortion.<br>  <br>  I am willing to accept an abortion for that case for this reason:<br>  <br>  *The health/life of the girl is at stake.  A 9 year old has a great chance for complications, miscarriage, and life staking risks.*<br>  <br>  I still don't believe that if I was raped that an abortion would be acceptable.  I believe that obtaining Plan B and taking it within 72 hours of the rape would be what I would do and what I believe any girl/woman should do, but in these exceptionally extreme circumstances I can't pass judgment on this girl.<br>  <br>  My stipulation is that the LIFE of the mother would have to be in jeopardy in order for an abortion to be anywhere near acceptable.  A 9 year old carrying a pregnancy threatens the life of the girl.  Her body is physically and mentally unprepared for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It's such a hard case though.<br>  <br>  * I completely agree with Chickenfarmer.  Jesus didn't excommunicate the prostitutes and other sinners.  He welcomed them with open arms and shared God's love for them.  The Catholic church is way off base.|`|TQW5E6olaa	How could anyone not support this child's decision?! Could you imagine the emotional trauma a 9 year old would go through carrying and giving birth to, possibly giving away a baby? <br>  <br>  Add to the fact that her health was at risk, no I see no problem with it. I see a problem with any religion that would rather see her life at risk than protect her.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'm pro-choice, but would like to point out to pro-lifers that this sort of thing is the reason abortion should not be banned *across the board.* If you want to ban it, that's fine. I have no beef with you. But realize that banning abortion completely would mean that little girls like this wouldn't be allowed to get an abortion either.<br>  <br>  That's all.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	I agree with you. Horrific story, the girl had no choice - well her family as she was so young. See how mean religion can be.....|`|AkFag8tNaa	For starters I have huge issues w/any church that would excommunicate based on "sin". We all do it (whether you include abortion as sin or not is up to you) and church, well religion mainly, is supposed to show us the light, not bury us in darkness. Secondly, it would be a huge medical threat for a 9 year old to go through w/labor and delivery and even if that came out all right, her body would undergo major stress due to being underdeveloped.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	They also said HER life was in jeopardy if she tried to carry the babies to term.  The girl only weighed like 80lbs.  So sad.  My daughters life at 9 would just be beginning.  I couldn't begin to think about sacrificing her life for grandchildren.<br>  <br>  edit - to the "enlightened one" below - the girls very LIFE was in danger.  She herself would have DIED had she carried those twins. as a PARENT you can say that you would choose to END YOUR childs LIFE over a rape??  wow.  thats all i have to say.  i'm glad my God doesn't think that way.  wow.  God help your children.  God help your children.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	I'm pro life.<br>  I teach CCD (Catholic religion to children)<br>  But I agree with the abortions in this case.<br>  Because the 9 year olds life was in jeopardy if she was forced to carry.   Anyone who would force her to carry can not honestly claim to be pro life!<br>  <br>  Poor girl. <br>  God is watching over her and loving her, regardless of the unfair judgement of that church!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Wow, this is a crazy article.....I can't believe the church would be mad about it. She's not even old enough to make her own medical decisions, they shouldn't take it out on her...<br>  <br>  That's what i don't get about religion.....Everyone sins and that's why we pray for forgiveness....god is supposed to forgive you of your sins as long as you ask for it. Isn't that why Jesus was put on the cross?  I don't get it. I don't really partake in a religion.|`|8RfmosODaa	Wow thats crazy!  I don't believe in abortions but this case is different. Your right, she is a child and its not like she was just having sex with a boy, her stepfather was doing it to her. It's ashame!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I think it is stupid, but thats how it is over there I guess, its good she got an abortion rather then put a 9 year old through child birth that would probably kill her.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	that is why i am pro-choice. for people like that. that get rapped or young kids that get pregnant?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Wow, this is so sad that this child has to go through this period.<br>  <br>  I think that it is bullshit that people are fussing over this.Why should this CHILD have to give birth to kids she cannot take care of? why should she have to give these children up for adoption when all this wasn't her choice? it's not fair.<br>  <br>  All those saying that this was murder and all the other BS DON'T have the child's best interest at heart.They care more about the  EMBRYOS (not even fetuses)  than the poor kid.I find that very sad and I KNOW that God is frowning upon all of those ignorant beings.<br>  <br>  <br>  "They took the life of an innocent" The step father took the innocence of that child when he raped her.What about her? She has to live with that pain for the rest of her life while the soul of those embryos get to live it up in Heaven.<br>  <br>  "Abortion is much more serious than killing an adult" Only someone ignorant can spew that garbage out of their mouth.<br>  <br>  "The girl's immature hips would have made labor dangerous; the Catholic opinion was that she could have had a cesarean section"<br>  Once again...another example of how these "Catholics" care more about a ball of cells that a LIVING, INNOCENT being.So, she should carry the burden of having children out there in the world and not being able to know them...having a scar for the rest of her life because of it...risking her life and the health of the babies carrying the pregnancy to term (which would NOT have happened) and the emotions of being raped.<br>  <br>  They are nothing but a pile of ignorant **** in my opinion.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Most people who disagree with abortion object to abortion being used as birth control.  It is the exceptions to that, the cases of rape/incest, the cases of severe birth defects, the cases of health endangerment for the mother, that draw a lot of scrutiny.<br>  <br>  Even if the Catholic Church doesn't support abortion in a rape/incest situation, the Church's stance is that abortion is allowable if the pregnancy is life endangering for the mother.<br>  <br>  Is there any question about whether carrying twins to term would be a life endangering pregnancy for a 9 year old?!<br>  <br>  I'm appalled that the church in Brazil excommunicated the girl and her family.  I am not a Catholic, but I am a Christian.  And I understand that excommunication is a big deal for Catholics.  I hope an appeal is made to the Vatican immediately.  That girl and her family need the support and love of the church, not condemnation.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I am pro life, but i can under stand that in cases of rape, incest and medical necessity that an abortion should be done.. This sounds like a couple of those things. I don't agree with ending a life, but in this case the little girl could have died, and she was raped on top of that, add in there her age and the fact that she wouldn't know how to take care of a child anyways... I'm okay with it honestly. I just feel really bad for this little girl.<br>  <br>  Edit" Let me just state here that i could never have an abortion, unless It was a true medical emergency, like the baby was going to die anywase, and having it could kill me. I have 3 other kids to think of. I agree that other women who are raped can take plan b, but sometimes that doesn't work.. I would not judge others if they chose to go through with an abortion...but I myself could not have one in a case like this.
H74F8jxuaa	If you are wanting to lose weight, it will be a lot easier to lose it before you get pregnant.  I know it would be hard to wait that long, especially if you are wanting one right now, but I say that you should try to lose the weight before trying.|`|oiJITSNZaa	For the best of not only your body but also of that little one that you want to bring in to this world, I would reccommend waiting till you are at the proper weight.|`|fMhXju8baa	i say lose the wieght first. It would be better and healthier for  you and your baby if you did. I am wanting to lose the wieght from my bc also. And just think it will be easier on you once u lose the 21ibs now then have a baby and then it want be as hard to lose the baby weight bc u wont have the extra 21ibs to worry about just the baby wieght itself! You might even beable to lose the 21ibs in less than 2mo who knws everybdy is different.

For months, all he would eat would be meat meat and more meat.  Now, a month later, he barely picks at it.<br>  <br>  As long as he's getting a balanced meal from the food groups.  He doesn't need to eat fruit if he's eating vegetables and he really shouldn't be having sweets at this age.<br>  <br>  I always make my kids finish their health balanced meal before they are allowed to have sweets.  I don't force feed them.  If they are not hungry, then they do not have to finish, but they are also not getting any sweets or treats of any sort.|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	parents make me laugh - when you say "he only eats chicken nuggets" that's because you give them to him - unless he's cooking them!  stop pandering to his fussy eating - put a sensible meal in front of him - if he's hungry he'll eat it - don't make him a "faddy fussy eater"|`|sAbah6dTaa	my daughter is extremely picky. and eventually they will grow out of it. they say you have to serve something at least 20 times before they'll try it/like it. also make sure it's on your plate and he sees you eating it and enjoying it. try giving him an apple with peanut butter or fruit dip. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Maybe we could trade for a little while?

b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	i took alot of baths when it happened to me. I had to stop work at 28 weeks because of it. It is really painful but you soon will experiance much worse during labor. I know that right now that it is the most pain you've ever had. I also took tylenol faithfully (make sure its tylenol not motrin or asprin or anything like that) 1000 mgs every 6 hours. my midwife said that was absolutely fine. until that point in my pregnancy i was staying true to taking no medications. when it got to the point i couldn't handle it, i broke down and took it. let me tell you what i'm glad I did. and the farther along you get the worse pains and discomforts you get for various reasons. pregnancy is so hard on your body. but hang in there. it doesn't last forever though it may feel like it =] its all worth it after you see your baby. just hang in there =D I also went to motherhood and got a pregnancy support belt that goes just under the belly and though it seems dumb it actually does help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. hope you feel better soon!|`|AA10458750	This is already happening to me...it feels like someone punched me hard.....Yoga has helped me. I only have time to do it 2x a week, but it has made a difference. Also, drink room tempature water, I don't knwo why but it seems to help. And when the pain comes on all you can do is lay down. Good Luck =)|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You can use a heating pad, just don't apply it to your stomach. Also take tylenol to help with the pain, epsom salt baths, try to wear a pregnancy support belt.|`|zBz10IiOaa	warm bath and tylonal usualy help me and a water bottle as well hun|`|AA11208683	i don't think it should be that painful but i agree it is bad i went to the doctors because i thought there was something wrong. i would try taking a warm bath or shower, and make sure you are drinking a lot of water. if it gets back just lay down on your side and take some deep breaths. you could even try taking some tylenol. other wise when you see the doctor next ask them what you can do they might have some more advice. i hope it gets better for you, mine did.. good luck!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	Lay on your left side and drink LOTS of water. A pregnancy support belt can help prevent these pains too.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	Sorry to hear your suffering like that, I get it when I cough or sneeze and I don't tense up before and I know it really really hurts but then it goes away for me.<br>  If that was happening to me I probably would have a warm bath, I find that water eases any backache I get. I know it's not practical all the time so maybe you could take a heat pack for it when you are out and about.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Oh do I know how you feel. I'm 31w 4d and get that horrible pain at least a few times a week. Once it actually sent me to the hospital because I thought I was in labor! When I get it, I can't even walk, or roll over or move, it's that excruciating! The best thing I can say is to rest, stay off your feet and put them up when you're on the couch or something. And drink plenty of water. Luckily, the past few days it hasn't been that bad for me. Good luck. Oh, and if it's really bad, try some Tylenol. Not sure if it'll help, but it's worth a try =] I hope you feel better.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Pregnancy support belts can really help with that.  Also you can try soaking in a warm bath to help ease some of the discomfort.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	My OB suggested a heating pad. I'd ask yours about that as well.
DE3Scu5Jaa	Well it looks like noone is reading your question right (shes asking what her chances of conception are with the times she has had sex not if she's pregnant) It all sounds like ovulation to me, I get all the symptoms of getting my period when i ovulate which always includes being bloated. Hate the feeling. Well your chances of pregnancy depend on the time you have had sex. You have said you had sex when your test had a positive to ovulating so hopefully you have a high chance. Good luck and lots of baby dust. Hopefully your hubby feels better tomorrow so you can try another time and hopefully have more percent of a chance.<br>  :-)|`|WZQKevt8aa	It sounds like ovulation. Wait until your period is due and take a test. You're probably feeling gassy and bloated because of what you ate for tea, if it made your husband sick it might make you feel unwell as well. Every month there is a 20%-25% chance of falling pregnant, I hope it is your month. Good luck!|`|tmBBywZsaa	definatly ovulation pain hun wait till your period is due then test !! i get bloated and have period like pains when i ovulate !!!
FkGh0LuWaa	My boys have the toy and my niece loves it and she is also two.  Their is nothing wrong with it at all.  I am sure she is going to love it just like my niece.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's just Little Einsteins - both girls and boys like that show. I don't see anything wrong with it. Besides, my daughter plays with Matchbox cars and dinosaurs in the tub; as long as there's something to play with, I doubt they really care, or even notice, until we parents make an 'issue' out of it and call it to their attention.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	what's so boyish about it?!? it's a toy boat for crying out loud! <br>  <br>  dont' limit your child because of her gender... of course SHE won't mind, she'll probably LOVE it.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I think that's a great gift for any little kid. If she watches Little Einsteins she'll love it and she will probably really enjoy the submarine and turtle as well. <br>  <br>  I don't think the little girl will think it's a "boy's toy", especially since she's only two.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	i doubt she'll care, i mean it is a bath toy.  get her a mermaid bath toy as well if you feel its too boyish.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	My girls LOVE boats and turtles and things for the bath.... At 2 they don't know about gender division, I'm sure she'll love it.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves ANY toy that can go in the bath tub/water.  But she loves Little Einsteins too so she'd probably like this particular item.  I can see how you'd think it's too boyish but Little Einsteins is co-ed.  Maybe try to find one of the girls to go along with it (that you deem tub-worthy of course).|`|3K7ffKn2aa	no i would get it for my girl. its like a bath toy rite? i had one that looked like a scuba diver i loved watching him swim in tub. she probably won't care.|`|TVqXrOq2aa	My 2 year old plays with little einstein toys. A 2 year old girl doesn't have to have princesses and ponies, she can play with anything a boy would like.|`|A4S9jAuVaa	At two she doesn't know what being a girl means. Put it in the tub if she plays with it she doesn't mind. My four year old daughter would play with it.|`|Psnvh0aTaa	i dont think she will mind at all. she probably wont even notice, and there are girls on that tv show too.|`|xZPHZBQgaa	alot of kids like the little einsteins show i think it will be just fine for a little girl.|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	No way! It's awesome and totally gender neutral!! All this lil girl is gonna notice is a fun new bath toy.|`|AA10747002	She prolly won't care either way. Its just a boat and driver after all.|`|RLSMl2Fqaa	No way.  It is a toy.  My son is 3 and he loves Dora the Explorer.  I don't buy him the Dora princess set or a Dora backpack, but he does have some of the toys and videos.  I wouldn't think a little girl would be interested in a "Hulk" toy, but keep in mind she is two and has no concept of gender typing.  I think it is a cute set and I wouldn't hesitate to give it to her.  She will probably like it even though it isn't covered in pink and purple!|`|kt89NRWvaa	It's a toy. All children play with the toys they like. That toy specifically is from a show for younger children of both sexes, so it should be fine. My nephew has several baby dolls and I have seen many little girls playing with cars, trucks, and even GI Joes/Army men. They will play with whatever toys they feel like it at the moment.|`|8AmMlAZYaa	Just remember children don't think like adults do they just see a cool toy. Not is it for a girl or boy. Children are taught those behaviors.
Fh4B88ZGaa	No more than if one woman and one man have more than one child. Siblings don't look exactly the same as one another, even though the come from the same two sets of DNA. It's the same thing. They will look related, but won't look exactly the same.|`|sAbah6dTaa	that would be gross... but maybe, not all twins look just alike though.|`|avkZGv1taa	If identical twins each had a baby by the same man (or by two identical twin men), their babies would be the genetic equivalent of siblings--they would look just as alike as any two siblings.  As we all know, that could be fairly alike, or quite different.  <br>  BTW, If you are a twin, I would encourage you not to sleep with the same guy as your sister :P  It might cause bigger problems for the two of you than whether or not your kids look alike! :)|`|kmV5MnvPaa	no, these children would still look different, especially if their mothers are not identical twins|`|I2UeqxKxaa	savanagh for a girl and cayleb for a boy|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Not sure but I like your way of thinkin'.....
ioZeveazaa	Unfortunately no there aren't. I would love it also if there was. However you aren't suppose to sleep on your belly while pregnant which is probably why they haven't attempted it because there could be serious lawsuits against whoever made one and a lady harmed her baby with the pillow. You are almost done and need to sleep on your sides. DO NOT sleep on your back because that can hurt your spine/muscles in your back. It can also cause the baby to lay against his placenta if the placenta is on the posterior side. It takes time but you will get use to sleeping on your sides. Sleeping in a recliner is also helpful. I am a huge tummy sleeper and find that a recliner is very relaxing. Good luck!!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	No because you're not supposed to sleep on your stomach anyways.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I would really like to know this too!!!  I'm in the same situation and can't find anything like that!  I am also surrounded in pillows.  I don't think there is any room for my husband either, the poor guy.  Good luck on your search!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Try sleeping in a recliner.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Nope, trust me I looked lol.
ybexjS2Paa	Is he miserable? Is he crying a lot? Has he got a fever? If yes it might be his ear I'd go and check with the doctor. Ear infections can be very painful for babies I know my son went through about 7 ear infections and it wasn't fun whatsoever.|`|CY8jAXPDaa	My son also does this. <br>  He does it when he has a cold so i would think it might be because of his cold. <br>  <br>  My son also does it, when he starts to get tired. He grabs his ear and pulls, and ive noticed he gets a little bit of pain in his ears when hes cutting another tooth, because he really tugs the ear and his hair, that is on the side of the tooth cutting.<br>  <br>  Just a few different suggestions you could maybe look at?|`|Ob0d7g7Raa	i have a 6mth old as well and she is doing the same thing. it can be a sign of teething or ear infections, but if he isn't screaming in pain and if he is still himself  i wouldn't worry to much they are trying new things everyday and this is just one of them..

I was just a few steps away when I turned around to see my daughter looking over the goodies.  She put her little hands on her hips and said "Damnit....not on sale"  I was cracking up - and the little old lady that was standing between us almost chocked.  She turned to me and told me that now she was going to get the best story of the week prize at her weekly bridge game.|`|zBz10IiOaa	well it is not funny but my niece was at school kindergarten none the less and she colored a picture at school and come home and showed it to me and i asked her what it was and she said it was a kid at school who was very dirty(mind you she is 5) and her teacher called me and said she was talking about an african american little girl! i had to teach her the colors of people and she went to school the next day and apologized|`|Y1LTzXataa	I don't have kids yet but when my brother and I were little, my parents were constantly being embarrassed by us.<br>  <br>  Two of my worst were:<br>  "Look at that lady's hair. She looks just like a witch" and<br>  "Wow, look how black that lady is"<br>  <br>  and my brother's were:<br>  "That woman has bouncy boobies" and<br>  (to a man with tattoos) "You'd better wash those drawings off your arms or your mummy will smack you"|`|TJezsCkHaa	ok.im potty training my 2 1/2 year old son.so we were at the store and i totally forgot to put his pull-ups on when we left the house.He was fine until we got to the checkout lane and he did number 1.my older daughter,which is 4 now,yelled mommy he peed all over the place.Imagine that while you are checking out,people are on your left,right and behind you waiting in line.That was the worst that a mother can get infront of people.|`|oiJITSNZaa	my friend's child was in the process of being potty trained. One day he was with his mom at the local upscale greenhouse. She turned around to mortifyingly see his pants at his ankles and responding to nature's call right there! Nothing like obeying to the letter to keep your pants dry!!<br>  <br>  My son in the midst of potty training....one day waiting in line at the checkout he loudly announces, "Mommy goes the potty!" Everyone was amused....I'm like well, what's new?!|`|pNKBszseaa	we were in the $.99 cent store. my daughter was then 5 and my youngest was 3. the oldest was being very bad so i grabbed her hand and was making her walk out of the store..when my youngest tells her ooh mommy's mad. Then the oldest one started yelling Don't break my arm in front of all these people.   I NEVER EVER EVER TOUCHED HER! SHE HAD NEVER HAD A SPANKING! the worst thing she had was a 10 minute time out. (which i know is too long but she was in alot of trouble) I was so devastated i came home and cried for hours. and was so paranoid that someone heard her~|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well ive mentioned this story on yahoo before but i was mortified...my 15 month old daughter has a fascination with stripping...trousers socks nappies all of it off......soooooo we were in the store and she was holding the trolley and my hand i went to get some juice and i felt her hand slip from mine......there she was trousers and nappy round her ankles doing a penguin style walk up the aisle.....<<mortified. lol shes growing out of it!|`|JivuAmfiaa	My seven year old once stood on top of a shelf in the middle of the supermarket and yelled, "Hear ye, hear ye, my mum was making babies with my dad last night!" Needless to say everyone was staring at us and I felt like dying! We paid for our shopping and got out of there sharpish. Lol.|`|ijDfRIyoaa	Lol.<br>  <br>  Well there are two embarassing things (that I can remember clearly)<br>  <br>  The first one was when we were waiting in the line at Myer (big store in Australia) and we were in the DVD section, anyway Shi was being an absolute terror that day and wouldnt let me hold her so I let her down and she sat on the floor for a second, then she got up and pulled this table cloth which had probably 40+ DVD's on it and they all came tumbling off onto the ground, I was soooo embarassed, but the store ladies were great haha (she was 18 months)<br>  <br>  And the second time was also when she was 23 months (just last christmas), her dad took her to David Jones (another big store). And he told me she ran off and took her nappy off and peed behind one of the display christmas trees, I was so shocked. But he said that the store manager said that she had seen it before and got ti cleaned up. How embarassing.|`|qayCggxMaa	I frequently take my kids to church with me - my daughter would get bored and realized I had to take her out of church if she needed a diaper change.  So once when she was 2, we were in church and she told me she needed a diaper change.  I knew she didn't so I told her she'd have to wait.  She then wailed loud enough for the whole room to hear "But I'm Poopy Mommy! Poooopppyy!"<br>  <br>  Another time, when we were potty training my daughter, we had a bunch of guests over.  My daughter mentioned she had to go potty and we put her off for a minute because we were in the middle of something.  I then turned back to her and asked if she wanted to use the potty now.  She casually said "No. It's too late."  Sure enough, she was soaked.|`|QveBSjFSaa	We went to the wedding of one of my husband's childhood friends, whom I had never met. My oldest daughter was in the reception line with me, and when I met the bride and groom, I shook hands with them, and they commented on the tattoo on my wrist.<br>  "You ought to see the ones on her BOOBIES!", chimed my daughter.

MXMMlSJPaa	Age does'nt matter as long as you love, understand each other, that is the most important thing|`|SYaSbJb5aa	For what, a relationship?  Depends on the age.  I think the general rule is half the age plus 7.|`|9DQjfmFvaa	If the girl is over 18 teen, your all good.  It don't matter after the age of 18.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	If your teen's then yeah,if not then i think its okay|`|RLSMl2Fqaa	It depends on the age of the people involved.  In some states it is against the law to be with someone (sexually)  in a younger age group defined by the gap.  If you are both older ie: over 18 The gap shouldn't matter.  What is legal should matter and maturity levels.  Check your state's guidelines on statutory rape to make sure you are not a "molester"  But if you are concerned, maybe there is a problem!!  When in doubt- back out!|`|HwIi9Tkwaa	I'm 29 he is 45 and we work very well both my parents have always been ok with it all.|`|0rBEqVtHaa	if you're 18 and she's 12, helz yea that's a big gap<br>  if you're 30 and she's 24, perfectly fine|`|pdNRDN2kaa	"oh no, she's 11, im 17! hahah!!!"|`|rdqsYfh3aa	no iam 27 and my boyfriend is 23 iam 14wks pregnant but if u are teens then yes|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	depends on the ages - but I wouldn't like my 19 year old son dating a 26 year old woman - I'd probably think there was something wrong with her.
45xNJ7Ncaa	It's just from going off the pill.  It's take the body sometimes over a year to figure out it's hormone system and get things in sync again.  There's a lot of hormones involved and each one needs to be balanced to make things work.  But I wouldn't put too much worry in your total cycle number.  Most women don't have the same number of cycles days month after month especially as we get older.<br>  The important thing is that you are ovulating and having at least 10 days between ovulation and a period.  You can determine this by taking your temp first thing in the morning using a basal thermometer.  A few days after you ovulate, your temp will elevate and stay elevated until your next period or you deliver a baby.  You want to count the number of days that you have elevated temps in a row after ovulation.  If you have 10 or more, you have healthy hormone levels to support a pregnancy.<br>  Using an OPK is a great way to determine your fertile days.  OPK detect the lh surge which occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation.  The day of a positive OPK is the time when you have the greatest chance to conceive.  You should notice chances in your cm around the positive as well.|`|GzOdn8tqaa	you will be fine
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I don't know any specific places; try talking to other parents, have your kids ask their friends what sort of extracurriculars they enjoy, check out bullentin boards at your local library and fliers around the office area of the kids' school. Community centers or parks and rec centers also provide lots of activities. Look in the yellow pages under martial arts, dance, etc for local businesses and make some calls to ask about ages, prices, times, etc. Visit a couple places with your kids and see what they get excited about.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Our local newspaper has a weekly section that lists things like this (in the family life section).  Our town also has a magazine called Lowcountry Parent, that has ads for places that offer children's activities as well as a monthly calendar.<br>  <br>  Most local churches will have activities for children, ranging from Sunday School to Wednesday Night Kids and Vacation Bible School.  These activities are free.<br>  <br>  Your phone book will have listings for local karate institutes, dance studios and the like.  As you drive around, look for ones that are convenient for you and note the name and give them a call later-or, better yet, drop in for information.  Many will offer the first lesson for free.<br>  <br>  Ask the librarian, other mothers, etc.  They will be glad to help you!<br>  <br>  Check Yahoo! Groups at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com">http://groups.yahoo.com</a> and search for "MyCity playgroup" or "MyCity moms", etc.  I am sure you will find one, and not only can you get together with playdates with the, but they can tell you what activities they have enjoyed.<br>  <br>  Local bookstores and libraries probably have reading clubs for children, and story hour for little ones.  <br>  <br>  YMCA has sports and activities for children.<br>  <br>  Contact your town or county Department of Recreation-they probably have a website.|`|LsAArkUyaa	I am not familiar with what types of organization are available to you so I will list those in my area. You likely have similar counterparts.<br>  <br>  Park and Rec Center, YMCA and Boys and Girls Club are usually your least expensive options and often only require short term commitments.<br>  <br>  First hand recommendations are usually the best way to find reputable activities. My only advice is the talk to the parents enough to see if their priorities and your priorities similar.<br>  <br>  <br>  I will now specifically address how to find a good martial arts program but many of the point are applicable for most youth classes/activities:<br>  <br>  Be wary of martial arts facilities that guarantee a black belt in 2 yrs if you sign a 2 1/2-3 yr contract. Long term contracts rarely offer any substantial benefit to the Client and often times do not have an "out" if you need to withdraw your child from the program early. Often times I hear of parents locked into a contract even if they move, or when a long term illness or injury keeps the child from being able to participate.<br>  <br>  Try out a few different styles/programs. There are a variety of styles and philosophies.<br>  <br>  Attend a local competition. You want to see how the instructors treat their students under the pressure of competition.<br>  If your child is interested in competition you need to closely look at the styles of sparring involved and the reputation of the safety at competitions.<br>  <br>  Look into the reputation of not only the local studio, but their parent organization.  Is there an up line that sits in on belt testing, especially for the higher ranks<br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest looking at DoJangs that are a part of the World Tang Soo Do Association.<br>  Here is the list of schools in Great Britain. I am not familiar enough with your country to know which town are close to you.<br>  <a href="http://www.worldtangsoodo.com/regions/Listing.asp?region=11#Great" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldtangsoodo.com/regions/Li...</a> Britain|`|7e25ab13e48dd8ca1039f649017bf1d0aa	My son has been doing Karate at the YMCA for 5 years now. Not a black belt yet! Don't get involved with the black belt factories. If you're going to do any martial arts. Don't sign long term contracts for any sports or programs. We pay $50 a month and can quit any time we want. <br>  <br>  Baseball always send home flyers in the kids back packs.  We do bowling on Saturday mornings. The bowling alley has a kids league. He used to do figure skating at the roller skating rink. That was getting very expensive.|`|oojO4WAraa	Check out the YMCA - they have many good programs for kids.  Our city has a Parks and Recreation Department and they run classes and stuff for kids - check to see if your city has such a department.  Otherwise, maybe ask at the school.|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	I would try the yellow pages online and just type in the activities you would like to put your kids in. Good luck in finding their activity.|`|kMymyn03aa	You could try looking through your town/city council website and they might have clubs going on around your area on the website.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|piw5oJ44aa	Check your community center, also schools might have some info.|`|RRChsxSKaa	check rec centers... school bulletin boards... stuff like that :D|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	call the school or your chamber of commerce
AA10247494	Besides eating less junk food and soda pop (which is REALLY bad for you) eat a healthy diet that includes cheese, lowfat milk, peanut butter, whole grains, and lots of real fruits and plenty of vegetables. Make sure to get 30 minutes or so of mild exercise a day (I prefer swimming and water aerobics) to keep you fit and healthy as well. Ask your doctor what other healthy foods and exercises would be good for you and baby. <br>  <br>  P.S. I can't stress the veggies and fruits enough by the way! As you progress through your pregnancy you may start to develop constipation problems. Eating veggies and fruits like apples, kiwis, and peaches give you extra fiber to help keep your system moving and discomfort down the natural way. I like baby carrots and lite ranch as an anytime snack... Easy to carry and very good for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|ioZeveazaa	Eat food from the food groups....fruit, dairy, meat, veggies, grain, and moderated fats and oils. This is the best thing. As you enter into the second half of the second trimester and start of the third your hunger will probably increase, for good reason, your baby is gaining fat so eat. Eat around 4-6 small meals a day. You are going to gain weight regardless but eating RIGHT will help. Good luck!|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	veggies,veggies ,veggies<br>  fruits,fruits fruits<br>  oatmeals.cereals<br>  whole grain wheats|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Veggies, actual fruit (not juice), milk, protein, lots of water, some carbs.  Basically a healthy diet, and you already know what that is, right?|`|AA10458750	milk!! that is number one, next to water. <br>  cereal is good too bc it gives you lots of nutrients & fills you up.<br>  basically jsut take your prenatal and eat like you normally would.|`|NpSVEC2naa	i used to have avocado and tuna sandwiches with two pieces of fruit for lunch most days. it gave me and bubs heaps of nutrients with only good healthy fat :)|`|hkbWhfCiaa	Fruit and Raw vegitables, keep a bag of carrot sticks with you or any kind of veggies really|`|olKKT2LTaa	I had a banana every day when I was pregnant. sually with a yoghurt and strawberries too! I liked beans on toast and baked potatoes topped with carrot, cheese and salad cream mixed together. I used to make a lot of soups too and loved eating brocolli with scrambled eggs. I did eat a ton of chocolate and ice cream though....but it was summer.<br>  <br>  I put on about 21lbs during pregnancy and was back to my pre-pregnancy weight 6 weeks after having my son (7lb 13oz). But I did swim 3-4 times a week and walked a lot. If you stay healthy, there is no reason you will put on unwanted weight. Eat what you fancy and stay active, Enjoy!|`|plI0WOrUaa	Always your vegetables.  Preferably raw because when you cook them, you loose alot of nutrients.  Eat protein whether in meat, nuts etc.  Milk for sure and other dairy products, whole grains, and lots of fruit.  Steer clear of a lot of white breads, sweet stuff and excess fats in processed foods.  As long as you are eating healthy, you will be fine.  Sometimes weight just seems like it won't stop coming on, but as long as its all baby, you'll be okay.  Keep exercising too.  It'll make your labour and recovery that much better.  Have fun!!|`|qImMwhUHaa	I can tell you what not to eat...and that's fast food.<br>  <br>  Try to eat iorn fortified cereals, fresh fruits and veggies, oatmeal, and peanut butter.

Also remember to take you pre-natal vitamins.|`|ieGiQ1vgaa	I try to eat a very healthy lunch (at work) because that is what I brought and that is what I have to eat.  At home there are options.

QeoljgkBaa	It sounds like it is possible, it sounds amazingly like my experience.  The first thing to understand is that you are not the only person who has felt like this and it in no way makes you a bad mum either.  The first step (and it can be a big one) is to speak to your GP, or your health visitor if you have a good relationship with them.  They can offer - along with your friends and family - help and support.  Your baby can give you the smiles, gurgles, sloppy kisses and that amazing smell that is unique to them which also helped me through mine.<br>  <br>  My thoughts are with you and hope you start to feel a little better very soon xxx|`|v0z5Nyypaa	I'm sorry you are going through this.  I went through the same thing.  You should contact your OB and talk to them about this.  There are many options available for treatment.  I had to go on medicine, but that is not the only treatment available.  Postpartum depression happens and is normal-your hormones are all out of wack from having a baby.  Don't feel bad about it.|`|a54770af827395ce98439812fd4cc3e3aa	I have PostNatal Depression and looking at your description it sounds like you may have it too.<br>  I spoke to my GP and he was marvellous.

PkeY5PlCaa	4 months old, ha ha give the poor bugger a break. Boys are normally slower than girls in the development stage, please dont stress, one day he will amaze you with the things he can do. my son is three tomorrow and everysingle day he comes up with something new. it amazes me at how talented he can be. give him time and he will come around sooner than you might think. for now enjoy the fact hes not into everything and giving you a bit of a break. i guess i was like this too wen my boy was a baby, its a motherly thing. goodluck, best wishes for many many many years ahead|`|hLSIRDtZaa	I think every child learns not at different speeds but more so certains things before others. Like some children might learn hand to mouth before someone whose learned how to sit up. Each baby learns something different at a different time. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Don't worry everything's going to be alright.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my sons 4 1/2 months and he doesn't roll over and cant lifted his head when hes on his stomach. babies do things at there own time.|`|0EZ0W5FPaa	He's right on schedule.  My daughter is 4 1/2 months, and she doesn't roll either.  She has twice from tummy to back, but that's it.  And that was recently.  And your little one hasn't forgotten he has hands, he just has no clue as to how to control them.  Also, mine give little laughs, not full laughs.  And all babies move at different paces.  He's not slow at all.  The fact that he is discovering his feet is a good sign, because some babies won't do that until 6 months!  He's doing great!  Check some sites online to check on baby milestones if your really concerned.|`|SVtZ4vUMaa	The fact that he is batting at toys and holding his bottle is good. It is not that he forgets his hands it is just that he is not quiet in control of them yet. I have a 5 month old daughter, She doesn't hold her bottle but she does grab for things, then drops them involuntarily, which is natural. Also his hand/eye coordination is not that great so grabbing something is difficult because he can see it but not sure how to get his hands there.<br>  Don't worry about not laughing, maybe he does and you confuse it for a different noise. I mean like a snort a gurgle or something that doesn't really sound like a laugh to you. <br>  Rolling is not a big issue. My Daughter has only just figured out how too roll. She has rolled from her back to tummy for a few weeks but couldn't figure out how to get back (this by the way is the back-to-front way to do it they are supposed to go tummy to back first). Now she is rolling she moves all over the lounge room.<br>  I know you have heard this a million times but babies really do develop at different stages.You may see a friends baby doing something that yours isn't and get worried, but if you watch your baby may be doing something theirs isn't. Your health nurse will tell you if there is anything to be concerned about. At this age I wouldn't worry too much, just enjoy him being still because when he starts moving you will wish he was still again, lol.

By the time it comes to having the baby, it ought to be on purpose, however the pregnancy happened.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My "accidental" pregnancy turned out to be the best thing to happen to me in my life.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Both of my Son's caught us off guard. I was told I would never carry a baby to term let alone get pregnant. At 26 I got a positive home test. He was born at 36 1/2 weeks. My 2nd Son we thought we were done having kids and another Surprise. No baby happens by "Accident"|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I don't believe they are accidents. I believe that everything happens for a reason.|`|ytE1q20taa	We got pregnant by accident, but now we see it as it was a good accident.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yeah i guess, i think about 50% of pregnancy are unplanned|`|MR9iBgafaa	If I can afford to love and protect my baby then it's fine. If you're having a baby for other reasons - eg to get a free house or trap your boyfriend - then no.  And how can you believe in having an accident? You have an accident or you don't. You don't plan it.|`|5UkfSahsaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  I was on the pill for over 5 years and was very strict in taking it at regular intervals, but an 'accident' still happened (which I didn't find about until I was 16 weeks pregnant). I am now 35 weeks pregnant and couldn't be more happier.|`|TAGQ4FQQaa	well im 29wks preg and it was an accident, i was on the pill, which i took regular but i wouldnt have it any other way!|`|U5RObaBGaa	i had 5 lol, but i love them to bits even tho they were not planned and i also don't really class them as accidents xx|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It wouldn't seem to be the most sensible thing to do.   I planned both of mine.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	It's possible|`|oDGpmkMaaa	? can I get some more info on what your asking?|`|3K7ffKn2aa	what do you mean?
jG8b3Mz0aa	Exactly like you. If someone were to show me a clip of my life now, to me as a child or even a teenager; I would scoff and say that's definitely not me! I honestly wasn't interested in getting married, having children, the whole package deal. I wanted to a serious career woman with no one slowing me down, but fate lead me to somewhere else and I couldn't be more happy. I absolutely love my life, even though this isn't how I imagined myself I'm grateful God led me to life I'm living.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Nope wouldn't know me at all lol.|`|AA12145826	Oh lordy, I'm not even close. I always knew I wanted to get a degree and be a marine mammal biologist and work for some group doing research on mating habits & other unknowns for the marine world....fast forward 15 years and I don't have the degree yet and I'm working as an administrative assistant for a medical engineering company that designs and creates amazing medical devices. That's the only area I think I came up short on my goals. I'm still happy with what I'm doing, but its not what I pictured for myself all those years ago. Other than that, I'm happily married with a beautiful child (and as of April I believe we are going to TTC #2!!!) which is exactly what I've always wanted. If I had changed anything, I'm pretty sure it would mean I wouldn't have met my husband, which means I wouldn't have had my daughter, so in that case I wouldn't change anything. I can still go back to school to fulfill those other dreams if I really need to but I'm happy now.|`|TJezsCkHaa	I wanted to be a doctor.Never happened and never will.I was an A+ student with ready to go scholarship from school to go to college after graduation and pick any field and study,but where i come from was a big block for me.I got married at 16 and my husband won't even let me think about going back to school.I have 3 precious kids that i do everything for and with them.But that will not be the case for my daughter.10 years passed and everything is changing.I wish i was 10 years younger to get the same benefits my sister is getting now..<br>  just not fair,right?|`|sxecXFgraa	When I was a kid, I never knew who I would be like when I got older.  I was a very vocal and stubborn kid, completely different from every other female in my family.  I don't regret the decisions I've made in my life.  I went to college, dropped out, joined the military, met my husband, finished my degree, had kids, got of the military, and now work for a military contractor company.  If I changed any of that, I might not of met my husband and possible not have my kids.  That's not something I would want to change.  My views on things have changed and I think this is due to meeting different people from all over the world.  In that since, I wouldn't recognize me, but my stubbornness is still here so that would be a dead give away.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I am not what I thought I was going to be. I was going to New York to college and I was going to get out of Alabama for good. I ended p pregnant at 17 never went to college and am still living in the same town in Alabama. I am however happily married and I think the pregnancy saved me. I was wild and I partied to hard. If I would have took off to New York  I'd probably be dead by now. I made some unwise decisions but they brought me to where I am now so Iwouldn'tt change anything - well except I would give myself no morning sickness with this pregnancy-lol|`|1iXvphNYaa	Well, in many ways I'm still that kid. And I think that much of what I saw came to be of course not in the way I thought I'd get here. On the whole, I never formed many opinions or ideas about anything as a kid, not even as a teenager. I was always observative and receptive. I usually looked back on my adolescence as one that was pretty mediocre and somber but now I'm coming to understand it as the best that any kid could have ever had. Peace. :)|`|2aqPnQPlaa	I wanted to be a hollywood actress..I turned out to be an interior designer and I thought I would marry a film star, I married a property lawyer. I thought I would have 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys called Emma, Jenny, Sam and Mark. So far I have 2 daughters, called Amelia and Francesca. I thought I would live in a mansion, I live in a 4 bedroom family home. Lol, things change I guess! :)|`|cAtWxJG1aa	well, i turned out to be neither a detective nor the boss of everyone in the world.  so nope, i wouldn't recognize myself and i'd probably be disappointed.<br>  <br>  lol, i'm nothing like i expected i'd be.  but i'm happy with my choices nonetheless.  thank goodness we don't have to make any lasting decisions about our lives when we're 10.
uVEDt4Woaa	I can't take offence to people who post stories of abortion. I assume that most are young and are looking for advice because they are too scared to reach out to people around them. I was young once and went through a fairly similar situation, however went through with my pregnancy and now have a beautiful girl (now 7).<br>  <br>  Now my husband and I are TTC and last month I had an early miscarriage. While it makes me sad there are people in the world who are yearning to fall pregnant and can't, or find it extremely difficult - I can't be angry for young people who make a mistake. <br>  <br>  Good luck to everyone!! Baby dust!!|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	hi hun!<br>  <br>  It really does upset me when i see those questions-there are so many ladies ttc and having many problems and here someone just wants to flush a life down the loo! A human life??? it just feels to me that it has no worth to some people,and the fact that that little baby never asked to be there in the first place and has to pay for its parents mistake with DEATH, is just sickening! But... who am i to judge, its none of my business anyway...people are going to abort weather i like it or not. and yeah there may be some circumstances where abortion is kind of ok-rape or deformity....but that still doesnt make it right.<br>  <br>  It is very saddening, and scarey-that there are so many people who are willing to kill their babies-because-oops i didnt use conception or oh boy my mom is gonna kill me...if you play the game, you have to deal with the consequences, thats how i see it!<br>  <br>  Id better go, i could write about this subject all day...|`|stRWElvPaa	I sometimes think, oh if only I could have a baby instead of this woman/girl who doesn't want it. It seems ungrateful, although at the same time I mostly sympathise with her situation.|`|NNwEuC8paa	It bothers me a lot actually. Why would they ever think to post anything about abortion in the pregnancy or trying to conceive category!? It blows my mind.<br>  Good luck to you!!!!|`|SaEb8XRBaa	hello hun, yes it does bother me as i was on microgynon 30 for 10 years never had a mistake or even a scare, i came of the pill november 07 fell in the 1st week, un-fortunately i missed miscarried and needed a d & c that was in feb i lost twins, then i had miscarried in may at 5 1/2 weeks then again in august at 7 weeks then fell in october and am now 5 months pregnant, it hurts me that women cant take responsibilty and have to deal with abortions i had a reassurance scan at 9 weeks and the baby was a baby just the limbs were still buds there was a heart beat pressent and to me that was my baby i burst into tears just seeing it move and bounce around. i dont agree or disagree i just get annoyed that some people are not responsible to do an adult thing and not deal with consequenses, every time i was on anti-biotics we used condoms, i do feel that you should use condoms with different partners to protect yourselfs from std's and sti's any way, i have been with my partner 7 yrs the 1st 2 yrs we ued condoms aswel as me being on the pill, xxx|`|4c34d31e8d0babee9edd38ac0e5b54c4aa	I completely separate myself from their situation. They must have a good reason for it I cant imagine it being nice. And where else could they put it it is pregnancy after all. Its a shame that many of us would love to be in their position and are struggling to do it but thats life|`|sk46uigvaa	No abortion is a pregnancy subject....??|`|H74F8jxuaa	It really gets my goat!!!  I had a miscarriage in Sept. and I was so devasted and now, I keep reading these posts about abortion and it really irks me!!  No one knows what it is like to struggle getting pregnant until it actually happens to you.  Abortion is one of the sorest subjects anyone can post on ttc post or pregnancy post.  It is just rude and disrespectful!
aLAmvX5Naa	Well, my daughter is only 1 right now, but when she is school age she will need to have a fever or have been to the dr in the past couple days and told she is contagious and needs to stay home, or is acting really out of it and doesn't perk up when offered a special breakfast or anything.<br>  <br>  I remember being a kid, I remember being "sick" when I didn't want to do the planned activity in school that day. Fake sickness won't fly with me.|`|sxecXFgraa	I have the same rules, fever or acting differently (when they think I'm not watching).  They also know if they stay home because they're sick, they don't get to play at all that day.  They can only stay in bed or lie on the couch.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	What if they have a fever AND a big grin?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I dont have rules or children that are liars<br>  if youre sick ..youre sick|`|nVQGpvuoaa	It matters. <br>  I can't fake, I always get caught, and what my mom does if she knows I'm faking, is she'll let me stay for one day just because it will be my fault when I have tons of homework, BUT she'll make me go to work with her AND she won't let me hang out with friends AT ALL.<br>  So I stopped that. but When I'm really actually sick. which to her is a cold, fever, or the other obvious I can do anything I guess like watch tv and computer.<br>  I can still do stuff with friends, when I'm actually sick unless its like SUPER contagious. I just can't go to their house.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My daughter is only 23 months so:<br>  when she has a fever<br>  when she is "not herself" (i.e. lethargic or crying, exceptionally tired)<br>  vomiting or diarrhea<br>  <br>  There are other things, such as if she has a severe cough.  We have no rules, mostly just go on how she seems to be feeling.  If she's miserable, she stays home.  She's too young to fake it....for now!!|`|X4qETu2Aaa	Mine don't really fake sick a. because he is at the age where he likes school and b. because they know when they fake sick they sit in their room and take yucky medicine and go to the doctors.|`|QveBSjFSaa	I call it, that's the number one rule.<br>  But I worked in the medical field for years, I can make the call.<br>  Fever, vomiting, colored mucus.... that's about it.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	if they say they are sick i will let my son stay home he only says he is sick when he is really sick and my daughter is to young to go to school?|`|rpsXPdFmaa	With my mom and dad they'd only let us stay home if we were running a fever or throwing up.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I don't know haha mine says it everyday.|`|P4LBygv2aa	you don't go to school you don't do anything but stay in Your room in bed till school tomorrow|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well i looked after my neice for a week as her mom was in hospital and boy did she try and test me lol... the rules were the same as yours aspecially the last one. i was convinced she was faking it but then she was sick poor mite...so off to bed she went!|`|1ERDjrTTaa	Usually on if they have a fever, vomiting or diarrhea. They have never really tried to get out of going to school, they actually like school. My son has lied to me once about being sick with a stomach ache. I had a feeling he was lying so I sent him to school anyways, the school called me about 30 min. after I dropped him off and told me he was sick in the office, so we picked him up. He confessed to us later that he was faking because there was a bully at school that keeps picking on. Besides that they have never lied to get out of school.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	only if they have green stuff coming from an orpheus or a fever but the fever has to be over 99F if it's just a slight fever like 98.9 or something it's might just be that the heater was too high that night.|`|jHmepKRMaa	If my kids stay home sick they stay in bed no tv and nothing to do but read a good book until they get better. needless to say they aren't sick<br>  very often.|`|TJezsCkHaa	My kids stay home if:<br>  1.fever is over 100<br>  2.vomiting<br>  3.order from doc not to go<br>  4.brokin neck!|`|xVEqBjDVaa	yeah, same as yours. but they aren't allowed to play or be on the computer, they have to rest.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Well, my daughter is only two but when she goes to school, the rules will be:<br>  -Fever<br>  -Vomiting<br>  -Coloured mucus<br>  -Acting differently<br>  -Lethargic<br>  I used to fake sick a lot, haha, so I know what to look for.<br>  <br>  If my daughter stays home, she will only be allowed in bed or on the couch anyway.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	My four all go to the same school I teach at.<br>  So they ride with me in the morning. I have my Hubby or their grandmother look after them, if they are real sick with fevers or stomach disorders.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )
ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, don't give up yet.  You may not have enough hcg in your system yet to give you a positive.  To prove how each pregnancy is different.<br>  <br>  With my son I didn't get a positive till I was 5 weeks late (9 weeks pregnant) and with this most current pregnancy I got a positive when I was 2 days late for my period.  So, that's a huge change in time.  Just takes time sometimes.  Good luck and don't give up!
FiUprYsvaa	No, it is not too old. <br>  I am 19 and if I could I still would go. <br>  <br>  I didn't get to go enough as a child and when I look back it makes me sad. <br>  <br>  I always wanted to go to that camp that was on Disney. Bug Juice. <br>  Idk the camp name. But I always wanted to go there and be on tv.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It almost sounds like the camp in the 1998 re-make of the Parent Trap(1961).<br>  <br>  Go for it!!|`|BbdWpp1Caa	Go for it! Things like pony camp go till your 17. You'll have fun regardless. As for friends, you make them there :)|`|hR1LlS2Haa	Not at all. At my sleep away camp their is someone new in every age group. If you really want to go, then go!|`|5Fdprw22aa	NO, have all the fun you want :D|`|dDHtziQEaa	get L-A-I-D|`|kCfOh2ZRaa	No, you're still young - fun is fun. You seem very enthusiastic about it, so go! (You know you want to).
P0Fjh59Eaa	You should ask your child's peds doc about that. My peds doc have always said vitamin D till 3-4 yrs of age.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Keep going with the higher fat.  They are finding that higher fat milk, that the fat holds in the good hormones and vitamins in milk, and as long as you dont OD on it, it may be less of a concern than obesity with the higher fat.<br>  <br>  And something was just out yesterday on vit D preventing colds better than C.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yea I think so.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Children shouldn't be on 1% milk until they are pre-teen/teen at earliest unless they are overweight and a doctor has told you to only give them low fat milk or limit their milk intake. You should continue with whole milk until age two at least and then you can start giving them 2%. Until age two children are still developing their brain and immune system- two areas that need the fat from whole milk and before that formula or breast milk.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	It's better for kids to be on whole milk til age 4 (or at least that's what my son's pediatrician told me), so if ur 21 month old is only on 2% milk than i'd keep him on it til he's at least 4, and then maybe switch it then.  Unless of course he is overweight and he doesn't really need the extra fat, but otherwise i'd suggest switchin him back to whole milk or stayin with the 2%, but it's only a suggestion, u do what u feel is right.  Also askin ur child's pediatrician might be helpful too.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	They say to change it from whole milk to 2% when they are 2 years old. My son won't drink the 2% though so he still drinks whole milk. If I drink milk at all it's the whole milk. It just tastes better.|`|sAbah6dTaa	we do 2% for my 3 year old... maybe wait a little longer because they do need the fat.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	I just asked my doctor yesterday when i could start doing that and when I could and what type of milk. he said start with whole then go to 2% if thats what you buy never less than that, I think maybe mixing whole and 1% wouldnt hurt but not a whole bottle of 1% or maybe one bottle whole, one bottle 1 % id meet in the middle and give him 2%. good luck !|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I'm not sure why you'd want your child to, or need them to unless they were overweight and your child's pediatrician told you to put him/her on lower fat milk?  I don't think I would.  They need that fat and vitamins that is in whole milk.|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	nope. whole milk is absolutely the best fo ryour child until 4. atleast that's what most drs say-age 4. i believe that they suggest atleast 2 years old @ the earliest because their bones are growing so rapidly.
CYmgD1siaa	YOU CAN TAKE IT 5 DAYS BEFORE YOUR MISSED PERIOD.|`|kziIf0r6aa	To be totally honest Id wait til 2 weeks after your period is due before wasting any money on tests you'll only get let down to see negative results.  The only way to determine a pregnancy early early on is thru a blood test which you'll need to arrange thru your GP.  Good luck and congrats if you are:0|`|gjVeJFRtaa	its only the 8th 2day you still have 8 days 2go
1WSFNX35aa	Probably because a person receives their name when they are a baby. Sort of like birth marks.. you have them until you die as well.. but you don't call them life marks lol.|`|HvX6KvK1aa	people get named when they are babies|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Because on here we ARE naming babies that have just been born or will be born soon.<br>  <br>  Its not like they are adults when they are first born.<br>  <br>  That's why you call them baby names.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	lol. great point!
98OlWbtXaa	It will go down over the next week or so.  If it doesn't, call your doctor.  But your body hasn't fully adjusted yet, so the swelling will continue till things go back to normal.<br>  <br>  Same thing happened to me :)  I had balloon feet and hands till a few days after the baby was born.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	i had a natural birth, no eclampsia or anything and i still swelled, i dtayed like that for about 3 weeks after birth!, good luck, it will go though, give it time, feet up, relax [impossible!!!!]|`|u0BzSesHaa	Was you tested for pre- eclampsia when you were pregnant?? I had it and my face, hands and feet ballooned and remained for a few weeks afer but because I breast fed it help reduce the swelling and helped the uterus to shrink back to normal. Take a visit to your drs =)|`|LZk3z2ilaa	The answer is Elevate Elevate Elevate!  Once you gve birth all of the extra water that you and the baby needed needs somewhere to go, it jut has to work its way out of your body.  I was swollen for a month and half after my first son.  Drink lots of water (i know why drink water if that's why I am swollen) but it helps work the extra out.  Good Luck!
AA12228565	nope.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Some women do have some signs a few days earlier, but you can't really confirm it until you test, and the best time to do that is when you miss your period.  But it is entirely common for the missed period to be the first symptom.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	No, its not true.  Some women experience some symptoms shortly after implantation, which can occur a few days before your period.  Most symptoms do start after a missed period though.|`|v0z5Nyypaa	You can have symptoms of pregnancy before a missed period.  If you think you are pregnant, take a test.|`|RRChsxSKaa	no. because in some cases you still have your period while you are pregnant... it's not common but it happens
AA12228565	This is just stress from thinking you might be pregnant.|`|lTsPX04jaa	your making your self feel like your pregnant|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Your not, don't worry.  If there was no ejaculation or precum then you can't get pregnant.  Plus if it was just brief contact with his penis, then the chances are very slim there was sperm that got in you.<br>  <br>  You are probably due for your period or coming down with something, don't stress about it, you are probably fine.|`|okpAjss6aa	if there is no *** then no
Nb0Gxvsyaa	At this point I would probably get a convertible.  It is not just weight but length you need to consider with the little infant car seats.  If you are set on a travel system check out the Chicco travel systems that take you to a 30ish pound weight.  The strollers are very easy to manage (one handed even) and the seat clips into the stroller very easily.  I have loved mine so far.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I had a travel system with my frist and hated it. I never used the car seat in the stroller it was so hard to get it straped in. It took forever. <br>  <br>  this stroller looks like a good one though. I think it will work for you. I hope you have better luck with it then I did|`|hkbWhfCiaa	I wouldn't even worry about it, I would get him into a bigger carseat in a few months and jsut put him in the carseat regularly...it's really not worth the money.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I had an infant car seat - Maxi Cosi. We recently replace it to Britax Boulevard CS/Convertable because it is much bigger & spacious for my baby. My baby's 8 month old & she weighs 21lb. She was already 19 pounds at 6 month & was going crazy with her infant seat - too compact for her body. Now she's so happy with this huge spacious yet very safe seat. <br>  <br>  I've looked at the car seat you are looking at which is nice too but I'm sure after few month, you'll be looking at a bigger seat. One nice thing about travel system is that you don't need to wake up your baby when you need to get out - you can just carry the car seat out. <br>  My baby's so heavy that I don't even want to carry her with the car seat anymore. <br>  <br>  Think about your baby's growing speed. Mine's so fast so I got the toddler car seat but your baby maybe small for a long time then the one you are looking at would be a good choice for a while.|`|x1VY9fJAaa	there are many types of baby seats, but the best are those that are large and can protect the baby|`|AA10648369	We have this travel system, the carseat with base, the single stroller, and the double stroller! We love them! I love that the carseat has a higher weight/height limit. I know that a lot of people complain that leaving them in the infant seat longer is a pain because it is too heavy,  but then you just leave it in the car, just like you would with a convertible seat. But, if they are asleep, you can transfer to seat to the stroller easily without waking the baby, or breaking your back! <br>  <br>  This way, you can leave them in their infant seat until they are 20 lbs and a year old and move them to a forward facing seat, eliminating the need for a convertible seat. <br>  <br>  Really, it is all personal preference though!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Whichever. I like the one that you picked. It's very cute!|`|33h5R8nTaa	Honestly your best bet would be a convertable car seat that goe from 5-65 or 100lbs. I found when my daughter got to 20 lbs i couldnt carry her in the travel system carseat to even put it in the stroller.
ilrSUcMvaa	im the same as u. i had my first at 24 she is now 2 and a bit planning on another sometime soon but u dont realise how hard it actually is until the baby arrives. it is real hard but it is real worth it. i dont know why a teenager would want to do it. people say its for the money but if u ask me working a job is easier than raising a baby. i had mine and none of my friends had babies so it was difficult. noone gets it that u cant just drop everything and go out. but in saying all that i wouldnt swap what i have for anything in the world. but u have to be ready for it. its a massive change.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Honestly I think they need to be taught a lesson or two because childhood days are the best days of your life they should wait until at least 18 because my cousin just gave birth but two days before she was 19 I was born when my mum was 22 and that age is okay.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.xxx|`|4Uuehq2Faa	I agree, im 23 now and expecting my first child, teenage pregnancy is not a great thing, i think these girls look upto other teens with babies and think "i want to do that" they want attention and whats the best way for teen attention? oh thats right... have a baby *rolls eyes* they have no idea, only when they have the child do they realize what they have done, and when they get the attention i bet they dont want it.<br>  <br>  Just give a teen a weekend with a baby to look after, ive seen many give up wanting one for awhile after that!|`|98WKYtfwaa	What the f*ck is up with all these questions about pregnant teens? It's upto them if they want to put themselves in that position, let them learn themselves, they won't listen to other people.<br>  <br>  I may sound rude, but i'm a pregnant teen and am getting fed up with questions like this, who cares what we do with our lives? You obviously have nothing better to do with your own if you're so interested in what other people do.<br>  <br>  ETA - You're not one to judge, you're 24, got a baby and having another one already and they both have different fathers, you're barely out your teen years yourself.|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I agree with you. I'm 28 and had my first baby, love her to bits, but I cried when my social life crashed. I'm slowly getting back into the groove a bit, but it's been over a year. They think it's cool or something. I dunno, but I wasn't ever going to have a baby if I couldn't afford it and as a teen, clothes/cd's/going out came first!|`|ZZakBjiNaa	it's not necessarily a want. it may be more of a sensible decision to cope with the consequences and mistakes. im 15 and i think im 4 weeks and 2 days. i'll keep my baby because it was my mistake and i'm completely against abortion x|`|5LzZYrQnaa	and thats the problem but so many young kids think they can handle it and their parents are the ones who really raise they grandchild.|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	That's the thing.

She said its sad how delusional she was and how it still hasn't changed.<br>  <br>  Babies get in the way of EVERYTHING! It's not easy. I'm about to be 21 and I'm waiting until I find the right guy and get MARRIED! My best friend is the same age and her life is completely effed up.<br>  <br>  These little girls need to know that babies aren't pleasant all the time. They cry when they're hungry, sleepy, need changing, and etc.

Sort of like a trophy girl. But deep down it's not just sex which is a main factor, they also want someone they can admire, and spoil, and do things for, and to have the same in return. That though won't show through when there friends are around. Young high school relationships can be the sweetest, and sometimes turn into long term relationships.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Different men want different things.

Girls want sex. Humans want sex. Guys will also survive if you don't get in bed with them. It always pisses me off when girls say, "Idk why I did it lol i gess it was just pressure lol." Unless there's force involved, both parties choose to have sex. Asking repeatedly or even the old, "You'd do it if you loved me," don't count as force because either party could still say no and leave.<br>  <br>  Respect yourself and don't turn in to a doormat for a guy. Don't be afraid to cuddle and fluff his ego in public now and then, but don't let him walk all over you. Relax, have fun, and let him be a guy. Don't assume that everything he does is to try to get you naked. Remember that guys have feelings too, but don't pressure him to cry. Hug him now and again.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, there's too much individual variation to tell.|`|egqveuPjaa	As much as I hate to admit it, all they want is sex!

17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	I don't know whether or not you are p/g, but yes, you definitely tested way too early!  Your best bet is to wait at least 14 days after ovulation to test...<br>  <br>  Most pregnancy tests aren't terribly reliable until AF is only day or two away.  So if AF hasn't come by tomorrow morning, then you should definitely test now.  For most accurate results, always use first morning urine when taking an early pregnancy test. The results you get tomorrow would be very reliable.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that if you are ovulating on day 20 of your cycle and having your period on the 29th of your cycle, that this might be a fertility problem.  Your luteal phase (the days in between ovulation and menstruation) should be a least 12 days and preferably 14 days long every cycle. If your luteal phase is only 9 days long, then you won't likely be able to get pregnant without taking progesterone suppositories.  Check with a fertility specialist if your LP continues to be only 9 days long.<br>  <br>  Is it possible you are wrong about what day you ovulated on and that your LP is actually longer than that?  I would try OPK strips, fertility charting using basal body temperature, and/or the ClearBlueEasy Fertility monitor for the greatest accuracy on pinpointing  your ovulation day.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes you tested too early. You cannot get a postive until 10 days after ovulation at the very earliest. Most women get positives around day 14.|`|t0jC2o0Jaa	Try testing within 3-7 days and see if it doesn't show a positive. Some women don't get a positive until 5-7 sometimes 8 weeks along. Don't get discouraged. Good Luck.|`|73547779aa84933eae14d1202168e7a8aa	If you do the urine test, ok , it was too soon. This test will be reliable after 21 days, at least. But the Blood -serum test answers sooner. But based on our rules you must recheck|`|CYmgD1siaa	yes you did. wait intill 5 days before your missed period.

At 12pm I feed her lunch which is 1 jar of veggies and sometimes a meat like chicken, turkey or beef. Sometimes with lunch I will give her fruit with it. DInnertime is usually around 5:30pm. I feed her 1 jar of meat and veggies mixed and 1 jar of dessert like strawberries, custard or banana and coconut cream.<br>  <br>  I always offer her a sippy cup with 1/2 juice 1/2 water at every meal in case she is thirsty and because she is still learning to use her sippy cup.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	My boy is almost 9 months old.  He eats solids three times a day.  Breakfast is usually a fruit and some rice cereal, or sometimes a fruit and sweet potato or a couple of egg yolks.

He always has a bottle with each meal, and I also try to offer him a drink of water from a cup as well.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Twice a day and he takes a bottle afterwards but not immediately afterwards.|`|p1Jz4BV5aa	My daughter is 8 months old and I feed her an 8 oz. bottle and 2-3 tablespoons on cereal for breakfast. At lunch she'll have another 8 oz bottle and then cereal, fruit, meat/veggie combo. I give her a 6-8 oz bottle for a snack and then for dinner she'll have one more 6-8 oz bottle and then cereal, fruit, meat, veggies. I also give her rice husks to snack on from time to time. My doctor told me that juice and water are not neccessary at this age because it tricks the tummy into being full but it isn't full with the proper nutrition. A bottle is given before the meal until closer to a year. Then you do the opposite.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	my daughter is 7months & she eats 3 solids a day.  breakfast she gets a fruit, lunch fruit or veggie & dinner she gets something like peas with brown rice.  if she still is hungry after dinner, then i will give her dessert.  she eats EVERYTHING except carrots.  my daughter will not take a bottle w/her meal, only a sippy cup of water.  she will only take a bottle at nap & bed time now.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	we've started my daughter on solids not so long ago -firstly we tried my daughter on rice cereal inc flavoured ones and she hated them.. my daughter is 5 months and now ive started her (the past 4 days) on 2 solids a day (breakfast and tea) - sweet potato and she loves it! next (tomorrow) im going to introduce her to a different vegetable maybe pureed peas?
GJgZVKvXaa	You don't have to take a baby outside every day.  The only benefits would be fresh air and a change of scenery.  If your baby enjoys a walk, it would be nice to take her when you can, but you don't have to every day.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Take the baby out when you go outside (don't leave it out there alone even if you are watching from the window).   No it's not going to hurt the baby to not go out every single day.   Yes walks  in the stroller benefit the baby because of the increase in stimuli from the different sights and sounds.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	I find it a little disturbing that you leave your daughter outside by herself.  What if something, like a leaf or a squirrrel, fell on her and you weren't looking?  How would you know she is chocking???   YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR HER!|`|UdtzY5ciaa	You referred to your daughter as It in the title.|`|WA7MzJeIaa	You should NEVER leave your child unattended. Even though you can see her out the window, she is still outside alone. Anything can happen and when it does, it usually happens within a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  If she is outside, you need to be outside with her.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I don't think you should leave your baby outside and alone and just watch through a window. It only takes one second for someone to pop out of a car, grab your baby and go.<br>  <br>  Your baby doesn't need fresh air that badly that they have to be alone outside. I am sure your pediatrician and the police would both agree your 3 month old needs to be near you. If you are inside your baby is inside. Open a window.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think you should just take the baby for a walk in her stroller every day. I myself wouldn't put my child outside while  I was inside whether or not I could see her. Sometimes you can see them and you are not paying attention and some people might think you just left your baby outside and then they could call the cops.
sjlQj4ihaa	Well first of all you don't need your parents permission. You can go to any Planned Parenthood and with a quick (and free if you say you don't have insurance) exam be prescribed birth control. If you do do this just say that you don't have insurance because if you tell them about your policy it'll  be charged and show up on the bill and your secret's out.<br>  You don't have to tell them that you're having sex if you ask for birth control. Just say that although you don't plan on having sex, being safe just in case is the responsible thing to do. You respect yourself and your future far to much to risk ruining it with a teenage pregnancy. If they can't really say no to you when your trying to be responsible. But if they do say no, remember you don't need their permission to protect yourself.|`|MSfC0FXvaa	mother, father... unless you want to be a grandma and grandpa... i suggest you get me on some birth control. thanks.<br>  <br>  anyway, if you're 16, im pretty sure you can go to planned parenthood and get it yourself. ask an aunt or something to take you.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Just tell your mother you don't want to end up being a pregnant teenager, and want to get on Birth Control and be safe about it. Also, you should be using condoms too. And if you have irregular periods, it will regulate them, and make cramps less painful, if they are for you. <br>  <br>  I got on it to regulate my period (that's what I told them I wanted it for), but I am sexually active also with my boyfriend of 1 year and 5 months. <br>  You just want to be safe, they shouldn't be mad about that. <br>  Good Luck.|`|cfdVadp6aa	Unlike most teenagers you have the respect to know to protect yourself. any parent should be proud of their kid for asking them to be on BC even if they dont like the fact you are having sex. I think that you should just flat out tell them. whats the worse they can do freak out? .. but if they are good parents they should respect that you want to be safe. Just do it.. what do you have to lose right??<br>  <br>  good luck|`|OpMS8Gwcaa	I think it's wondefull that you want to be safe, and I think you should talk to your parents about getting some birth control. While I don't know them, I would think that they would be glad that you're wanting to be safe. You said your mom had 2 kids before graduation. While I'm sure she doesn't regret that, I'm sure it must have been difficult, and I doubt she would want you to go through that. I think she might understand. And if you get along with your dad, that's great. I think he would be glad that his daughter wants to be safe.|`|VmuLzz0Waa	I know alot of girl's who got pregnet on brith control so don't  get your hopes high that you won't get pregnet I hate to brake that to you but it's the truth use condoms that's a hole lot better.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	Get it from planned parenthood for less. Buy it yourself OR say its for you heavy long periods so you want to take it for shorter lighter periods.

BxrU8kUJaa	I have had pre-eclampsia with all 3 of my prior pregnancies and went on bed rest between 32 and 35 weeks until I was induced at 36 or 37 weeks.  Your BP going down and symptoms subsiding some are proof that it's helping, but it's likely if you go back to your current amount of activity it'll all kick back up.  One of my docs actually said "I can tell you've been doing what you were told!" <br>  <br>  The only "cure" for pre-eclampia is delivery so it's likely you're on bedrest for the duration. Good luck!|`|qImMwhUHaa	I had pre-eclampsia with my first child. I was never even put on bed rest but I needed to be. A BP of 131/92 is VERY high. You need to take it easy. I ended up having to be induced it was so bad....so take it easy! Pre-eclampsia is a serious thing.|`|oojO4WAraa	Pre-eclamsia can be very serious.  I was on complete bedrest from 4 1/2 months on.  It was awful.  You only have another month or so.  Do what the doctor tells you to do.

Just goes to show that people put no thought or effort into middle names most of the time.|`|v0596BTeaa	Not exactly weird, more unimaginative perhaps.|`|BBLraJE3aa	Its not unheard, of but I agree it is a little uncreative to label your kids with the same middle name?|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I don't think it's so weird. It's a family "connection" kinda thing. I have the same middle name as my mom (my sister does not though. I'm the oldest- I got there first) and as fate would have it, my stepdaughter has it as her middle name too! I had nothing to do (obviously) with naming her, but I think it's kinda cool.<br>  <br>  I however would not give this middle name to any children of mine...I don't really want to carry on this little "tradition" and I don't like the name. I do plan to give my daughter a middle name that is reminiscent of my stepdaughter's though. Her first name ends in -ee, so my daughter's middle name will end in -ee. I want them to have that tie in their names. So they feel like sisters, even though they are half-sisters.<br>  <br>  It's all personal preference though. If that's wnat you like, then no, it's not weird. And in your situation, I don't think that it is.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	i know of a family of like 9 kids and all the kids-boys and girls-have the same middle name. i honestly don't know what it is but it starts with a K. idk-i think it's different but it might be because my family doesn't do that. my good friend's (who is pregnant) middle name is Leigh and her boyfriend's middle name is Lee so whether she has a boy or girl-the baby's middle name will be Lee or Leigh.|`|sC6rQkm2aa	no.  my family could only offord one middle name and that was: billybobjoewenttothestoreandboughtafishw...<br>  <br>  everyone in my family has that middle name except for one whos middle name is g.  not gee just g.|`|jkkCfu6Haa	easy to remeber haha! but i dont think it is. i think that its a name you could carry on. as long as its not jerry for a girl then its on you! :)|`|PbCa7ZYsaa	the same as the parent.. no not really. same as the other siblings, like octo-mom yea it's weird and uncreative.

tdFFU4rOaa	It's hard to say by your description but it could be some mucous plug coming out, It keeps producing. As you cervix dilates it can get a pinky tinge and even be bloody. It's also possible you have thrush. Get it checked out by a doctor if you're worried|`|YOrRafZoaa	As long as it is not bloody, I think there is nothing to worry about. Just remember to pay attention to how you feel. When i was at the end of my pregnancy with my son, and my husband and i had sex, i would start to contract. I had to stop because this became painful. As far as the discharge goes, it is probably nothing. If you are concerned that it is something bad then just check with your OB/GYN. They will let you know for sure. <br>  Best of Luck on the new addition!|`|zj32aZ2eaa	I'm not sure. Sounds like bits of built up discharge or it could be bits of your mucous plug slowly coming out. Ask your doctor...you've got me stumped..|`|hoX7hoINaa	Intercourse can wake the baby and cause him/her to move around in there. Since you're 39 weeks, intercourse will cause braxton hicks to be stronger. Until you are feeling regular contrations, you are not in labor.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	I would ask my doctor.  Seriously, like call him or her right now and ask.  No kidding.  BH at 39 weeks is a big deal and I hope you do realize that most women as far along as you are have sex so as to bring about contractions so they can get started on having the baby.
UdICTUnaaa	all these answers are garbage<br>  <br>  you SHOULD be having sex to make the baby come<br>  and yes, u should be dialated to about 3 cm right now... i was at 39 weeks and most people are dialated to at least 2 cm, ur body is getting ready to have the baby. go to the hospital when ur contractions start coming 5-10 minutes apart consistantly|`|YOrRafZoaa	If it is at all painful for you, then you should definitely not do it. Other than that, i'd say you are ok. Some women have sex all the way till they give birth. As far as you feeling different to him, I think that is normal. Your body is going through many changes right now. Ofcourse its going to feel different. And if you are 39 weeks, then it is a real possiblitly that you could be dialated a bit. My cardinal rule when i was pregnant was that if it hurt, i didnt do it. Just pay attention to your body. You will know what you shouldnt do. <br>  Best of luck to the both of you on the new addition.|`|M5tqVX8Baa	ask a doctor|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	i think sex during pregnancy is something natural you can watch this video at <a href="http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=5548" rel="nofollow">http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=55...</a> you have the opinion of the expert of pregnancy and you can read these articles at <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/5016/306/Nightmares-of-Unsafe-Sex-and-Pregnancy-By-Anurag-Ahluwalia.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a><br>  and this <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/5017/306/Sex-and-Pregnancy-Common-Myths-and-Little-Known-Facts-By-Sam-Jenkins.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a><br>  and this <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/5018/306/Myths-of-Sex-and-Pregnancy-By-Stanley-Fernandes.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a><br>  and this <a href="http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art/5019/306/Sex-During-Pregnancy-By-Beverley-Brooke.html" rel="nofollow">http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...</a>
AnDnOd5Vaa	your most likely pregnant!|`|DN6XtoViaa	just about any symptoms can come on after Implantation happens.<br>  <br>  implantation happens about 6 days after fertilization.<br>  <br>  if you were fertilized the day you had sex then YES you could very well be having symptoms.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wishful thinking.  If there is an embryo, it's implanting about now.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Seems early, but it does depend on when you ovulated not when you had sex exactly.  If you ovulated a week ago, then it is possible to maybe feel a few things if the egg implanted.  But not likely to feel it that early.  Its hard to say, many women say they felt symptoms and new they were pregnant right away.  HCG is released after implantation, that is what causes the symptoms in pregnancy.|`|NNwEuC8paa	I didn't have any symptoms at one week but i tested 8 days after intercourse and got a positive,then i started getting sick like a week later and a week after hat my boobs were killing me. <br>  Take a test in a few days.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Most likely its pre-period symptoms. Sorry but it is way too early for pregnancy symptoms. You haven't even gone through implantation yet even if you were preg.|`|stRWElvPaa	those are symptoms of pregnancy, but I think it would be a little early...although your pregnancy hormones could be strong, good luck!
iJ9Ewxwtaa	first off, i think your in the wrong section.<br>  <br>  secondly, its NOT stupid.  I was 16 once.  every young driver makes mistakes; and most of them don't pay enough attention while driving.  <br>  <br>  they are doing it to SAVE LIVES, no matter the inconvenience on you, if it helps save a life than its worthwhile.<br>  <br>  put yourself in kyleighs parents position, you would of fought for the same thing.  parents are just trying to protect their kids.|`|AA11138222	It may change things, because teenagers will think twice before having more people than allowed in their car since the police will know how old they are for sure. I think it's an okay idea. It is well documented that teenagers are not good drivers in general, and that having more passengers causes distractions that new drivers do not need to deal with. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way...Would you rather have a stupid sticker on your car  or not be allowed to drive at all until you are 18, or even 21. The alternative to making laws like this is to raise the age that you are allowed to get your license and I think you would hate that even more.|`|kQUSPstlaa	This has nothing to do w/ naming babies|`|QAeyvDdwaa	I think that this is hilarious.  Suck it, teen drivers.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I'm sorry, I think this is in the wrong section.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	Whats this got to do with naming babies?|`|HXa1NqOzaa	this is 2 confusing sorry|`|5ZwIASCgaa	It is DEFINITELY NOT STUPID!!! This is the best thing they have ever come up with....You obviously need to do some research on how many teens die a year from a car accident....And it doesn't give "creepers" the opportunity to find a way to sexually assault a teen...did u even read the article This is what it says------->The state Motor Vehicle Commission has a prototype decal in the works that is "non-descriptive, not obvious to the general public," highly reflectorized so it can be seen at night and can be removed if an adult driver is behind the wheel, said Pam Fischer, director of the Division of Highway Traffic Safety.<br>  <br>  The decal will also be orange, Kyleigh's favorite color.<br>  <br>  <br>  Non descriptive, not obvious to the general public<<<<So no one can really notice just the people who need to notice Like the cops and law enforcement....Your a child of course u dont agree but one day u will realize it will save ur life and people u care abouts lives!!!
eL5P3eIPaa	I would suggest taking a pregnancy test, first and foremost.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who got her period for 3 months (light but it was still a period) before she knew she was pregnant. <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test. More then one if you have too. <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out for you.

It will be more difficult and may take longer to conceive, but having a ectopic once puts you at risk for having another one, and that isn't fair to you or the baby.|`|45xNJ7Ncaa	Cyst can cause hormone imbalances but not an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are usually do to scare tissue or blockage in the tube.  The best way to see if that is the case is to have an hsg.<br>  Depending on the type of cyst, depends on the outcome.  A functional cyst (which is just a follicular sac which failed to release an egg) tends to resolve itself without treatment but bcp can sometimes make them disappear faster.<br>  Some cyst requirement treatment.<br>  Any cyst will interfere with progesterone and cause the lining to not thicken or shed properly.  The reason is that the follicular (a sac filled with fluid and nourished the growing egg) collapses once the egg is ovulated and it produces progesterone.  This collapsed sac supports the progesterone levels for 10 or more days.  If no pregnancy occurs within 10 days, the sac deteriorates and within days, the levels drop along with estrogen and the lining is shed.  If an egg is not ovulated, there's no collapsed follicular to send out proper messages to the brain, uterus and ovaries.  <br>  I would suggest talking to your ob/gyn to see if anything can be done about the cyst.

6qCnpxrNaa	Do you feel your abdomen getting hard when you have these pains?  Are you leaking any fluid?  If you're not sure they can do a simple test at the hospital for it, they just swab you really quick and that's it and then they can see if there is any amniotic fluid in it or not.  I wouldn't go to the ER unless you think you're leaking fluid, the pain is unbearable and/or/also can't reach your doctor by phone.  Most of the time they don't want you to go unless you live far away and can't take the chance of not making it in time.  If you live close by or within a reasonable traveling distance they'll want you to wait until you can hardly talk through the contractions.  I know how gross it feels, I never thought of using that word before but yeah...it fits.  I had my son (first child) about three weeks ago.  I was in labor three days but couldn't dilate past 8 cm.  My water had been broken long enough that it was dangerous to wait any longer so I had a C Section (oh man, pray you do this naturally).  Not that it's unbearable it's just that it's major surgery and I've needed (and gotten, God Bless my husband and my mom) lots and lots of help to get around and in caring for my son.  Good Luck to you dear!  It's all worth it when they put that precious little one into your arms.  Oh man, that's just the best thing ever!|`|YOrRafZoaa	is this your first baby? Is your tummy getting really hard at times, and then softening up? If it is, then those are contractions and you should start timing them. <br>  One thing i would do when i was pregnant and started having contractions was to change what i was doing. For example, if i was active, then i would lay down and see if it stopped. Also, if you are not being active, then take a walk or something. If this makes it stop, then it's just false labor. Your body will go through this to prepare you for the real thing.<br>  Best of luck to you with the new little one.|`|tdFFU4rOaa	It can go on for a while like that when it's your first baby.

By the time I went into labour I was exhausted from lack of sleep.  Rest as much as you can and get hubby to give you lots of massages to ease the back pain, I found that a hot water bottle helped a lot.  Warm baths (I was taking 4 or 5 a day LOL) relax all the muscles and ease the cramping.  I hope you go soon I reallly do know how miserable you must be feeling right now, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you hun xx
6qCnpxrNaa	Switch to ice chips dear and call the doctor.

TanepNjdaa	In order to get pregnant, a sperm must meet and fertilize an egg, so any factors that affect this also affect your fertility. These include: the timing of ovulation, how long the egg lasts, whether there are any sperm present and how long sperm can live inside you.<br>  <br>  Women who have regular periods can easily calculate when ovulation occurs. Ovulation almost always happens 14 days before you expect your period. For a woman who has 28 day cycles, that would be in the exact middle of the cycle, 14 days after the last period and 14 days before the next one. Women who have 30 day cycles can expect to ovulate 16 days after the last period, which is 14 days before the next one.<br>  <br>  Women who have irregular cycles cannot predict when they will ovulate. In retrospect, they can calculate that ovulation occurred 14 days before a period, but that does not help in planning a pregnancy. Women with very irregular cycles may need to use ovulation predictor kits to determine when they will ovulate. Ovulation predictor kits detect the rise in hormones that occurs before the egg is released.<br>  <br>  It is not necessary to time intercourse to coincide with ovulation. That’s because both the sperm and the egg can live inside you for a while. The egg can last approximately 24 hours after ovulation. If sperm are available anytime during this 24 hour window, you can get pregnant. You don’t have to have sex within the 24 hour window, though. That’s because sperm can live inside you for days, waiting for the egg to be released. You can get pregnant by having intercourse anywhere from several days before ovulation to a day after ovulation.<br>  <br>  For example, if you ovulate on day 14 (counting the first day of your period as day 1), you can get pregnant by having sex anytime between days 9-15, and perhaps days 8 and 16 as well. Conception will take place on day 14 or so, but you may have had sex many days before conception.<br>  <br>  The bottom line: You don’t have to time sex to coincide with ovulation. If you have sex at anytime within days of ovulation, you can get pregnant|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Yeah I suppose it is possible.  However if you are TTC, I would have sex the 1st and 3rd.  Yes sperm can live up to 3 days.  But with every single person that is different.  You need good mucus for them to live in and your husband needs to have sperm that can live that long.  Some males' sperm can only live 12 hours.<br>  Best of luck!!!|`|stRWElvPaa	hmm. Luteal phase (from ovulation to period) is nearly always between 12-16 days before period. So lets be on the safe side and say that you will ovulate around day 14 of your cycle. In the best cervical mucus conditions, the sperm can live for up to 3 days, so if you have sex on cycle day 10,12,14,16 you should definitely cover your fertile period. <br>    I hope this helps.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Don't go by those online charts.  They just tell you according to a 14 day Luteal phase what day the average person would ovulate on.  It could be wrong for you.  Every women is different.  I have a 28-30 day cycle and I Ovulate around day 12-13.  So that's early.  That means my fertile time begins when my period is ending.<br>  <br>  Your fertile time starts 7 days before you ovulate, sperm can live inside you for 7 days.
6WdgA94Qaa	You should have used some type of contraception unless you are trying to get pregnant. So you could be if you didn't use anything. The possibility is great. Sorry if that isn't what you wanted to hear.|`|v0z5Nyypaa	You will have to wait it out and see.  It is possible that you are pregnant, but try not to worry too much about it.  The chances of getting pregnant right before ovulating are high, because you are more fertile. If you are not pregnant, and don't want to get pregnant, you can go on birth control.|`|kt89NRWvaa	No, you shouldn't be sorry...(previous answer) I completely agree! If you don't want to get pregnant ANY TIME OF THE MONTH, you should use some type of contraceptive. I honestly hope for the sake of all that is good that you are NOT pregnant. Some people just should not breed!|`|pqzKlNudaa	Go get Plan B.
aaZ0cTdCaa	I don't care for Jenny...<br>  But I love the boy name Isiah!!|`|3d1XRIzkaa	those are very cute names. I like Jenny for a girl. And Isiah is a very nice boy's name.|`|cErLq7f3aa	i love Jenny, but that's the only one.|`|FoBLX9ceaa	yes im not that crazy about jenny either prolly cause i go to school with like five of them|`|jtjISk6qaa	pretty nice, but im not too crazy over the name Jenny. <br>  <br>  i love the name Isiah|`|2pQUMKb2aa	LOve em|`|SO2oRloEaa	Girl: Guinevere Elaine or Margo Anneliese or Dawson Avery<br>  Boy: Arthur Edmond or Christopher Adam<br>  <br>  Jenny is too common for my taste, but maybe you could switch it up to:<br>  Jennifer Serene or maybe even Jennifer Serenity|`|eznL5Zwvaa	I like them just fine.|`|o37i9Nazaa	Yeah there both nice.|`|fySPUUy9aa	like the girl onee.
Y2fr8jp8aa	it is very difficult to predict that way<br>  only a gynecologist can tell|`|55b85d860ba36374ca31c5119817a7b2aa	that was my first sign that i was pregnant (though i didnt know i was pregnant yet and had no idea that it was my first sign!)..goodluck|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Yes its posible to get pregnant whenever you have unprotected sex|`|AA12228565	Is it possible you could have mis judged your ovulation days and now the spotting could be implantation bleeding?
TQW5E6olaa	I'm too sensitive, so yeah, I do let other people's opinions bother me. Not enough to rule my life, but enough to bring me down for a few minutes.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'll honestly listen to what people may have to say but do I really care what others think of me? No ( so I'm answering no to the first 5 questions).<br>  <br>  I will teach my little ones to be accepting and open of everyones opinions. I want them to be exposed to different types of views so they are more aware that there isn't only one specific way to do something.|`|j2mRop0laa	I only care if I value the persons opinion. I also like to make good impressions of myself when I meet people. If I am putting my true self out there or my opinions and beliefs and they judge me negatively, I really don't care.<br>  Same with parenting. Yes, I put my best foot forward and like when people see me in a positive light but I won't change who I am to please someone.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I don't care, I know what I'm doing and I have two happy, healthy, and well adjusted kids to show for it. The topper is other parents I know ask for advice.|`|AA10424047	No. I don't wear makeup, for example, because I feel that people should like me for who I am, not who I am with a mask.<br>  <br>  Of my parenting, absolutely not. They can parent how they want to, and I'll parent my way.<br>  <br>  Some opinions of my children are laughable. Apparently my son is comparable to Dan Connor from Roseanne. My kids are adorable, fun, loving, and well-behaved.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter. The only opinions that matter are mine and my husband's.<br>  <br>  How will I teach them? That's a tough one. I haven't really thought about that one. Let me get back to you.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Well generally I don't care but my son is a true red-head and during the christmas service at the school I heard an ignorant man behind me saying 'oh my god look at that ginger kid' his partner then said 'what's wrong with him' and he said 'what's right with him, he's ginger'. I could literally hear his partners 'shut ups' because her daughter is in my sons class so she knew I was sat in front of them. Things like that really annoy me because really it's just as bad as being racist. Other than ignorant people like him then I have no other worry about what others think.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I only care if the person's opinion means something to me or not. Some of my family, i could care less what they think, some I do. Some of the of the people I do, to a certain extent, some i could care less. Strangers... No, i could care less at all.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I try to not let it bother me, but I have the type of personality where I constantly seek approval from others. It's a curse, really. Real life is more, but on here, I take what others say to heart if I have a lot of respect for them.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I listen and consider it, but it really depends who it is. If its a stranger than i usually say screw them, if its a friend then it definitely effects me cause i think about it.|`|AA12145826	Your opinion is the only one that matters to me!! LoL<br>  <br>  Actually, I take pride in the compliments and ignore most of the negative opinions (they're just jealous anyways, right?)|`|W8UZebRWaa	I really don't. I've been that way my whole life.<br>  Of course I don't want to be hated by everyone but if people don't like me that is their choice.|`|tN2f6vWoaa	some times if it is really mean|`|1VdgsZPoaa	I am long past caring of other opinions of me.  In high school I was the loud-mouthed, over opinionated, against the mainstream girl who always wanted to pick a fight.  My actions ironically got me pregnant, which just made me more the way I was.<br>  <br>  I don't care if people don't like my parenting.  As long as my kids are fed, clothed, loved, and well-mannered, they have no right to tell me how to parent them.<br>  <br>  I do care to an extent about my kids.  I want them to have manners, but I don't care about their looks or personality.  My daughter is on the creative and day-dreamy side.  As long as she isn't upsetting anyone then I just leave her be :)|`|98qMZZPlaa	Honesty~~ Not at all.  Maybe i should somewhat, but i really do not.  And my friends and people in real life know this about me.  You can tell me anything about raising my kids, and i will pay you no mind at all to you.<br>  <br>  By the way Stay@home, yes you can me TS.  and have a great weekend!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	I care wayyyyyyy to much, a symptom of PND i think. I worried so much when i first had Charleigh that I would lie to people so they thought i was doing things the "right" way (their way)......I even get upset on here if someone accuses me of being a bad mother.....need to drink some concrete and harden up i think!!!|`|xubIaiZaaa	i think everyone does to a certain extent- I usually listen to a persons opinion and if it makes sence to me then i'll take it on board, but not everyone is right, and i try to take these things with a grain of salt, especially if they are rude and not encouraging|`|kM3t3iDsaa	Meh, my Children I will raise them however I want.<br>  <br>  But I do listen to all opinions, and do take advice, even if it pains me to do so.|`|NpDcDcnPaa	yyyyyyyyyyyyes 2 allllllllllllllllll.|`|lrJopeC5aa	No however I hear people out if they are trying to help.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Of me- no<br>  <br>  My parenting- i use too, im a young mom and i know that alot of people have bad things to say about that. But im a good mom, we arent on welfare ( i dont think its wrong if you needed it, technically we could have it but we dont need it so we arent on it) Ive learned that past my family that is always there for me that i dont care what others have to say. I know im a good parents, i know my daughter is healthy and happy and thats all that matters to me. Ive had some older women ( like in there late 60s) come up to me and yell at me about my daughter because i want a young mom. One told me my daughter was going to hell because shes a bastard child ( im now married to her father but i wasnt when i had her)  <br>  <br>  My children- sometimes if some one says something really rude i normally say something. other wise i ignore it. not every one likes my parenting style and thats ok. they dont need to its how i decided to raise my daughter.<br>  <br>  forgot to answer how ill teach them<br>  <br>  I think because I had her at 19 ill just simply tell her to not tell others my real age or her fathers. She wont lie but its not there business. We act like a normal family who had her at a normal age sept we had her young. About her self i want to teach to be comfortable with herself and to love her self and value what she thinks of her self. Past that no ones opinion matters past the ones shes loves.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I care about my honest opinions of myself.  I'm not so arrogant as not to seriously consider the opinions of the people I respect in considering what a fair opinion of myself really is.<br>  <br>  The opinions of the people I don't respect really don't matter to me.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Of me?  Not really.  I do place value on the opinions of people I respect and value, but other than that, no I really could care less (especially when it's a stranger).<br>  <br>  Of my parenting?  Nope.  The only critics I care about in that department are my kids or my husband and they all think I'm doing well.  If my kids or husband point out something to me that needs pointing out, then I will apply their opinions in an appropriate way.<br>  <br>  Of my children?  Eh, again, not really.  I know that people's opinion of my kids is in a way a direct reflection on what they believe of me, but since my kids are good kids I don't care if people think otherwise.  I know differently :)<br>  <br>  Even if it's my mom or my dad or my aunt or my dog (lol), I don't care what their opinions of me, my family or my parenting are because my husband and my kids tell me I'm doing just fine.<br>  <br>  I'm going to teach my kids to to look at the facts when it comes to people's opinions of them.  If it's not true, then brush it off.  If you can learn from it and draw something good out of the opinion, the apply it where needed.
b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Well, I cannot give you an opinion on the Voyager, considering I haven't used one nor do I know anyone that has one, but I can give you some insight on the Blackberry Pearl, which my friend has.<br>  <br>  He says it's very useful for writing down notes to self, saving prior text messages, going on the internet and AIM, and the keypad is very easy to use. Buena suerte!|`|HOdblqIkaa	I have a blackberry pearl and I love it. I've become a fan of the curve recently but anything blackberry I have never had a problem with. The screens haven't gone out, the buttons all work, I get internet access super fast, the only thing I wasn't big on at first is the scroll ball because sometimes it moves too slow or fast.

um29wkUPaa	No offense, the reason nobody is answering this is because it gets asked several times a day, and has become the height of anger for some people here.  Lots of opinionated people.<br>  <br>  I dont mean anything by that.  I just didn't want you to think you were being ignored.<br>  <br>  My opnion is as follows: "Whew, glad it aint  me."  That's pretty much where it ends for me.  I think she realizes how much she bit off and hopes she gets/affords the assistance she needs.  Raising children well is hard work, I can't imagine doing a good job alone with so many children.

Ask him out ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|HkpMrMepaa	I think he likes you!!<br>  <br>  If you like him get your flirt on!!<br>  <br>  Flirt with him a little bit but not too much.

I know there's nothing more boring than a personal story of my own, so I won't go into detail about my life, but my guy friend and I used to talk all day and into 3:00 in the morning. And later, he confessed that he liked me. (: But now, he ignores me, so I dunno lol.<br>  <br>  But yeah, he's being obvious about liking you too. If you like him back, drop hints expressing your feelings for him. He might take a while to catch on, but if you return the flirts, he'll ask you out sooner or later.|`|sCL6b362aa	there are two options.<br>  <br>  A) he's a total jerk and is leading you on<br>  B) he really truly likes you and there's no other way around it.<br>  <br>  i don't know you and i don't know the guy, but personally, i think option B is much more reasonable! :)<br>  <br>  good luck, sweetie.|`|0N5nKs5Xaa	ya and go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!111111|`|iT5vnplHaa	he really truely likes u. say yes if he asks

How can people even call that a party? It sounds like a whole lot of dirty trash. And people are gonna end up screwed up. <br>  I'm not sure about you but thats not the kinda environment I want to be in. <br>  <br>  Real parties involve dancing, pop drinks, junk food and talking. Not all the things that ruin your body and possibly LIFE. <br>  <br>  You're only 14. Please look into your inner sense. <br>  If you choose to avoid that kind of lifestyle then you will end up more successful and in shape than those other kids (that will be screwed up in the end).|`|aYcdbSiDaa	No. Its better that you dont. <br>  You may think things are going to be alright, but you can always get yourself caught in awkward situations.

And if peope complain you didnt go, then just say that you didnt feel well or you had better plans to than to watch people have sex and get wasted.|`|hUtftU2Vaa	as much as i like to drink and smoke, trusting a party of 14 year olds with alcohol is not too smart. there going to be loud and obnxious and things r going to go out of hand and the cops r going to be called. young teens are not to smart or careful about these sort of things|`|AA11296427	Trust me, you are not missing out.

As a mom of an almost 14 year old boy, I'd just about die if he went to a party like this. It's my job (and his dad's) to protect him from these kinds of parties and influences. Listen to your mom! You are wayyy too young to be involved in this kind of activity. Save it for your twenties!! And I'd encourage your mom to call the parents and clue them in.

tlIlmTs2aa	First of all, I am saddened you are having to cope with so much and on your own.   You have had a lot of sound advice from lots of people so far but would like to add some of my own thoughts if I may.<br>  <br>  May I urge you please see your doctor.  Before you go, write down all  those issues you need to raise with the GP - miscarriage, two children, your fiance's departure (he too must be mourning the loss of your child so will need some help himself too) and any other emotions.   Having a baby is an emotional time in itself without the baby dying as well.<br>  <br>  If you have a family, involve them and ask for their support, encouragement and any practical help they can give you.  They too will be feeling pain for the loss of their grand-child.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor to refer you to local organisations to assist you with your grief and quite possibly depression.  Here in the UK, there is an organisation called Homestart for parents with children under the age of 5 who can provide support - not household duties or child-minding but practical advice and just general support - which you can either seek out for yourself or perhaps your Social Worker.  Again ask your doctor to refer you.   There is no stigma associated with this - they are trained to help and guide you at this particular time.<br>  <br>  Spend some time with your other children because, like you, they will be feeling hurt from the loss of their sibling.  There is bound to be a lot of crying at the present time but this is perfectly natural and normal so allow the tears to fall.  Then talk with your children, explain how you are feeling and ask them to talk to you too.  <br>  <br>  Try not to shut them away from your grief so share with them how you are feeling and allow them to tell you how they are feeling too.   In this way, you will all be united and not afraid to voice or show your grief to one another.   It is important to ask for help and take up any suggestion of a practical and positive way that will help all of you.<br>  <br>  Being on your own is no bad thing.   Yes, it is tough especially when money is tight but in today's society, there are many families all struggling.   However, you may surprise yourself at just how resilient you are once you have your life under a bit more control.   Budget, eat sensibly, get plenty of rest and sleep and as one of the answers suggest, turn to God and ask Jesus to help you.   <br>  <br>  So....... go to your doctor, enlist the practical help and support of your own family and perhaps your fiance's family too if you are on good terms wth them, ask for referrals to whatever agencies there are in your locality via your doctor, talk to your children, look out for other organisations there may be both nationally and locally, grieve for your dead child, take one day at a time, be gentle with yourself and your two children and you will get there.   <br>  <br>  Once you feel you are getting your life back into focus, make a pact with yourself to be positive and constructive in word, thought and deed, then find courage and determination from deep down inside and then move on.   I did this many years ago now when faced with a future without a husband but with two small children under five.  Yes it was frightening but when you find yourself totally responsible for your children and yourself, you may surprise yourself at how well you are doing.   My boys are now grown men and doing well - I am very proud of them.   You too can do this and even more.   <br>  <br>  Never be afraid to ask for help so give it a try.  Best of luck in all that you do and I will be praying for you and your children that you will you will come away from this particular time in your life a wiser, more tolerant and worthwhile human being for this experience.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You're allowed to morn the loss of a pregnancy, sadness is okay and expected.<br>  <br>  But you can not neglect your living children - it's not fair to them.   Allow yourself time to mourn, but also take care of your kids at the same time - I had to do so (miscarried Jan 20th with two living kids), it can be done.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'm sorry. Have you tried talking to someone, like a counselor? You can always seek professional help when it comes to things like this. I wish you the best of luck.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Hun of course your gonna be upset but you should still be thankful for the children that you do have because they love you no matter what and i'm sure if you tell them they will support you. Also ring your ex and I know that's the last thing that you want to do but if it was his baby i'm sure he wants to know no-matter how much he says he doesn't then remember he must care it's HIS lost child as well as yours|`|rBq189W1aa	You can stop neglecting them, is what you can do. I'm sorry your life's crappy at the moment, but your kids shouldn't have to suffer because of that.

Contact your GP to discuss berevment and loss councelling talking therapy.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Focus on the ones you do have put your energy in that, do some fun things to take away the sadness.|`|MMx7TeEBaa	Sorry to hear you had a miscarriage i know it must be really hard but you really do need to be strong for your children, as it is not there fault and they may not understand.<br>  My mam had 2 miscarriages and she stayed in bed for a couple of days but then got up and got on with things because she didn't want to let us down. <br>  You maybe should go to your doctor and ask for counselling, or talk to someone.<br>  I had a stillbirth at full-term and i found it hard to cope because i never saw myself at 20 planning my first baby daughter funeral but i stayed strong because i could see my family were also hurting and worrying about me, and it hurt me seeing them like that.

I am so sorry. I feel your pain. My parents just recently died in a car crash and I am taking care of my 13 year old sister, 9 year old brother, and 4 year old brother. My gf is pregnant too. Don't worry. Think positive. Hope that you wont have a miscarriage. As for your children, try to spend some time with them. Tell them you love them and if you do have this baby (hope you do) that you'll still love them no matter how much you pay more attention to the new baby. Tell them you might have your hands full because a baby is a lot of work when it is first born. Good luck!|`|txv7TIgiaa	are you depressed? go to the doctors you might need to go onto some medication for a while ... just try to spend more time with your family and be happy a miscarriage could not have been your fault it just happens sometimes, you can start trying again right away they say....|`|1sd8GcxCaa	I don't know if you're religious or spiritual but if you are look to your believed higher power.

aLAmvX5Naa	Its not your fault you were raped but its not the baby's fault either. Killing the baby won't change what the man did to you. Killing the baby won't give you power. Killing the baby won't undo the rape.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	only one citcumstance? what about medical reasons? you would rather mother die? I agree with abortion for rape and those who say just have it and give it up for adoption have obviously never been raped because its not that easy<br>  <br>  i got a medical abortion when i was 16 and was raped when i was 18 which resulted in a pregnancy, i could not go though another abortion but i really wanted to, I had the thing and put it up for adoption and it was the longest, and worst 9 months of my life. I hated that child ever second and every day of my pregnancy i prayed i would miscarry, and really hope the thing never tries to find me when its 18.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	wither you want to convince yourself that rape is rare or isn't happening try watching the news every now and again. 44% of all women raped are under the age of 18 and 15% are under the age of 12. that's not rare and a very bad thing. that's why abortions are legal. if it was murder it would be deal with that it's a well known fact. your not killing a baby it kills a little blob of cells that is not legally considered a person because i can't survive on its own. it however is stressing the life of a real legal person that can survive on their own.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	please stop posting questions like this. not just you, but everyone.. PLEASE. its making people annoyed and youre  not changing anyones opinions. thank you.<br>  <br>  yeah, well its only going to start an internet fight, which is the dumbest thing EVER. if you really wanted peoples answers you could look at the other questions JUST LIKE THIS ONE.|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I think abortion would be the best option, only if rape occured. I can assure you that having the baby of the person that raped me would tragically affect me for the rest of my life...don't want to share my genes with that person!|`|0xiHNsmVaa	Only like 1 percent of abortions are due to rape.|`|UfhE3k1baa	I am also a democrat and pro-life. I really don't like abortion, and I hate that people use it as a form of birth control. I think adoption is almost always a better option, but I can push aside my own beliefs and ideas of what is right for ME to understand a few things. Women who are raped were not given the choice to use protection, women who are already mothers have a right to be afraid if their pregnancy could kill them and take them away from their children. Women who are pregnant with a child with some illness or abnormality that will not allow the baby to make it to full term alive or through the birthing process, I am sure it is much worse to carry a baby until it passes away from whatever it has. I understand why those things would make someone think about it and I do not judge them for that. I have never been raped, hurt, or told my baby would die or could kill me, so I don't feel like I am in a position to judge anyone. Until you walk a mile in someones shoes....<br>  I think what people need to remember about abortion is it is a personal choice you make for yourself, not something you can make for someone else. You shouldn't force your beliefs onto anyone, because I am sure you wouldn't appreciate it, if it was done to you. I would never have an abortion, but I will also never stand out front of a clinic with a sign and yell at people and call them names, or spread nasty pictures or videos just to make someone else feel bad about themselves.|`|sjlQj4ihaa	Well I for one fully support a woman's right to choose. I don't think that it is right to try and stop a woman from making a decision that she feels is best for her life. Especially in a rape situation. Those who say that the mother should just put the baby up for adoption obviously don't understand what women may feel. The thought of such a awful man's child inside of you. Of having to spend thousands of dollars to take proper prenatal care and deliver the baby, of having to to be constantly reminded of what happened to you, it's awful.<br>  If you don't believe in abortion, that's okay, no one will ever make you have an abortion, you can choose to to do with the child what you will. But to pass legislation against it is forcing your own moral believes on others and forcing them into unfair situations that you will not have to deal with, that you have no part in. It's not your right to say what is best for every one, and it is not your right to condemn them because they disagree with you.|`|DkO1hedOaa	Look, no one likes abortion. But my problem comes when other people decide that its their right to me what to do with my body and my life. I think that abortion is a horrible way to go, but I will not pretend to understand why women turn to this option. It's their choice.<br>  On the subject of rape especially, I think it's ridiculous to expect anyone to want to keep that baby. If someone took advantage of me, I would not want to give up 9 months of my life to develop a child that would only bring up horrible memories. But once again, it is not mine, or anyone's place to try and make a decision for women.|`|KcglcvYXaa	I don't believe in abortion at all. Even with the rape circumstance because I wouldn't ask a 12 year old to raise the child but at least let it be adopted and LIVE. That's my arguement. the only circumstance is if the baby wil die no matter what and it will kill the mother.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	what about for medical reasons if the pregnancy will kill u or the baby heart is beating but has not developed something it would need to live eg most to the brain and yes that has happened would u want to carry that baby to full term just to watch it die ?|`|9mLGFqdxaa	im against abortion. if a girl was raped and got pregnant, i think they should just put the baby up for adoption. its wrong to kill an innocent baby.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	This is one extremely annoying argument.|`|0N5nKs5Xaa	NNNNOOOOOOOOOO i would consider maybe adoption but don't kill the babybefore it got a chance to live!!!!!!!!!!!!!! atlst give it the gift of life

pSkPC3sbaa	Yes.I like it|`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	Yes.
GHnkKwl3aa	Aw. I read your answer and didn't answer your question, then just saw your boyfriend's question (he referenced your question) and my heart broke.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him in person about this. He probably really truly loves you and wants to do everything he can to support you and your child.<br>  <br>  In this case, I don't think it's too young to get married. If you two are truly and irrevocably in love and want to get married and have a child on the way, I think it's an okay time to get married.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Just think about how you feel, how you thinks he feels, feelings towards each other before the baby, and how things have changed. You don't have to say yes or no, if he really wants to be with you he will still want to marry you after the baby. Personally I think 17 is too young to be married but engagements can last for years, just because you get engaged doesn't mean you have to begin planning a wedding right away. Look deep into your heart and see what you tell yourself. If you think it was for the wrong reasons then don't rush anything. If he loves you it won't hurt his feelings to have him wait for a while or even ask him what his intentions were. If he was shaking it makes me think he was being sincere, guys don't get nervous when they do something they don't mean.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	here's a good Dr.Phil line.. if its a good idea today, then it will still be a good idea a few years from now.  let him know you love him and are looking forward to this baby and him being the daddy etc but that you want to focus on the life ahead of you right now and would like to wait.  other possibility is to say yes but insist that there is to be a minimum time limit on the engagement, for example until you are both 21 and can legally drink at your own wedding and your child can be a flower girl or ring bearer.|`|3MVv1uOaaa	aweee. that is so cute, he read it and aww. haha sorry, i probably sound like a corny freak. but its cute. congratulations!|`|E8anv8Zzaa	don't do it. your not ready for pregnancy or marriage.|`|EanVzQBQaa	babe i want to marry you cuz i'm in love with you|`|CdJtH0xdaa	If I were you, I'd question him; my girlfriend (who is now my wife) questioned me about why I wanted to marry her. A big reason was because of the baby, but another huge, maybe huger reason was because I knew that I wanted to spend my entire life with her. She is the greatest woman ever. So, I would ask him why he wants to marry you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  It did not hurt my feelings at all. Part of me suspected her to question me, because marriage is a big commitment, and I didn't think that she would want to make that commitment, especially at a young age.|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	talk to him about it and ask him if he's just asking you to marry him because you are pregnant with his child. <br>  <br>  Once you know the truth, go from there. <br>  and if you really want to spend the rest of your life with him, then say yes. <br>  You don't have to get married right away just because your engaged, you could wait years when you get your own place, live together, get the money. <br>  and good luck.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Talk to him and ask him why he proposed to you.<br>  But I do 17 is too young, you're still in high school.<br>  And when people get married too young it doesn't always work. My friend got married at 18 and she got divorced about 5 months later.<br>  So I say wait a couple years(at least finish school) before you get married.|`|zkqMYpRsaa	it is great that he isn't scared and looking to leave... raising a baby is much easier with   2 parents... good luck :)<br>  <br>  btw:<br>  <br>  You may be interested in this: This is completely FREE to do and helps me pay some bills each month:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxYwrP-IBs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxYwrP-I...</a><br>  <br>  This short video will teach you step by step how to earn money online.

I don't think it's too young. It'll be hard, but hopefully worth it.|`|18wq5yaRaa	looks like he is caring.|`|cnssh7v3aa	Well im 17 also, <br>  i was engaged when i was 16 and 6 months after i was engaged, i found out i was pregnant. 3 months after that we got married :)  I also asked him why he wanted to marry me, right after the baby, and he said the only reason why he was holding off was for a big wedding in the summer! But now we wouldnt have money for that, so he just really wanted to be with me! He also said he couldnt picture himself with anyone else for the rest of his life and after a year and half of being togther, i still give him those butterflies that i did on the first night.  He also told me that he cares about me more then himeself, and he would give his life for me :) It was a great answer, he wasnt hurt that i asked, and it really made me more secure!<br>  So as far as being to young, i think that it depends no the maturity of the person. If you really love him, and are really ready to commite, i would say go for it!! <br>  I love my husband very much, and getting married to him was one of the best days of my life so far!! <br>  Its going to be hard, but its worth it. <br>  To me it sounds like your boyfriend really does love you! He stuck around when he could have easlily left you, and you say youve had a great realshonship before so theirs nothing much to question. <br>  Sit down with him and say why do you want to marry me, if you like his answer go from there!! He wont be hurt, hell understand that you need to be reassured!!<br>  I wish you all the best of luck, me and you should chat were in the same boat :) <br>  <br>  Good luck hun, follow your heart and you cant go wrong!!

Pois como já fazes uso dos mesmos  a mais de um ano o efeito do remédio dura mais um mês no organismo sendo eliminado.  N?o que isto impe?a alguém de engravidar, mais provavelmente n?o deve ser o seu caso,   mais acompanhe isto de perto caso ainda tenhas dúvidas compre um teste de farmácia.  Caso dê positivo corra para o seu ginecologista ele orientará no sentido amplo da coisa em si !|`|CybvZCscaa	N?o sei aonde vcs moram, mas aqui em SP 1500 pilas n?o da nem pro come?o de uma familia.<br>  <br>  N?o sei nada em rela?ao q poder engravidar ou n?o mas se vcs se amam e por acaso acontecer, boa sorte =D<br>  <br>  bjao|`|T6Oogw9kaa	N?o fa?a o teste de farmácia. Após o atraso acontecer (se acontecer) fa?a um exame laboratorial, de sangue. Dando positivo significa gravidez, dando negativo e n?o menstruando, precisa ser repetido após 10 dias. Algumas vezes o exame demora a positivar. N?o fique ansiosa, pois atrapalha. A gravidez tanto pode ocorrer logo como pode demorar até um ano, normalmente. Só achamos que existe possibilidade de  problemas após um ano de tentativas.

SnQvsOPwaa	I was going to skip this but Ollie your way off base. There is no way to prove it unless the mothers on drugs or something. As long as children have either a mother or father in their lives. That loves them and takes care of them they will be fine.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Go to court and file for joint custody.If you are fit, you will more than likely be granted.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I don't know that mothers are always naturally the best parents for a kid, regardless of whether the kid's a boy or a girl (and I'm a mom myself). I mean, you see lots of single moms raising sons and while there's an acknowledgement that you might want to find good male role models, it's not like the courts automatically award custody of boy children to their dads and girl children to moms.<br>  Look, my daughter's father and I don't live together but I try not to badmouth him to her because....that's her dad!  If your daughter's mother is threatening you and has a quick temper, plus has tried to commit suicide, I think you may have a case that her time and energy should be devoted to taking care of herself not taking care of your daughter.  Please document these behaviors and be willing to back them up with witnesses if you have any.  Courts do tend to award custody to the moms but I think you have a case.|`|CFFuFof1aa	I definitely agree with Ollie on this one. Unless the mother is using drugs or his harmful to herself or the baby, then they do want the babies to be with the mother. A child that young needs to be with her mother, yes she needs to be with the father too, but more so with her mother. This is the hard part of divorce or split families. Now if she neglects, harms your daughter, or uses drugs, then get you a lawyer and follow their advice. If the mother is doing that, the baby needs to be with you.|`|aJYyRVQhaa	What is the other parent doing, because unless it is SERIOUSLY bad than it is best for the baby to be with her mother. When you separate a baby from the mother before the age of 3 many children will have attachment disorder.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Does the mother have drug problems, has cut herself, attempted suicide, things of this nature, if you can provide a home for the daughter and take care of her.  I am not sure how you can prove it unless the mother has documented problems
0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	I am a co-sleeper and I have left the decision up to my daughter who is four she isn't ready to sleep on her own yet but when she is she has a bed right next to mine she slept in it the first night for a few hours so I think we are making progress. I think it is fine for them to decide when they are ready.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I have a 3-year-old and I co-slept. she still is in my bed and refuses to sleep in hers.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	the First few weeks i had baby next to me all night as i loved him so much i couldn't let go. <br>  <br>  my 1st son started spending nights next to the bed then by 6 months was in his own room. <br>  <br>  my 2nd son, same thing but is only 5 month now and i do admit he is in the bed more often because his daddy is deployed and i want him next to me. i also breast fed him so i tend to fall asleep with him eating at night. <br>  <br>  once you make the choice you need to be firm. if the child is older you need to explain the reasons why. then make it happen. no they are not going to like it but it has to happen some day. you don't want teenagers in your bed.|`|1485ed10658f5fff9f00587d44259041aa	My son slept with us until he was 3.  We tried to move him into his own room and bed at 2, bought a twin sized bed with a rail.  I'd lay in there with him and let him play with my hair until he fell asleep and my husband would do it some nights.  We'd try to sneak out but any little noise would wake him.  If we did escape, he'd wake several hours later and cry for us.  Then one night I checked on him and he had a high fever, and I realized we all weren't ready, and if he had been sleeping with me I'd have felt his fever sooner.  <br>  <br>  At 3 years old, we went shopping for a cool new bunk bed.  He very easily moved into his bed on his own.  Within 2 months he went through so many changes and grew up so fast...moved to his own bed, potty trained, gave up his pacifier, and started going to daycare.  Now he's 6 and would love to sleep with us like his baby sister does, but he sleeps well in his own bed.  I kind of want the baby to move to her room soon though, so I'm interested in responses!|`|Cah6nfV5aa	I put my daughter into her own bed at 6 months. It took 2 days of crying to get her used to it. I would put her to bed and she would cry. the first time go in after 5 mins, then wait 10 then wait 15 and every time after that 15 mins. It was really easy and now she fine when I put her to sleep. Good Luck.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	my son is 2 co0sleeper baby still in our bed fighting if we try to get him to sleep on his own.. today took him 3hours to fall asleep im so tired of the fighting with him yea it doesnt help that he doesnt have his own bed but we r working on that if u can get ur co-sleeper out asap!|`|wK4kqhHkaa	my daughter co slept for the first 7weeks.  I had a crib next to the bed but she didn't like it- wouldn't settle.  I found her sleeping in bed with me was easier in regards to feeding and she would settle easily.  I didn't sleep very well, everytime she'd stir i would wake up. At 8 weeks i found that my husband and i moving around would disturb her sleep and we were ready to have our bed back, so i decided it was time to go into her own bed and her own room.  I didn't have any problems with the transition- actually she slept better.  So i guess it was the right time.|`|vKG6qO2Zaa	my daughter slept with us in our bed and took over when she sleeps with us but she sleeps in her crib as well. She 7months old now and has been a wonderful baby that sleeps all night after she was 3 months old. Til this day she sleeps in her crib at night and in the morning around 5am she wakes up hungry and sleeps with us until its time to get up and go to work. She didnt give any trouble so i am glad shes not a fussy baby. We had a routine schedule and stuck to it since she was born. Every now and now i want her to sleep with us and she does but then we place her in her crib to sleep better since she moves around alot and doesnt like to be cover up so i put on some warm cozy clothes at night.|`|7fog5OKfaa	Well with my 1st he was 15 months old and it was my choice. He fought me all the way!! It took 8 more months before I could lay him down and walk out. With my next two the have slept in their beds but in my room. The transition was much easier to their own room that way.

When she's older, we'll get mylar balloons (the shiny ones) for occasions when we want balloons.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Yes, my daughter loves balloons.  She is 9 and she draws faces on them, plays with them, calls them her pets and names them, and carries them around on a string until they pop or deflate, then she has a little funeral for them and invites all her other balloon friends.  Honestly, sometimes she worries me, but she is a funny one!|`|bo4MguzVaa	Not usually.

CdJtH0xdaa	It's ultimately up to you. If you are ready to raise a child, then keep the baby. If you are not ready to raise a child yourself, then give the baby up for adoption.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i am 20 and i live with my mom, and i have my one year old. its your baby do what you want.|`|VmuLzz0Waa	Move out sorry but don't do that god gave you that baby for a reason don't let them take that from you think about it don't do it take care of whats your's baby girl don't let anyone take what's yours.|`|QnNUo7diaa	just do what you think is fair for the baby<br>  like if you know you cant support it and give it everything it needs, then give the baby a good chance in life by giving it to a family that can give him/ her what they need<br>  if you think you can handle it, keep it. your mom you know whats best.<br>  But if you do decide to put the baby up for adoption, just do what Juno did and meet the the family who would be adopting your baby and make sure you approve of them<br>  good luck =]|`|vGxipYJnaa	Do whatever you want. Your parents are probably worried that they'll be stuck raising your child - it's a valid concern. They had their kids and now they're grown up and it's your parent's time to relax again. <br>  <br>  If you want to keep the child, then you have to figure out how to support him/her.|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Well, do YOU want to give your child up for adoption? If you don't, then I suggest you find a job, take college courses, and move out right away. If you still want to live with your parents, then I suggest you respect their wishes.<br>  <br>  It's your choice in the end.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Adoption might be the better choice for you and the baby.<br>  <br>  I think that would a very difficult but wonderful choice.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	They have no say in the matter, even if you're living with them. Its your baby, only you and the father have a say in whether you give up the child or not.<br>  I don't know them but you have to be prepared for the possibility of them kicking you out if you choose to have the baby. Still, that is not enough reason to give it up. There are plenty of governmental programs that can help you. It would be difficult but if you want to keep this baby, you can and should.|`|XrC5x3gtaa	well you are 20, not 12, and it is your decision.  yes you may live under their roof, but you need to do what you want.  You are old enought to make your own decisions.  do you have a job? income?  If you want to keep the baby there is help out there for you. Good luck and do what you want, not what someone else wants you to do.  Remember you are the one that has to live with the decision|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	It's your choice and what YOU want to do. <br>  Figure out what you want, and if you could really go with adoption after carrying the baby for 9 months. <br>  <br>  Don't do what your parents want you to even if you do live with them.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	your parents can't make you give up your child no matter what the reason is! go to the local Housing Authority and apply for Section 8 and try to move out on your own. where's the baby's father? maybe he could help you out for a while.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	what do u want to do ?<br>  u not told us how u fell if u want this baby then keep it but if u don't then a couple how have the time and money will love this baby to bits and it nothing to fell guilty about|`|iIiRVexbaa	If you are not emotionally or financially prepared to care for the child on your own, you must do what is right for the baby.|`|1XX30GNVaa	if you want to give it up for adoption, thats fine. But make sure that it's your choice not your parents! =]|`|Qhyovyj8aa	That's a choice that you need to make on your own. No one on here can tell you to put your baby up for adoption, neither can your parents. If you don't feel like you can handle the kid, maybe adoption would be a good choice for you.|`|dRPblFRfaa	It's your choice...at 20 u can move out and make your own choices|`|cdAQZJGpaa	what ever u want to!
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Institute the one, two three rule. Count to the child giving her the chance to change her behavior ( saying 1, 2, 3 to her) if you get to three the consequence should be swift and consistent. For a first offense I do the corner for however minutes old they are (5 minutes in your case), the second offense (if they insist on doing the same thing you just counted for) double the amount of time in the corner. Third offense gets their pants pulled down (some children just laugh it off if you spank them through their clothes) and however many swats old they are and then they get a nap. If she won't stay in the corner stand behind her with your hands on her shoulders keeping her there until she learns she needs to stay there. Don't let her have fun in time out, it's not a place for fun. Remember to set a timer (on the microwave is good) so you can be consistent about the time, it's too easy to forget and leave them there or not leave them there long enough. Even if you can't get your boyfriend to participate with you, you need to be consistent and take charge of her. Don't let her run to her daddy if she isn't minding you, tell him she didn't mind you and you are going to discipline her for it. Remember not to be mean about it just matter of fact, stay cool calm and collected while you are doing these things. Discipline comes from the latin word discplina meaning 'to teach'. teach her well and remember consistency is the key to getting any child to mind. You can't expect her fly straight if no guidance is given. All you can do about your boyfriend is prove him wrong by discipling her and getting her behavior to improve. You shouldn't let her tear you two apart by letting her demand his presence for her to sleep. I'm gointo get some thumbs down for this but I don't care, I've seen this tactic work. I'd move the baby back into your room, reverse the door knob to the child's room so you can lock her in for the night; she needs to learn to sleep by herself, she should have learned this as a baby because she didn't you now have to take a hard line about it now. Explain to her that Daddy won't be sleeping with her anymore and she need to learn how to sleep by herself because that's what big girls do. Do this for as long as it takes for her to realize that Daddy isn't coming and she needs to now sleep by herself. If you don't do something drastic about it, it could end up effecting your relationship in fact it already is if he is sleeping with her every night. I hope this helps remember consistency is key.|`|AA10943329	tell him you want to do a parenting course together that will benefit the raising of both the kids. That way in the group setting he can hopefully realise that it is a problem|`|f17af46bdaf6cbc8a29dc6ea5a56b808aa	Get your glock and shoot his ***.<br>  Then hit him across the face with a cookie sheet.<br>  then mabye you should slap him across the face.... <br>  then drown him in his own ****|`|XrC5x3gtaa	NANNY 911|`|sB5dyaczaa	This kid deserves a good spanking. Discipline her yourself then if he won't do it.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	I'm assuming that this little girl lives with you Does she see her Mum? maybe she's acting this way because she's had a lot of upheaval in her short life. Don't get me wrong 3 yr old can be little terrors esp if they aren't given any boundaries I agree with you when you say that you & your B/F need to present a united front Also she might be reacting to the arrival of her half brother or was she like this previously I think you need to look at the big picture & look for ways to improve your Situation through Parenting Classes for both of you & definitely Counselling for your Family|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I think you should do as nancy says and try to take a parenting course with him.  You can tell him that it is causing some stress for the both of you and you want to go with him as a way to figure things out with him, that way you both can be in a healthier place and mindset.
bkgBLjuvaa	he was probably just being silly !|`|nBNzYDpLaa	I think you should start hanging out with him more, get to know him. Good luck :)|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I don't think he's joking. If he's not the type of person to say "I love you", then I'm sure he means it. Although it is odd that he ignores you at school, maybe he's just shy or unsure of starting a relationship at this time. Good luck!|`|XLhLC36baa	Not necesarily friends also say i love you but talk to him more and try to find out. =]|`|U1NGMjCIaa	HE HAS THE HOT'S 4 U|`|vR6AwIppaa	damnnn girl are u blind??|`|ZAppRn5Faa	mabye he likes you, but i dont think he was serious when he said i loved you. i dont think he meant it as a joke necessarily more of like he didnt know what to say to that so he just kind of said it back sort of thing. talk to him a bit more and be kind of flirty but dont make yourself sound desperate or easy and bamm someones gonna be your new boyfriendd :) good luckk|`|esl9OF11aa	HE LIKE'S YOU MORON!!!!!!!!!!|`|FkB3jQzWaa	i tink he likes u
AA11296427	Post it in Pregnancy and Parenting, Not in Adolescent. Way too many teens are getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|6ITgXvBWaa	Why is this in the adolescents section? <br>  <br>  I dont think 11-16 year olds can give you much advise about this.|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	I agree with the first answerer; you've probably lost a lot of your fertility. I would suggest checking in with a fertility specialist and they could recommend options for having a baby, such as invitro fertilization and other methods that I don't know about.<br>  <br>  There's always hope and keep trying! My aunt gave birth at 44. :D|`|RYiSYJvTaa	You go to a place where they insert the things you need in your body. But serisaly, I don't believe you. Because if you were a parent and had those kids 14 and 17 you'd be older-and know this. Maybe your a kid using this for a game of somthing.|`|E8anv8Zzaa	go see a specialist.|`|cdAQZJGpaa	don't think ur doing anything wrong!|`|Qhyovyj8aa	If your kids are already 14 and 17, I'm guessing you're at least in your late 30's, unless you had them young. It might be that you're too old. See a fertility doctor.<br>  <br>  ps: this is adolescent, maybe you'd have better luck posting in trying to conceive.|`|OpMS8Gwcaa	I think your age could be a factor, but so could a number of things.<br>  Try tracking your menstration cycle, and find what days you're ovulating.

I feel bad for a baby living with all of these names.  Domoniquiea would be so hard to learn to spell! I don't get how to say that either. In general I think naming people after words is silly. Maybe you could reverse a word like the awful name Nevaeh at least it sounds slightly better than those. Or Apple? Ha.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	horrid|`|MUp3wMThaa	Oh please do not do this to your child!!|`|EZ2tpETIaa	Be simple. thats like...wtf|`|wCt69FGFaa	I think they are TOO "out of the box."|`|aJRP6WWYaa	I don't care for any of them.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Not my style. :o)|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I don't like them. What is wrong with simple names.
