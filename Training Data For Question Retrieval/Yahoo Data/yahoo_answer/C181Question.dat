20071201123840AAjKb9R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Blagounette du soir bonsoir, un peu de spiritualité?	Un beau jour, dans le jardin d'Eden, Eve appelle Dieu :   Seigneur, j'ai un problème !   - Et quel est ton problème, Eve ?   - Seigneur, je sas que c'est toi qui m'a créée et que tu m'as inventé ensuite ce superbe jardin ainsi que les animaux merveilleux qui y résident, y compris ce gros déconneur de serpent... Mais, je m'ennuie et je crois que je ne suis pas heureuse....   - Pourquoi cela, Eve ? répond le Divin   - Seigneur, je me sens seule ! Et puis j'en ai marre des pommes et cet obsédé de serpent n'est pas très inventif sur le plan sexuel...   - Alors Eve, dans ce cas, j'ai une solution. Je vais créer un Homme pour toi.   - Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un "Homme", Seigneur ?   - Cet "Homme" sera une créature imparfaite, avec des tendances agressives, un égo énorme et incapable d'empathie ou même d'écoute. En un mot comme en cent, il t'en fera voir des vertes et des pas mures. Mais par contre, il sera plus grand et plus fort que toi. Ce sera un bon chasseur qui pourvoira à tes besoins, il saura encore te défendre contre les bêtes sauvages. Et coté "inventivité sexuel", il inventera même le KamaSoutra !!! C'est dire...Eve fronce les sourcils avec intérêt et dit :   - Ca n'a pas l'air mal..   - Ouais, bof. C'est toujours mieux qu'une cheville foulée. Mais, tu ne pourras l'avoir qu'à une condition...   - Ah bon ? Et laquelle Seigneur ?   - Il faudra lui laisser croire que je l'ai créé en premier et qu'il est le meilleur...

20090304064346AAYFwCZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When would you put your baby in her own room?	My daughter is 12 weeks old and sleeps in her cot in my bedroom as im breastfeeding and its much easier this way. My partner does keep asking me when we are putting her in her bedroom as he sleeps in the spare single bed when he has work and i think he is missing the double bed! I was thinking about 4 or 5 months, i read that they say keep them with you til 6 months but is that really necessary? She has a fairly decent sleep pattern. 11-3 then 3.30-6.30 then a bit less settled for a few hours but the actual night time isn't that bad. When did you put your baby in her own room (with a monitor of course) if you had them with you.

20081015172443AAZo9q6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Do you think I went too far?	I recently married a woman with an 8 year old daughter, and they moved in with me. We stay in a house I inherited from my mother when she passed away.      Well, one day, I was home watching her daughter when suddenly she raced slammed her bedroom door shut, raced down the stairs, and sat on the couch with a weird look on her face.       Moments later, the smoke alarm went off.      I ran to the bedroom to find an inferno under her bed--fortunately, I was  able to put it out with the fire extinguisher. The floor, wall, and mattress sustained extensive damage.      The girl admitted to playing with a cigarette lighter she had found on her way home, had set some paper on fire, and when it had gotten out of control, she kicked it under the bed thinking it would just die down.      I immediately sprawled her over my lap, and took a wooden spoon to her butt.      My wife was outraged when she heard about, somehow made herself oblivious to the fact this kid almost BURNED MY MOTHER'S HOUSE DOWN, and told me I had no right beating a "poor helpless girl" and that she was annulling the marriage. I asked her what was I supposed to do since every child is taught from a young age not to play with fire. Her response was "How about a time out, like any civilized human would do?" I was speechless.      Who is right? Did I go to far? 
20081112080238AAPsWlM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do men still have to put on the hat/gloves to be in the L&D room?	I know from looking at my baby pictures that my dad had to put those plastic bags over his shoes, wear a big plastic apron thing, and a "shower cap" just to be in the L&D room (not a c-section, normal vaginal delivery)         and on some baby shows you see the men wearing those.      But most of the time when I watch birth shows on DHC the men are just in their normal clothes.      I guess some hospitals have different regulations, but generally speaking, do most hospitals require your partner to wear any of that stuff?
20090304064804AAInYcN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding and fertility?	I read this thing on kellymom.com that says its harder to get pregnant while you're exclusively breastfeeding.(which I am)  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/normal/fertil...       Now, I get so annoyed reading those "am I pregnant?" questions...but I find myself concerned and seeking the help/advice of other moms (not insults please)   My son is 7 weeks old today. I'm not even sure if my period has returned because I was bleeding on and off for like...4 weeks after I had him   I have had the implanon birth control for about a week. And I'm exclusivity breastfeeding my 7 week old. My hubby and I "did it" last night...and *sigh* we started out with a condom but for some reason..(and this never happened before I had my son) the condom burned...maybe it was the lube. I dunno...and it was like the only chance we had to do..ANYTHING, really...both children were sleeping and there was nothing on TV LOL....anyway...so we went without...   why is it that in the heat of the moment everything seems like a good idea? lol Anyway I was kept awake for a while after he was sleeping..(men....lol) worrying about being pregnant. I mean we DO want more kids...and if I was pregnant it wouldn't be the end of the world. I just want to take the time to enjoy our little boy before we have another....      yes,yes I know.."take a test" I will...but I guess I'm just looking for some thoughts or opinions on the situation      (p.s I asked this in TTC aswell for maximum answers lol)

He is going this month for a consultation with an ENT to see about getting tubes put in his ears. He has had ear 8 ear infections so far and we went to the pediatrician yesterday and he said it's time for tubes.

20090304064348AAhDv11	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you ever wish you could just get your child a sitter for the day and not worry about it?	I am just feeling really crappy today and want to know I'm not alone. I haven't spent more than 3 hours away from my daughter since she was born (my husband took me to a movie on our anniversary). I have no family where I live right now, my family didn't even meet my baby until she was over a month old. My husband works every day. I just want to find my daughter a sitter for one day and just regroup. But then I feel guilty for even thinking about it. Has anyone done this before? Did it help? She's 9 months old.   If you're going to be rude, don't bother I am harder on myself that you could ever be.
20081209094150AAB9ujD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is three bottles a day of formula enough for a 11 week old?	I breastfed my son so I don't know if this is right or not.  A co-worker was telling me that he son only has 3 bottles a day.  I didn't ask how many ounces she gives him, but even if it were 8 doesn't seem like enough to me.  I'm pretty sure my niece who is 9 months old drinks about 2-3 bottles a day and is on baby food.  She is a first time mom and it just doesn't seem like enough for such a small baby to be eating.

20081106143153AAcJCh4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is anyone else petrified of SIDS...?	I knew I shouldn't have just looked SIDS up on the net as I'd feel petrified after wards but I'm curious, is anyone else so scared of their baby dying that they actually feel sick?      I know its rare...which leads me to my next question, what are the statistics in England?      And also have there ever been any "symptoms" before the baby has died of cot death, any signs that your baby might not be well and to keep a closer eye on it?  I know that no one knows the causes (although I just read something about it can be caused by a genetic condition....what does that mean?).      Sorry to go on, just really worried myself by reading about it and feel like I need to talk to people feeling similar to me or who can give me some answers.      By the way, no need to explain what causes them, just to save you the time, know about putting baby to sleep on her back, no smoking etc...
20081013181748AAN3HMN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please help me to figure out the date of conception...?	so im trying to figure out when this girl i know would have concieved, to figure out if the father is who she says it is. she told us she was originally due December 10th, and had her last period March 4th. well, yesterday we were informed that the new due date is December 1st. is there a way to figure out when she would have concieved? (the guy shes claiming to be the father was only with her once, and knows the date) thats why we're trying to pinpoint around when she concieved.      i'd really appreciate your help! <3      add info:   the one time he was with her, was march 28th   and they plan on a paternity test,    im just trying to get a rough idea         in addition, she said she knew it was a boy at 13weeks.   i didnt think that was possible, at least not off of an ultrasound pic.      I guess it just seems kind of odd to me, because hes overseas, and she was telling him like a month ago that the doc was saying he would be able to induce her a week or so earlier so the baby would be born while he was here on leave.       to my knowledge, thats when the lungs and everything are finnishing up developing. i've never heard of a doctor saying "oh, its a big one, we can take him early if you really want"      it seems to me like shes just making excuese after excuese as to why this baby would come earlier, in turn, making the possiblity of it being his less and less.

20090304062507AAlF58I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	This is getting crazy, what will my friend and I do about this internet psycho?	So, my friend Marie was at an Internet Cafe. She was on bebo and a new friend request came in. Her profile is friends only. She had to go that second so she just clicked accept. So I was on the phone with her and she told me about this guy. He had a made up name (I am just guessing that because it is so weird). He kept messaging her and when she said she was going to delete him he said don't. She said Why and he said don't you dare delete me. She is 13 and he says he is 18 but I'm not sure about that. All his friends stories are Don't know them, Through Bebo whatever. He keeps sending Marie weird messages like what are you doing now. We made her up a boyfriend so he wouldn't keep asking to date her. Here are some things he said: I want to date you. Come to my place for some drinks, Break up with your boyfriend I want you. What is your phone number/email addres etc. He is so weird. He had his school has Dublin first and then he changed to a college near where we live. He keeps asking my friend for phone number or her school or whatever. He gave her his phone number and said to ring him but she said she doesn't want and said she didn't have a phone. I said delete him. Marie said she was scared because he said not to delete him so she was going to wait until he went offline so he wouldn't notice she deleted him but he his always online. I was up at 6:00am on Sunday and I saw he was online. At any random time in the middle of the day he is online. He is never offline. What are we going to do about him? I keep telling Marie to just delete him but she wants to wait until hes offline but he never his. Please leave suggestions. We don't know what to do about him!

I am now 26 weeks pregnant and my ultrasounds seem to be off by about 3 weeks now...I temp'd using the BBT method and here's some background...LMP was Sept 5th...temps were low until Tuesday the 23rd when they went up in the usual pattern when I ovulate. Then went higher again a few days later...so basically my temps pre-ovulation were around 97.3....after ovulation 97.7 then went up to 98.3 and stayed there. I took a HPT on October 4th..two actually that were positive. My question is...Isn't my dating more accurate than the ultrasound?? Why does my doctor insist on using the ultrasound to date my pregnancy when I have been charting my cycles and basically know when I conceived, or am I mistake and this is not a full proof method? I always thought it was a cut and dry system to show ovulation.   Input would be appreciated!   Thanks :)

20080125220315AAghjLs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Length of bleeding during my miscarriage, is this normal?	I started my miscarriage more than 7 weeks ago and I am still bleeding! I did not have a D&C because I was told by my OB that the bleeding should be 2-4 weeks and everything should pass naturally. I have seen 3 different Dr.'s since then, 1 gave me some tiny pink pills 4 weeks ago to stop bleeding (didn't work). Another gave me Vicodin and basically said hang in there. And the other said the same things, and added a D&C this late would be risky.  I just need some advice from ladies who have experienced this. The past 7 weeks of my life have just been a pain in the @$$! My husband and my sex life has sucked and I'm tired of wearing bulky pads! I recently moved out of state and have military insurance so it's been a very slow process in getting to see my new Dr. So please don't tell me I need to talk with my Dr., been there done that. Dr.'s are useless (at least any of my Dr.'s). I just want real advice from real people please.

My Mother in Law lives abroad and so comes to stay with us for three or four weeks every year...she is pushy...nice but pushy and also takes over EVERYTHING when here. She pushed and pushed last year and the year before so she was the one to make my child's birthday cake and not me (she is abad cook and thinks shes great) every night she takes over dinner...and what she cooks and buys is invariably not nice...this time I had decided not to put up with it...so I told her I am making the Birthday cake and today I went shopping and when I came back she said "Oh I got some nice braising steak for dinner tonight" well I had planned on chicken and so told her I don't like braising steak (which I don't it is cheap and nasty and she cooks it badly) and she kept saying "OH its beautiful meat...really lovely"￡ so I said "I don't think so...it is the cheap cut and usually very gristly..I am sure it will get eaten on another day though" now she is being all funny with me...which annoys me...she is a guest and it is not up to her to decide the family menu....I appreciate HELP...but not someone trying to be the Mother of the house...which she is not...that is me...am I wrong?

I've been extremely nauseous the last 2 mornings, and also a couple of times about a week ago. I gagged so much brushing my teeth this morning that I almost puked (tmi, sorry). I can smell EVERYTHING and it bugs me! I've been way more emotional than usual.      BUT... I'm on birth control (I did miss 1 pill last month, but I've done that a million times and not gotten pregnant.) I just had my period last week, and it was normal - on time, not light...

20090305061309AAPIxAP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Too trigger happy on me in any situation?	Not for a teens interest, adults please respond....      Doesn't matter what the issue, even when I know I am in the right and it is crystal clear to the world at large, my so called boyfriend will always play devils advocate and stand up for the other person/situation if an issue arises.    There's a woman in the neighborhood that is notorious for her selfish ways. ("all about her" type).   I pick up her children for school each morning (I also bring my own) . I went today and waited at there house for the kids to come out like I have done every day of the year (snow, rain, etc) and finally figured out that they weren't even there. She had decided to drive them today I guess. That's her option of course-- but not so much as a phonecall to me to let me know. So I passed her in the school parking lot and on our own side street in our vehicles and I slowed down to talk to her, and she drove fast right on by. It was intentional.    So I told my bf about this, who always says she's a witch (unless of course it's me complaining)   So I tell him and he says "well maybe she wanted to teach you a lesson that if you say you will pick her kids up at 8:00 than she means 8 sharp." I said "I'm doing her a FAVOR by picking up her kids each day, no charge, just a neighborly good thing to do. The kids have never been late, always greeted warmly and dropped off with a smile. Why would she feel she had the right or need to "teach me a lesson?".    My bf then started on his long stupid rampage about "understanding the other person"... I just blew up at him saying you don't even understand ME nevermind HER!  What the f--    For ONCE I'd like him to just stand by me on ANYTHING and not always challenge me.      I am from a very loyal family.  Brought up to have my have friends family back.  Of course,We speak to eachother honestly but in the end we stand together.  I don't feel this security from my bf.  I don't expect my bf to do anything about the mother or get involved but in the privacy of my own kitchen I'd like some understanding.    He consistantly puts me on the stand for cross examination. I want an emotionally loyal man. Not one that will agree with me ALL the time, but one that will at least be supportive when I am just looking for some encouragement or comfort or to feel a little protected.... One that will not blame me for things he clearly KNOWS are not my fault. I think it's a passive aggressive way of putting me down. I think he is undermining who I am by disagreeing and belittling and turning around any situation that I have a complaint on.  What do you think?

20081216074952AAI1tKl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	21 weeks.  Am I over prepared or are my friends just ill prepared?	First, this is my first child. I moved to a big city with no family.        My husband and I have basically no family....his family is very small.      So now that I am pregnant with little or no support, I feel that I should have all my bases covered, but my friends are being so negative.      For example,  one of my best friends came over and I showed her my baby's room and she was like why do you have all this, you are going to get this at your shower.  Except, I dont have that many friends here in this city, just co workers and for my wedding shower, I got NO GIFTS just a bunch of gift cards.      Then my husband and I work different schedules so we are going to have to get a babysitter right away, and I am so worried about the cost of that, and how to choose one, but again my friends say it is too soon to be thinking about that.      What is wrong with me being prepared for my baby and not waiting until the last minute to do stuff?  Why is it that I am expected not to buy my own  stuff for my own baby without feeling guilty?

20081107070842AAdqUxd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anybody have this type of pain @ 15 weeks?	So last night I had a different kind of pain in my stomach that made me worry a bit.  It wasn't a cramping due to the uterus stretching or anything like I've had before.  It was more of like a stabbing and sore pain below my stomach and on the lefter side of my pelvic area.  I wasn't doing anything strenuous, just sitting at the kitchen table doing a craft.  After the pain got too much, I layed down and after awhile, the pain went away.  I haven't felt that yet today so I'm not sure if I should call my doctor or just write it off in my mind that it's normal and everything's okay.  Has anyone had this pain?  Could it have been a cyst?  Could it have been that something's wrong in there?  I'm not bleeding and I have no pain now.  What's the deal?

20070505012535AAAxsPc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When to switch formula?	When do you know when to change your child's formula? My son is 1 month old and has been drinking Enfamil A+ for about 4 days. His bowel movements are terribly painful for him and I wonder if this is due to the formula. When they come out, they are not hard, so I know water or more hydration wouldn't make a difference. He does do them once a day, but I truly hate to see him suffer for at least 30 minutes with these cramps and pain. Is this a reason to switch?       I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor, but in the meantime I thought I'd ask other parents. Thanks!

20081103124930AAmJcHC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you think is going on?	I had my period on  October 4th and it ended on the 10th. I had my IUD removed on the 13th and then had unprotected sex on the 17th. I am now three days late and I have taken a pregnancy test which was negative. I am having some symptoms such as sore breasts, fatigue, frequent urination and of course the missed period. Do you think that it was a false negative or do you think I am just late because of the IUD removal? I am going to wait a few more days and test again and I am going to consult a doctor no matter what the result. I am just looking for opinions and I would like to know if anyone else has experinced this. Thank in advance!

About two years ago i was seeing a man for about 2months and i fell pregnant,hes ex girlfriend was also pregnant aswell,basicaly he didnt take it well,he stopped meeting me and we only knew what each other was thinking through friends,i didnt keep the baby,that would of been a disaster.   We have always texted for the past 2years and met up and had fun on several occascions,about 8 months ago i found out he had another baby with a girl but when i asked he denied it,although its true.   I didnt mention it again and recently we have been gettin on well,texting a lot and meeting up he told me he loved me,but the past week he hasnt spoken to me and wont reply to my texts.He has done this lots of times but always gets back in touch eventualy.   Im just not sure what to do ,there is obviously still a part of me that cant get over the way he treated me when i was pregnant.   Whilst i was pregnant he was sleeping with another girl called stacey and keeping hes ex sweet at the same time,im so confused WHAT SHALL I DO?i cant get over him?

20081017131629AAnwQ6Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	28 weeks pregnant and party tonight?	I'm 28 weeks pregnant and my bf's ex-coworker invited us to his apartment for a party. My bf really wants to go, and I actually would love to get out of the house, but I'm kinda nervous. I feel like I will be totally embarrassed. And it's not like I'm going to a club, it's just his friends house, but I still feel like everyone will be judging me. His friend knows I'm pregnant, but still wants us to come (plus my bf might drink a little bit and I want to make sure he gets home safe and doesn't do anything stupid). I asked two of my girlfriends to come along (one of them is 4/5 months pregnant and goes out all the time, but I guess I'm more shy than she is, and she doesn't look as pregnant as me, I feel like a cow). I have a nice outfit planned out, just a shirt and skirt and some sneakers, it's really comfortable too. I don't know, what would you do? (It's not the type of crowd where it will be dangerous or smoking or anything like that).

I had an ultrasound done at 8 weeks to check and see how far along I was. My doctor noticed that the fetus had stop growing at 6 weeks but I was 8 weeks along. the weird thing is, I had NO IDEA I was even miscarrying!! I had no symptoms or signs really. I bled it out about a week later. Sorry for the graphics...I"m currently 4 1/2 weeks along right now. My doctor does not want to see me until 10 weeks. I guess I just want to know everything is going to be alright this time before then. I'd hate to have waited 10 weeks to see her and have miscarried the whole time! I SHOULD know before then that I'm miscarrying right?!?!

20081002192216AAggKlW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could these even be symptoms?	I know that people ask questions all the time about pregnancy symptoms,  so sorry to bug you guys with another one. But I haven't been able to find out much about these particular "symptoms" so I thought I would ask. Something is certainly off with my body and I fully intend on testing for pregnancy on Monday when I am due to start.      - hot flashes (i'm only 26 so I highly doubt that menopause is an option with this one)   - increase in discharge (it is white and gooey. It's odorless and does not hurt or itch. I have never before noticed this happening like this before my period or any other time of the month for that matter)   - my boobs hurt (I know sore boobs IS a symptom but this is an odd hurt. It's not the sore when you touch them like I normally get before my period, it feels more like the growing pains I got in puberty)   - gassy      I also had some spotting one day earlier this week (about 10 days after unprotected sex) which was my first indication that pregnancy might be a possibility.      Has anyone heard of any of those things indicating early pregnancy???    Again, I WILL test on Monday, I'm just curious in the meantime.

Say if a 14 year old girl gets pregnant (not: I am not pregnant nor is any other 14 year old I know) do you think the parents should have the final word? Do you think the pregnant girl should have a say in what happens to the baby even though she is a minor? I think they should be able to make a descision as long as the parents can agree with it. I'm 14 and if I ever got pregnant I'm pretty sure (well I know my Dad would) my parents would make me get an abortion. But I could never do that so I'd probably refuse and put it up for adoptino instead. What would you say if you found out your teenage daughter had gone out and gotten herself pregnant?

For my first I was induced because he was 8 days overdue so I don't really know what the start of labour feels like.   I'm having lower back pain that just won't go away and every now a cramping feeling, kind of like a period cramp.   I can feel that she has engaged (I can breathe properly!) and was wondering whether or not this might be the start of labour. If so, from experience how long from this early stage did you go into active labour?   I have a doctors appointment in two days but am anxious..       Thanks for your comments      Annabelle x

Last summer we did so much together. I took him to kings island (an amusement park) and stayed in the kid part all day.  I took him to New Port Aquarium and chuck e cheese and some carnivals and things like that but I know i cant do all that stuff with him this year and i don't know what I can do. This is my first child and there for have never been pregnant so i don't no what to expect over the summer. We have a very close relationship and i am scared about him feeling like i don't love him as much. He already made a comment to my mom (his grandma) about who's baby he is suppose to be now. His mom just had a baby last month. I now i want to take him to museums and chuck e cheese still but he loves rides is it safe to ride things like farris wheels and carousels while pregnant and than i could just play the games while he rides? And does anyone know any ways i can keep him included in my pregnancy. Also i am 13 weeks pregnant now if that helps. i just don't want him to feel like this will mean i love him any less.

I want a pram where my baby will lie flat - I am not a big fan of the travel systems as feel the baby looks a bit stooped up in it - just my opinion.       I want a lightweight one as I walk a lot and don't want a difficult bulky one that is hard to push.      I want it to turn into a forward pushchair later on and I would like it to have a shopping basket too.      Any suggestions - please tell me which you are getting, or used and if any good - include pics if poss pls.      Thanks       Lx       P.S Caden's pram I sold before I found out I was pregnant - it was very bulky anyhow - I use a pushchair with Caden now. He took his first steps quite a few weeks ago!      Lx

20081022082856AAYIus3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I call the doctor?	I hate being a pest so I have been avoiding calling the doctors office.  I am 36 weeks pregnant today according to the ultrasound.  I was at the doctor on Monday and he did not do a cervical exam but did say that I was measuring about 2 weeks large.  Last night I was experiencing extremely sharp pains in my lower abdomen and vagina.  This morning, I woke up with what feels like menstrual cramps and have recently started with the diarrhea.  This is my second pregnancy and my first son is only 11 months old.  I have read that in subsequent pregnancies that are very close together, preterm labor is common.  I don't want to have the baby this early for fear of him having to stay in the hospital for being underdeveloped.  Two weeks ago at my doctors appointment, my cervix was soft and I was 1/2 cm dilated.  I am just unsure of what I should do.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you.
20071125220947AAqGYSg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	A question?	Before my last period I was very sick and throwing up so I just took a pregnancy test to see. It was negative and the next day I got my period. But the throwing up hasn't gone away, if anything it has just become worse. I went to the doctor and she didn't do anything. She didn't give me any tests but she perscribed me promethazine for the nausea. I've been taking that. But then I started to become VERY bloated. Could that be from the medication or what? Also, I am still throwing up. I started my period three days ago. It was VERY light at first then yesterday it was REALLY heavy and then today it is a lot lighter but not Super light? Is there a chance I could be pregnant. Or is it very slim? Should I take a test or would it be pointless?

20080925080418AApH7aI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the chances of me being pregnant?	Ok I had sex this past weekend and I stopped using my NuvaRing last month because I am being put on something new next week when I go to the OBGYN. I didn't plan on having sex it just sort of happened. I knew what I was doing and I even told the bf that I was not on my BC anymore. He said that he didn't care. He pulled out before he got there but I know there is always pre***. My question is since I had just gotten off of NuvaRing the previous month could I be pregnant? I got online as soon as I got to work Monday to look up my ovulation date and low and behold it was very high Saturday and peak day Sunday (right when we did it). I am not suppose to get my period until the 5th of October and I leave to go on a cruise for my birthday that Wednesday. I really don't want this hanging over my head until then. Is it probable that I am pregnant and if so should I ask my OB to do a blood test next week? I know this is alot but I need to clear my mind of it. I know it's too soon to get symptoms or at least I think it is....Please tell me what you think. At before you pass judgment know that I have five brothers, four still living, and two sisters all ranging in age from 21 to 3 so I know the consequences of unprotected sex so please don't lecture me. I am prepared to handle what ever situation I have gotten myself into and if God blesses me with a child I will take it on with my whole heart!

My husband and I spent a couple months charting my temps, but did not try to conceive until March, which is the month we conceived!      When I went in to the doctor to confirm my pregnancy, I told them I had had irregular cycles, so they averaged out the shortest and longest and came up with my due date (December 3rd).      Just yesterday I went back and was looking at my charts, and I realize that I actually was not irregular, but I had consistent 29 day cycles.      This would actually put my due date at November 29th.      I realize it's not a big difference, but obviously I am getting anxious for the pregnancy to be over and to have my little one in my arms.      Which due date is probably more accurate?

So list what it is, why you love it, where you can get it and how much!         Thanks and good luck to all trying to conceive or already pregnant!
20081118114116AAp4yOJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can I get pregnant this way...every month is disappointing!?	Me and my husband have been using the withdrawal method for about a year now...      He knows that I can get pregnant this way...he just says if it happens it happens and if it doesn't it doesn't...which means we aren't exactly trying      Why haven't I gotten pregnant yet if this isn't really 100% effective?      deep down I do want to get pregnant without really trying...ugh! this is so hard to explain      What can I do? What should I do?
20090305055639AAzoxqX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Does this mean I'm going through a growth spurt?	Well, I'll start off with...      1. I started my period when I was around 12.      2. I'm 14.      3. I haven't gone through a growth spurt yet.      These are the reasons why I think I'm going through one:      1. For the past couple of days, I get hungry ALL the time,   like after I finish eating, within a half hour I get hungry again...      2. My legs get a little sore      3. I never had a growth spurt before            (I listed these to make it less tiring to read :])      So, am I going through a growth spurt?

I have been having a hard time finding a job in general (thus, I find myself already 5 months pregnant and finally having a job interview, I'm also showing so I can't hide it very well with an outfit)...On one hand I want to be honest with them from the get go, on the other hand, though it is illegal to not hire a pregnant woman, many companies could find a way around it. Should I not divulge that I am pregnant until I am actually offered the job? That seems sort of deceitful. This is sort of a tough dilemna! I'd like some advice please:)

20081111053517AAnUB9L	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it so bad to feel like this?	Hi, so i started TTC in Feb of this year, got my first positive in April but unfortunately this ended in M/C at 5wks - blighted ovumn, i then fell pregnant again straight away after this with no period in between, i had an early scan at 6wks 5days when i saw and heard the heartbeat, however at my 12wk scan there was no longer a h/b and it only measured 8wks, i was devastated to say the least, d&c required this time.  I went back on b/c after this  but having been off it so long i forgot to take it on a few occassions which once again resulted in pregnancy which again ended in the form of a chemical pregnancy at 4-5wks.  This was in September.        With my 1st pregnancy the due date i was given was Christmas day, up until now its been the 2nd m/c that has affected me the most but now with Christmas approaching all i can think about is how close i could have been to having my baby.  Im sorry if i seem to go on a bit but i just really needed to get this out of my system

20090305061050AAUfQnB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this 8 year old boy under-developing?	He can't use a knife and fork, can't do shoelaces, can't make himself anything to eat or drink (not even water or a sandwich), can't wipe his bum properly, can't brush his teeth andf can't read many things.    And if you ask him a question you have to completely dumb it down otherwise you get the 'wha? dunno whatcha talkin bout' answer. He gets words wrong like huggle, instead of cuddle and hug.       He is my step-son, he lives with his mother full time and we see him on a weekend. I know she doesnt spend anytime with him as he's always on his computers, his toenails are always bending over back into his toes whenever I see them and his finger nails are always really long and dirty, he has wax coming out of his ears and his teeth are all wonky, yellow and his gums are bright red and wonkey over his teeth.      Its not my place to say anything but when he comes over with long nails etc I do cut them. I know when I was this age I was much more independant and could do alot more things than he can, but i'm not sure if he is undeveloping or not? (he's definately not special needs before anyone suggests that.)

I so want to believe that this happened for a good reason.  I feel that God made this happen because he felt that this is what I needed in my life.  My life was empty and I was depressed and always drinking and smoking.  I have not touched alcohol or ciggs since I found out I was pregnant.  I feel that the only thing that would make it better would be to have a loving supportive man in my life.  The father of the baby has mental issues and I can't be around him anymore (we were together for years but it was too much for me to take (verbal abuse etc. he has BPD an is Bipolar and won't seek help he drinks a lot and does rec. drugs too).  The only good thing is that he has a decent job and works every day so hopefully he will pay child support. So...do you believe that things happen for a reason.

I posted a question a few minutes ago, and I finally thought of a better way to phrase it to make more sense with more details.      I got my first and only ultrasound at 26 weeks. (I found out I was pregnant late, and had to wait 8 weeks for an appointment with the Army medical center.) My ultrasound at 26 weeks said the baby was consistent with that of one due on Jan 19th, but my LMP says I'm due on Jan 8th. My doctor did not change my due date because she said it was less than 2 weeks off, so they keep the original lmp date.      Which would be most accurate?

This is my #5 pregnancy. I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old. i had a misscarriage inbetween the 2, had an abortion due to finacial issues 14 months ago, and now im pregnant again.LOL!! im not sure what think about it. Its not like we dont use protection. i had my IUD taken our on the 17 of December and started my pack of B-pills the week after. i guess it wasnt good enough, or my husband and I are really fertile. Anyways my hubby is telling me to get another abortion. he says it will be better that way, that we can give our kids everything they want and its much easier these days with only 2 kids. i dont know what to think in a way i do feel he is right but in another way i want to have this baby. any one have any idea that could maybe help me make my decision?

20090305054324AAt4aGy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	17 and confused, please help me?	I am on antibiotics and my doctor said to wait 3 weeks before having sex again (I'm on the pill). So I waited 6 weeks to be sure, however, I have now missed my period.      I took a pregnancy test (one that was 99.9% effective), the blue line showed up to say it had worked and that I am not pregnant.      Could something else have stopped my period? I have not altered my lifestyle or eating and I am not under any stress.      I'm going to the doctor next week, should I mention it?

20081103102423AAYquO6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I assume that I'm pregnant? (I will give very high points for answers!!)?	OK, I've taken many HPTs, including one at the doctor that were all negative. I had gotten a light positive about 4 weeks ago (which is why I went to the doc). I took another 2 days ago and it was like instantly positive. I haven't had a blood test yet and my GP/family doctor won't do any more tests because the urine test was negative.       It's been 10.5 weeks since my last period (August 22). I had some light brown bleeding on October 3-5.       In the first 8 weeks, I had these "symptoms": cravings, nausea, fatigue,  moodiness, bloating, strong sense of smell, always hungry.   In these past 2 and a half weeks, my "symptoms" have changed to these: not wanting foods i'd normally like (makes me sick to think about), way way more moody (like extreme mood swings), breaking out on my face, chest and belly (never had bad acne, stress has always caused one or two big nasty pimples but never 10 or 20 and NOT on my belly or chest), my hair can't seem to stay clean, still really tired all the time, laying on my stomach feels uncomfortable ( i always have slept on my stomach), my focus is scattered, and lack of concentration.      Should I assume I'm pregnant? Do you think an OBGYN would be willing to do an ultrasound even if they got a negative??      I don't have any infections or anything. I've had them before and I don't have any symptoms or signs of those (ie UTI, yeast, etc).      What do you think??

I'm on the pill, however I missed the last two pills before I had sex. It's still a week or two before my next period however, I've been having some pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, sore breasts, pretty severe and frequent headaches, been quite irritable, been nauseous although I haven't thrown up, been extremely tired, more senstitive to smells, within the last few days I've been more hungry than usual, and I'm gaining weight which is why I think I'm bloated because I started gaining before I had a larger appetite and wasn't eating that much and running around a lot which struck me as odd that I wasn't losing any. I took a pregnancy test last Thursday which was negative however if I got pregnant when I think I did, I wouldn't have even been a week pregnant. I used the EPT pregnancy test. Also, I am on the pill and only with one person, whom I have sex often. Help?

I found out i was pregnant on wednesday after 3 HPT's all with a lighter line than the test window line. Early hours of thursday morn about 5am woke up with period pain and medium bleeding, phoned the doctors who booked me in for a scan next wednesday ( 8th Oct) as its too early to see anything apparently. Passed a really few tiny bits of clot like stuff although it looked a bit like lumpy blood to me (dark red), took 1 more HPT's that day whilst still bleeding and cramping and it came back positive although the line was even lighter than the lines from the day before. Bleeding eased off in the afternoon so i took another HTP same result as before (faint positive) although not faint where you need a magnifying glass to see it, suspense was killing me so when to docs, who told me what i was already thinking (miscarriage) and said just wait untill the ultrasound on wednesday, but i asked her to do one more test, and hers came back negative.    Im confused 4Positives of mine but 1 negative from docs?? No cramping since thursday but still bleeding although very very lightly sorry of this is TMI but its pinky red in colour and quite stringy. Oh yeah i passed 1 other clot which was a bit like skin colour smaller than a small finger nail, Have i got any hope left or is it too late?! i have already told myself its too late so that on wednesday @ u/s i wont be disapointed but any advice in the mean time would be great, Thankyou x      PLEASE DONT PUT IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS GO TO THE HOSPITAL AS THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO WAIT UNTIL WEDNESDAY.

I havnt slept or eaten properly since as it is so painful and often reduced me to tears, which isnt like me but i just feel so stressed and drained from it all.       My tooth is so sensitive that the thought of a dentist coming anywhere near my tooth again freaks me out, especially as the injection doesnt take away the pain. But i desperately need it taken out or a root canal! In the past i have always been sedated for dental treatment as i have such sensitive teeth/ gums. Is that possible now that im pregnant? Im also very worried about the amount of paracetamol i have had to take in the last week and the effect that it will have on the baby?      Please help, i've lost hope!
20081006135441AA1DCZJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant or just pms?	ok well me and my bf had sex right after i finished my period and it was unprotected he didnt finish and didnt go all the way in. i started to get the slimy mucus (usually associated with ovualtion) about 7-10 days later. it has now been about 2 weeks since sex and my nipples hurt but my boobs dont. also i just feel a little bit nausiated when i wake up but it goes away after about 5 minutes. could i be pregnant or is this just pms      also he said he didnt jack off in the past 3 days and i read online that sperm in pre *** can be washed away after 24 hours so his pre *** might have had little or no sperm in it

The doctors said everything looks normal but I haven't taken the prenatal pills your supposed to since I was unaware of my pregnancy. I know the first three months are crucial for a baby. I don't smoke or drink though, which is good I know, I just want to be sure my baby won't suffer from being deprived of the prenatals for the first three months. Thank you!

20081008040331AAbTDd5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are you suppose to let out ANY discharge while pregnant?	Because I had my period Sept. 18 and ended the 23rd and it says on yourdays.com that i am fertile the 30th through the 5th. sooo i had sex the 28th, the 30th the 4th and 5th. And just this past weekend, JUST ON Saturday I woke up and there was 2 little blood spots and that was it and it only did it when i used the bathroom. And every time i used the bathroom it was a light pink, then it was gone. But I've only let off this creamy discharge like one time and that was it. My cousin did that when she was pregnant with her two boys also. But now it's like i'm dry as a bone! it's just a little bit of clear stuff will come out but it's not enough to make me worry. It's to early to test, so I can't do that. I don't really feel anything. Well of course I won't feel anything right now, duh duh! lol!   But does it sound like I'm starting off my pregnancy stages?  I've asked alot of people and they've told me yes. Any answers would help but no smartass answers. Thanks lots.

His 6yr old stays on the wknds and the 2nd bedroom is his; here is my problem, his son will not sleep in his room, thanx to mom allowing him to sleep on the couch at her house, he does the same at ours (i have tried to enforce the bdroom to no avail), his son barely goes in his room, only to take toys out. I want to turn it into a nursey WHILE keeping his bed in there with his toy box and belongings; but mostly a nice nursery...his son likes skulls and crossbones, I want soft and lovey, I have been told that I am pushing his son out and that it is his room and the baby wont need it for at least a year. I just want a place for my first child, his son doesn't even use the room, I can not rationalize it. If its not being used then why can't I do what I want to it?

20081010131820AA2teHl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I want a baby so much!!!?	I am only 18, but lately i've been feeling so incredibly broody! I want a baby more than anything in the world and have become so preoccupied with the idea that i could have one whenever i wanted. The fact that i know i could conceive straightaway and be giving birth to a perfect little baby in 9 months time is making me want one even more! I even had a dream the other night that i had one...I know what you'll all say - they're a lot of hard work, they're not cute and sleeping all the time, but i know this. When my little sister was a baby i did so much for her when my mum was working weekends. I fed her, changed her, put her to bed, looked after her when she cried. Yes, i know it was hard work, but i understand that it is a long-term thing and even those negative aspects aren't putting me off! I am and always have been a very maternal person and i know i would be a good mother. Deep down i think i should wait simply because society thinks that way and i need to go to university and get a degree and get married blah blah blah. But if i wasn't so busy thinking about what other people would say or what i am 'supposed to do' before i finally get pregnant, i would definitely have one now. I don't know what to do. This is something i want more than i've ever wanted in my life. Is it a bad idea? I wouldn't regret it - how can you regret your own child?? i know i would ALWAYS love and care for it but perhaps the timing is wrong? I don't know what to do, i am SO tempted to stop taking birth control.

Mi hija de 3 a?os llora siempre mucho antes de dormir, cuando la mando a la cama, va obediente y se acuesta contenta, pero de rato comienza a llorar y tengo que levantarme a ver que tiene, platico con ella un rato, me dice que ya esta bien y que ya se va a dormir y no quiere que apague la luz, despues salgo de su habitacion y comienza de nuevo a llorar.   Tiene apenas 3 meses durmiendo sola, y son los 3 meses en que se la ha pasado llorando y no se como hacer pues yo me levanto temprano y me duermo tarde por estar esperando que se duerma.

I only entered about 2-3inches our first time but did not continue because it was painful for her, and we opted to stop because i didn't have a condom. That was on the 8th, she had her period on 19-21st and now she's been complaining about stomach pains for the last 3 days, that would be 26th, can it be related. I don't see how its possible. I would think it would be another 2 weeks before she should start feeling cramps, if any at all. Is it too soon for such symptoms? she shouldn't be because she had her menstrual flow, so conception did not take place, it just really seems unlikely.

20081029100303AAKSScX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the odds of a false positive for a pregnancy test?	Well my boyfriend and i were worried because my period normally is every 28-30 day cycle and it went passed that.  But i also have had abnormal period cycles because ive been on and off birth control.  We went to the 99 cent store and bought 2 different types of pregnancy tests.  One said it was identical to the EPT test which cost like 10$ and we got another brand.  They both came up positive.  We checked online if there is false positives and it said if you are on allergy medicine its possible that it will give you a bad result and i take allergy medicine every day.  We just went to the store and bought a good test that cost 10$ and it came up as invalid results.  Meaning nothing showed up and I'm getting pretty frustrated.  Can anyone help out and tell me what they think?  thank you

I've been wanting a baby for the past 7 months or so with no luck and every month feeling like im getting the symptoms cause I want it so much. And I aways get BFN. So Im wondering if anyone knows if it's possible to want it so much that you can actually make yur veins appear more/darker??    I know it sounds crazy but I also have a LOT of gas, burping, some queasiness every so often, dizziness/lightheadedness..... Heartburn nothing agrees with my stomach (meaning I get gas,or, heartburn.)

20081103125511AAdkUuo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	10 weeks pregnant, having problems, please help!!!?	hello everyone, i am currently 10 weeks and 4 days pregnant w/ my first baby.      I have had a bad pregnancy. with bleeding and cramping all along the way. sometimes heavy.       went to the er last week with bad bleeding and cramping ,after a few hours and a few blood tests, i had an ultrasound at 9 weeks 1 day and the baby had a good heartbeat. i continued to spot for a few days and it finally let up. i wasn't worried at this point.      yesterday morning i woke up with slight cramps. and sharp pains in the left side of my abdomen (near my ovary area.) i felt something come out, it felt like i peed myself. i went to the bathroom and saw some bright red blood. it filled the toilet. there was quite a bit of blood and it was bright red and fresh.      i freaked out, i put a pad in and called the doc who said...don't come in unless it gets worse.      about an hour later i felt something large come out of me. went to the bathroom and in the bottom of the toilet saw a blood clot slightly larger than a golf ball. not huge by any means, but i definitely felt the thing come out.       for the rest of the day, i bled and spotted. with some very small blood clots. i filled 2 pads.      the spotting eventually let up, and today i have been fine.      i am worried i may have miscarried. i know it is abnormal to pass any clots while you are pregnant.       the doctor tells me to wait until my 12 week visit. i might go to the ER tonight instead.       basically I am just wondering about other peoples opinions. Is a miscarriage inevitable? Could it be normal? I have just had a bad pregnancy. It is very disheartening.      Thanks for reading and thanks very much for any info/advice.

Hi, i'm 28 years old and have been pg 4 times, two resulting in live births.I got the regular pms symptoms two weeks before menstration. Sore boobs, increase sense of smell, a little sick,headaches. I was 3 days late, after my husband and I had sex it came on the 4th day. it was very irregular, light at first then a day of medium flow. then nothing. came back as spotting on day 3 as spotting. then nothing. Pms symptoms have not gone away. breast tenderness increased, i feel pregnant, but urine and blood test on oct.28 were negetive. After that, nurse still saying that my symptoms are "probably" early pregnancy but too early to tell.My last sexual encounter was on oct.18, the day before "my period". I'm confused. last hpt ( dollar store brand if it matters) was on tuesday nov.5. How can that still be too early to tell? Could I still be too early to tell?They want me to wait until nov.19th to test again (when my next period is due). The wait is killing me and i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.Any advice?

Since that's the case, ovulation should be sometime during the first week of the following month (if counting 14 days or so). I never notice signs of ovulation though until about the second week of the month. Does this mean a screwy luteal phase?  The weird part is I spotted during the time I'm supposed to ovulate AND now..the time when I normally feel as if I'm ovulating. It's very light spotting..pink when wiping. It happened on Nov. 2  (supposed date) and lasted a day and is happening now (the time I normally feel like I'm ovulating). Could I be ovulating twice or what?

20081112120337AAazS7K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I go see my doctor?	I am 32 weeks pregnant.  Last night I was downstairs in the basement doing laundry.  When I realized that the basement was flooding I flew upstairs taking them 2 at a time to tell my boyfriend.  As soon as I got upstairs yelled what was happening, I ran back down in mere seconds.  After we fixed the problem, I calmed down and the adrenaline rush subsided.  I began to feel pain in my abdomen.  It was by far the worst pain I have ever felt!  It took everything I had to get back up the stairs and into bed.  This morning it still hurts.  I figure I have pulled some muscles and that I should just rest and stay off my feet.  However, in the back of my mind I'm wondering if I should go see my doctor.  What do you think?

20081116082224AAZHDyJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it too soon to experience pregnancy symptoms?	Hey. I need advice. On Thursday night my boyfriend came inside of me, which was the last night of my period. All day Friday I felt great no bleeding after a 4 day period. Saturday I felt fine as well until I went to the bathroom at 9pm and saw a little amount of blood on my underwear. When I wiped there was a little brown and light pink stuff.       Later that night I felt VERY nauseous and like throwing up.  I also felt cramping in my lower abdomen. Im tired, moody, and craving Taco Bell which is highly unusual since I hardly ever eat fast food. lol      My BF did also come inside of me 2 days before my period started. Which was weird because I just had a period two weeks before that, but I just put that off to stopping my birth control pills after 2 weeks.  I do not know if any of that is relevant.       Today is Sunday and I have not spotted or had cramps. I feel great just really really tired even though I slept for 7 hours.       So my qestion is... Is it too soon to be experiencing pregnancy symptoms?

20090305074641AANmY9c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	UPDATE!!  It's a pleasure to write this one?	So my period is due on Saturday (30 day cycle), but I couldn’t wait and tested today (cycle day 28 , and I got a BFP.  It's a bit faint, but definitely positive (my husband saw it too).  I tested 12 dpo.  I got a positive opk on cycle day 17.      I thought for sure I wasn't going to get my period this month.  my Estradiol level was 119 ( I was told they want to see a level of 200 per mature follicle, but that they have seen pregnancy occur with low levels, and I still had one good size follicle).  I was on clomid 50mg 2nd cycle and put on metformin mid-cycle (that's when they realize I had PCOS).  With my son I was on clomid 50mg, and got pregnant 1st cycle.      I have had no breast tenderness, no implantation bleeding (I didn't have it with my son either).  I only feel a little nauseous.       How are my contacts doing?  Congrats again to Butterfly baby (TTC fairy).      I should be 3 weeks and 5 days pregnant.      Sorry I haven’t been on as often asI want, but I got a promotion and now have added responsibilities.  Be blessed!!

20090305062940AAd1iDn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Becoming obsessed... what should I do?	I have a friend who is quickly moving from friendship to someone I try to avoid! She's 23 and the mother of a 1 year old. I'm 21, married 2 years, just bought my first house, and don't have kids yet. On Tuesday, I checked my phone & in the 6 days leading up to then, I had TWENTY-FOUR calls from her! And since yesterday, she has called me 7 times! =(  When she calls, she doesn't even have anything to talk about. She just baby talks her daughter, ignores me, and leaves long, awkward silences. And I have a cell phone, so I can see my missed calls & listen to voice mails.      This is SICK. I don't know what's wrong with her. My husband mentioned it to hers and he said, "Well, she's with the baby all day. She needs adult interaction." Ok, so that's understandable, but why me? Why does she call me several times a day? =(  I don't even want to be friends with her anymore because she's so annoying & obsessive.
20090305063252AA1nSeK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Does your 5 or 6 year old child still?	Does your 5 or 6 year old child still enjoy watching things on NickJr? Obviously at that age they are in school, but on days off, will they still watch things like Dora, Yo Gabba Gabba, Max and Ruby, etc?       I only ask because my son's almost 5 and he still enjoys these shows quite a bit. He watches the big kid shows, too, like Fairly Oddparents and Spongebob, his interest in preschool aged shows just isn't dwindling. And no, I have no problems with that. I'm just curious.

My friends son is about to turn 6 and he hasn't had a loose tooth yet. He didn't get his first tooth until he was 1, and I was just curious if that had anything to do with it. Getting teeth late and loosing them late. What about your kids?? Thanks!
20090305065549AAxcDEu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Where can I find any medium flow nipples.?	I have a 3 month old baby girl that bottle feeding. I have her on high calorie formula right now. Also her OT told us to use medium flow nipples. I got only one from the hospital. But none of the stores here have medium flow for playtex bottles or other kind. I want her on Playtex because she seems to get gassy and get air from normal bottles. So I am stuck want to do.. Did the bottle company stop making medium flow nipples now. I know when I had my other two boys they had medium flow and it like 4 year later I don't see them anymore. All I been seeing her is slow and fast flow. The fast flow is way to much that make her gag on them.   Thanks      I was breastfeeding but doing to weight issues and she been admitted to the hospital two times. So I stop so she wouldn't be going back to the hospital again. This one reason why she on high calorie formula.
20090305062912AA7aLXz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	We've created a monster!  My two year old must be the worst eater ever, help!?!?	My son is 29 months old... from age 8 months to 18 months he ate like a trooper... most anything we would give him.  Started with cereal, then veggie baby food, and then fruit baby food.  Around the time he started feeding himself we started to offer him adult food... anything we were eating.   From there it all went down hill.  It seems that he has a texture issue... he doesn't like certain textures.  He'll eat yogurt, peanut butter and jelly, soft fruits, oatmeal, and he'll eat pretzels and crackers, toast or dry waffles... but he won't eat anything in the middle.  We can hardly get him to eat meat or anything that is chewy.   We've tried the forceful "have to take a bite" etc method and it didn't work.  Then we went with the "eat whatever you want as long as your eating - but we always offered our food too."  That hasn't done anything except make him think he gets whatever he wants.   Now we're back to forcing him to try a bite.  He doesn't eat badly... we don't allow junk, but his range of what he does eat is sooo very small.   He gets protein from peanut butter and yogurt.  He gets enough dairy from milk and yogurt.  He gets good carbs from wheat bread, wheat waffles and his baby oatmeal.  He does eat peaches and bananas too.      I'd just die out of joy if he ate meat or a veggie though... HELP!

20090305065655AAMrEFh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, have you ever...?	Have you ever talked, yelled at, or cursed at one of your children's toys?      Let me explain this a little better, lol. Last night around 2:30 a.m. I heard "Aha, Ahahaha. Elmo needs a good stretch."  And all of the other things my daughter's stretch Elmo says. I just thought that maybe if I ignored it, it would go away. (Call me crazy, but I was so comfortable and warm.) At 3 I told my husband that the crazy thing was possessed. I kept thinking that the darn thing would shut up eventually. (You have to pull it's arms and legs to make it talk.) Around 4, I was livid, the dumb thing was really going crazy, it wouldn't shut up. I rolled out of bed, went to the living room, took it from the toy box and said, "Shut the f*** up you damn demon doll." Unvelcroed the back and flipped it's switch.      I know, not one of my finer moments, but my daughter wasn't around to hear. Honestly, if it wasn't so cold out last night, it would have been in the middle of the street just for spite.       Any funny stories from you guys?

Just to be sure that it was right I bought another test (this time a very cheap one, i don't get paid till tomorrow) it was negative. Would I of messed the first test up because of the water??

Regardless about that stuff, i woke up with my breasts feeling.. pressure.. full.. numb... tight... i don't know how to explain it. last night my fiance went to touch me and i felt it hurt and i thought he was holding me to tight there. this morning i woke up with a feeling as if it's still happening and he's not around. i felt so like they are heavy... kinda achy.. like they swelled just before i woke up. what could this be from? and i got many symptoms like pregnancy when i went to WebMD. just i'm confused how far i am. u'd get the breasts change right away and i didn't if i was right before. but what could it be from?
20090305062259AAjvb3E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Pros and cons of breastfeeding and/or pumping?	I have a pump at home which I will use, though I was 100% sure that I was never going to breastfeed. I was just going to pump.      Now I'm more 50/50. I have no idea what I want to do, except that I know that I want to give them breast milk if I can produce enough for the 2 of them.      Obviously there will be times when I will have to do both, especially when I go back to work, though I'm not sure how long to breastfeed for either.      I want my boyfriend to get the chance to feed them whilst he is on paternity too (from bottles obviously! lol).      I'm not sure on breastfeeding at the hospital as I'm a very shy and modest person and don't want an audience whilst I try! It's a natural process so I don't see why I can't be left in peace to do it alone or just try at home.      How hard would it be to pump at the hospital and then start to breastfeed at home considering the change from bottle to nipple?      Would I be able to produce enough colostrum for both babies at this point? Or would it be better for supply reasons to let them suckle rather than pump as they are twins and I need enough milk for both of them?      My mum had oversupply issues with me and then also with my sister. Could I have the same problem? Is it an inherited thing?
20090305080449AATxKLE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Moms! do you know what days or week you conceived your babies?	first..I know this isn't really a Newborn & baby question. But as many of you do I like this section!          Long story short. My BC i was on in 07 made me have 3 periods in the month of august 07 and the last week I didn't have a period. I stopped BC by sept 3rd( but I know if the egg was already fertilized and implanted BC wouldn't matter anyways). For the whole month of sept, 07 I did not have a period. By oct 11th 2007. I took 2 pregnancy tests which obviously came out positive and I confirmed pregnancy by oct 18, 07. My due date was supposed to be June 2nd, 08 but they moved it to May 28th 2008. I didn't have my son until may 31st. When do you think I conceived bc I have no idea lol. I know this sounds very stupid. Bc we might start trying for another in the next few months.         I forgot to add that. On my last ultrasound (which was my due date). It said on there I was 39wks 6 days but I was supposed to be 40 wks on that day. SO if that's true does it mean my due date was May 29h 08 instead. Which would make conception a later day...      I asked this same ? two wks ago. Only got one good answer from Bird Flippin. I just was curious about this as my husband and I werent trying for a baby. It just happened. Surprise Im here kinda thing lol.

Hello Mothers out there, Please help me with this difficult question!!!!   Before i got pregnant i never liked my breast but it was a fairly average size and shape (size 34b) but i never felt comfortable with it. (I never even like standing naked looking at my breasts)      9months ago,i gave birth to my lovely daughter and it also ballooned to a size 38dd.    I stopped breast feeding 3months ago and my breast has reduced to almost it old size (38c) but my breast went from an ok look to NO NO look. It is very sagging and my nipples are pointing down.   I am seriously considering Breast surgery.      But i have a few questions.   I will like to have another child in 1year time but i don't know if it is better to have the surgery after i have stop having children (so i don't have to worry about it sagging again due to breast feeding and that is or having to go back for more surgery) or if it is ok to have the surgery and still have another baby later?   And can i breast feed when i have had the surgery and have another child?   Please i want a good advice from another one that has been in my situation or is going through it now.   I am almost 30years old and never liked my breast and please don't advice me in getting a wonder bra instead of having surgery.   Await your honest respond

My friend who hasn't been much of a friend lately has been bringing her husband lunch during the day which would be fine but then that strands my husband at work (he's been carpooling with her husband) and since I have a one year old, I can't always bring him lunch when he has a break. We haven't been driving this week because our car is totalled and we have a rental which I just now got a pass for so we can take it on post. She just now called me and told me that "there was a miscomminucation" and that when Brian has appointments or whatever, I'm going to have to figure out how to get him there because they're not going to drive him anymore. WTF. I haven't answered her calls for the last two days because I'm so fed up with her audacity. I mean, I thought that we were friends but we found out that when our car got totalled, they drove right by us, knew it was us and didn't even call to see if we were okay or if we needed to get our daughter home, since it was cold and raining and they live three houses down. I have taken her to the emergency room on a Friday and stayed there with her until 1 30 Am because her husband "was too tired". And now she's treating me like crap. I have done a lot for her and introduced her to a lot of people because her husband wasn't going to do it and now I'm ready to cut ties and just not talk to her ever again. Is that over reacting, though? I mean, I've tried talking to her over the past few weeks to try and figure out what's going on but she says nothing's wrong and that she's not acting weird. Is it just that I'm the first one to actually say we're not going to talk anymore? Or am I blowing this all out of proportion?
20090305080338AAFuN6E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	She's made me feel like i cant have a baby at the moment?	3 years ago i fell pregnant a couple of months after my sister in law announced she was pregnant, no problem for me but she made it clear she wasnt happy about it like id done it to 'steal her thunder' as it was no longer about just her pregnancy.   my partner and i told her we were gonna try for another baby when we moved house (last week), 2 days before we move she announces shes pregnant again! now i feel i shouldnt get pregnant because of how she was last time! should i do it anyway and ignore her?
20090305075744AA3kQtY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Umbrella strollers.....................…	Well, a friend of mine went to Babies R Us (Macy-ha ha) the other day & checked the weight of this one    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    and it's only 8 lbs. I think there's another one that's 6 lbs. I want a nice light weight umbrella stroller. No need for a basket. A detachable canopy (or not) is ok. And I'd like something $20 or less (like the one above).   I was wondering if any of you have that stroller and what you think of it or what other umbrella strollers are good. I want one that is 8 lbs or less. Do they hold up well?
20090305064431AACNp1m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC and I think I am at fault for the delay...?	So I just had a semen analysis done and I didn't realize it but I don't ejaculate much.  Is that a good things or a bad thing?  I hope that little bit of ejaculate has a lot of sperm in it.  All joking aside, I am bummed because I now think I am the reason for my wife and I not getting pregnant.  It is frustrating because for the past 6 months, we have tried but to no avail.  And now the possibility of me being the reason for the failed attempts, has me sck to my stomach.  I want  to give my wife a child and I can't.  How emasculating!  The one thing a guy can provide a woman, I cannot do.  Any advice on how to cheer me up?

20090305075327AAOG1qr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When did you start feeding your baby 3 times a day?	I started my daughter on cereal at 4 months old. Now she is 6 months I have introduced veggies. This is her first week and we are trying green beans. Now I give her a breakfast and a dinner, and of course formula in between. She has about 28 ozs a day. When should I start giving her 3 meals a day?
20090305080006AAd2kQg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Will i still fit in my dress?	Ok i'm getting married on July 26th this year and am fairly certain i'm pregnant! I would be happy about the baby, but it would be my 3rd baby. My dress is a pretty typical wedding dress, not a true corset, but with a lace up back. Do you show much sooner with your 3rd, or if i was really, really careful about what i eat and maybe wear some spanx (although i don't want to squash the baby!!), do you think i would be able to get away with the dress i already have.  It fits me almost perfectly at the moment, just slightly too big on the bust and waist, but its only like half an inch.I don't really want to buy another dress, its my dream dress and it cost me ￡500! By my calculations i'll be about 23 weeks at the wedding.       Has anybody else got married whilst pregnant? How did it affect your big day?      Oh i am going to confirm if i am pregnant or not, my fiance is going to bring me a test home from work later today.

20090305072129AANsZmT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 Weeks and measuring 3/5?	Hello,      I have just been to my mw appointment and she has said that baby is quickly decending downwards, she asked me if I was having pains in the tops of my legs (which Im getting) and said that I have a very active baby.      On my notes she wrote under 'Relation of Presenting Part to Rim' section - 3/5 and I wasnt sure what that exactly means.      Does this mean that baby is 3/5th into my pelvis or does is mean that she can feel 3/5th of the baby head?      I never got a chance to see the notes until I got home so couldnt ask her what it meant

20090305073640AAxvplC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	17 month old and potty training?	First, I do think 17 months is a bit young and I have absolutely no expectations at this point, especially since we have a new baby in the house and I know a new sibling can cause even experienced potty users to regress. But, my daughter has been letting us know just about every time she goes and pulling us towards her room to be changed ( she doesn't really talk a whole lot yet, maybe has about 7-10 words at this point, she lets us know by holding her nose like she's stinky...but it means wet too) I think she must be telling us right as shes going because when I go to change her she is always just a little wet and the diaper is still warm like she just went. Sometimes she grabs at her diaper just before too, so I know an awareness is there. I was thinking of getting her a little potty chair just to show to her, no pressure or expectations, just to start exposing her to it and see what happens. Do you think it would be an okay time to try that or should I wait until she has more language and is a bit older still? Thanks for your advice!

20090305065106AAdqYFi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant sleeping troubles at 22 weeks--is this somthing you have gone through?	I'm starting to have trouble sleeping, major trouble.  Besides the normal difficulty of positioning a oddly shaped body, flipping and flopping from side to side like a fish out of water, when I finally do get comfy I discover that my leggs feel figity and like I need to kick them around to get them to calm down.   Then when I do sleep, I don't stay asleep, having weird dreams and wake up countless times for no reason.....then I wake up lots of times to pee too.        However, I have no touble napping for an hour or two every afternoon b/c I'm just so exausted from not sleeping well. And napping makes me feel like I'm lazy and unproductive.        I don't think sleep was ever an issue, aside from peeing with my first pregnancy.  But this is my second pregnancy and it is BRUTAL.  Anyone else having severe sleeping issues?        I'm about to crawl back into bed to nap (thank God we own our own business so I can be flexible!)
20090305064622AAr20v7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Could I be pregnant?! Help me!?	- I had unprotected sex about 10 days ago   - I did it a couple of days after my period   - My boyfriend 'pulled out' before he came      - I have had unprotected sex before but never became pregnant from pre-***.      I have felt nausea a few days ago but its just because I traveled and had a big change of diet.      Besides that I dont have any sypmtoms or anything unusual going on with my body.      Am I pregnant? What are the chances that I am pregnant?      And I have a mild UTI but I always get it when I have sex and Im getting the results on Monday. Is there a way the doctor will find out I am pregnant from the urine test?            I asked this question before and i got really a couple nasty comments.   And for all those judgmental people, me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year, im almost 18, we love each other, and that was the last time we did it because i moved, me and my family had to leave the country. We are going to be separated for 4 years and will be together later. Im not a dirty slut who ***** without a condom all the time. And i lost it to him too, after a LONG time of being with him.

I had a scare the other day, I'm about 28 weeks pregnant, and I keep seeing flashing lights. My head gets all funny, and my vision goes crazy. I called my doctor and asked them about it, and they told me to come in NOW or go to the emergency room. They were worried it might be related to high blood pressure.   I went in, and they said everything looked fine. They don't know whats wrong, but they are going to "keep an eye on me". Has anyone else had similar symptoms while pregnant?

20090305063137AA33wN2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Negative pregnancy tests that are positive?	So, when I conceived our first son I did an early response at home pt and had a very very faint line (I didn't even think I was pregnant) but did the digital one a few days later and it was "pregnant." I know that some people don't get a positive line until a couple weeks after missed period because of the hormone levels. I was just wondering if for my first the test was able to detect the hormones early does that mean it will happen again with the second.

Would it be ok for me to test today when I get home or should I wait? Also, do I have to use the first morning urine? I read on the early response directions that I don't have to but I know a lot people recommend it. The last 2 days I've been feeling like my period is going to start with feeling cramps and back ache which I never get until a day or two into my period so I keep going to the bathroom expecting it to have started.

20090305071125AAaYFwp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I EBF my 9 weeks baby. He is very fussy these days.?	I really do not know what to do. For example he will feed for 5 mts on left side, and in the mean time my right side has leaks quite a bit of milk, And after 5 mts, when I move him to right side he will taste the nipples and make a very bad face and start to cry. What is happening?      Another thing,  When babies wake up do u feed them immediately or you let them play little bit, then feed them.       Yet another thing, I really do not know how to set his routine. Like lets say.      8 am he wakes up.    Immeditely he will feed for lets say 5 mts.But it takes me good 30 mts for me to see if he will feed more. Then after some time i give up. I leave him flat on the bed and he will play for 20 - 25 mts and then starts to cry, So I think that he is sleepy and put him into his cradel and let him sleep.       Again he will wake up at 10.30/11 same routine , only change could be he might take a bath, then feed again and back to sleep.   There will be very little play time in the middle      So most probably he will sleep at 12.30 or so and wake up at 3/ 4   then same thing, feed and cry and get tired and sleep.      Wake up at 5/5.30 and will not lie down or feed (may be feed a little) and will want to be carried around till 10/11 when he will fall a sleep.   In the middle i try to feed if he feeds.      Then i wake him at 2/3 at night to give he some feeding where he will max feed for 7/10 mins. and back to sleep.      then will wake up at 5 to feed for the max of 7 mins and back to sleep to wake up at 8 in the morning.      that is my days routine. I donot what I am doing wrong, why does he cry all evening, what changes should i bring, why does he make face after tasting my nipple, i do not know.      Please guide me.

20090305074230AAszBsl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Unisex names in decline? WDYT?	I saw this article yesterday.       http://www.babynamesgarden.com/unisexbab...       "n 1995 in the United States, 77 names ranked in the Top 1000 in popularity for both boys and girls, according to baby name data from the Social Security Administration. Of those 77 unisex baby names, 67 were “unique,” while 10 were variants, such as Devon, Devin, or Devan.      By 2005, the number of unisex, or androgynous, names appearing on male and female Top 1000 lists had shrunk to 64, including 53 unique names. That’s a drop of about 20% in unisex names over the decade.      The drop is surprising for a couple of reasons. For one thing, people often assume that as more “made-up” names (such as Rylee) enter the language, or as more “placenames” become baby names (think Dakota), more of these names are unisex. That may be true, but there simply aren’t that many “made-up” unisex names in the Top 1000, for either 1995 or 2005.      What did change between 1995 and 2005 were the names themselves. Of the 77 unisex names in 1995, fully 50% (38 names) lost their unisex identity by 2005. Discounting those situations where both names fell out of favor, the name more often moved to the male side of the table rather than the female, contrary to conventional wisdom about unisex names. "      What really surprised me is this last bit above - i.e. about males winning back names, which also seems contrary to what people generally say or assume.      WDYT?
20090305065936AA9pHif	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	15 yr old wants to spend the night with girlfriend?	My 15 year old nephew is dating a 14 yr old girl. The girlfriends parents are divorced because her father left her mother for his gay lover. So now the father is living with his boyfriend.       Over the winter my nephew was at the fathers home with his girlfriend and the weather got bad so he asked if my nephew could spend the night with the girl sleeping in dads room and the boyfriend sleeping in the livingroom with my nephew. My sister said yes but felt very uncomfortable with this.       Now the father is asking if my nephew can spend the night at his house again this weekend with the 14 year old girlfriend (same sleeping arrangements). The father is asking because my nephew and his girlfriend are going to a movie Saturday night and he wants to make breakfast for these two on Sunday morning. My sister has said NO but the other adults (girls mom, dad and the boyfriend) don't think there is anything wrong with this.       What are you opinions on this? I told my sister to limit how often my nephew has contact with this man because i find it odd that any adult would think it is ok for teenagers spend the night with each other.
20090305070656AAdKyie	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Three ultrasounds have confirmed baby is growing but there is never a heartbeat to be seen.?	Hi, I have had four ultrasounds.  Two on the same day to confirm babies size.  Two a couple weeks later on different days.  My baby has clearly grown measurement wise but we never can find a heartbeat.  Does this mean baby is dying or already dead or that some babies just do not grow the same or have visible heartbeats etc.  I do have a tipped uterus, baby is measuring on track every time.  Baby was 6 weeks 6 days gestational age (actual age of baby) or 8 weeks 6 days pregnancy age at last scan.  Has anyone heard of this?  I am waiting until I am 11.5 weeks gestation age or 13.5 pregnancy age for next scan unless I feel any pain/bleeding etc.  the doctors have been unable to give me a reason why this is happening but each time say baby is dead NOW but the other sonographers were wrong because baby grew before and there is no breakdown of tissues evident.  At what point do I throw in the towel - I should say, how long can baby grow like this without a heartbeat showing up for some reason?  We believe we were carrying twins earlier on and one has been absorbed due to some controversy on what the first u/s said and the fact that it has happened to me before.

20090305074426AABvrHw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Preeclampsia or early labor?	I am 35 weeks pregnant with my second child. For the past two months or so I have been having braxton hicks contractions and they are doing nothing but getting worse. Last night and the night before I was having shooting pains to my cervix and they hurt REALLY bad. For the past couple of days I have been having headaches that I can't get rid of and blurred vision that I haven't had this bad before. I had preeclampsia with my first one by six months. I am also very nauseous and my apetite has decreased tremendously. At my last doctors visit I lost 2 pounds since the previous visit. I called my doctors office and they told me to keep my appointment for today at 3:15 which I was planning on doing anyways. Do you think that I could be having signs of labor approaching or preeclampsia? If it is one or the other what are the chances that they may induce me? Thanks in advance for your answers.

20090305063518AA50fsF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I found adult diapers under my teenager's bed and I think he's wetting the bed. Should I confront him?	I wasn't snooping, just tidying up. Under the bed of my son, who is a sophomore in high school, I found a package of disposable adult diapers, along with a plastic garbage bag containing several soiled ones. I think he has been having a bedwetting problem and was too ashamed to tell me. Should I confront him with what I found? Or would that be too humiliating for him? And he would think I was snooping. On the other hand, I know this is a problem that can be treated medically. What should I do? And how should I do it?

20090305062628AAVQLZV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My youngest is always sick but my oldest rarely is.?	My 17 month old is always sick. He has one cold after another. Seriously about every two weeks he has a new cold or virus. I understand kids get sick a lot but he's sick so much I've never seen him better. My oldest boy who is 7 years old is rarely ever sick and he has asthma for goodness sakes. He has had maybe two viral infections in this entire year so far. But on the other hand my 17 month old is constantly sick. Why do you think this is? I keep asking the doctor and he says it's "normal" is it really normal? It doesn't seem very normal to me to have a viral infection every other week. My 17 month old did get blood work done and it showed that he had elevated liver enzymes and low liver functions along with low iron. My brother and I both had iron problems as kids. He's on supplements for the iron. The doctor keeps ensuring everything is okay. We live in a fairly small town and I'm wondering if this doctor even knows what he's doing. Or am I being an over protective mom?

Hey all      Last week I saw midwife she found a trace of sugar in my urine and I had my 2nd glucose blood test on Tuesday.      Today I saw the consultant just for a routine check and he said the test showed I have gestational diabetes.      The last test I had a month ago was fine, I dont eat sweets, I dont drink tea or coffee so no sugar there, mainly drink water (sometimes have squash but gonna stop that now) so why have I got this?      I've got an appointment for the diabetic clinic on Monday and will be given a monitor and will have to prick my finger.  Not worried about the needles (although would rather not have to do it), this was IVF so I'm used to needles!      So many questions in my head????????      1) Is this harmful to my little man      2) Will I have to have him early if he gets too big      3) What causes it      4) I know it can be controlled by diet but what diet??? I already dont have much sugar in my diet.      Why cant pregnancies be straight forward.      Should I be feeling upset?  Just feel like its all going wrong.      The consultant I saw wasnt my usual one and didnt have much time so I felt I couldnt ask these questions.      PLEASE HELP!

20090305072829AAHxtfq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I wrong to expect a 2 and 3 year old to walk and not hold onto the buggy or climb on it when we go out?	I'm a stay at home mum and today I took my 6 month old twins, two year old and 3 year old out into town to run some quick errands. All we did was walk 500 yards from the car to the butchers then next door to the farmer who sellers fruit and vegetables from his farm in the shop and back to the car. People saw fit to tell me that I shouldn't be letting my two and three year old walk by themselves and not hold onto the buggy. It's not like I force them to walk from the house into town and back. It was only 1000 yards walk and we didn't have to cross the road or anything. I let them walk on their own when we walk by the beach but I tell them not to go too far. The only time they ever go in a buggy is when the whole family goes out so their daddy pushes them. I don't see what the problem is because they are safe.

20090305083119AAVQQaa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Spotting, but no period?	Okay girls... this is my second round of Provera and Clomid... I took my last Provera pill on Feb 28th... I started to see some dark brown spotting, but no period... On my first round of Provera, I spotted the very next day of my last pill, and got a heavy period like 4 days later... This time.. I started to spot on the 2nd , then have gotten nothing but dark brown spotting for 4 days now.. So I have not started on my Clomid yet because I wanted to wait until I actually got a period.. I noticed at one point, some red, but mostly brown... Sorry for TMI but I just wanted to make sure I did everything right this month and I feel like I am not gonna start a period.. I also took a preg. test a few days ago with a BFN.. So any advice girls? Has anyone else been through this?

Do you lie awake in bed thinking of the effects your life has on the Earth?     Or are you more the type to participate in an energy saving practice if it sort of falls in your lap?  Do you feel you have too much else to do in your life to add more stress?   How much emphasis do you put on energy conservation in your life?
20090305082610AApI1gh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to get my 9.5 month old son to gain weight?	My son has always been on the smaller side because he was a 34 week preemie. In December when he was 6.5 months he weighed 14lbs 8oz. He was around around the 15th percentile for weight then. Today at the Doctors he is 9.5 months and weighed in at 15lbs 10oz. He fell below the charts again (he hasn't been below the charts for weight since 3-4 months). His height and head circumference were right on, it is just his weight. He learned to crawl around New Years and has not stayed still since then. I think he is just burned so many calories. Are there any foods I can give him to make him gain more weight and get back on the charts?       The Doctor isn't too concerned just because she saw how active he is but she would still like for him to gain some weight.       Thanks!

I just received an email from Enfamil saying that I should switch to Next Step Lipil because it is formulated for babies 9 months to 2 years instead of switching him to cow's milk.  My son is 11 months.  I was looking forward to switching him to cow's milk next month because it is loads cheaper than Enfamil Lipil with Iron.       I just wanted to ask if anyone uses Enfamil Next Step Lipil and if they do, how do your kids take to it?  Is it cheaper than Enfamil Lipil with Iron or about the same?  And is it really any different than cow's milk.  I will ask my doc too, but I wanted to know  what you all thought.  Thanks!

I'm excited for her, but don't really want to be around her, the father, or the baby anymore. I was the second one to hold her after she was born, but now.... I don't even want to see anyone.          I had a miscarriage back in October of 2008, and my baby was supposed to be here April 17-24. My birthday is April 25. I still haven't been able to get over this, and still get in my down and depressed moods, and wont come out of my room for days sometimes.          How do I deal with all of this?

How do I get him interested more in feeding himself?

20090305082534AArolAM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How can/should I opt out of a fundraiser for my sons' Cub Scout Pack?	My sons' Cub Scout pack just announced that they want to hold a second fundraiser this year. We launched our annual pizza kit fundraiser in September ($40 buy out per scout) but now, they want to hold a candy bar sale at $30 per box. Since I have two sons in the Pack, I'm looking at $60 for the buy out. I understand that fundraising is a "necessary evil" of virtually all youth activities, but between scouts and sports they are only so many times that you can hit up family, friends, neighbors and co-workers. The rationalle of the Pack's leadership is to hold down the costs for camping and other activities, however, I personally would prefer to pay slightly more for those activities that we choose to participate in, rather than pay/sell $60 to subsidize the cost of activities for others, but which we will not be participating in. How can I tactfully address this?

At night she'll sleep for either 4 hours then get up to feed and sleep another 4, or sleep for 5 1/2 to 6 hours straight, and she's up for the day. I know that 5-6 hours is considered "sleeping through the night," but everything I read says a baby her age should get about 10 hours at night and 4-5 more during the day for a total of 14-15 hours. She's only getting 8-10 hours total. Also when we lay her down at night much of the time she'll wake after only 5-10 minutes several times before she actually goes to sleep.

I have been trying for a year now.  I have a lazy ovary (yep - - like Miranda on SATC) so I only ovulate (and of course get my period) every two months - most of the time anyway. Sometimes it messes with me and comes two months in a row.  My cycle is 35 day when normal and 70 when not.  My last period started December 21. We had happy happy baby-making time (or sex as some like to call it) during ovulation (two weeks before what should have been my period - mid-february).  Last weekend  (on vacation of course) I felt crampy like my period was here.  I made my DH drive out of the way to get pads, get back to our room, and nothing.  A little while later when I went to the bathroom, the was some light blood when I wiped.  The next morning the same thing happened.  It's been four days, and still no period.  I've been super gassy (my poor husband has started complaining).  My nipples are a little sensitive, and a little light-headed.  I called the doctor and can't get in until the 16th.  What do y'all think?

She doesn't take but maybe a 30 minute nap during the day, and at night she is up every hour. She has a routine. She gets fed at 7-730 then she gets a bath and then she will take a bottle around 9 and goes to bed. She sleeps for 2 hours when she is first put down and then for the rest of the night she wakes up every hour and then it takes at least 30 min to an hour to get her back to sleep. We have tried everything. Not taking her out of her crib and just laying her back down and we have let her cry it out but she just cries for an hour till you go in there and she gets louder. She loses her voices from crying so long. We have rocked her, we have let her up to play for a few hours to try to tire her, we have propped her mattress up, we've even put her in the bed with us.  We also have taken her to numerous doctors, including an ENT and they all say there is no reason why she shouldn't be sleeping. She simply DOES NOT sleep.  HELP!!! I'm so tired I can't enjoy my time with her.
