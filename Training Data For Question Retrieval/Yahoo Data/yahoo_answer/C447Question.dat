We would have to get wood to make the interior of the wall. (the wallboard) I am ok with doing that, but want to know how you would decorate the room...   The girls want:   -A carpet or rug to cover the cold floor   -Pillows    A small cubbylike thing to put on the sides   -Alot of colors   -A light system in there or hanging lamp that bends (They were thinking that I could put those light things that go over a movie star's vanity type thing)   So what would you do to decorate the room???????????

This isn't the first time it's happened; I just thought they were something else, not termites. I have bubbles in the paint on my walls. Can I treat it myself, or do I need a professional? If I need a professional, how much is it probably going to cost?
20090309131752AA44qxi	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Is it good to handle your household/garden plants?	hello there. my name is john. i am a very enthusiastic gardener. i live in canada and am preparing for spring already. ive planted some tomatoes, watermelon, some flowers (carpet of snow) and also lettuce. now my tomato plants are about 3/4 of a foot tall already, i have them in pots inside under some garden lights. a friend of mine was over, and she had asked me why i handle my plants. i was sort of petting the plant from the bottom to the top, so that the leaves werent as droopy. i like to see my plants nice and happy, reaching for the sun.    but my friend tells me its not good. she says that the plants might turn out male because of the stress im causing and not produce vegetables? ithought all tomato plants produced tomatoes. also that it might not make as many vegetables or "hardened" or stressed vegetables?       i just wanted to know if this is true. although last year i grew tomatoes, radishes, beans and carrots. and i handled all my plants just the same and i had so many cucombers i had to throw lots of them away!      just wanted to know. knowledge is power.   thanks to everyone who is gonna answer :)
20090309132228AAEPeny	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	My portable electric Dryer is drying my clothes, but when I take them out right after they are done...?	They are not warm.  I've been using the same setting every other time, and they used to come out warm.  The clothes are also not smelling like my dryer sheets.  I'm guessing, from this, that my dryer is not blowing hot air, but cold.  It's only about a year old, and I clean out the lint trap every time I use it.  Any suggestions as to how I can fix this?  Thank you.

20090309133432AAHGdN1	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What kind of tree should I plant at the corner of my house?	I had my house built last year and am getting ready to start some landscaping.  I am wanting to soften the front right corner of my house with a small tree.  There are quite a few of my neighbors that have Birch trees planted on that corner, so I don't want to plant one of those (although they do look pretty good).  My question is, what would be a good, small tree to plant in that corner?  My house is a one-story ranch so I don't want a monster tree planted there.  I want to be able to plant it around 10 feet from the corner, so it is somewhat tied in to the house.  Any suggestions would be great!

20070727102915AA5jfVw	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Why is the new grout cracking and coming up?	I have 18 inch ceramic tiles with probably 1/8-1/16" gaps in the foyer (hallway). I have cementboard right under the tiles and then two layers of 3/4" plywood underneath that.   I have used unsanded grout that says "Polymer enhanced portland cement grout for grouting small tile joints up to 1/8" wide".   Almost everything ended up fine and satisfactory except for a few lines where it just cracked and came up after vacuuming. The grout also can be easily pushed out with hardly any pressure from your finger, so it can't be because of the vacuum.   I have probably tried to re-do it at least 5 times, but it keeps cracking and coming up. When I re-do the grout, I try to clean out all the old grout and vacuum it out. I even tried to use mineral spirits to clean it and then re-do it.
