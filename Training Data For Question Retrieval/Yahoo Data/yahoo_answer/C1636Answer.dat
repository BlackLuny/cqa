I mean, when you lose that bad you can't really say much.<br>  <br>  If I had to say one thing, the Korean pitching just wasn't good enough.  <br>  <br>  Japan is just a lot better.

MRquwjgPaa	i'ts a very nice area, i've been through there a few times when i lived in mt shasta. the population's about 600, very quiet town, if your into outdoor activities i'ts perfect for you. I wouldn't recommend it if you have an overwhelming fear of bears, lol, trinity county is LOADED with them. I really like the area though. your also not far from Mt shasta ski resort, if your into that.
TU7vDI95aa	There are dirty parts of any city, any country, and any continent.  I'm from the U.S. and I currently live in Paris and find it to be extremely clean.  It's true that there's no recycling program, but people don't understand how bad recycling actually is for the environment.  The run-off from the chemicals used in recycling is terrible for our planet.  The only way that the good things about recycling would outweigh the bad things about recycling would be if absolutely everyone recycled religiously.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Is the US a dirty place?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfhsS-KMFL4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfhsS-KMF...</a><br>  <br>  I went to New York and Detroit i saw that the city was full of dirt and in some areas of detroit there were slums sururound by dirt and plastc bags is there was no proper system of recycling as our Europe is much more clean and we have proper system of recycling also.|`|dpKntiZoaa	Tut tut... your use of "our" is a dead giveaway! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah1aKKeDDgVoqJT..4..Bznsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308064115AATfMpI&show=7#profile-info-qAvtkPuWaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> and certainly not something a "native" English speaker would use.<br>  <br>  However to humour you, actually "Europe" is recycles far more than the US and Pakistan.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that you are either very young or very ignorant to make an assumption about a whole country (let alone a continent) from one visit.<br>  <br>  However I now understand that ignorance is the underlying reason and for that I feel pity for you that you need to project your ignorance into the form of such a question.

l74RoxUDaa	I've just answered another of your questions that answers this one: Worcester is on the main line between the two, and is prettier than Birmingham New Street, which counts as one of the ugliest railway stations in Britain.  Go to Foregate Street, which is in the middle, and wander down the High Street towards the Cathedral and then down by the river back towards the bridge and then past the market towards the middle again.  Then explore the shops in some of the older streets like The Shambles and Friar Street.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Probably the easiest by rail would be  Birmingham.
vZaLptZWaa	Magic Kingdom:<br>  You will feel like a little girl! Characters everywhere, and the park is pretty well fairy tale themed. They have a lighted parade at night, and some nights a fireworks show that's pretty awesome. There are 3 rollercoasters here, Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain. The rides are all pretty family friendly, meaning tame, imo. Space Mountain will be your biggest thrill ride here. A not miss, though, is the Haunted Mansion.It's so much fun! Basically, to me, this is a park to just get excited about all the characters and things you see.<br>  <br>  Epcot: <br>  This is the most grown up park. It's divided into two parts. The first is all about learning. It has pretty neat activities for you to do to see how things work. There is a ride called Mission:Space, that is pretty popular. Also, Soarin' is awesome! You are hangliding over a big screen that makes you feel like you're flying over the world. There is another area called The Land, where Disney grows their own veggies and fruits, and then serves them up in a restaurant.The tour of that is really cool, and you will guaranteed see things you've never seen before!<br>  <br>  The other half of Epcot is the World Showcase.You basically walk from one country to the next, checking out shops and restaurants. Two of them have a ride. The Norway ride is actually one of my favorites! <br>  <br>  Epcot is huge so plan a whole day for that park if you're going to that park. <br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios:<br>  This is the park with thrill rides. The whole park is themed old Hollywood. There is the Tower of Terror, my all time favorite ride, anywhere. There is also the Rockin' Rollercoaster, which is one of the fastest coasters I've ever rode. The park is small, and can be split in half with Animal Kingdom easily.<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom:<br>  A large and fun zoo-type park. The not miss rides are Expedition Everest, the Safari, and the water ride,which,for the life of me, I cannot remember it's name. The Safari is really cool. You can get thisclose to a rhino! <br>  <br>  Since you're going in December, I would skip the water parks. It may be balmy, but probably not hot enough to really enjoy them. And all of the Disney hotels, as well as most surrounding hotels in the area have an awesome pool anyway. <br>  <br>  Tips: Bring lots of $$$$! Food is expensive, and so are souveniers. I would say bring at least $30 per person per day to eat with. <br>  <br>  Bring a camera, bring sunblock, and bring a poncho! I've been there 3 times, and each time it rained at least once. Disney ponchos are crapppy and also about $20. You're better off with a dollar store poncho from home. And trust me, the park doesn't close for rain, and everyone you see will be wearing a poncho.|`|J08K6Fqeaa	You really can't describe Disney World in a few short paragraphs. Here is the best tip anyone can give you:<br>  <br>  Go buy "The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2009". This was the best $20 I spent for my family's July 2008 vacation to Disney. The book contains reviews for restaurants, hotels, and attractions on and off Disney property. However, the best part of the book are the touring plans! The plans give you step by step instructions on where to go and when to go in order to avoid the longest lines.<br>  <br>  For example: "Soarin" in EPCOT is one of the most popular rides in all of Disney. A 2-hour wait in line is not uncommon to partake in this awesome experience. However, using the touring plan in the book and maximizing Disney's "Fast Pass" system, we were able to ride it twice in a row without waiting in line one time!<br>  <br>  By the way, if you don't know what the "Fast Pass" system is, then definitely get the book or ask us that are in the know at yahooanswers. It's fast, easy, and one of the few FREE things in Disney. Yes, it is absolutely FREE!<br>  <br>  Go out and buy the book today. I promise you will not be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|6Nmly1wmaa	if its just the 2 of you DONT go to magic kingdom.

Get the meal plan. this saves you so much money. you only can get this plan if you stay on the grounds. the meal plan is 40 dollers per person per day but this is a money saver with out a doubt. because with this you get a sit down, a snack, and a over the counter. The sit down will usually cost you about $250 for a family of four and an over the counter about $150 for a family of 4 thats if you dont get the meal plan. <br>  <br>  3.if you stay on grounds you also get extra magic hours this means you can stay later and go early then other people and you can get on more ridesss. cause theres usually no line. (:<br>  <br>  4. transportation is amazing there. the buses come about every 20 minutes usually every 10 minutes and they are labeled to where they are going and they take you there. they run all day. and there comfortableee. <br>  <br>  hopeee i helpped. <br>  <br>  also, heres a website if you want more information on everything <br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts-compare/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts...</a>|`|IySTxK0kaa	well, when i went my parents had this really good book bout Orlando, Florida and it was very good with  loads of stuff they recommend, like restaurants, rides, tourist places, nice building ect......<br>  Any book will have useful info like the one i had.<br>  go to WHSmith, or a travel place, they would have good ones<br>  <br>  blizzard beach is great 4 someone like u so u can do stuff together,<br>  so, if ur going there u could live in the animal Kingdom (close)<br>  and very calm hot there, and look outside ya hotel room and u see animals!!!! its very nice, wen i was there i saw giraffes, deer, ostrich, zebra and this other thing!<br>  <br>  GREAT to live there, with great restaurants inside<br>  <br>  Disney's Hollywood Studios, is awesome too!!!<br>  great rides and entertainment, <br>  Hollywood studios have great rides like the rokin rolla coaster,<br>  the Hollywood tower hotel,<br>  <br>  hope this helped!<br>  hope u have the most awesome time og ya life with ya boyfriend!!!<br>  xXx|`|x9RDPwIZaa	This is a great time to go, but the parks will still have a certain amount of crowds; they are not empty.<br>  <br>  I would suggest checking out the links below.|`|1IsKyXdgaa	its crowded as hell in december in all the parks.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	You are correct, the first week of December is BEFORE the holiday crowds hit, so that's a great time to go.<br>  <br>  I would highly suggest you get a guidebook.

You need at least one full day here, probably 2 if you want to do most everything.  Be sure to ride Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Caribbean, see Mickey's PhilHarmagic and Wishes.<br>  <br>  Epcot - huge park, lots of walking.  Ride Spaceship Earth, Soarin, Test Track, and Mission: Space in the front section and spend some time exploring the countries in the back.  Might need more than a day if you enjoy the countries.<br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios - smaller park, can be covered in a day.  Lots of fun rides worth doing twice!  Ride Rock n Roller Coaster, Tower of Terror, Star Tours, Great Movie Ride, Muppets 3 D, Toy Story Midway Mania<br>  <br>  Animal Kingdom - get there when it opens and get on Kilimanjaro Safaris to see the animals at their most active.

5YPh5RXPaa	Of course she shouldn't punish her daughter.  All children, both boys and girls, love their teachers more than their parents, particularly at the KG and early primary levels.  Teachers are the ones who provide them with all the knowledge that they've been hungry to acquire and usually KG and early prim teachers are young and beautiful, cute and fun.  So it is just normal.  On the other hand, parents' job is discipline and of course they annoy their children through this tough task.  <br>  Your friend's behaviour was wrong because she put herself in a competitive position with the teacher and there will always be comparison in the child's mind. In my opinion, she should have encouraged the admiration of the teacher in the hope of having her daughter love school, but at the same time, she should talk with her daughter and understand the source of this infatuation with the teacher and explain to her that her Mummy isn't that bad and tell her about all the positive things that she (the mother) has.  This was the perfect opportunity for mother and daughter to share a conversation.  Unfortunately, by her dictatorial rule, she shut her daughter who will never express her feelings again.  Moreover, by asking the grandmother to behave in the same manner, she is distancing her too from the granddaughter.  Grandparents have an extemely important role to play in their grandchildren's life and when the parents fail, grandparents always come to the rescue.|`|gkoOThQAaa	I think she should punish herself because she's the one responsible for that. I am sure the kid has her reasons to love the teacher better, maybe she was there for her or her mother is always not playing with her. So she is the one who brought it upon herself.<br>  <br>  Also love is not by force, you can't force your way into your child's heart.

No I will never punish my kids for that.. First of all teachers spend more time with kids than parents, and it is their work being with kids.

zdSRsySNaa	I had a quick look on the nationalrail website. It depends what day you want to go there and what time. The shortest journey I can find takes about 3 hours, but most routes take about 4 or more hours. Also the 3 hour journey doesn't seem to be an option on a sunday. It involves changing at Castle Cary, Dorchester West and Dorchester South.<br>  <br>  As for fares, an advance ticket costs just under ￡30, otherwise it's just under ￡40, for an off-peak ticket. But if you want to travel early on a weekday morning expect to be charged through the nose. You can also save more money with a railcard, saving 1/3 of your train fare.

This was the route i had to go last time but it was about 2 years ago. not sure on price but the earlier you book it the cheaper it will be and usually if you book it as singles its alot cheaper. <br>  If not then check out national express as one of the main stations is in bournemouth so you'll have alot more routes which will probably make it alot easier for you.

They are very heavy duty and you can stack them.|`|lUSTFw94aa	Boxes are expensive.<br>  <br>  I am moving this Friday.<br>  <br>  Here is what I did. For small items, breakables, decorations, compact discs, I went to 3 different post offices and got all of the free boxes I could grab. They range from 12" X 15" X 10" up to just a little larger. Especially for books they get too heavy if the box is too large.<br>  <br>  Then for wardrobe boxes and boxes larger than 20" X 24 I had to buy them. <br>  <br>  They are sort of inexpensive.<br>  <br>  All you have to do is go to UPS' web site and find the "packing" link.  For about $50.00 dollars they will deliver to your door a variety pack of boxes it is like 10  to 12 cartons.<br>  <br>  This is really a great bargain.<br>  <br>  No bx should cost more than two dollars.<br>  <br>  And boxes are not free, even though people want them to be.<br>  <br>  If you are just moving, grocery store "used boxes" are probably OK. <br>  <br>  But if they are going into storage and you will stack more than 2 boxes high, then the weight of a stack of boxes is logarithmic in pressure, after a year, the boxes you stacked will be crushing under their own weight.

9QBlKlFmaa	First of all, there is no Palestine.<br>  <br>  One of the first Christian uses of the term Palestine is found in the works of the Church historian Eusebius, who lived in Caesarea.  He wrote around 300 AD, as the Roman persecution of Christians was ending and the Emperor Constantine began to accept Christianity as legal.  Eusebius did not accept Hadrian's designation of Jerusalem as Aeolia Capitalina, but he did use Hadrian's term Palestine.  <br>  <br>  Eusebius considered himself to be one of the bishops of Palestine.  Thus, the anti-Israel, anti-Christian name of Palestine was assimilated into the Church's vocabulary as the Byzantine Empire was being established.<br>  <br>  The Church has, since that time, broadly used the term Palestine in literature and in maps to refer to the Land of Israel.  It should be noted, however, that the Crusaders called their land the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  When the British received the mandate after World War I, though, they called the land on both sides of the Jordan River, Palestine.  This became the accepted geo-political term for several decades, and those who lived in the land were called Palestinians, whether they were Jews, Arabs or Europeans.<br>  <br>  Even evangelical Christians who believe in the future of Israel have used the term Palestine.  The New Schofield Reference Edition of the Bible has maps in the back entitled Palestine under the Herods.  There never was a Palestine under the Herods.  This is a serious misidentification.  It would be something like looking at a modern map of Texas and having it titled Mexico in the Twentieth Century.<br>  <br>  The MacArthur Study Bible published recently contains a map called Palestine in Christ's Time There are numerous references in the notes to something called first-century Palestine.<br>  <br>  It appears that Bible-believing Christians have either knowingly or unwittingly followed the world, pagans and haters of Israel in calling Israel by the anti-Israel term Palestine.  It is found throughout Bible maps, Bible commentaries and textbooks.<br>  <br>  The use of the term Palestine was biblically inaccurate and wrong throughout the Church age.  However, it is more than just wrong, it is devastating in our time, when the term Palestine is the cornerstone of the propaganda war against Israel and the Jewish people.  Do we want to use terms invented by those who hate Christ, the Bible and Israel? Do we want to utilize terms used by the enemies of Israel who desire to accomplish nothing less than the destruction of the Jewish people? I think not.<br>  <br>  Christians should use the terminology of the Bible wherever possible.  Why not go back to the terms used in the New Testament? The Gospel writers used the term Israel to refer to the Land.  Why should we use any other term when referring to the Land, especially now that the Jews are back in the Land and have re-established the nation of Israel among the family of nations?<br>  <br>  As Christians draw closer to what they regard as the Second Coming of Christ, we should understand that Satan's fury against the Church and Israel will grow exponentially.  Satan hates the Gospel of the crucified and risen Messiah, and he hates the reality of the restoration of Israel as the nation that will ultimately receive Jesus as the Messiah at His return, and the nation that will be Christ's earthly headquarters.  <br>  <br>  The only term we should use for the Land is Israel, or its subdivisions of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.  We should make every effort to remove the term Palestine from our Bible maps and textbooks, and use only biblical terms with reference to the Holy Land of Israel.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|i00SbscLaa	East Jerusalem is a palestinian city and the palestinians are free to call Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.

ZxF6tSNAaa	TS boy,I totally agree with you.<br>  <br>  I have been playing mas since I was in primary school and seeing the decline of creativity in Carnival makes me very sad. In the past you could tell what band  was passing by its masqueraders alone. Try that today nuh!<br>  <br>  Only one or two have stayed faithful to the concept of mas, the storytelling and awe inspiring spectacle that was Carnival of old. Now we lookin like we in Vegas or Rio. Steups.<br>  <br>  And Jaz is right, it is the fault of the masqueraders. I have gotten on my soapbox many a time trying to convince others that we need to boycott this bikini and beads nonsense and take a stand for our culture only to be told, " Yeah, yuh right.....but de lime in dem band does be good and it have prestige!" Hello? Excuse me???<br>  <br>  It is not only the mas, the music is following the same dotish route. Remember when our music was about social commentary? Even if it was a party tune, it made sense on some level. How many times we have to hear " Rag and flag, flag and rag. jump and whine, put oono hand up in de air?  Oh gosh man! <br>  <br>  And wham wit dis singing in "accent"? I nearly dead when H2O Flo was "High on da  Deens Floor".

As a trus "Bush Gyal" to the heart....country mas real different from the town and city mas. The element of storyline and culture is still preserved. Monday night mas in my old village is serious business.....if yuh doh come good with yuh story and portrayal...well ...boo down the place. All masqueraders participate in their act to make the story captivating...and then they could play they self after. Monday night mas in town....nothing special. I think the originality is still there...somehow..kept in the rurals of society...where the fancy and pretty hasn't yet seeped in. <br>  <br>  I love carnival...and I love traditional mas.

But I thought I was paying for a lime I guess, even that was not what I had hoped. <br>  <br>  Seriously, I know I went voluntarily but fool me once shame on me, never again! Birds of a feather? Most primary school mas have more complex concepts than that, way, talk about one dimension! <br>  <br>  IP had nicer costumes by far and they were quite imaginative. I doh mind the costume brief, but portray SOMETHING!!!|`|aQIJp9khaa	Ah hear yuh TS, we stop believing in ourselves, we start look to north America and Europe for creativity, because we wish to please dem, forgetting that it was and is our ingenuity that has dem mesmerized .

I feel so ashamed to know that most of the people playing mas are only concerned with how their body looks at carnival time. The only person keeping some tradition in the costumes is Mac Farlane. Kudos to him!!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I think the "lack of creativity" lies with the masqueraders honestly. Are they demanding more?! Are they boycotting the bikini and beads?! Or are they very happy that they can "play theyselves" and display their bodies for everyone to see?! I think the Mas bands are just giving them what they want and that's "very little" to say the least.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	you are right...and the skin showing is a little bit more almost like Rio..<br>  I used to like the stories of the costumes in each band..now you are just looking at people trying  to dance across the stage because they <br>  have to...
AA10523012	Interesting questions for me are questions, where you can not/or where it is difficult to find the answer through the net or any other sources. I neither have a favorite topic nor subject. But - I like to read about peoples opinions/experiences on certain things depending where they are from and what's their cultural background. <br>  <br>  An interesting question in an Arab section would be: Justitia is blindfolded to treat all people equally no matter of race, skin colour, religion etc. Why do judges in the Middle East not follow these rules?<br>  <br>  Btw: most annoying are all visa related questions and "how much can I save".|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Really I do not care of the topic, what I like is that the question is interesting, I can almost read throw the question what kind of a person that puts the question.

Based on a cost of living study you would need to spend ￡164 in Switzerland for what would cost you ￡100 in Great Britain.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.xe.com/ict/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xe.com/ict/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/18/18598721.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/48/18/18598...</a>

qwsbej9paa	i live in brisbane.<br>  <br>  its nice.<br>  <br>  if ur over 18 the pubs a good place to go.<br>  <br>  otherwise, alot of tourists love to go to the gold coast.<br>  theres the beaches, gold coast is made up of different beaches its not just one big beach, which is wat many people think lol.<br>  <br>  on the gold coast u have movie world, dreamworld, underwater world, white water world, sea world, the auastralia zoo and they have tourist drives from brisbane to the gold coast that show u all the nice scenes of australia.  Lots of things to do on ur drive to the gold coast.<br>  <br>  Oh and the nightlife is pretty good.  At southbank there's a really nice man made beach, in southbank theres the cheapest cinema complex throughout the whole of brisbane!! lol.  its on grey street, so remember that street lol.  Umm..in the city, which is a short walk over a bridge to it, or u can catch the bus if ur that lazy lol, but in the city, on friday's there's dancing on the street, as soon as u cross the bridge ull land urself in the queen street mall...its a street surrounded by shops, myer, internet cafe's, pubs, subway, banks, fashion stores, just all sorts.  Anyways, thats a part of brisbane, im sorry i rambled about it lol.  But if u wanna see pictures or want me to tell u more about australia, hit me up on renae_59@hotmail.com.<br>  <br>  oh and to sydney...umm..the only way i really no of is by plane.  and its just somethin like $150, not too bad, but dont forget about ur accomodation and food and shopping and transport for wat u wanna do when u get there lol.<br>  <br>  ok, ill stop rambling now, and ill leave u with a nice night picture of the mad made southbank beach :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rogerswebsite.com/Australia/66%20-%20Southbank%20Lagoon%20at%20night.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rogerswebsite.com/Australia/6...</a><br>  <br>  cya later! :)|`|GspKFIgnaa	At 6.30 its like both depending on which channel your watching. Brisbane is great, I live just Sth of it, North of Brisbane, Sunshine Coast is beautiful, heaps of buses and trains, though no trains going through from Brisbane to Sydney, plenty of buses though, Greyhound buses run from Bris city all over the country, prices are pretty reasonable, google the Brisbane Transit Centre and that should be able to give you a rough idea, if your staying in Qld, I wouldn't bother with Sydney unless you want to see the touristy things, it's overrated and busy and boring.|`|HTulGtABaa	I live on the Gold Coast which is about an hour south from Brisbane. I've been to Brisbane many times, its a very busy, work-related city, much like somewhere as New York but not quite as crowded or hectic. Theres some great art galleries,street performances,swimming spots, an exhibition & entertainment center where they hold concerts, performances,sales etc... Brisbane is also the home of Rugby League team Brisbane Broncos & AFL team Brisbane Lions,so if you want a energetic, passionate experience, attending a game of Australias national sports is the way to go. I dont think trains go that far, but they do go a long way south & north of Brisbane.If you get time, try come to the Gold Coast, just south of Brisbane,it has Australias best beaches,night life,restaurants,theme parks... basically everything, its definitely worth checking out while you're here. As for the tv shows, they are very dramatic & over played. They do show our Aussie language and lifestyle to some extent but its not real,you're going to love the real thing! Hope you enjoy your stay and experience some of our beautiful countries best attributes, but remember Brisbane is just a tiny part of it, there is soo much more we have to offer.Anyway all the best, good luck with your travels.|`|HkNRR45baa	I live in Queensland, the state which Brisbane is in. I don't actually live in Brisbane, though. Mind you, I go there several times a year because most of my relatives live in Brisbane. I'm not really sure about trains to Sydney to be honest. I usually fly because its so much quicker. The traffic in Sydney is quite bad if you drive there.<br>  <br>  As for Neighbours and Home and Away. They are both very dodgy shows as far as I'm concerned and I wouldn't judge Australia based on them. Queensland is definitely not like those shows, considering neither of them are made in Queensland. The stereotypes on those shows, like the that of Alf on Home and Away are quite ridicules. My bet is throughout your stay in Australia you'll find very few people you even come close to that stereotype.<br>  <br>  While in Brisbane I recommend going to South Bank and QPAC's Lyric Theatre which is at South Bank. If you like the beach then you can go to the Gold Coast or if you prefer quieter beaches then try the Sunshine Coast. For shopping go to Indoorpilly (sp?) or Queen Street Mall. If you're traveling throughout the state then you should go to Yeppoon or the Whitsundays though not right now because we have a cyclone :(|`|U3fwQPcjaa	Congratulations! Brisbane is an amazing city, I should know, I have lived here all my life.

zgTsCicNaa	Edinburgh has more pubs and bars per square mile than any other European city. That may just be the drink talking, but the city does boast an inordinate amount of watering holes, from centuries-old pubs to the latest in contemporary urban chic. There's a bar for everyone in this town and, if that weren't enough, the city is blessed with the most liberal licensing laws in the UK. It is not a problem finding bars open till past midnight any night of the week and many are open till 0100 at weekends, and till 0300 during the Festival and the Christmas/New Year period. There are also bars on Leith Walk that open at 0500, in time for post clubbers still up for a good time. Festival Edinburgh is a place where you can party for 24 hours – as the saying goes: “You can sleep in September”. The city's clubs, mean- while, are no longer simply places to get a late drink. The club scene has undergone a dramatic transformation and any self-respecting raver will be well sorted for the latest dancefloor tunes spun by some of the UK's top DJs. <br>  <br>  Edinburgh's most famous drinking street is Rose Street, a narrow pedestrianized lane between Princes Street and George Street, but it has seen better days and only one or two of its many hostelries are worthy of note. The prime drinking venue now is George Street and the streets running north and south of it. Here you’ll find most of the city’s hip and happening places. Another good destination is the area at the top of Leith Walk known as the "Pink Triangle", where there are many gay or gay-friendly cafés, bars and restaurants. The dark, narrow streets between the Chambers Street and the Royal Mile hide some good bars, especially the Cowgate, which joins the wide expanse of the Grassmarket, a big drinking street that gets very lively at weekends and is particularly popular with students and visiting hen and stag parties. An area with a diverse mix of drinking holes is Leith. Here you'll find everything from the roughest spit-and-sawdust joints to the trendiest waterside warehouse conversions. The city's club scene has now pretty much recovered from the effects of the fire that destroyed several venues at the end of 2002, with most nights finding new permanent homes. <br>  <br>  Opening hours Note that in Scotland people tend to speak of bars rather than pubs and many of them listed here are open from 1100-0100 Monday-Saturday and 1230-2400 on Sunday. All of clubs venues listed open from between 2200-2230 to 0300 (Festival and Christmas/New Year also applies allowing opening to 0500). Standard charges are from ￡8-￡10 for members and ￡10-￡13 for non members.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.footprintguides.com/Edinburgh/Bars-and-Clubs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.footprintguides.com/Edinburgh...</a><br>  <br>  Edinburgh.

BJERgbM5aa	I don't think they have much of a case against you, regardless of the judgment that they obtained.  First of all, the judgment was a 'default judgment'.  they obtained it because you didn't appear in court to answer the complaint.  These kind of judgments can be easily opened up by a defendant (you), so that you can have your day in court.  They know this.  Second of all, even with the judgment in hand, they did not pursue enforcement or collection of this debt in apx. 20 years.  That almost automatically inhibits collection procedures.  Voluntary payments by you after all that time was a mistake but can be overcome.  Go back to court.  File a complaint stating the two reasons mentioned above.  And demand repayment of money that you voluntarily paid.  Cite the fact that you paid in error, thinking that it was so old and you probably did own the money but upon further investigation, you discovered that you did not. OR   OR     OR  , send a registered mail letter to the company stating that you made an error and you do not owe the money.  And if the really did have a judgment, why didn't they enforce it?  And why didn't they serve you with the judgment?  And demand your voluntary payments back.  Give them 3 days to respond.  If they do not respond, Go to court as indicated above and use part of that demand letter as your cause against them.
xnTC73cXaa	unless they're TOTALLY korean, as in cant speak much english korean, then your pretty safe just turning around and starting a friendly chat. ^^ honestly, it doesnt really matter how much korean you can speak if you wanna be friends. i have a friend who is in the same situation that your in and on the 1st day of school, he just came up and talked to me. and today---he and i still have a really great relationship even though hes more korean american :D now, if you want to talk to 1st generation korean people, then ya, often times speaking korean to them can make them feel more comfortable with you. plus---its a fair trade (: you can teach them english and they can teach you korean~|`|4YU35t51aa	Just stop being an americanized idiot and try to be Korean. Prolly the koreans would lol at you.|`|Kq59KRtYaa	dude, when you are sitting next to them it is perfectly safe to start a conversation either in korean or in english. Just act the same way you would when you want to make regular friends. It is easier when their alone not in groups. It WOULD be embarassing to butt in a big korean clique/group. Koreans are very nice and social. Most of them dont close them off from strangers. Just try saying hi or start a small conversation or a BIG one it doens't fkng matter|`|05HY0oScaa	try www.interpals.net Korean languge is second after English among those penpals.|`|fhDPOAKLaa	Why don't you get in touch with your school's Korean /  Korean American or Asian American students' organization?  You can meet people at the meetings, events, and such, and tell them more about yourself.  Or if there is a language exchange / conversation partner program at your school, you could participate and request to be matched with a Korean-speaking partner.  <br>  <br>  I'm a Korean American back in Korea now for a while.  My Korean is not great, and sometimes the cultural differences due to my American side are a bit of a challenge, but I stay focused on the positive and what I can do for my friends.  Good luck!

pgFD4n1Caa	I've been to many major U.S citiies and done my share of shopping and overall the shopping experience in Seattle is great. I'm not just talking about the malls - frankly the malls have less personality. Downtown Seattle has great shops, the local neighborhoods like Fremont have excellent little boutiques. The malls that I do like are Bellevue Square, University Village (which really isn't a mall - more like a shopping district) and the outlets in Marysville. Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood is okay but I personally dislike the LYnnwood area.  The biggest of course is south center but frankly the area is too ghetto for my tastes.|`|AA10285685	Also remember Westlake, the southern terminus of the monorail @ 5th and pine. Not all that large as malls go, but it is still there, right in downtown. Also there is Northgate mall as U head north on I 5.<br>  <br>  Timothy<br>  <br>  :o)|`|5yPw4TDfaa	If you go to The Westfield Mall it is huge! It has every store, and its pretty.<br>  <a href="http://westfield.com/southcenter/ourstores/" rel="nofollow">http://westfield.com/southcenter/ourstor...</a>|`|jXuU5uVraa	The malls in Seattle are simply phenomenal. Westlake Mall is one of the best because of its giant size, and its location, (in the middle of downtown!). But my favorite is Alderwood mall because it has so many trendy shops (such as Alley Kat, Forever 21, and American Apparel.) Also if you are looking for bohemian clothing i would try the university district.|`|AA11622926	Alderwood is good for meeting hot guys  ; )<br>  Lol anyways, Northgate and Alderwood are both really good for shopping and just hanging out with your friends, cause they're good places to people watch<br>  the U-Village is also fun, they have a lot of good restaurants, but the shops are kinda more upscale and a little more expensive.<br>  Southcenter is HUGE and amazing for shopping and just hanging out, but it's kinda hard to get to and not in the best area<br>  Downtown Seattle is also good for shopping<br>  Hope this helps  =)|`|GQTaKHCvaa	Go to Southcenter (It's actually called Westfield South Center if you want to look it up, but nobody calls it that). It's the best.<br>  <br>  Some other ones around/ in Seattle are:<br>  <br>  Northgate: small and empty, but it has a new parking lot<br>  Pacific Place: really quiet with lots of "high class" stores. there's a movie theater and a johnny rockets, so yum<br>  Westfield: (Not the same as Southcenter). It sucks, it's small and nothing really in it. I would only go there because there are other stores around it (since it's downtown). <br>  The Supermall: Sort of far out of town. Very big with a few outlet department stores... lots of shoes... <br>  Factoria: There's nothing here! Just a baby store, a nordstrom rack, and target. the best thing is the ice cream (coldstone!!!)<br>  <br>  there are a few more, but yeah...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ckZ2UcaAaa	Why is a garden rake?<br>  <br>  That's probably an easier question to answer.

2q1XI0j9aa	Okay if you are looking at the commuter express, leaving denton and going to lewisville or further you look at the southbound route. for coming back you look at the northbound route...  The times start in the morning so the first time on there is AM then it goes to noon and then pm. Make sure you look at both schedules, Southbound for going towards Dallas, Northbound fro coming back to Denton. Once you get into Carrollton you can get on a DART bus or train or the TRE and actually go to work in Dallas or fort worth if you find a job there. You will be having early mornings and long days with the way the schedule is, It won't be convenient but if you dont have a car or need to save money you dont have a choice. The earliest you can get back to Denton is 5:17 PM.  There are tons of Jobs in Lewisville because of the mall and all the restaurants, so I would definitely limit your search to just close to Denton even though you may not want to.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	Isn't there a phone number for DCTA Commuter Express you can call to ask?  I'll bet a lot of people in Dallas have never heard of DCTA so they can't help you.  I haven't.  Sorry.|`|mDYsr62maa	Most people drive into the Carrollton Park and Ride or just drive into Dallas.

uyQppMYLaa	I've never done an exchange in France but I've done an exchange with a German school three times. The first time several of my friends went. We spent a lot of time together and had a great time. The second and third Time I was staying on my own. It was a lot more difficult, and I did get homesick, but I still had the fantastic time. The second and third time I did work experience, and not only was it great fun, but it really improved my language skills and looked great on my CV. I have been asked about it in interviews and all the interviewers were impressed by the fact that I had lived away from home and worked.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, it is difficult. You will feel homesick and i is difficult to be immersed in another language. But it is also great fun, even without your friends. If you are lucky, like I was, you will make friendships that will last for years. I got on so well with one of my partners that we have visited each other's houses as holidays, and indeed the two of us are going camping together this summer. I'd say go for it. It's also, as I have recently discovered, very good practise for when you go to university, as you prove to yourself early on that you can live away from home.<br>  <br>  Go for it. Trust me, it's well worth it.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	With an exchange, you normally spend a week or two in their house with them, then they come and stay in your house with you.<br>  <br>  It's the best way to learn French I reckon. I had an amazing time when I went, of course it's strange but then it's a different country but the experience is brilliant and you'll see and learn so much.<br>  <br>  It's only for a few days so as long as you're not a complete wuss who gets homesick easily, freaks out in different situations and cries for their Mum, you'll be fine!|`|Ia4jEzQ4aa	I'm doing that this summer. There are different types of exchanges, some last longer than others and everything like that.

So we're together all the time :) I'm not like alone in her house.<br>  <br>  I know there are some exchanges that differ, so when you find a program, just look around their website and see what its all about

It is bureacratic sadly!<br>  <br>  The only way to find out for certain is to visit the official Russian Consulate website for your country.<br>  <br>  I can only speak about the UK, so will tell you how I get my visa from the consulate in London, I do this independantly, NOT through an agency, which will charge you more as a processing fee.<br>  <br>  I have to send a copy of my passport to a russian travel company, and book accommodation through them and then they will issue you an official invitation, which gives your details and shows that you have paid for accommodation in your chosen city to visit. (Around 30 Euros for this)<br>  <br>  Next. When I have my invitation, I then have to complete the Visa application form online. Print this off (please for the love of god make sure you read the stipulations about printing this off!) and then send to the russian consulate.<br>  <br>  You will need to send with this 1) Your passport 2) The appropriate fee 3) The invitation you received from the travel company 4) Valid Travel insurance covering European Russia 5) Pre paid special delivery envelope 6) Photographs of yourself as required on the form.<br>  <br>  Then it is a case of waiting!<br>  <br>  Dont forget that if you go for more than 72 hours, you will need to be registered as a temporary resident.<br>  The travel company that supplies your invitation voucher will be able to help with this, but you will have to visit them to give details and to pick up your voucher. Again this is about 30 euros.<br>  <br>  It is expensive, whichever way you do it. Like I say, it is more expensive to do it through an agency as you will have to pay a processing fee.<br>  <br>  I have been to Russia several times and always done this independantly and have had no problems getting my visa at all. I have certainly never had to send a bank statement.<br>  <br>  If you need any help, please do add me, I will assist you wherever I can!<br>  Good luck!

kgBPU4xxaa	Unless you have a car, there really isn't a good option for getting to Bergamo early from Florence. When I fly out of Orio al Serio in Bergamo, I stay overnight in Milan near the train station and take one of the early buses from Milano Centrale station to the airport. I use this site to find the best hotel rate: <a href="http://en.venere.com/italy/" rel="nofollow">http://en.venere.com/italy/</a><br>  <br>  There isn't a train that will get you to Milan or Bergamo for the really early flights from Florence. Note that you cannot just arrive in Milan late the night before your flight and sleep in the waiting room of Milano Centrale station - the station is closed and they kick people out while it's being cleaned.<br>  <br>  You could also just get a hotel in Bergamo the night before your flight out.
d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	I like hiking trails, although I've never done a hike that lasted more than one day. Japanese hiking trails tend to be less strenuous but have more cultural sites and things to see along the way. I'll try to list some that I've done...<br>  <br>  Kamo-cho (in southern Kyoto prefecture) has a nice hiking trail. The main trail begins and ends at two different temples. In between there are ancient stone buddha carvings scattered about. If you do this, buy the map at the first temple (100 yen, I think). It shows you the trail, as well as marking where each of the stone carvings is located. It's like a hiking trail and a scavenger hunt, although it's not so difficult to find them (just occasionally the map is helpful when you reach forks in the road and there are no signs).<br>  <br>  Mount Daisen (Daisen City, Tottori prefecture) is a nice hike. Daisenji Temple is quite nice, and when you hike high enough, you can see the Sea of Japan.<br>  <br>  Kurama (just north of Kyoto) makes a nice half-day hike. The nature is quite beautiful along the trail, and there are a few temples and shrine there. There is also an onsen.<br>  <br>  Tenri and Sakurai (Nara prefecture) have many hiking trails. The scenery is quite nice and there are shrines and other sites along the trail.<br>  <br>  If you want a longer hike (maybe more strenuous, also), you can use bike trails for hiking.<br>  <br>  The Kibiji District Cycling Trail (Okayama) is a great trail with a good variety of sites (temples, shrines, small museums, kofuns (burial mounds), and more). The sites along the trail have rich history, and some are connected to the story of Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-Mikoto, which the famous tale of Momotaro is said to have originated from. The trail is 15 kilometers long. To walk the trail AND see the sites, you'll need a day.<br>  <br>  Asuka (in Nara) is another popular bike trail that has a wide variety of historical and cultural sites. I haven't been there, but it may be worth considering also.<br>  <br>  If you want a challenging hike, then I would recommend looking into some of the pilgrimage routes. The Shikoku 88 temple pilgrimage route is actually meant to be hiked! You'd need months to complete this, but with five days, you COULD choose a section of it and hike it.<br>  <br>  The Kii Mountain pilgrimage route is a World Heritage site (spanning Wakayama, Nara, and Mie prefectures).

bru2xnlRaa	I was born in 1956. Gas stations used to give the maps away for free back then. I suspect the value isn't much, depends on what you really do have. I have seen them at garage sales, flea markets and online. If you have a map with special information or notations it might be worth something more. There is often someone with some sort of " sentimental value " who will pay.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	I think I would like to see it...haha<br>  <br>  If you don't want it you should donate it to a local muesem, maybe even to the City of Sacramento or the State or California.

d0ff48441cb372a53ded2d0fa9ac55bfaa	Unless all you want is flash, and you wish a true understanding of America, for heaven's sake include New England!!  Especially Boston, Portland and nearby Maine, and Vermont (and if you get to northern Vermont consider a side trip to Montréal - if you are American you will then need passports; if you are not American make sure you comply with Canadian passport and visa requirements).  In New York include upstate, especially the Finger Lakes area.  Do a side trip to Toronto - now the most multicultural large city in the world (no, it's not N.Y.C. or L.A.).  Roam to Chicago via "middle America's" central Ohio and Indiana.<br>  Don't miss the Nebraska and Kansas prairie.  The beautiful emptiness but fine friendly people of the Dakotas into Montana, then down through Wyoming, along and into the Rockies through Colorado and New Mexico.  Side trip into Texas.  Then into the majestic deserts of Arizona.  In Nevada continue more nothward to Reno before hopping to California.  After California don't miss Portland Oregon and the coast, and of course from there to Seattle.  A cross-Washington side trip to Spokane is beautiful, also a final Canadian side trip to Vancouver.<br>  <br>  There are no places necessarily to avoid, but, as a general rule for single young girls Canada is safer than the US, and in the US the northern states have considerably less violent and rip-off crime than do the southern and southwestern states.|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Avoid Underground Atlanta!<br>  A real good idea is to buy a National Parks Pass. This will get you both into any national park (camping fees excluded) in the US. National parks in the US are the greatest. In California, don't miss Redwood National Forest and Yosemite National Park. In Nevada/Arizona go to Hoover Dam and pay the extra money to do the Hard Hat Tour, it's so worth it. You are right on with Vegas, it is a must see; if you are not used to arrid climates, take your lip gloss and moisturizing eye drops with you and drink a lot of water.<br>  New York is cool, like Vegas, you can be out at 3:00 a.m. and there are so many people  out it's like the middle of the day.<br>  Florida, Homasassa Springs is beautiful, and positively go to Sarasota and Longboat Key, it's a paradise.|`|AA10054180	the links are some of the things we did in San Diego:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-pggut2no&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2-pggut2...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQbsmL8jWNQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQbsmL8jW...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v5wKPuvm_o&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v5wKPuvm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nw1_6n0Pc4&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nw1_6n0P...</a><br>  <br>  i would suggest you avoid Tijuana...not a safe place for two young females....good luck and be safe.

aVJyU3Tjaa	I know this sounds terrible, but whenever I'm in Greece or Cyprus, i crash any wedding going! And I don't mean the ceremony, I mean the reception!<br>  <br>  Typically, most Greek weddings are huge, just huge. And the bride and groom probably don't even know half the people there. The wedding begins in the Orthodox church. I'm not sure if you've ever been in an Orthodox church, but they're very ornate and elaborate. Just a tip: people dress up a lot for Greek weddings. <br>  <br>  The ceremony is long, and, even if you understand Greek, nobody knows what the Priest is going on about because most of the service is in ancient Greek! <br>  <br>  Then there is the reception, which is often in a large restaurant, and often outdoors. Lots of meat, lots of Carlsberg. And its all free. And in abundance. Take advantage of this! Though first you'll have to queue for ages to congratulate the newlyweds. Then there's a lot of music and dancing. For sure, they do not break plates, or shout 'oupa!'. <br>  <br>  And people bring money instead of presents.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped:) Have fun!|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	When I was stationed in Cyprus during the early 60s, one of my colleagues married a Greek Cypriot girl and I took their wedding photographs.<br>  <br>  They are very colourfull and lots of fun, the priest not only let me take photographs during the long but extremely interesting service, he stopped half way and told me that I hadn't taken one of him yet.<br>  <br>  The reception/party afterwards is something else and full of traditional entertainment like the breaking of plates, during the couples first dance together, well wishers pin money in the form of banknotes or cheques on them while they dance, my mate and his new wife had about ￡1,000 on them when they came off the floor.<br>  <br>  It's not unusual for the groom to be given a dowry by the bride's father, my mate still owns an orange grove in Cyprus.|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	No we dont break plates.That was back in the 60's maybe? Now its strictly forbidden, maybe some greek americans still do that in the states. People get dressed very chic, especially the ladies, before we used to throw rice during the wedding, now its forbidden to do that in the church. Regarding the reception, depends on the families background and where the reception will take place. My sisters had the reception in 5 star hotels here in Athens so everything was elegant , caviar, salmon etc, but there are others (families from villages) that do a lot of fuss and have lots of fun, dancing like crazy, drinking etc.|`|e24b072e8467456a3dca679f200c1f38aa	Customs vary a bit from place to place. Ceremony (town hall or Church) is pretty calm, Rice and Sugared Almonds are thrown. The reception can get pretty wild; all sorts of things are thrown as confetti and plates &c. do get smashed. Pinning banknotes n the bride is local to Cypress I was told. Expect a big meal with one course of Lamb, lots of drink, loud music, traditional dancing. NB Zorba is not traditional!|`|BgouZaeSaa	Many people,much food,much wine,much music (mostly traditional),dancing,wine,,dancing,many voices,dancing,dancing,dancing until the morning|`|CJbSrsQdaa	Two guys in front of the altar?|`|qo7e7m4Oaa	We dont break plates in weddings that was way back in the 60's and i honestly dont know why this stereotype still exists in the outside world. We do drop rice when the bride and groom get out of the church. I never heard of pinning money in a woman's bridal dress, it must be a Cypriot thing. However there is money dropped on the floor when the men (usually the bride's father dances rembetiko) Greek weddings are always large with lots of dancing, dancing and dancing lol. from traditional folk to slow to rembetiko to modern u name it lol. And we cant forget the food too! yummm lol =)|`|1iPi6BJKaa	we don't break plates, at least not anymore.<br>  but we do stuff money in the bride's shoe.

I am 100% sure that both of them will be in coalition. Likud and Israel Beitenu are having a meeting today were they are expected to finalize their agreement and Shas also in negotiations. Israel Beitenu and Shas also had series of meetings to come to compromise between them. To my liking Shas will sell anything if the price is right. Mark my words both of them will be in|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Whichever one is prepared to retain control of Israel & not concede any land. G-d despised Esau because he despised his birthright. Israel must not make the same mistake by granting land for peace. History has shown trading land for peace is not effective. Arabs own 23 countries while Israel owns a piece of land the size of Vermont. Why isn't Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon or ANY other already existing Arab/Muslim country not giving up some land to their fellow Arabs? Why do they feel driven to parcel up the land of Israel?
M1oVSlZdaa	Common logic suggest launch 8,000 back and see what happens.<br>  <br>  But I think more "palestinians" might have died this way. <br>  <br>  You see, the reason Israel limits their own casualties is because the GOVERNMENT CARES. Installing the Tzeva Adom and having officials everywhere. <br>  <br>  Hamas would not do this and rather 1,000 of these little "palestinians" die to get the media affection. <br>  Happened before and it will happen again.<br>  <br>  Arieh- so what you suggest Israel do?Lte the rockets coming?God ur dumber than I thought.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Well, I certainly wouldn't retaliate by killing off the opposition's innocent civilian population through indiscriminate bombing.  Those 8,000 rockets were never a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.  They were more of a nuisance.  One child killed is too many when dealing with a nuisance.  Hamas is a puppet whose strings are controlled by Syria and Iran (who are real threats to Israel).  Those are the real enemies whom Israel should have attacked.  Then Hamas would cease to be a terrorist entity and would negotiate in good faith.|`|iCMrsV9daa	Israel, with the fourth strongest military in the world, and empowered by US support, has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip (or ‘Palestinian Territories’) since 1967. The Palestinians have no military, few weapons, and no powerful allies.<br>  <br>  Israel’s occupation controls almost all aspects of Palestinian life. Children have difficult getting to school, parents to work, the sick and injured to hospitals, because Israel has erected hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks obstructing Palestinian movement around their own country. <br>  <br>  In addition to the daily difficulty posed by roadblocks, Israel has the ability – which it uses with disturbing frequency – to completely shut down parts or all of the West Bank and Gaza. Sometimes Israel imposes, by force of arms, a ‘curfew’ for an entire city or village. Heavily-armed Israeli troops enter civilian cities in tanks and armored vehicles, to prevent all inhabitants from leaving their houses for weeks or months at a time (only broken up by occasional hour-long respites, to allow residents to obtain food).<br>  <br>  In 2002, Israel began constructing a barrier through the Palestinian West Bank, confiscating huge tracts of land, demolishing many homes and crops, cutting off many Palestinians from their means of survival, and making travel even more difficult for the entire population.<br>  <br>  Every so often Israel ‘re-invades’, a section of the West Bank or Gaza strip, wreaking havoc above and beyond the ‘normal’ obstructions to movement described above. In the course of these invasions, much of the infrastructure for a future Palestinian state has been destroyed, many people have been killed, and much personal property – cars, homes, etc. – has been stolen or obliterated<br>  <br>  IF IT WAS UP TO ME, ID LAUNCH 50 0000 ROCKETS ON YOUR LAND HOW ABOUT THAT!?|`|B5Y46XBoaa	As someone else said, I don't think it's a matter of "if" but "when. And if it was up to me, I'd bulldoze Gaza into the Sinai Peninsula where it belongs and then plant tanks along the entire border to make sure the cancer doesn't grow back.|`|NdIfCZbIaa	the right question is <br>  if someone took ur land won't u launches rockets to him ?<br>  and if u did that ? will u be mistaken ?<br>  <br>  and even if someone launches 8 rockets to my land is that enough reason to terminate all the nation .|`|VS92WBLtaa	Just ask yourself: have I done something wrong to deserve that?<br>  If you come up empty then any answer I am going to give you it's of no use to you.<br>  The Machine|`|TA4rdQM3aa	Ask yourself why they might be doing that. Perhaps you would enjoy being pushed off your land?|`|bmhnXEsVaa	I suspect it's not a matter of "if", but "when". There is coming a nuclear war in the Middle East. The surrounding nations will be devastated, which will open up Israel's boarders & grant access to expanding their territory.|`|i7oHTo9haa	This is what Netanyahu said to do before but he wasn't calling the shots, Olmert was:<br>  <br>  achieve clear victory against Hamas to cripple it's ability to launch rockets<br>  smuggling corridors sealed<br>  not wait 8 years, months, weeks, days to respond this time<br>  <br>  Netanyahu in King David with foreign press<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqECWfh4iWw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqECWfh4i...</a><br>  <br>  I say just drop 8,000.  I'm sick of what's going on and I want it to stop.  I wanted Israel to make a "green zone" like America did in Iraq and there is plenty of room in negev for this.  Pull out the women and children 12 and under and then start pulling out the younger ones, one by one into a safe zone, until they don't want to come out anymore.  Then go in and finally clean up that mess once and for all and drop the 8,000 back to them.<br>  <br>  I also want to see everyone live under Israeli sovereignty.  If the terrorists are gone there is no reason for people to live peacably side by side.  If they have issues with living next to a Jewish neighbor, they will have to move, not the Jewish family.  Israel can absorb this populace successfully without a takeover if she is a theocracy. Build up Gaza back after that is done and they would still have a place. If Israel doesn't take charge there really is no future because they keep educating those children in kindergarten to suicide bomb so it is bigger problem then just rockets it is that the rockets will never stop. Israel can accomplish so much if she's united and puts her mind to it.<br>  <br>  If Israel can successfully solve the Palestinian crisis it takes much of the momentum off the rest of Islamic extremism.  They would be like angry people without a cause :)

Some time later, people from other parts of the world arrived, brought along their culture and religions and settled down in this island for opportunities. It went on for centuries and this phenomenon still remains.<br>  <br>  So basically, we are used to living with different people of different religions and different cultural habits.

Lots of young travelers, too.|`|GlSUoVSFaa	Depends where you want to go and things you want to do and visit<br>  <br>  I live in LA and whenever friends come over there are many things you can do in the city for free or low price<br>  -Hotel around 85 night for like a Ramada or Radisson in an ok (2-3 star).. it all varies depending in area, that would be like a <br>  -Movies around 12-14 dlls<br>  -Food around 14-20 medium priced restaurant.. fast food is about 7 per per meal<br>  -disneyland 70 ticket plus 10 parking plus 25 for meal inside and a snack ... or do Knotts Berry farms where the tickets are usually on sale for like 35dlls<br>  -LACMA (LA county museum of art) free after 5pm (i think everyday now)<br>  -Getty Museum -Free all the time, pay 8.50 for parking<br>  -Visiting beaches and piers, ex. Redondo, Santa Monica, Seal Beach, Hermosa Beach, Long Beach .. free just pay parking meters<br>  -Hollywood walk of fame, Hollywood/Highland, free just parking<br>  -El Capitan Disney Theatre ~$16<br>  -Graunman's Chinese Theatre ~$13<br>  -Griffith Park, Hollywood Sign Look, Free<br>  -Clubs free before 10 mostly after might be cover 10-15, drinks depends on the club some are fruity and watered down for $10, some are pretty strong for $5 ... happy hour most places have it weekedays til 8 for $5 or less drinks and appetizers<br>  <br>  All you do in LA you will need a car tough the city is huge and make sure the car has GPS or you are very good with maps... and have patience... 20 miles might take you 20 mins or 2 hrs<br>  Gas is around 2.25 per gallon, more or less depending on neighborhood being cheaper in the eastside and the valley and more expensive in the westside and hollywood.

N7G26k4Iaa	It is not possible to buy a ticket from Phoenix to Cuba.  To go to Cuba, legally, you need to apply for a special permit from the US government, which you can only get if you have direct relatives in Cuba or a couple of other charitable-based categories.  And then there are specific flights from Florida only for those with the permit.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	There are no direct flights, but if there were, they would take about 3.5 hours.|`|PA0bGBtCaa	What you can do legally though is fly to a nearby island and take an "island hopper" flight into Cuba. I wouldn't recommend that though as the US government really does not want you flying there without special permission. Doing so without the permission can get you trapped in Cuba. I'd steer clear of it. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, a nonstop flight (if it existed) to Cuba from Phoenix would be approximately 5 hours 15 minutes at an airspeed of 450 knots. That would be less if you went faster and more if you went slower.|`|ssYRhvdfaa	Easy...........you can't.<br>  <br>  Any American citizen caught in Cuba will get hammered big time....

3iL7V04waa	I'm doing a French exchange with my school in a month, and I already did an exchange for a month in Germany last summer.  <br>  <br>  I would actually say it's better to go alone.  When you go with other English speakers you know, you tend to gravitate more toward them and speak English, which is exactly not what you want to do.  <br>  If you find a good, accredited program, then you should be perfectly safe.  There are also some government scholarships out there that will pay for you to study abroad, so if you were to be granted one of those, you could definitely ensure your safety since it's through the government and they wouldn't want something to happen to someone they're sponsoring.  Make sure to research all possible programs and find the best one for you.<br>  <br>  What is your safety concern, exactly?
hRnEf90Naa	Hmm.. Hi Ghanouge, you don't know a single man who has cheated because men don't share this kind of information with girls/ women and they want to keep it that way! and probably same goes for women....<br>  <br>  I am sharing with you all this e-mail sent to me by a friend.... again the thoughts are not mine nor I agree with it but take as joke and probably as information as it must have been written by some man : )<br>  <br>  #CASE 1<br>  Getting married is like going to a restaurant with friends. You order what you want, then when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that. <br>  <br>  #CASE 2 <br>  At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, "Aren't you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger??" The other replied, "Yes, I am. I married the wrong man." <br>  <br>  #CASE 3 <br>  Before a man is married, he is incomplete. Then when he is married, he is finished. <br>  <br>  #CASE 4 <br>  Marriage is an institution in which a man losses his bachelor's degree and the woman gets her master's status. <br>  <br>  #CASE 5 <br>  A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to get married??" And the father replied, "I don't know son, I'm still paying for it." <br>  <br>  #CASE 6 <br>  Young son : "Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa, a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her?" <br>  Dad : "That happens in most countries son." <br>  <br>  #CASE 7 <br>  Then there was a man who said, "I never knew what real happiness was until I got married, and then it was too late." <br>  <br>  #CASE 8 <br>  A happy marriage is a matter of give and take; the husband gives and the wife takes.<br>  <br>  #CASE 9 <br>  When a newly married man looks happy, we know why. But when a ten-year married man looks happy, we wonder why. Affair ? <br>  <br>  #CASE 10 <br>  In the first year of marriage, the man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they both speak and the neighbors listen. <br>  <br>  #CASE 11 <br>  After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, "You know, I was a fool when I married you." And the Husband replied, "Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice it." <br>  <br>  #CASE 12 <br>  A man inserted an 'ad' in the classified : "Wife wanted". The next day, he received hundreds letters. They all said the same thing "You can have mine." <br>  <br>  #CASE 13 <br>  When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of one thing : either the car is new or his wife is new. <br>  <br>  #CASE 14 <br>  A woman was telling her friend : "It is I who made my husband a millionaire." <br>  "And what was he before you married him?" the friend asked. The woman replied, "A Billionaire."|`|YH375R9jaa	I don't know, I'll never do it and have never once thought about it.

PA0bGBtCaa	No, your languages you speak will certainly help you get hired by the airline! Your routes you fly are strictly based on seniority with the airline. Once you have enough time, you can bid those trips where you can use your languages. But when you first start off, you're on "reserve status." That means you get whatever open lines there are out there. I know many international flight attendants for American Airlines. None of them speak anything other than English and they fly mostly Paris, Germany, Italy, and London. They all have over 25 years of flying experience with AA, so they just pick and choose what routes they want to fly on.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Yes, it can.  It will help you get hired (if they're hiring, many airlines are laying off right now).  But it can get you bid denied too.  This means if and airline is flying a route, Shanghai for example, and not many Chinese speakers work for the airline you might be denied flying elsewhere an be sent to Shanghai each month.  This may be good but if you want to fly other places it could be bad.  I've seen people give up their language qualifications because they are bid denied to fly everywhere in the international system.|`|xIHgTqVhaa	Yes it can. <br>  <br>  I worked for two airlines. Both had "language positions". Depending on the airline and routes, this could be good news, bad news or not change anything. <br>  <br>  If it's a needed language, you could end up only doing those routes. Our Portuguese speakers only saw Rio. The German speakers got a little tired of Frankfurt. The Russian speakers only went to Moscow. I spoke French and we were a dime-a-dozen so it didn't affect us much. There were only a handful of French lines. Same with Spanish.<br>  <br>  Transferring can help get you out of this position. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it can help. I have a friend who with her airline and at her base, would be on reserve but if she bids a German line, she can hold it and then do international flying that only the more senior people can fly. She also earns more money doing them.<br>  <br>  Does this mean she's the most junior on the crew. YES! <br>  <br>  So it's variable. Just speaking a language helps you get hired but you could be hired to just do that. I was offered the job by a (third) airline and they said "You will fly Paris and be based in X city". I declined and went with the other airline since the French wouldn't limit me.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  P.S. Find out what level they want. One airline just needed conversational. The other you had to be super-fluent. That also is variable and you may want to concentrate on improving your 2nd or 3rd language for now.|`|XlRC5NFdaa	Not necessarily, it all depends on the airline you are working for. I have seen many flight attendants for example from American going to Mexico or South America and not speaking Spanish.<br>  And now all the security procedure videos are recorded so the flight attendants don't even have to read it anymore.<br>  But everything extra will help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

Large firefights have taken place in many towns and cities across Mexico but most recently in northern Mexico, including Tijuana, Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juarez.  During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area.  The U.S. Mission in Mexico currently restricts non-essential travel to the state of Durango and all parts of the state of Coahuila south of Mexican Highways 25 and 22 and the Alamos River for U.S. government employees assigned to Mexico.  This restriction was implemented in light of the recent increase in assaults, murders, and kidnappings in those two states.

mSVXV2gbaa	It is about a 40 mile trip.  Part of the confusion is that parts of Indiana are on Daylight Savings TIme, and others are not.  <br>  My guess is that you would want the South Bend Airport to start, but either Carroll Avenue or 11th Street would be your destination.  Please look at the whole schedule, and it would tell you the time change info.  <br>  I would suggest calling the place where the class is offered and asking them what stop they are closest to.  <br>  Also, if you are going to use the South Shore (what we locals call the NICTD), buy your tickets ahead of time if at all possible.  Also, if this is a class you will attend regularly, get a 10 or 25 ride pass.  It will be cheaper.|`|TskZHzZyaa	Hey there, the South shore is a great resource but as you see from the schedule the travel times are limited, especially east of Michigan City.  The South Shore seems really geared toward the people taking it in to Chicago, and there are some people that actually commute from South Bend to work in Chicago, crazy as that sounds.<br>  <br>  You are on the right track with schedules and costs.  It's not cheap but if you don't have a car it is your best option.  If you do plan to take the train consider getting a good folding bike to ride from the station to the classes, unless someone can pick you up - and a bag for the bike is mandatory.  Though it's not a terrible walk, looks like a mile.<br>  <br>  I took it once from Carroll Avenue to Dune Park and that was $4.15, which I thought was kind of a rip off.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that South Bend/St Joseph County is on Eastern time and Michigan City/LaPorte County is on Central/Chicago time, all year round as of a few years ago.  So if you leave MC at 10:20 you get to the airport at 11:07 CT, which is 12:07 ET.<br>  <br>  If your class is frequent say five days a week monthly pass is the way to go.  I imagine it's once a week so 10 or 25 pass is probably best depending on how long the class lasts.
asaLj4BTaa	No, there is not such things in beijing.<br>  Taking subway, you can be any place  with 2rmb, taking bus, 0.4rmb/10kilometers, the forbidden city 60rmb, the summer palace 30 in winter, 50 in summer. The cost is very cheap  even though no discounts.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	No, but its pretty cheap to travel in Beijing already, as compared to those places you mention like Seoul or Stockholm or New York City or London. No need for any passes, just purchase token and you have a cheap ride on its metro. Its attractions are neither expensive also.
4NxXKJBjaa	There is a 1-day open ticket available for use on the Tokyo Metro for ￥710 and a combined Metro/Toei subway ticket for ￥1000.  Note that it is only for the subway, not for JR.<br>  <br>  There is a seperate open 1-day Tokyo-area JR ticket for ￥730.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	I don't think anything is free in Japan.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	metro 1 day pass|`|eAMbWkahaa	Check out <a href="http://www.tokyosubway.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.tokyosubway.info</a><br>  Remember Tokyo has many train systems, so choose one that you might be good for your travel plans.  "Metro" is just one of the two subways, and only one of the many train companies.<br>  Because of this, getting one pass that covers all the trains is usually a waste of money, usually you can save money by riding only one train system but again review the site and chose what you might be good for you.<br>  Or you can get a Suica or Pasmo card which isn't a pass, but it saves you the trouble of getting a new ticket each time.  Again check the site out, its very useful.<br>  <br>  Also technically speaking Tokyo isn't a city..but that's another story.<br>  <br>  There's also an awesome museum pass you might want to look into getting:<br>  <a href="http://www.museum.or.jp/grutto/about-e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.museum.or.jp/grutto/about-e.h...</a><br>  However it is only issued at certain points of the year (depending on when you are traveling) the recent one just ended.

AA10523012	Assuming that you did not pay a fortune anyway and you also may not have a receipt, let it go and don't waste any more money.<br>  <br>  Of course it's just logical to share the costs of driving, but if he as a private person offered transportation against money, that's illegal and you took a illegal service.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	The procedure is the police have to bring him in first before they tell you (both) to go to court. Unless perhaps you don't know where he lives , and you don't know his car plate number from which they can pull the address. You could try asking the police to give you a copy of the report so you can show it as proof to whatever party that keeps information on this person to help you track him down ..<br>   In court the judge can ask Etisalat to turn over the passport copy they keep on file , from which he can be located thru immigration records (place of employment registered with them).<br>  <br>  It is well known unmarked taxis are illegal in Dubai , and there are heavy fines up to confiscating the vehicle if caught , let alone if this person is a theif as well. I know quite a few advertise in the classifieds but it is illegal , and as such you have no legal protection like you do if this was a licenced taxi. Even with all that , you got no receipt  ?|`|uidg8Uh0aa	go to police and press charges, go to other police station and say this is theft. <br>  if he is legal driver with license, you can report him to RTA for not honouring his business, otherwise you can also report him for being illegal taxi.<br>  <br>  otherwise arrange for someone else to call him to hire him as a carlift and when he goes to pick him up or deposit him, be there and explain yourself with him.|`|DSVUvfGuaa	No receipt .... No money back , so simple it is friend. <br>  Just bad luck to you, and a lesson in life to be care full in the future.<br>  Best of luck next time.
s2IOyj8iaa	Whoops you posted this on the travel section . Never mind but you may get more answers if you put it on the health section. Name someone that has never done anything wrong in the past. I doubt anyone can do that. Mistakes are something we learn from. Use them to your advantage and in the long run can make you rather wise. As soon as they arise then do something play music or try and laugh about them try seeing them as immature and now the feelings have come to show you these mistakes have made be a better person because I've learnt they are not what to do or what i want. Set yourself some goals.|`|oECtQgtlaa	hey..dont worry.it happend in the past.we learn our whole life..and your mistakes wont happen again,once u did them.i got a really good idea.im sure it will work..lol.i do this when im really bored.<br>  Try to not think about penguins<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)<br>  This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.|`|xKZTQ3Iyaa	Just take a breather try not to stress about it eventually it will go away you just have to little by little take your time you'll be ok i promise just take a deep breath and forget and start off fresh ok i hope this helped a little bit.

IgNADy1Taa	There is no typical layout for specifically Dutch CV's, and I only really notice a difference when compared these CV's with American "resumes" which seem more skill-based and succinct. <br>  <br>  This website has good samples of example CV's.<br>  <a href="http://www.idplein.nl/solliciteren/voorbeeldcvs_overz.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.idplein.nl/solliciteren/voorb...</a><br>  If you click on the underlined links (CV1, CV2 etc) you can see how the layout is, even if you don't speak Dutch. As you can see, often there will be headings including Personal details (contact etc), Education and Work Experience...and if relevant Personal qualities/attributes and Languages (especially CV3). The order in which you present this information depends on what job you are applying for: for example if you are a recent graduate and have only had casual work experience, a description of your degree might come before work experience, and you may even want a description of your hobbies or extracurricular activities towards the end. Conversely, if you have reached a high career level, a chronological (most recent first) work experience breakdown might take main focus. <br>  <br>  Personal contact details always look neater at the very top or beginning. <br>  <br>  I have seen a good number of CV's with photos included, but I do not think this makes a better or worse impression (at least it did not make much of a difference for me, working in HR). The only thing I can say about photos is that they are generally admissable in The Netherlands, whereas if I understand correctly they are generally INadmissable in The States as this might bias recruiters based on race/sex etc.<br>  In fact I have come across many CV's even stating irrelevant things such as religion. Some people state their marital status. But never has anyone in my department commented on a piece of info as superfluous or inacceptable so: only include what you feel you would like to but don't worry about recruiters scrutinising your CV too much. If you have great work experience/skills/education, they will never disregard your application based on a technicality.<br>  <br>  The range of CV formats I have seen is absolutely immense! Don't worry about following a set format - just concentrate on including all your strong points and essential contact details (including nationality, if you are abroad). I feel the way you lay out your CV is a matter of personal taste and is as varied as personalities are. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aZi6BvBraa	No, a photograph is not common.<br>   start your CV with<br>  Name<br>  date of birth<br>  address<br>  contactdetails (phonenumber and email)<br>  <br>  what to put first after that depends on what is most recent - If you only just finished you education, sum up your education first (start with most recent)<br>  If you already have a few years of relevant work experiense, start with your workexperience.<br>  <br>  Put in a seperate bit for additional skills etc - like pc skills- language skills-full drivers license, own car etc<br>  <br>  Alss, sum op some hobbies and interests (doesnt have to be work related)<br>  <br>  If Possible, keep it on one page - never more than two.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ZiECN194aa	Just the American/International standard is perfect. A photo of yourself will definitely be appreciated. And be creative!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I found that the following format works best - but it is more american than typically dutch.<br>  <br>  First - work experience - start with current, or most recent, and work backwards. Holiday jobs, or temp jobs only if they are relevant to the function you are applying for.<br>  <br>  Second - school / training - start with current, or most recent - and then any relevant items. (Kindergarten etc. should not be mentioned).<br>  <br>  Other details that are useful :<br>  References available or not, and if yes, how (written, by phone call, or mail)<br>  Date you can start (and any applicable notice period)|`|AA12210908	A photograph is not usual, but sometimes it can help to do something really different from others. <br>  You  asked the general lay-out. Here is the general accepted lay out: <a href="http://www.leren.nl/cursus/solliciteren/cv/voorbeeld-chronologisch-cv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leren.nl/cursus/solliciteren/...</a> personal (name, date of birth, etc) education (latest is the first)  than work experience (latest the first). Than hobbies or (better) charity-work. Maybe the languages you speak. Last is persons who can be asked for a reference. (But many do not do that in the CV and say "references available")<br>  Do something that shows you are different from the rest, but do not change the general lay out.
LpM3uaWiaa	Well it depends on what you like better!<br>  <br>  If your a Criss Angel fan, like me, The Luxor is going to be THE place to stay! I love it there really because its all Criss Angel and its THE place to be if you want to see him. It has Criss Angel EVERYWHERE and when I went, the Believe show was SO amazing, especially since my room was NOT far of a walk at all from the show. It took maybe 3 min, but only because we walked so fast because we were so excited. Its VERY nice there, but last time I was there, november, their pool stunk SO bad. But if your a criss fan, STAY THERE! but it your not a fan of his, its not worth it, im sorry to say. <br>  <br>  But if your not a fan of criss, stay in the Palms! Because the Palms is very nice, but does not have any Criss Angel. and its VERY nice there (but so is the luxor). But I bet it has a better pool :)|`|XD6as6d9aa	If you're talking about atmosphere and style of the rooms, I would say Palms. Luxor is nice because it is on the strip. You also have to take into consideration about how much you want to spend on a room. Luxor will most likely be cheaper in price for every type of room when compared to the Palms. Don't stay at a hotel because of a show or what is at the place. You can go into other casinos and enjoy their shows, restaurants, etc. Don't just pick Luxor simply for BeLIEve. The show isn't getting the best reviews, anyway. Don't pick the Palms simply for the Playboy Club. I've been to the Playboy Club many times and it's a glorified high rollers section. You're better off going up the next floor to the club, Moon. You can get into both "clubs" with entry. Palms can be a $20 cab ride to the strip with traffic and tip, so choose wisely on where you'll spend most of your time if you decide to stay at the Palms.|`|SZkJ65SOaa	The Palms is much "cooler", but is not on the strip.  The Luxor is right on the strip and has a monorail between the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.  <br>  <br>  My friends and I just got back from Vegas 2 weeks ago and went to both casinos and The Palms was REEEAAALLY dead for a Friday night.  It also had a much younger crowd stumbling all over the place which wasn't our thing.  <br>  <br>  Stay at whichever hotel gives you a better deal.  The Luxor is running some really good deals right now.  You're not going to be spending much time in your room anyway.  Plus, you can always go check out the other hotel/casino while you're in Vegas.|`|NHjttkdRaa	The Palms by far!!  There is always a lot going on there plus one of the best pools.<br>  <br>  The Luxor is old and rundown as The Palms is cool, hip, and filled w/ beautiful people and great clubs.<br>  <br>  Shoot me an email with any other questions about Vegas|`|Aesq1I4Baa	Both hotels are very good IMO but I prefer the Luxor because the location is better for me. Before you go I would check the current hotel promotion offers, Luxor have some great offers. A good site for this is <a href="http://www.vegas-hotels-online.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegas-hotels-online.com</a> - it has the latest promos.|`|AA10240904	Both are nice and you don't have to stay at the hotel to go to the other feasures.  However, Palms is by Rio and Gold Coast where Luxor is by Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, Tropicana, MGM Grand, NYNY, and Monte Carlo.|`|bHA2K4HYaa	Personally I like the Palms and Palms Place much better than the Luxor. I like the rooms better and the staff overall at the Palms is amazing. Better places to eat in the Palms as well.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	The Palms by far is a better hotel.  It's a 4-star hotel where as the Luxor is a 2.5 star.<br>  Biggest problem with the Palms is the location and it's not that big.|`|rUvaitfLaa	First off, Believe is one of the worst rated shows right now.  People have walked out in the middle of the show!  However, the Luxor is on the Strip.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, The Playboy club is ok if you have a discount pass, unless you don't mind spending $40 to go to a club that looks like a mini casino. And, it's off the Strip.<br>  <br>  Think it over, I prefer the Palms only because it's newer and hipper than Luxor, although it is also a trendy hangout for all the local youngsters since there is a movie theater and food court there.|`|urHPuzMsaa	The Palms is much better. A younger crowd. A lot more things to do at the Luxor and it is right on the strip. It is like comparing apples to oranges. It is all in what you are looking for in a hotel. Why would a show like Believe make you want to stay there. Most people who go to the show do not stay there. The Luxor is much cheaper. Decide what is important to you and then decide.|`|dFBccLExaa	I perfer the Luxor- but not for the show. If you stay at the Palms, you're not going to be right on the strip. And that can take up a good chunk of time hauling your **** over the freeway to get to where most of the action is. <br>  Believe is the worst rated show on teh strip. They discounted tickets for it, and you still can't get people to go in to see it.|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	PALMS PALMS PALMS...the Luxor is a property that is suffering under MGMs financial crisis,,,,they have cut costs and service and comfort is way down   its a place the Europeans love because its cheap...GO TO THE PALMS|`|VmCncRmoaa	the luxor is horrible really dark dingey rooms the casino floor and restaurants age ok but the rooms aren't<br>  <br>  we stayed at the luxor for one night and then moved to the mirage much much nicer|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	Luxor is on the Strip so i vote Luxor.

If the pet is under 15 pounds, then they'll fit into the approved kennel very easily and they can still move around. They'll be just fine. At home, I'm sure you see some of the crazy sleeping positions they have. As far as being active, I give my pets a Benadryl to help them sleep. I don't want them getting anxious with all of the other people around and start crapping all over the kennel. They are very frequent flyers and they actually know that when they see the Sherpa kennel, it's time to go flying and thet get all excited. My 7 month old puppy actually jumps right into the kennel without me grabbing her. Both of my dogs are mini-Dachshunds.|`|eevhC1Ivaa	yes

Parliamentary self-government was not granted until 1849. However, conflict between French and English made the united province unworkable, and in 1867, when the confederation of Canada was formed, Ontario and Quebec became separate provinces.

E.g. will he stay for a month in your spare bedroom; stay in a nearby hotel; or stay near you for two weeks than go to Wales for some hillwalking. If he is travelling round it should be fairly detailed, giving the likely town for each night, and maybe an idea of hotel costs in each place.<br>  <br>  Your friend may then have to prove that he has the funds to support this holiday, and show that he really will be on holiday for that time, not trying to work.

ndACw30Haa	Dan of Silver Spring MD writes (2/6/03): <br>  Below is the letter I sent to RPR. In response to the letter I received a full refund.<br>  <br>  January 1, 2003 <br>  <br>  Dan Lambert <br>  Ramada Plaza Resorts<br>  2419 E Commercial Blvd. #100<br>  Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308 <br>  <br>  Tel: (954) 630-9449 <br>  Fax: (954) 567-9399 <br>  <br>  Re: Request for full refund following Ramada?s fraudulently misleading description of vacation package #*******-025RP <br>  <br>  Dear Mr. Lambert, <br>  The purpose of this letter is to explain Ramada Plaza Resorts? (RPR) fraudulent misrepresentation of the vacation package that I used from 12/19/02 to 12/26/02. I am requesting a full refund of the $1,700 I paid for the vacation package. RPR?s dishonest and fraudulent description of the vacation package violates the Maryland Unfair Trade Practices Law as well as various laws as the state?s Consumer Protection Laws, as described by the state?s Attorney General.<br>  <br>  Below I describe how RMR misled me by misrepresenting its offer. I have also enclosed documentation of multiple lawsuits against RPR for its fraudulent activities. These cases show that my terrible experience with RPR was not unique, but rather is quite common as the company routinely lies to customers and misleads them. RPR operates under several company names in order to mislead customers and protect itself from the consequences of its illegal behavior.<br>  <br>  I am furious at the awful treatment I received from Ramada. I am requesting that Ramada fully refund my vacation package because of the company?s fraudulent claims and misleading operation. These problems include Ramada?s failure to provide the vacation for which I paid, Ramada?s numerous misleading descriptions of aspects of the vacation, as well as Ramada?s failures to correct its errors. I was extremely dissatisfied with my vacation and I look forward to Ramada making up for my awful experience.<br>  <br>  I paid $1,700 (approximately $700 each for my wife and me, plus an addition $300 an hotel upgrade) for this vacation, but the vacation experience was nothing like the package that Ramada sold to me. Ramada misled me and attempted to get even more money from me by failing to abide by the terms of the vacation that it sold to me. During my vacation I complained several times to Ramada and explained each of the problems outlined below. I have already contacted my credit card company and informed it that I will be taking action against RPR because of its misleading business practices. If I do not receive a full refund, then I plan to contact the following authorities to inform them about RPR?s illegal and misleading business practices: <br>  <br>  Charles Bronson, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services <br>  The Better Business Bureau <br>  The Florida Attorney General <br>  The Federal Trade Commission <br>  Part I: This section describes the process by which RPR fraudulently offered me the vacation package by misleading me in order to make the package appear much more attractive than it was. <br>  <br>  In March of 2001, I received a solicitation in the mail from RPR. The solicitation offered a vacation package, to which I responded by calling RPR?s toll free number. A representative named Julia told me that the vacation package was a ?one time only? offer that could not be purchased anytime after my phone conversation with her. After taking careful documentation after the phone conversation, I allowed the sum of $698.00 to purchase a ?secure deposit? for a vacation in my name; I later paid another $698 for my wife?s ticket, as well as $300 for a package upgrade. <br>  <br>  However, I later learned that this description of the offer as an exclusive, ?one-time? opportunity was fraudulent. Indeed, one can purchase this same package at any time at <a href="http://www.dreamtimetours.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamtimetours.com,</a> and just a week before my vacation, I received another call from RPR offering me the same package, which it claimed again was available only on this ?one time? basis. Thus RPR fraudulently misrepresented the nature of its offer and its availability, which is a direct violation of Florida law.<br>  <br>  RPR indicated in the solicitation that the vacation offered were valued at over $2,800, but for a limited time, RMR was selling it at a ?highly discounted? price of $698/person for a total of $1,396. This is deceptive and misleading because the actual retail value of the vacation I recently took was significantly less. The vacation included: <br>  <br>  Two nights of ?first class? accommodations at the Ramada Plaza Resort Hotel <br>  Premier Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Line or Imperial majesty Cruise Line <br>  Three nights of ?first class? accommodations in south Florida <br>  Transportation for seven days provided by Alamo Rent-A-Car After taking the vacation, I have determined the actual retail value of the trip as follows: <br>  One night at the Ramada Ft. Lauderdale on Commercial Blvd. ($50/night): $50.00 <br>  Two nights at the Quality Inn Hotel at 1208 N. Ocean Blvd. ($129/night): $258.00 <br>  2-night cruise on Imperial Majesty Cruise line (2 people @ $|`|vnorljg4aa	uhhh..thats a scam..and UR TOO YOUNG TEW GET MARRIED!!!!<br>  wooooooow................|`|zxl30SARaa	how do you know for sure it's a scam?

Do a search on "Imperial Majesty" and you will find many sites that may be of help.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|CpJnhy1saa	It's a scam. A threat to the BBB will probably not get you anywhere because they've already been reported hundred's of times. Call them and tell them you want your money credited back to your credit card. Do not be nice, do not let them talk you into anything else. If they will not do this then, contact your state attorney general and your credit card company to see if you can do anything through them. <br>  <br>  This is a scam because any cruise you book with them would have been cheaper had you just used a regular travel agent and would have been a better quality cruise. They told you it would be a free cruise and then they charge your credit card. They keep delaying you when you try to book or tell you the week you want is not available. These people are out to cheat you out of your hard earned money. Hope it turns out well for you.

They're compact, easy to clean (and sanitize if she gets the dreaded bed-bugs) and dry, and are fabulous in all weather. <br>  <br>  You can look online for "silk sleep sac" or silk sleeping bag liner. Also, if you live in a major city, there may be a local hostel with a travel store. They may sell sleep sacs. <br>  <br>  They're not terribly cheap, but she'll probably get lots of use out of it, so they are good value. <br>  <br>  I bought myself one for my year in Australia, and it was the most useful item in my pack.

Biggest thing you need is reservations for a place to stay. You can sort thru the hotels easy using Expedia or Orbitz.<br>   If you want to save money, take a cooler along with soda and water, perhaps food for one meal per day. Snacks. Avoid convenience stores.<br>  Cell phone, of course. <br>  Road atlas or GPS. Perhaps radar detector.<br>  Make sure your car is in tip top shape. A breakdown can ruin everything.<br>  Tunes are important, it can get boring. Try a new comedy CD for the first time. Sometimes it is hard to agree on music. Perhaps a portable DVD player.<br>  A small pillow for sleeping in the car.<br>  Much of this depends on how far you have to drive to get there. The above advice is for a 2-3 day drive.<br>  Good luck.

Sure, there might be ignorant people out there, but as has already been said, even if you disagree with Israel's actions it's wrong to blame all Jewish people for what Israel does. And Americans of all creeds are on all sides of the Israel argument (and I insist that there are more than 2 sides). It's fairly obvious that Israel is a separate entity from Jewish (and especially American Jewish) people in general... <a href="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/2009/01/22/american-jews-oppose-israeli-policy-in-gaza/." rel="nofollow">http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_...</a> You should consider that even when Bush was president people were still outraged at racism against Arabic people (myself included). A bigger danger might be Israel finding herself in a situation where all international support is gone. She's basically only got the US. So whether you'd be better off leaving or staying is arguable. Just because Israel considers all Jews a member of Israel doesn't mean all Jews consider themselves supporters of everything Israel does.<br>  <br>  People in modern Western societies have come view racism as particularly repugnant. I don't think anything will happen on the scale of the terrible atrocities committed against Jewish people in the past. My intuition tells me that most people are deeply offended by these types of prejudices (myself included). But if you feel  you would be safer in Israel, go ahead and move there. I cannot make the decision for you (and perhaps my opinion is worthless to you because I'm a gentile), but if you do move you will get to learn more about your own culture and other aspects of your background, so that's a plus. But I can tell you this: I certainly do not dislike all Jewish people more because of Israel, I only disapprove of what (some) Israelis are doing. Even where people are personally responsible for criminal actions (which they know are wrong), I don't dislike them more in general, because people make mistakes and if they are truly repentant and show it in their actions then I will still like them. I also think the intent matters (the difference between 1st and 3rd degree murder, say)... and most Israelis, I'll wager, believe they are doing the right thing. So for what it's worth, those are my candid thoughts on the matter. <br>  <br>  If moving is all about safety, then apparently the most economical and hassle-free option is the South. Haha, never would have thought it.|`|8I9uduIiaa	I'm a British Jew and I feel the EXACT same way.<br>  <br>  There is currently a lot of physical violence towards us. <br>  <br>  The British government banned Geert Wilders - and are NOW letting into the UK a senior Hezbollah guy who is a known anti semite and who puts out the most hateful anti Jewish programmes on Islamic TV.<br>  <br>  So I hear ya.<br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to your gut feeling, my friend...|`|M1oVSlZdaa	I'm not so worried.

O8qdCBzLaa	I would say that April and May are the least expensive. I just checked flights from San Diego to Maui for April and May, and they have lots of them starting at about $350 round trip per person. Fall months are around $600, and winter and summer months are around $850.<br>  <br>  The winter months are usually more expensive (and crowded) not only because people want to go somewhere warm. But, it's also whale season. The holidays are expensive, because lots of people take long vacations. And, summer-fall is expensive because that's when most kids are out of school (family vacations). <br>  <br>  I would suggest going in April. It's toward the end of whale season, but there's still plenty of them around with stragglers hanging around into May. The big surf is also starting to diminish and the trade winds start to mellow out. So, you don't get as many small craft advisories and there are more options for doing things on the water. It also makes for better snorkeling.|`|BA3mGlTyaa	In agreement, the summer months are the most expensive, just when everybody comes and are out of school.<br>  <br>  Just another local....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oa...</a>|`|GEUU9q2Paa	It costs the most to go to Hawaii in the summer and winter, less in the spring and fall.  Summer is busy because lots of families with children come while the kids are out of school.  Winter is busy because lots of people from cold climates come to get away from the snow.  Spring and fall are slower times in Hawaii because the kids are not out of school and the snowbirds are not running away from the cold weather.<br>  <br>  High and low temperatures, and rainfall, for each month of the year are at  <br>  <a href="http://www.mauihawaii.org/maui-weather.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mauihawaii.org/maui-weather.h...</a>|`|SMa03xHwaa	I know that July and August tends to be more expensive than earlier in the summer.

8I9uduIiaa	Most Israelis speak extremely good English; in my experience, at any rate :)|`|VS92WBLtaa	As far as I know Russian is the most popular language in Israel.<br>  Some folks speak German-Jiddish but not many Jews speak good English.

We have a lot of American TV shows and movies (lately we are getting some british stuff too). Population in general does speak English well (in average ofcourse). But this is rather generalised answer on way too generally formulated question<br>  <br>  Edit to Kevin: Wow! I thought you knew better then that. I am Russian Jew, and certainly Russian is very widely spoken language. Russian Jews in Israel are very large group and mostly are accepted well, considered Israelis and are well integrated into Israel's culture and sosiety. I for once never felt any persecution or discrimination. In some areas (such as military and security forces) Russians are held back a bit and may be in medicine too. I am computer engineer and I know a lot of Russian Jews in the same profession and we are well respected and not persecuted at all.

gm9QYLjIaa	So I have not been to Kahya hotel but it seems decent enough, not excellent but interesting enough to keep the attention of a 14 year old.<br>  <br>  But the question is what kind of 14 year old is he/she? Cause a "normal" teenager at that age would certainly be bored anywhere without friends to chat with or a computer to access msn :-/. If he/she is open and social then I don't think there'd be any problems, if he makes friends at the hotel (and you get to know their parents) he/she may hang out with them safely. Alanya is less crowded than Antalya and a bit calmer so don't worry they'd be able to hang around without any problems. Otherwise nightclubs and bars do accept teens with carding even if they're young as long as they're with their parents. The pool seems nice and there's also a wireless access in the hotel so if he brings with him a laptop, or an iphone or something he won't get bored just in case.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind Alanya, and more particularly Antalya is a very touristic city filled with Russians who have actually pretty much settled there and German tourists. The nightlife is mostly shaped around them (Local tourists tend to avoid Antalya during the summer months) but it is buzzling and hot, you certainly won't get bored. It's centered around the harbor, so you won't get lost and you will have a variety of choices at your feet from Western style music, to pubs, to Turkish pop scene. You'll discover the different choices by walking around that's the best advice I could give you. Oh and keep in mind they won't be as cheap as you'll expect, and imported beverages especially alcohol is really pricey so my advice if you're really not that picky the local stuff is just as good (Efes for beer is a must, for votka Istanblue is a pricey alternative but Absolut isn't too bad either).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :) Just expect it to be very crowded!|`|N53mDeaeaa	You can find it from the site <a href="http://www.stayresturkey.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.stayresturkey.com.</a>

kgBPU4xxaa	I've lived in northern Italy for almost ten years and go out exploring on the weekends. The weather can be variable depending on exactly where you are, but it's generally a good time to be here. Most things will be open, but without the huge masses of tourists. Here in northern Italy, we can get fog starting around the 2nd or third week in October, but that isn't a big problem if you're not driving. It can make places like Venice pretty magical - especially in the early morning when there aren't many people out and about. <br>  <br>  It can be wet especially toward the end of the month in some places. It's useful to carry a small umbrella just in case.<br>  <br>  There are some interesting festivals in October - one excellent one is the Eurochocolate Festival in Perugia. The Palio del Papero near San Miniato in Tuscany is interesting. It features a costumed parade and competitions between the four neighborhoods of the town that take the form of duck races. There's also a lot of good food.  The Bardolino Wine Festival on Lake Garda and the Rice Festival in Isola della Scala just south of Verona are pretty good too.|`|fd09ea41f86382847375794c6ab36318aa	Conley39 is right!|`|AA11881190	I was in Tuscany the first week of October and it was wonderful (70's and sunny). Plus, the crowds have thinned a bit and there are low-season prices. You can review the average temperatures for any place (which is important since Sicily isn't the same as Milan) by going to <a href="http://www.weather.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.weather.com</a> and searching for your specific destination e.g. Florence, Italy, then click on 'month', scroll to the bottom, and click on 'averages'.|`|ZYnxC0ukaa	i'm italian so...i think i can answer to this question!<br>  it isn't too cool but it isn't hot neither.<br>  sometimes rains but NEVER snows in october (usually snows in november, december, jenuary and february)<br>  north: rainy and a little cool<br>  center: not much rainy and not much cool neither<br>  south: it's still summer<br>  enjoy italy, weather is always good here
jipqICzVaa	It depends on the cruise line you go with. P&O are formal most nights and you will need a dinner suit and evening dress. Thompson are more flexible, but expect at least a shirt and tie on formal nights. Other ships have relaxed dining every night. You will get a newsletter on most ships telling you what sort of dinner it will be (formal, casual, smart casual etc) If you don't want fine dining, then there are buffet restaurants where you can wear what you want.|`|MyUi3Blyaa	Don't throw up in the Dining area.<br>  No fornicating outside your cabin on the ship.<br>  No jumping in the pool from any height.<br>  Wear footwear in public areas except by the pool.<br>  Keep your stuff in your room secure in case your mate's dangerous liason's are light fingered.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	it's all fun.<br>  Just remember that if you do your own trips ashore that if you are late back because of traffic jams etc, the ship won't wait but if you book a tour with the cruiseline, they will wait.|`|bNrrTyrQaa	Just relax and have a great time dont stress about anything.

PA0bGBtCaa	I fly A LOT. I used to be a flight attendant, and now I travel multiple times a month for my job with the airlines. I've tried the ear plugs, I've tired the gum, and I've tried a liquid solution and none of them worked! Your ears will naturally pop due to the pressure changes in the air outside the plane and the pressure that's inside the plane.<br>  <br>  The EASIEST way is to do what one of the other answers mentioned and that's just pinch your nose and try to blow really hard through your nostrils. That will make your ears pop every singe time. When I scuba dive, that's the method you use to clear your ears as you go deeper into the water.<br>  <br>  Once you're leveled off at cruising altitude, you won't have that pressure difference anymore becuase you're leveled off. However, once you start descening for landing, it'll be something that you have to do pretty frequently as that pressure change will be constant again.|`|EsufC1qhaa	the best thing to do is to carry a gum or a sweet to chew during take-offs and landings. its effects are not that great but at least, keeping your mouth closed will help.  <br>  <br>  but other natural way to prevent this is to close your nose with your hands and blow hard from inside your nose. this will ''pop'' out your blocked ears..  keep doing this often|`|lKscJRWnaa	if you don't have gum make sure to yawn. yawning will prevent your ears from popping.|`|SK1inJtJaa	chew gum... simple!

I do know that they have special places for smoking on the ship. i do not think the balcony's are one just because most people throw the cigarette overboard instead of in a special waste receptacle.<br>  <br>  i guess you could smoke..but its probably not allowed.|`|AA12337848	pretty much all of the major market cruise lines allow that.|`|p4V1zfR1aa	umm when we went on carnival they didnt really allow it. but people do it anyways.

5NgcndzXaa	Hey.<br>  I'm studying Interior Design and Architecture in Australia, I also work in the industry. It's great to see your architectural design, is the residential building based around the environment and climate of the Philippines? If so, i like the textures/materials you have chosen for the exterior facade of the building. The timber horizontal panels give a warmth and also connect back to your clear horizontal/vertical concept, is that influenced by Le Corbusier or Frank Lloyd Wright? <br>  <br>  The rough rendered white blocks are also of interest, as I see it as an adaptation of using concrete and a material that is easily accessible and under-estimated in it's use and capabilities. <br>  The large windows allow nice natural light to enter the interiors, the window panels are nicely framed. It's the control of the amount of light and heat entering the building that could be considered. The windows continue the horizontal/vertical planes evident in your design. I also see your use of louvres and vertical blinds to enhance your concept.<br>   <br>  As for the interior, the render you've shown doesn't show much about the interior unfortunately, but i see you've still continued to make use of the same textures/materials and horizontal/vertical planes within the interior. The lighting fixtures seems out of place, and a little dull compared to that of your exploration of textures on the facade of the building. Maybe you should explore the horizontal/vertical planes concept a little more within the interior, you could really make interesting transitions between the spaces. Your fixed and moveable furniture could be incorporated into the design, as now it just library parts within your program that you used and placed in any furniture for this rendering. <br>  Think about making a horizontal plane, so the bed, table and cabinet unit is all the same height. This way it visually makes it interesting and your eye is drawn to this feature. <br>  Also think about using more textures that are soft and look comfortable, think about colour that evokes feeling and patterns. Make this room look inviting, it's a bedroom one, if not the most intimate space within a house. <br>  <br>  It would be interesting to look at your spatial planning and other renderings. At the firm I work for and at university we use the program ArchiCAD, I love it. What program/s do you use? <br>  I hope my opinion hasn't been too harsh, please excuse my critiques. But I think your renderings are good, the shadows and reflections are interesting. The textures/materials really give an interesting contrast to the building.<br>  As a pinay living in Australia, I'm really interested in looking at architecture and interior design in Philippines, maybe next year I'll get a chance to see your building in it's finished state. <br>  Good Job.|`|oqiw8Ruuaa	1st artwork --<br>  <br>  the house and the pond is great. it's like a tokyo mansion which somewhat looks like a chateaux.<br>  <br>  btw. i don't think the house and the tall grasses look good together. also, i found a weird looking reflection on the middle of the wide roof.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2nd artwork --<br>  <br>  i like the desk and the figurines! ohh so cute! also, the flooring is really nice. you're good huh.<br>  <br>  umh, but i think your comforter (is that a comforter?) doesn't look soft enough. it's like a pastry dough on a bed. and umh, i think the reflection on the girl's picture is a bit.. odd looking.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BUT all in all,<br>  <br>  i think you're good.<br>  <br>  =)|`|T6v3RWixaa	Very modern European design.  This design will sell in Europe.  Come <br>  over here.  These are the things you see in our architectural magazines.|`|UofhMpy9aa	am not an architect..but i do sketches at times and i paint din (as a hobby) well,  the design concept is quite refreshing..but i dont know,..the exterior kinda disturbs me, it feels like it greatly lacks symmetry and balance. And I cant help wondering if those darkborwn materials on the right side of the structures were wooden slates (and if they really were, di yata practical sa weather natin). As I understand designs should greatly incorporate aesthetics with functionality. The glass panels were charming, but personally (if that house would be built in the phils), I wouldnt dare sleep in there even for a night fearing na baka massacred na me when i wake up the next morning. I would definitely wanna place iron grills with that (and that would definitely spoil the design). And lastly, the interior feels too 'decorous', it would feel like i'd be sleeping in a board meeting or something. One thing i loved about the cast was the pond, it made the project a bit more 'humane'.<br>  <br>  ei, again am not an architect, neither am i familiar with architectural design disciplines, those were just my personal and grouchy opinions, wala lang, nangialam lang.|`|QmwYOQuDaa	the rendering is amazing, you definitely have a skill set with the software.  The concept of the exterior lacks proper proportion and grace.  Especially in the area with the columns, there's no statement to the elevation, it's just there and awkward.
AA11349530	Brighton (for the Brighton Pavilion), Hastings and Battle for 1066 and all that, Colchester has loads of historical sites both Roman and Cromwell stuff, Canterbury especially the cathedral, St Albans for Romans, Ely for the cathedral<br>  <br>  a bit further afield York, Durham (the best cathedral in the country), Cornwall is stunning (I specially like the far west, and the coastal walk)<br>  <br>  natural beauty is a bit more difficult in the south, but the Chilterns and the Cotswolds are pretty, especially if you're prepared to get out there and walk ... there's stunning scenery in Wales but you might need a car to see the best ... and not forgetting the Lake District<br>  <br>  a couple of hours by plane would even take you to Inverness

That's a real problem. Look, there are those special curtains that prevent the noise. I dunno. Maybe try to study in the quietest room, close all doors and windows and try to concentrate.

oQrIn41zaa	Well, it takes a while...1 and a half hours on a train, you can get the train from Reading station or Reading West station to Wembley Stadium (the station right next to the stadium, obvs.)<br>  You can go by car if you want to brave that...it'll take about an hour, no traffic, so I'll give it 2 on a night when england is playing, here's a link to google maps:<br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=wl" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=wl</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps, I personally, would go by train!<br>  <br>  [x]
ay8tXLD2aa	The styles are very different, so that may be a positive or a negative. <br>  <br>  It depends where you shop - if you are shopping at the large department stores, at "real" jewelry, then very expensive.  If you are looking for mid-range stuff, ie/ a name brand thing like a Dior watch, etc etc, then they will be more expensive here. <br>  <br>  However, in areas like Insadong, where the large jewelry stores are found (one area is all rows of jewelry stores), the gold is sold by weight. As in, the current value of gold, and the item you chose is weighed and the cost is calculated then.  Most people I know who have purchased necklaces, rings, etc this way have worked out the cost and realised that they got a great bargain.|`|7507585dba9eca5ef96cb88aa64b9436aa	Jewelery is about the same.  It doesn't matter where you buy it.
ZS7Ew7F3aa	I think you'll find a lot of the Chinese speak English, at least enough to answer this question for you while there (It's us 'English as a 1st language' folk that tend to be lazy about learning other languages). <br>  My suggestion would be that you learn a little Chinese/use a translation guide...you'll be in their country, attempt to accommodate them. Also, if you search out only English speaking people you'll miss out on a whole dimension of your travels...you may as well stay home ;)|`|972OdSIJaa	there are some foreigns there.<br>  <br>  you just need to find the right places.<br>  <br>  you might even meet someone on the plane. i went hong kong earlier this year and saw a couple of different ethnicities. basically 98% of people are hong kong. and yes some hong kong people do speak english but it aint good.<br>  <br>  so if you want to buy something and ask for a price. i will highly doubt they will understand you. <br>  <br>  but everything do have a price so you will understand that. and if you do go then you should take the train as it has english words on it.<br>  <br>  Go to Tsim Sha Tsui as they have stores like gucci and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  and mong kok for shopping.<br>  <br>  best if you go with someone.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	go to the irish bar in wan chai, Luard rd, on Hong Kong Island<br>  <br>  there is lots of westerners around that area as well, also a few nightclubs|`|f8ajuJuZaa	Go out and about, you're bound to find some English Speaking people..<br>  There are British and American speaking schools everywhere.. soo all of the students and teachers that teach and live there will speak English..<br>  I thought i'd have the same trouble when i moved from England to Egypt..|`|0p9ur3aMaa	im going there in Summer as well, you can chill with me ^^, I can take you around some places.

DY7oQ0LYaa	If you are 'going back' to Hong Kong and you are at present in a boarding school in the UK, it suggests to me that you are a Hong Kong citizen. I think if you look on the internet you could find English teaching opportunities and meet people of your own age or younger or older as may be your choice.<br>  <br>  If that is not your cup of tea then maybe I would wait until I got to Hong Kong and look in all the normal job-hunting grounds.<br>  <br>  However if you just want to look on the net, here are a few links:<br>  <a href="http://www.allhongkongjobs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allhongkongjobs.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.monster.com.hk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monster.com.hk/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://hongkong.recruit.net/" rel="nofollow">http://hongkong.recruit.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jobchina.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jobchina.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newchinacareer.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newchinacareer.com/index.html</a>|`|972OdSIJaa	you need a visa if you dont have a hong kong passport and you should need to learn cantonese.

dpKntiZoaa	Oh second question in one day from a new profile about the same subject!~ (and also one who has apparently had questions deleted already judging by your points)  ........How wonderful <br>  <br>  So I take it you have travelled extensively throughout the whole of Europe?....... no?   I thought not.<br>  <br>  It is pretty naive or ignorant to make such a statement when sitting behind your pc and as I said before, for that I feel pity for you that you need to project your ignorance into the form of such a question. It is very sad and I am very sorry for you :0)<br>  <br>  I hope you open your mind, actually visit Europe in it's entirety and you will see that actually it is a beautiful continent with a lot to offer, as is Pakistan I am sure (although I have never visited so I will not pass judgement!<br>  <br>  Yes there are places which have room for improvement but this is the minority and not the majority, as you may one day hopefully find out for yourself.|`|Bt81ClpXaa	Europe isn't all dirty... Some cities can be very dirty because of litter and car fumes and whatever but in the country you'll find its very clean. Thats quite a big stereotype to indicate that the whole of europe is dirty!|`|jPt4iwICaa	Europe is not all dirty and generalisations hardly work here as it's a very unevenly developed continent. <br>  <br>  Moreover, "dirt" comes in many forms; some of the most industrialized countries are more polluted on account of being a consumer society that lies on waste of all kinds, starting from packages down to noise and water pollution. On the other hand, the less developed countries have their fair share of pollution caused by the lack of funds to handle waste properly. <br>  <br>  But the overall state of things is not as grim as you make it sound, and people are aware of this problem, which is a good start.<br>  <br>  I have only been to Karachi in Pakistan, and my impressions don't match yours, I'm afraid. It's not the cleanest place I've visited, and that goes for every aspect of pollution and common dirt. I think you're just being partial or plain bored to ask questions like this one.|`|AA12319516	What kind of being dirty do you mean, and what part of Europe do you mean?<br>  <br>  I agree there is a lot of trash in the streets, especially in the cities. Personally I also have a problem with the grafitti everywhere.<br>  <br>  And of course, the more people that life in a small area, the more trash you will find. That is everywhere in the world. I never visited Pakistan, but in the cities in India and Thailand you also see a lot of plastic in the streets :-(<br>  <br>  What is the solution? <br>  <br>  First of all, avoid all unecessary packing material. In more and more countries, you have to pay for plastic bags in the shops. Buy one big bottle instead of 4 little ones. Don't buy individual packed cakes but buy them in a box. Don't buy packed fruit, vegetables and meat.<br>  <br>  Secondly keep your trash till you see a trash-basket.<br>  <br>  And sorten your trash so it can be collected separately to recycle it.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	The dirtiest parts of Europe are infested with Pakistanis, Iraqis, Iranians, Turks, Somalians, Eritreans etc. It's the truth.

There isn't a separate currency called the "Scottish pound" that just happens to be worth one pound sterling, if that's what you mean.<br>  <br>  The Pound sterling is also the official currency of the Isle of Man, Channel Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory.<br>  <br>  Territories which DO actually have separate currencies pegged to the Pound sterling are Gibraltar (the Gibraltar pound), Falkland Islands (the Falkland Islands pound) and St Helena and Ascension Island (St Helena pound).<br>  <br>  What's the difference in practice? I'm not sure, to be honest. You can pay any Pound sterling banknotes or coins into your UK bank account, whereas I suspect the banks would be entitled to charge commission if you wanted to pay Gibraltar, Falkland Islands or St Helena money into your UK account.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless the coins of Gibraltar and Falklands etc. are the same size and weight as UK sterling coins, and the Gibraltar coins in particular often turn up in UK change.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Yes the Scottish banks issue their own notes

B3FBgxjEaa	General Rules <br>  Although the details of kashrut are extensive, the laws all derive from a few fairly simple, straightforward rules: <br>  <br>  1.Certain animals may not be eaten at all. This restriction includes the flesh, organs, eggs and milk of the forbidden animals. <br>  2.Of the animals that may be eaten, the birds and mammals must be killed in accordance with Jewish law. <br>  3.All blood must be drained from the meat or broiled out of it before it is eaten. <br>  4.Certain parts of permitted animals may not be eaten. <br>  5.Fruits and vegetables are permitted, but must be inspected for bugs <br>  6.Meat (the flesh of birds and mammals) cannot be eaten with dairy. 7.Fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables and grains can be eaten with either meat or dairy. (According to some views, fish may not be eaten with meat). <br>  8.Utensils that have come into contact with meat may not be used with dairy, and vice versa. Utensils that have come into contact with non-kosher food may not be used with kosher food. This applies only where the contact occurred while the food was hot. <br>  9.Grape products made by non-Jews may not be eaten. <br>  There are a few other rules that are not universal. <br>  <br>  The Details <br>  Animals that may not be eaten <br>  Of the "beasts of the earth" (which basically refers to land mammals with the exception of swarming rodents), you may eat any animal that has cloven hooves and chews its cud. Lev. 11:3; Deut. 14:6. Any land mammal that does not have both of these qualities is forbidden. The Torah specifies that the camel, the rock badger, the hare and the pig are not kosher because each lacks one of these two qualifications. Sheep, cattle, goats, deer and bison are kosher. <br>  <br>  Of the things that are in the waters, you may eat anything that has fins and scales. Lev. 11:9; Deut. 14:9. Thus, shellfish such as lobsters, oysters, shrimp, clams and crabs are all forbidden. Fish like tuna, carp, salmon and herring are all permitted. <br>  <br>  For birds, the criteria is less clear. The Torah provides a list of forbidden birds (Lev. 11:13-19; Deut. 14:11-18), but does not specify why these particular birds are forbidden. All of the birds on the list are birds of prey or scavengers, thus the rabbis inferred that this was the basis for the distinction. Other birds are permitted, such as chicken, geese, ducks and turkeys. However, some people avoid turkey, because it is not mentioned in the Torah, leaving room for doubt. <br>  <br>  Read the rest - very informative site<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm</a><br>  <br>  Jews smoke.<br>  <br>  Drinking alcohol is not forbidden to Jews. Drinking to access is (except for Purim)<br>  <br>  Fish eat lots of fish.<br>  <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/95q2/smartjews.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/95q2/s...</a>|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Observant Jews do not eat meat and dairy together in the same meal or in the same dish.  In order to keep meat and dairy completely separate, observant Jews will keep 2 separate sets of pots and pans, dishes, and silverware -- one set for foods containing meat (beef, chicken, lamb, turkey) and one set for dairy foods (milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, ice cream, etc).  Foods like fish, eggs, vegetables, fruit, and grains (bread, rice, pasta, etc) are neutral or "parve", and can be cooked and eaten with either meat or dairy.<br>  <br>  As has already been stated, certain foods like pork, shellfish, lobster, shrimp, and rabbit are inherently unkosher because they come from forbidden animals.   Other foods, like beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, and veal are kosher only if they are slaughtered in the appropriate manner by a specially trained Jewish religious official (called a "shochet"), butchered and prepared according to the laws of kashrut; otherwise they are not kosher. <br>  <br>  <br>  Prophecy of Crazy Cat:<br>  <br>  Coconut milk isn't really "milk" -- its not a dairy product, its the liquid found inside a coconut -- so its "parve", and can be used to prepare a kosher chicken curry dish.  Sour milk IS dairy, so if you use that with chicken to prepare a curry dish, the dish will NOT be kosher.  You could use sour milk to prepare a curried vegetable dish, or curried fish -- but only if the fish has both scales and fins (no shrimp!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	1) The word Kosher literally translates to "fit" or "proper" and while not exclusive to food in Judaism, is generally used in reference to it. Kosher food, is food that is acceptable in Jewish law. <br>  <br>  Food may be designated non-kosher for a variety of reasons. They include the species involved (pig) the manner in which the food was processed (improperly slaughtered, or mixing milk and meat); or time (leavened product not properly disposed of prior to Passover or food cooked on the Sabbath). <br>  <br>  You can learn about it here: <a href="http://www.ou.org/kosher/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ou.org/kosher/intro.html</a><br>  and here: <a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wizard_cdo/aid/113425/jewish/What-is-Kosher.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chabad.org/library/howto/wiza...</a><br>  <br>  2) We are not allowed to eat pork in any shape or form. <br>  <br>  3) It's generally frowned upon, but people do understand that it is an addiction some have.<br>  <br>  4) Yes: A lot of our holidays include blessings and prayers where wine is included.  <br>  <br>  5) You should eat whatever you feel like. Just remember to keep it light, add greens and have a good mixture (although this just did NOT work with my daughter at all!)<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  <br>  Prophecy - Doctors were in a huff about eating fish when I was pregnant with my daughter (mercury levels in the fish). Apparently they changed the decision on this one (my mistake). But yes, you are correct.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You can check the responses here to see the differences and similarities between halal and kashrut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlSMRFwzbRVXtAxdO.ujWY_ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090130122053AAuJvgJ&show=7#profile-info-DVmDWDC4aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Food that is Kosher is technically halal (however, you should also check about this in your community).<br>  <br>  Edit to "justtruth":<br>  -------<br>  There is no such thing as a "Kosher tax." That is an antisemitic myth spread by white supremacist groups. Companies voluntarily pay for a Kosher certification in order to have a larger customer base. <br>  <br>  The same applies for the Crescent M symbols for Halal based foods. Please educate yourself before stating such comments which have no basis. <br>  <br>  Kashrut has nothing to do with "Rabbi's blessing foods" either.  That shows your lack of knowledge on the subject. It means that the animals and products are checked to ensure that (a) no pork products are used (b) there are no bruises, cuts, diseases or problems with the animal etc..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/racial/business/kosher.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/racial/business/ko...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_tax" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_tax</a>|`|s26apn70aa	Im not a jew but im interested to learn, as well.<br>  When you mean meat cannot be mixed with meat, does it mean you cant eat chicken curry?

Kashrut - is a set of rules derived from Torah - first five books of Holy Scripture that determines what foods are kosher. The main rules are that of land dwelling animals we are allowed to eat only Anymals that chew their cud and have completely split huwes. So pigs that have completely split huwes but do not chew their cud are not kosher. Touching a carcas of any unclean animal makes person unklean as well until the evening of that day. Of Sea creachers we can eat those that have scales and fins. And of birds scripture gives specific list ofclean (kosher) and unclean (non-koser) birds. General rules could befound in Vaikra (Leviticus) chapter 11. However those are just basic rules. Jews also do not mix meat and deary foods and even dishes on which deary and meats are served are separated. Also a Kosher anymal must be slotered in appropriate way by sertified person only, otherwise it becomes unkosher.  This is very short description. For full knowledge google kosher and set few years aside to learn the issue in deapth :) This isfor your first 2 questions.<br>  <br>  3. Smoking: In general smoking is permitted by Jewish faith. There is a scriptural commendment not to harm your own body. Based on that commendment some small minority of rabbis prohibit smoking. There is more general agreement that if one does not smoke yet, it is prohibited to start.<br>  <br>  4. Alcohol consumption is allowed<br>  <br>  5. This is not Jewish related question. In general you should eat well balanced foods stay away from smoking and alcohol. For more ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps

AA12210908	The IJsselmeer is the biggest lake of the Netherlands. It is named after the ?ssel river that drains into it via a smaller lake, the Ketelmeer. The internal capitalization in the spelling is caused by the fact that IJ is a digraph in Dutch, possibly a ligature, and sometimes considered a single letter (see IJ (letter)). The ?sselmeer is not only the largest in The Netherlands, it is also the largest lake in Western Europe.
JLw4axJBaa	You will never get use to the difference. I lived in Colorado before I moved to Vegas.. It's so different that you don't really get use to it, you just have to accept that it's different. The biggest thing you'll notice is lack of trees/green. I've been here 10 years and I still hate not seeing trees.<br>  <br>  Adjusting to life without your family can be tough, especially if you've never been without them. It's tougher for the younger crowd here to find friends, just because of the Vegas lifestyle and the kinds of people it attracts, but if you're closer to retirement age it should be easier to get a good base of friends. All you can do is surround yourself with good people to fill-in for your family. There's a good retirement and pre-retirement base of people here, so that should help some.<br>  <br>  The zip codes you want to buy/rent in are 89052 (Seven Hills), 89044 (Madiera Canyon), 89012 (MacDonald Ranch/Green Valley), 89074 (Green Valley).. All of those are in newer Henderson. You don't want to live in 89014 & 89015 (older Henderson). 89123 & 89183 (Silverado Ranch) are in Las Vegas, adjacent to 89052 & 89074, it's also a good area to live in. It will be cheaper than living in newer Henderson. Southern Highlands (89141) is a 15-20 minute drive to Henderson and is a nice area. I live here and drive into Henderson for work. <br>  <br>  Generally, the nicest areas are on the edges of town. Be forewarned about living too far back into 89052 & 89044 though.. There's only 1 main road (Eastern) that goes back there, so traffic can be pretty bad at times.<br>  <br>  I have no real knowledge about the sub situation, but we do have a huge budget short-fall and education is one of the things on the chopping block. But maybe that's a good thing for subs? Less full-time teacher = more subs??<br>  <br>  Animals and insects are almost a zero issue. Been here 10 years and have never seen a scorpion or snake at my house and I live right up against a mountain with no development behind my house. There's no mosquitoes. One of the great things about living here is that there's almost no bugs. I've seen maybe 5 black widows in my yard and a coyote running by a few times, that's about it.<br>  <br>  You do get use to the heat to some degree, but you'll learn to go out once the sun goes down. Most stores are certainly NOT open 24/7, but they do stay open longer than in other cities. Restaurants are open longer too. Wal-Mart and grocery stores are pretty much the only 24/7 stores. It only snows about once a year and it usually doesn't stick, so thats not really an issue.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled, it's going to be very different. You just have to accept the desert southwest for what it is and what it isn't. I hope the move goes well for you two.|`|urHPuzMsaa	You will find yourself a night dweller for awhile. It is not as hot during the day but still is hot. However, you don't have to deal with the sun at night. Most stores are open 24/7 so that helps. After a full year here your blood thins and you get use to the heat. The only problem comes if you have to go to another part of the country, you will freeze. <br>  <br>  Henderson is a good area. It is a separate city from Las Vegas. You really don't have to worry about the desert life. I lived in the desert in the southwest and I loved the wildlife there and had some strange things happen like mountain lions coming down from the mountains and hopping walls and ate their pets. In Henderson the city is more like a city and not desert. I only saw one scorpian since I have been here. Bugs are few and far between here compared to where I am from. Never saw a snake ... they are far up in the mountains. <br>  <br>  Yeah .. life is a bit different here but honestly ... give it a year and you will be fine. You will love the winter here ...gets cool but not real cold.<br>   <br>  Teachers are in demand here.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	Also, remember that Vegas is a diverse climate.  In the summer it might seem all desert but there are places you can easily sneak away to:<br>  Mt Charleston - has snow in winter/about 20-30 degrees cooler than the strip in the summer.<br>  - it's about 25 minutes from downtown<br>  <br>  Red Rock <br>  Boulder City|`|AA10240904	Henderson can be a very nice place to live.  Green Valley Development has the most choices.  You don't want to rent/buy in the areas called Pittman or Basic(original areas).   Highland Hillsl is an older area and has nice homes (near Downtown).  The areas on the way up Boulder Highway toward Boulder City are near the mountains and more chance of critters.<br>  <br>  Snakes are not an issue unless you live on the edge of an undeveloped desert zone.  Snakes don't like people any more than we like them.  Same for scorpions and vigaroons.  We lived in Henderson for years with undeveloped desert besides us.  The few times we saw any desert creatures they were of no threat.  BTW you will probably see more lizards, and they don't hurt you, just eat other bugs.<br>  <br>  Clark County needs teachers.  Subs have to have specific credentials.  But right now with the terrible Vegas economy the Clark County School District is talking about laying off permanent subs (benefits issue).  Contact them directly at www.ccsd.net<br>  <br>  You will adjust to living in Vegas and when you need a fix you can always go see the kids/grandkids, etc.  <br>  <br>  Locals know that going out in the heat of the day is not a good idea.  Unless they are leaving work, most stay inside or at the pool from 2:00 p.m. until 6:00.  But then there are those desert lizzzzzards like myself who don't mind the heat and sunshine (a benefit).  And snow is a rarity here, one you look at from inside and know in a few hours will be gone.<br>  <br>  When you move here be prepared for lots of adult visitors who want free room and board LOL.  Really.  Depending on the size of your home and attitude, you may need to set rules of visitation.  For us it was family, friends were directed toward a nice motel or hotel.
pIvN6TY7aa	First of all, contact your local Al-Anon group.  They will be able to give you better advice for your particular situation than you'll find from Answers.  Our intentions are good, but we're pretty ignorant ....<br>  <br>  Next, check to see whether your Canadian option is still active. <br>  <br>  In some provinces, esp. Ontario, there have been shocking layoffs. Even the Alberta Oilpatch, which was hungry for all sorts of skilled laborourers, is contracting as oil prices have fallen.  Check, as well, just what the immigration requirements are.  Depending on the job offer, the question may be trivial, or take years.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, leaving your children in the care of a drunken and abusive person is entirely unacceptable.  <br>  <br>  Taking them with you to another country, unless you have the support of friends or family there, is just about as difficult for all concerned.<br>  <br>  Talk to your local Social Services people.  The advice of a social worker would be really valuable.  If necessary, talk to a lawyer, and find out what your options are.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that the easiest solution would be for her to come home to find the locks changed and her 'stuff' outside. Why should you and the children have to move away from her?<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it would seem sensible to get another place where you are working now, and move the children there.<br>  <br>  If that's not possible, at least stay nearby, so you're available to your children, if/when the need arises.<br>  <br>  If you have a job where you are, hang on to it.  Unless you're independently wealthy (lol!)<br>  <br>  There are many options open to you, if you try to look.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, if you have a chance to go to canada,then take it.its a much better Quality of life over there.all my family are over there.i can't go,because ill heath stop me.you will never look back.you can always take the kids with you.i don't think she will change.|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	The best thing for you to do for all concerned is take the job in Canada and take your children with you.  By the way, if you want to prove to your wife that she is nasty when drunk, get her on video and play it for her when she is sober.  I guarantee it will be a sobering experience for her.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	You cannot...yes 'cannot', not 'should not'...leave your kids with a mother who has a drinking problem.<br>  <br>  How are things going to be easier? You're still going to be married to her, you're still going to think about her.<br>  <br>  Maybe she cannot change. I would try and get her some help first, as in professional help, before you just leave her. If you love your wife and want to help her, there is nothing worse you can do than leave her with two young kids. <br>  <br>  The other very heartless option is to take your kids with you. But you will still have a wife. Things will not just suddenly be ok because she is on a different continent.
PA0bGBtCaa	The minimum drinking age is whatever the age is where the airplane is "flagged." IE, all US carriers have a minimum drinking age of 21 becuase it's 21 in the United States.|`|Zadysvg5aa	My son was refused alcohol on a flight to Canada when he was 18.  The steward said it was19 years in Canada and the local age restriction applied because the plane was an Air Canada flight. He explained that this aviation rule applies to all flights.  So, if it's a UK carrier, it will be 18,  or a US carrier it will be 21 or a Canadian carrier it will be 19.  <br>  I expect if the plane is a UAE carrier it will be 21.|`|XwVDQLmuaa	the drinking age is the same as where ever the plane is leaving from|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	The laws of the country where the "Airways" is based.<br>  Uk would be 18 etc.|`|U2tx9gDHaa	18|`|eevhC1Ivaa	10

AA11091664	I'm an Appalachian-American from Alabama (some call us "hillbillies"). I've lived in Hawaii for eight and a half years, on three different islands. I've also spent a couple of years in a small town in Taiwan, and more than three in Washington, DC. <br>  <br>  I've studied ethnicity and population in graduate school at UH Manoa while living in an international community, and later taught in a middle school where 75% of the students had some Native Hawaiian ancestry. In some ways, I am uniquely qualified to answer your question. I can only tell you a little bit what it is like to be Asian in Hawaii, since I haven't experienced that directly, and never will.<br>  <br>  The populations differ from island to island.  Oahu is about a third American of Japanese Ancestry (who have intermarried a bit less than the other ethnic groups, traditionally), about a third is Caucasian, and about a third is a mixture of mostly Asian and Pacific Islander populations. It is not the least bit unusual to meet an individual who is Part-Hawaiian, Part-Chinese, and Part-German. <br>  <br>  The population of the islands of Hawaii and Kauai are similar to Oahu. Maui is about 40% Caucasian, though, Lanai is more than half Filipino, and Molokai is more than half Native Hawaiian, with an unusual percentage of people with more than half Native Hawaiian ancestry because of the Hawaiian Home Lands program.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing: except for Washington, DC, Hawaii, and possibly New Mexico, non-Latino whites have been the numerical majority for the last several decades in each of the states. And in those three places, there is a notable imbalance of power such that many scholars would say whites are the majority as far as the structure of society, even if they aren't the largest group.<br>  <br>  I'm greatly oversimplifying when I say there are two ways of looking at society in Hawaii--there are about a million, but bear with me. In the Local (with a capital L) way of looking at things, the Native Hawaiians (and Part-Hawaiians) are at the center of society.<br>  <br>  The next tier out is a handful of ethnic groups that labored on Plantations in Hawaii. The Portuguese are included in this group, so they aren't considered "haoles" (which originally meant foreigners, but is now pretty much considered to be Caucasians). In fact, I saw a birth certificate not too long ago which listed one parent as Caucasian and the other parent as Portuguese, because that's how statistics are kept in Hawaii. The Portuguese were laborers on the plantations, the haoles where owners and overseers. That's a distinction that may never die out. The Locals who worked on the Plantations have a fairly secure acceptance in Local society, unless they act too "high makamaka".<br>  <br>  At the edges of that group are a handful of other groups, and I'm not sure of their status relative to each other. They include Asians who have recently moved from Asia, "local haoles" who grew up in Hawaii, people from other Pacific Islands, and populations who kind of look like the Locals, including Asians from other states, Mexicans, Alaskan Natives. <br>  <br>  Locals have a number of ethnic nicknames which are considered gentle teasing most of the time. The one for Americans of Japanese Ancestry from North America is meant to mimic the hollow sound of tapping a ripe watermelon. I don't use the nickname myself, I'm just letting you know it's out there.<br>  <br>  Fresh, white transplants from North America might be the next rung out. There's a probationary period, where people wait to see how long you're going to stick around and how you're going to act. And finally, you have the short-term visitors on which the money economy depends, since agriculture has become less and less viable in recent decades. And for some reason, the outsiders on whom the economy depends like to remind the Locals of that fact as if it will make the Locals respect the malihini (guests) more. There's some tension there.  <br>  <br>  In this Local society, how you look, how you sound (if you speak Pidgin naturally, that's good, if you try to fake it, that's very bad), and how you act are all important. You cannot expect to reasonably predict the criteria by which you will be judged. For example, how much you enjoy eating food is more important than you might realize. <br>  <br>  And if you happen to be a Professional, it might help you to act like you're Working Class, since Local Society is dominated by the Working Class. Labor unions are very powerful, and some Local people suffer a certain loss of status if they get too much education. <br>  <br>  There are people who don't know about the history of Hawaii. There are those who know about it and think folks should forget it and just move forward. There are others whose lives have been profoundly impacted by history. Some of those are angry, and some of those are bitter. Many hate the relationship of power and economic relationships we have inherited through that history, and a few just hate the pale skin color. Many of those have significant European DNA and surnames in their family tree, whether or not it shows up in their skin tone.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Caucasians (haoles, as I'll call them and what they're called here) aren't the majority like on the mainland. We Asians are. Some don't see that. We're still the majority, despite where you heard that the Asian population is shrinking.<br>  <br>  There are locals here who don't like haoles, mostly the Hawaiians because of all the history. Plus the haoles don't necessarily know what not to do in Hawaii, and that makes the Hawaiians mad. <br>  <br>  There are some mean haoles here. I've gotten yelled at by one and I was all shaken about it afterward. Note that she's a local and so am I. Did I disrespect her? No way.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, I think that haoles are considered "bad" by some because they're not the majority here, the tourists don't know how to act, and (some) haole locals are mean to the non-haole locals.|`|SQWvMx6Maa	Adding to what ladydreamer254 said:<br>  Some of the local haoles will get mad if an old person cuts in front of them while on the road. I mean they don't know what they're doing and they're old so they gotta let it go. But they just yell from the back and honk their horns (you shouldn't do that here people get agitated) and its so shameful they don't know how to treat people with aloha sometimes.|`|YhECDSKRaa	You've gotten some very informative responses, so I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about information that has been already well covered.  And I can't compare Hawaii to the other 49 states as I've only lived in 2 of them.  I'll just say that I am haole & have lived here over half of my life.  Have I ever been on the receiving end of racism?  Sure, but not very often.  With the exception of a very small percentage of folks who are carrying around a lot of bitterness, most locals will give you the benefit of the doubt.  I think people who run into a lot of racism are either hanging around places where they shouldn't be or are bringing it on themselves by their behavior.|`|0eT9mNhdaa	White folks buy out everything and raise taxes so that only the rich come there and live there.<br>  <br>  <br>  The native hawaiians (poorest group) get kicked off their own island that way and is forced to move to the states.<br>  <br>  <br>  See why theres a lot of Haole hate?|`|COWsSguVaa	nah, that award goes to new york. hawaii is 2nd|`|8VEEihaqaa	Well, all that slighting/belittling that you have to tolerate there in the mainland often comes with some of the white people who move here.  Locals here, however, do not tolerate it.  Hawaii is all about respect, and while the locals here may seem horribly racist for making fun of so many races the way we do, we never do it in a hurtful way and we never single out any race; it's like we all agree that we're equally open to being made fun of, and in a strange way, that makes us all equally respect each other as races.<br>  <br>  The white people you've met that are complaining about it being the least white friendly state are usually the people who bring that "mainland" attitude with them and expect for it to be tolerated here.  When it's not, they complain that it's racism, when really we just don't like unnecessary negativity.  Hawaii is a very laid back state.<br>  <br>  Also, just like any other place you go, there are always people who are racist.  Hawaii and the U.S. have a very controversial past, and there are a lot of people who are still pretty sour about it, just like there are still Native Americans on reserves that are still sour about America being taken from them.  My grandmother is full Hawaiian, and she married a white man from Santa Barbara, Cali.  I know lots of white people who live here happily, both that were born here and that have moved here.

fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	With kids you might consider Branson. They have lots of choices of things for kids of all ages that will keep them busy. Silver Dollar City, Celebraton city, lots of mini golf, go karts, ride the ducks etc. You can get everything from a condo rental, to a hotel room or a cabin on the lake. Very family friendly. You might inquire to make sure where you want to stay will be pet friendly. If not you may have to kennel the dog.<br>  <br>  You could also consider the Lake of the Ozarks. <br>  <br>  Chicago is fun as is Wisconsin Dells. <br>  You might also consider Kentucky Lake or Memphis or Lexington Kentucky area.|`|jPfcKtgdaa	Just save your money for something that would be fun....8 hours outside of STL is :(  or try going for a little bit of a longer drive and hit up gulf shores|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Thinking outside of the box here why not try Destin Florida? It is only about 12 hours drive from St. Louis. There is good golf and the beaches are spectaclular. There is a waterpark, shopping, spas and in general something for everyone in your entire family to do. Most restaurants are of the family variety - go early or you may have a long wait!<br>  <br>  It is not very expensive either. I am heading to the "redneck Riviera" or "St. Louis South" in June.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter when she was one and we survived the drive.<br>  <br>  I will second Nashville, TN as a great destination also.|`|2XbErUofaa	8 hours is a pretty wide net! That's like 500 miles.. can you be more specific as to what you're looking for?<br>  <br>  My favorites within that zone would have to be: Chicago, Mammoth Cave NP, and the Cumberland Gap / Great Smokey Mountains NP area. Cincinnati ain't too bad either.|`|a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	Kansas City :o....|`|TskZHzZyaa	We're from the Chicago area and we really liked Springfield.  The Lincoln Library and Museum is definitely worth a trip.  There are really great interactive theaters.  Most of the Lincoln sites around town are free.<br>  <br>  Cities might be difficult if you're traveling with a dog.  Otherwise Chicago, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee all have great things about them.  I'm sure Kansas City does too but I've never been there.  A couple of smaller cities I am familiar with are Bloomington and Columbus, Indiana, both south of Indianapolis.  Columbus is unique for having several buildings by world famous architects, beautiful city.  <br>  <br>  Between Columbus and Bloomington is Nashville, Indiana and Brown County State Park, a really nice place if you like the outdoors.<br>  <br>  A little farther is the bigger Nashville in Tennessee, that is a really great city rich with history.  Even if you're not a country fan the people are so friendly and the city is great.  If you can swing it a few days stay at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel is amazing, a true resort so big you don't have to leave if you want.  They might even have dog services as big as they are.<br>  <br>  Back in Indiana is West Baden Springs in French Lick, Indiana, also a large indoor resort lovingly restored and reopened a few years ago.  There may be a casino there but also family things to do.  <br>  <br>  Cincinnati is a really neat city too, a lot like St Louis though with it being on the river, but much hillier and older.  They have an amazing art deco train station converted into a museum center that I try to get to every few years.  They also opened the Underground Railroad Museum recently which is also very well done.  Just watch what neighborhoods you're in at night there.<br>  <br>  We stayed in St Louis a few years ago and loved the City Museum - if you haven't been there yet GO!!<br>  <br>  Finally if you like smaller towns consider Galena, Illinois, a older river town.  I haven't been there either but I know a lot of people that find Galena to be a restful place worth visiting.

He will need to compromise like any other politician if he wants to get anything accomplished as far as peace goes.  If he sticks to this rhetoric he will only further alienate the international community against Israel (something that they can ill afford to do).  He may be only a "stop gap" measure to insure that the status quo remains until a real humanitarian can be elected as the leader of the State of Israel.|`|OhrysGKIaa	I hope so.  Why give up land to terrorists?  That would hurt Israel's security. The Muslims/Palestinians have to give something back.  How about returning that kidnapped soldier from 2005 for starters?|`|74RNHyxHaa	No, and I don't he's serious about being able to wipe out Hamas as well. All radical extremists talk that way.<br>  <br>  @ED: Don't you DARE insult Prophet Muhammed(pbuh), you uneducated idiot.|`|bgQP1Aquaa	he'd better be!<br>  Weve tried that and it didnt work.<br>  <br>  this is the truth from the holy land and you cant get any better than that!<br>  Bye bye!|`|B3FBgxjEaa	Would you ???
URZNtrxsaa	Yes, you can and should only carry them with you in your carry on, as long as they are in the original bottle with the drug script label in your name showing on the bottle (same label that you get now from the pharmacy). The info must show the script number and doctors name along with the name of the drug. Yes to taking multiple bottles as long as you have proof that you will be in Europe for an extended stay. BTW, I might suggest talking to your local pharmacist and asking him or her to give you one of their watertight white pill bottles (usually 100 pills) that he or she can label for you. This is more secure and all the pills are inside of one secure bottle.|`|0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Yes, take them in their original packaging. Make sure your pharmacy or doctor information is listed somewhere on the bottle/box, or bring a copy of the prescription.<br>  <br>  Keep them in your carryon, in a clear plastic bag (like you carry liquids in for security). I've kept prescriptions in the same bag as liquids, or in a different bag, so either way works. You're supposed to take them out of your bag and put them in the trays they provide, along with other loose items.<br>  <br>  You only need papers if you're carrying a scheduled prescription like Xanax, but none of my medications have ever been examined. There are too many people transporting all sorts of over the counter meds and prescriptions to check closely.
AA10192646	Considering the distance between the two points (about 11 km in direct distance), your options can vary depending on day and time of travel, as well as your style of travel (ie want to get their fast, or with least changes), and how much walking you are willing to make.<br>  <br>  If we say that you will travel on Monday noon, seeking the fastest routes, with no more than 5 minutes of walking, then your trip will be around 60-75 minutes long. Here are some possible options: (Note: paying cash for your trips is costly. Use an Oyster card)<br>  <br>  - Catch Bus 109 or 250 from Green Lane to Brixton station where you can take the Victoria Line to Green Park, then change to Piccadilly Line to Covent Garden. The Oyster fare for this trip is 2.60 pounds (1 pound for the bus, and 1.60 for the underground).<br>  <br>  - Take Bus 50, 109 or 255 from Streatham High Road to Norbury station where you can take the rail to Victoria station. From there, take the Victoria Line to Green Park and change to Piccadilly Line to Covent Garden. This has the same fare as the previous route, adding the rail fare of 3.10 pounds.<br>  <br>  - If you are willing to walk a little bit more, then walk to Norbury station, catch the train to Victoria and then the Circle or District Line to Embankment. You can walk then through the street of the Covent Garden area to Floral.<br>  <br>  - Going solely on buses can be cheaper, though longer in time (90 minutes). You can take Bus 50, 109 or 250 to Streatham station then change to Bus 159 to Trafalgar Sqaure and then walk to Floral. This will cost 2 pounds by Oyster.<br>  <br>  - Alternatively, you can take Bus 109 or 250 to Brixton station, then Bus 59 to Holborn. 2 pounds too.<br>  <br>  I suggest to consult the advanced journey planner on tfl.gov.uk to search your favourite options. You can use exact addresses to enhance the search. I like the site. Enjoy.

1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	April will not be hot.  If your from Italy, the weather will be like your winter.  There will be windy days and rain.  Below is the average temperatures for the month:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/monthly/60601?month=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/bu...</a><br>  <br>  Prices in Chicago are high.  It's not a cheap city.  There are some bargains.  One is public transportation.  It's fairly easy to get to where you want and the cost is reasonable.<br>  <br>  Food costs are high if you eat in restaurants but there are many places to get a sandwich, pizza, Mexican food that are good and lower in price.  Chicago is famous for Italian Beef sandwiches, hot dogs, and deep dish pizza.<br>  <br>  Below are some sights you might like to see while here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&rlz=1T4GFRD_enUS218US218&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=chicago+tourism&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&view=text&ei=jPGzSZ7_N6boMJLgtIAF&sa=X&oi=local_group&resnum=1&ct=more-results&cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=nav...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gochicagocard.com/?GCID=S18000x004-5833-CHIMGTtsm1&KEYWORD=chicago%20tourism&MATCHTYPE=search" rel="nofollow">http://www.gochicagocard.com/?GCID=S1800...</a>|`|AA10945574	Well, I live in Chicago and right NOW- the weather is really rainy and cold, but it's going to get up to about 60-ish later. The prices are normal (as in not overpriced). One place I love to go is to Symphony Center to see the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, I'm actually going later this month. I love it here, and oh look, it's raining again.|`|EBVraXRpaa	the city of chicago will be more warmer next month so you will enjoy your trip|`|3buQDaRDaa	No. It is great. It is kind of expensive. There is no way to predict the weather. It could be in the 70's or the 40's. You should check out the weather in the days leading up to your trip. You should check out the museums, Grant Park, and Wrigley Field.<br>  <br>  The food that the guy above me forgot to mention is a Maxwell street polish sausage. For pizza there is Gino's or Lou's. Giordano's is also good. You should try Superdawg and or Jean and Jude's for hot dogs. Gold Coast and Portillo's are also good. A fancy place to eat that I highly recommend is the Signature Room at the 95th. It is a restuarant near the top of the Hancock Building.
