I  have a 04 (2004) BMW 318iSE and the yellow engine symbol lit up this morning. The manual says this means the exhaust emissions have deteriorated and I should get it investigated soon. What I'd like to know is what could be causing this and is it potentially expensive to fix. It's already booked in for a service and MOT at a BMW garage next week so I'll be taking it in then but I'd like some idea of what they may tell me. Cheers.

20090202105835AAThOpa	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Someone hit my girlfriend's car in the apartment parking lot, and I found the car that caused it?	What's the next step?  The other day I noticed her passenger door had a BIG dent in it and a red paint scrape, and now the door doesn't close properly. I looked around at all the cars and found a red car with a scrape on the driver fender at the same height with some paint rubbed off.  Grabbed some pictures with my phone camera.  This person always parks in the same lot as her.  I called the police and had them look at it, they agreed it looks like the car hit her.  I said I'd try dealing with the person since they live in the apartment, and I'm going to try and deal with the person, and see if they can settle it (not very optimistic since they didn't bother to leave a note).  If that doesn't work the officer said to go back to him, and proceed that way.  Is the best course of action to give him the option to A) pay to fix it himself, or B) I can officially report it and proceed that way?      Wondering what other steps I should take or what else I should do before continuing.

20090205105035AA7Y0fP	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	What's the best thing for me to do... upside down on my car loan?	So here's the deal... I owe $4600 on a car that's booking for $3,300 (with a couple MINOR mechanical problems) and $3,800 in good condition. I had a guy offer me $3,500 for it. But I don't really want to take that much of a loss.      It gets better though... I found a car that's priced for almost $2000 less then what it books for. So my bank said they'd roll over the remaining amount on my existing car to the new car... IF that's what I decide I want to do.      My husband thinks I should wait and pay the car down some more. But the problem is that it's our primary vehical. The longer I keep the car, the more miles that get put on it, and therefore is worth less and less everyday.      SO... Does anyone have any advise for me? =)

20090202121804AAvX0yu	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Rover 25 Windscreen Wiper problem?	The windscreen wipers on my car do work.....when they want to.    First turn of the stick 'pulses' the wipers, 2nd turn makes them constant & 3rd turn is the fast constant setting (incidentally).  Also, press down on the stick once makes them go the once.    Pressing down on the stick works EVERY time, but whichever option I choose on the switch makes them go just when they want it seems.    They will work, eventually.  They'll just start going, but there could be a gap of up to 30 seconds before they start.  (A bit annoying when it's raining heavily).  Remember, I do have the 'press down' option if things get too delayed!    Whenever I try to show someone the problem, they just work, which makes me look a bit daft!!  Also, whenever I show someone, they work (when it's not raining!), but when I NEED them, they play up.    Is this only happening when it's raining, or is that a coincidence?    Anyway, anyone have any idea's what's causing it?  What could be wrong?    Thanks for any help.

When they lifted the car onto the tow truck there was a puddle of what I assume was oil on the ground where the car had been standing.       Do you think it's the gasket, whatever that is, and how serious a problem is this?

I have a 1990 Nissan Sentra, and for nearly four months I've been dealing with this problem.  I'll turn on my car and drive for about 5 minutes and suddenly my car will start to sputter.  When I try to accelerate, my car doesn't, and it feels like it's running in neutral.  It is a four-cylinder manual drive.  My grandparents who gave me the car tell me it might be the fuel injector, but I've changed this to no avail.  I also heard other solutions which I haven't implemented for I want to make sure others might agree with the solution.  Also, it seems that my car is burning oil.  I've heard this could be any number of problems like bad rings or even transmission.  I don't have a clue.  Lastly, will I personally be able to fix this myself with ease and how much will it cost?  Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you.
