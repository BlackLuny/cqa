20090203114235AAoFkC6	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Im trying to dance, but lack of self confidence!?	I have never been to a dance lesson before, and even though i really wont too we cant afford it. I also love acting and singing, you no the stage side of it all. And one thing i have got to love is just getting up on stage and dancing! But when i try to dance at home to music, i end up thinking "am i any good?". And i do really wont to dance and be reconsigned like by theatre train but im getting the feeling i wont be. I have just sent a video of me to theatre train to ask if they think i am any good, i would love them to say i was wonderful. But how do you no they mean that? I am going in for a dance with my friends for the talent show, but feel like i wont to drop out... What would happen if i totally mess up?? And how am i ever going to get the real practise and get good if i cant go to any clubs?? I really wont to get good, because i feel like i could go far with dance, but mum thinks im so good at english and should do that when i leave school. But i wont to just do dance and acting, or am i waisting my time? Should i be concentrating on much more important things than dreaming of being a good dancer?   How am i going to get confidence and go far??      Any comments would be very much appreciated

20090203114552AAlSM2Y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help, please????????	I just finished my 124k novel; I'm 14, and I need a good title for it. The basic idea is a girl goes to live with her dad, her boyfriend died a few years back, he is still in her life as a ghost; the girl meets a guy that has amazing features, (bronze hair turquoise eyes) so on. This guy has the same exac features as her dead bf, and she can't tell then apart but she thinks her dead ex might of taken over her new lover's body. It's almost like a... "love triangle" in a way I guess you could say. I really want a unique one- word title for my YA romance/drama novel. I've tried so many names for the characters on for size and t seems like not one if them are perfect enough. Same with the title. Tv cover is already designed; my best friend whom I love like a sister has drawn the perfect cover; her being an artist. Two hands intertwined but coming undone and a red/black rose slippig from them. The first name I tried on fir size was forever; that didn't do. Then, forever, I still didn't do. Then always&forever and i'm still just not sure.   Also, names for my characters:   Addison-marie Smith was the first, and I quickly grew tired of it.    Now it's Abigail "Abby" Caroline Sinewy and I'm still just not sure. She's A clumsy girl; paranoid; gorgeous but doesn't think she is. Pale ivory skin, green eyes and chocolate brown hair. About 5'4, 110 LB, bites her fingernails when she's nervous.   And for my guys,:   (alive) Brad tommy Slagle. I'm growing tired if it.   John Paul Collin   (dead) Davie Edward osbourne   Please help. It seems like nothing is just right.    "Addie & Brad" negative.    "John & Abby" not so sure.    I need names that will blend well together.   I would also love a one-word unique title.    *sorry about the miss punctuation and capitalzaion. I'm on my itouch and it's getting on my nerve. And, sorry about how long it is. As an author, you can never keep stuff short :)    Thanks in advance,   Madison

20090221025414AAXkj6q	Arts & Humanities;History	Please Answer ! how and why was edward seymour (protector of the realm) removed from his power by john dudley?	edward seymour -the duke of somerset was the oldest of the 8 seymour siblings and after Jane's and Henry's death he became his nephew Edward's Protector. He and Thomas Cranmer tried to make England's change into a Protestant country slow but by 1549 he became over-confident and the changes became bigger. He removed the most powerful Catholics from the Council and were sent to the Tower. The Bishops who opposed were sacked and replaced by Protestants etc. Seymour stopped holding full council meetings and just met with his closest supporters in his home which was a palace built by the Palace which was built by the money stolen from Catholics & the Church one way or another..      So after that what happened? I understand John Dudley (Duke of Northumberland) was a close friend of his but then he wanSeymourymou out of the way..      Why was this and how did he do it?

A broken doll with splintered skin,   As she dances with an aching pose.      A lily white sky of perfect hands,   Did carve her silken thighs of oak.   A perfect figure of the day lit lands,   To wrap her in a paper cloak.      So sweet and small, the ticking tune,   The measuring of her silent heart.   The heart that embraced a fallen moon,   To stitch the earth of sunken art.      Her neck to stretch and yearn for light,   To lean and spy the leather stars.   Her dripping fingers under sleeves so tight,   They tear to cast her wooden scars.      A sugar soaked mouth to drink the sun,   Watching eyes to abandon tears.   Her narrow heels that cannot run,   She hears the tune with pointed ears.               the image it should bring is a wooden ballerina in a music box. dunno what it makes you think of though, please tell me!

20090221051013AAeqFEq	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	I need to get money for ballet classes!!?	i have started taking ballet at a studio that is pretty far away from my house. the class that i take once a week i feel that i am not learning a lot. even if i were to add a class every week, it would be a different group of people with a different teacher and i would be doing the same thing. so, i began taking open classes at my studio that are at a slightly harder level. it is harder but i practice a lot and think i am starting to get better. when fall comes, i want to audition for this new studio. this studio is slightly different, and uses level 1, level 2, level 3, etc. like most studios, each level has a certain required days a week. this studio is by audition. if i make it in at the level that i am at, then i will be with a bunch of 7 year olds. i want to do it with people more my age. i am 12 years old. however, this new studio will cost more money, and i dont thin kthat my father will pay for it. my mother cannot because she is currently unemployed and cannot afford it. my father will certainly pay for some of it. i will not be doing summer camp next summer so that is something that will help my dad pay for it. so i guess i have 2 questions. how can i improve my ballet enough to get into a higher level, and how can i make enough money to pay for some of it. i have some money saved up but i have to use it for open classes at my current studio. HELP ME!!
20090220184836AAJtZJU	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I am going to post this poem, either you laugh or you cry .. which one?	I wrote this a while back under the influence of migraine medication and pain.....       Wild, wild dream      I dreamt that I was dropped in space on the planet named Uranus, It was wickedly cold there and what transpired is hard to explain ---thus,   I am muddling wickedly, searching my word bank, for the words to spin out this tale.      I was standing there and I noted beside me a little glob of jelly   The jelly glob was growing larger and I stepped back in stunned curiosity   The jelly mass morphed into a figure, a figure that looked real to me, however things are not always what  they seem as you see what happened to me..   I said “Oh my goodness, how did you get here?” And “how did you morph from that Jelly? “ She laughed and said “I’ll show you” and with that she did...   She scrunched up her face so tightly, I thought that it would give her great pain, then she opened her eyes and twitched a bit and vavoom she was jelly again.   I thought to myself she seemed a good sport, I would try to do as she showed me...  I squinched my eyes, my nose, and my lips   I placed my hands, both on my hips... I shook first left and then right foot…  I closed my eyes and opened again... Nothing had happened so I did it again      Suddenly I felt my body go soupy, my mind was swirling a little bit loopy.   I morphed myself into a liquidy mass of goopy jell on the floor.   I thought to myself, this feels pretty good… no bones complaining no muscles to work, but then reality hit, with a tiny jerk.   I realized with, the wind chill and force I would dry up in short course   So finding my voice I threw out these words… “How now do I morph back into me?”   The mass of jelly, laughed then, hysterically, this was becoming very scary…..   Laughing so hard she morphed into a kitten -- a cute furry thing and I was smitten, But the kitten licked me once, she licked my twice, this did not feel nice.... I said shoo, shoo kitty and kitten backed up   Her eyes glowing brightly her teeth gleaming white, she growing steadily now quickly… I held my breath and then she licked me!   With one slurping mouthful she swallowed me down…    I wasn’t to happy inside in the dark so I wiggled and squirmed I had no legs or arms… If I had, I‘d be kicking and punching trying to do her harm.   I suppose the movement I made in her belly, made her sorry she swallowed me *jelly* She burped as only a cat can do, heaved once or twice as though had a hairball, summarily now I found myself out, regurgitated without a doubt.    And as I tried to catch my breath from that escape with sudden death I morphed once more and I was me… glad of that in all sincerity…    Glad to wake up away from Uranus, I shall not go near there again.
20090221023433AAYijNa	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can a Dorsimbra be a floral offering?	Flower In the Mist (A Dorsimbra)   By Elaine Polin      I saw the flower waving in the mist,   though I could sense no hint of space or time,   its colors drew me, I could not resist   a pathway marker to a world sublime.      Was I in Hell   and being shown   what might    have been?      I saw no sun, no stars, nor heard a sound   as sense-deprived, I longed for Ocean’s voice.   What dreams are these? What message do they send?   I saw the flower waving in the mist.

20090221001324AACCanZ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think of this story?	Take my Son    A wealthy man and his son loved to collect rare works of art. They had everything in their collection, from Picasso to Raphael. They would often sit together and admire the great works of art.           When the Vietnam conflict broke out, the son went to war. He was very courageous and died in battle while rescuing another soldier. The father was notified and grieved deeply for his only son.       About a month later, just before Christmas, there was a knock at the door A young man stood at the door with a large package in his hands.       He said, "Sir, you don't know me, but I am the soldier for whom your son gave his life. He saved many lives that day, and he was carrying me to safety when a bullet struck him in the heart and he died instantly. He often talked about you, and your love for art." The young man held out this package. "I know this isn't much. I'm not really a great artist, but I think your son would have wanted you to have this."                                 The father opened the package. It was a portrait of his son, painted by the young man. He stared in awe at the way the soldier had captured the personality of his son in the painting. The father was so drawn to the eyes that his own eyes welled up with tears. He thanked the young man and offered to pay him for the picture. "Oh, no sir, I could never repay what your son did for me. It's a gift."                              The father hung the portrait over his mantle. Every time visitors came to his home he took them to see the portrait of his son before he showed them any of the other great works he had collected.       The man died a few months later. There was to be a great auction of his paintings Many influential people gathered, excited over seeing the great paintings and having an opportunity to purchase one for their collection.                                 On the platform sat the painting of the son The auctioneer pounded his gavel. "We will start the bidding with this picture of the son. Who will bid for this picture?"                                 There was silence.      Then a voice in the back of the room shouted, "We want to see the famous paintings. Skip this one."                                 But the auctioneer persisted. "Will somebody bid for this painting. Who will start the bidding? $100, $200?"                                 Another voice angrily. "We didn't come to see this painting. We came to see the Van Gogh's, the Rembrandt's. Get on with the real bids!"                                 But still the auctioneer continued. "The son! The son! Who'll take the son?"             Finally, a voice came from the very back of the room. It was the longtime gardener of the man and his son. "I'll give $10 for the painting." Being a poor man, it was all he could afford.                                 "We have $10, who will bid $20?"                                 "Give it to him for $10. Let's see the masters."                        "$10 is the bid, won't someone bid $20?"                                 The crowd was becoming angry. They didn't want the picture of the son.                                 They wanted the more worthy investments for their collections.       The auctioneer pounded the gavel. "Going once, twice, SOLD for $10!"                    A man sitting on the second row shouted, "Now let's get on with the collection!"       The auctioneer laid down his gavel. "I'm sorry, the auction is over."       "What about the paintings?"       "I am sorry. When I was called to conduct this auction, I was told of a secret stipulation in the will. I was not allowed to reveal that stipulation until this time. Only the painting of the son would be auctioned. Whoever bought that painting would inherit the entire estate, including the paintings.       The man who took the son gets everything!"       God gave His son 2,000 years ago to die on the cross. Much like the auctioneer, His message today is: "The son, the son, who'll take the son?"    Because, you see, whoever takes the Son gets everything.       FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, WHO SO EVER BELIEVETH, SHALL HAVE ETERNAL LIFE...THAT'S LOVE

20090220225729AAhR6WH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think about this story? Any suggestions?	Okay so here's the deal. I am 14 years old and I love to write, I just had a weird idea for a story and wanted to get your opinion. The main character's name is being debated (sophie, ava, or chole) she is about 16 years old, witty, sacastic, tomboy who likes to wear big comfy hoodies and she likes to go to up to "The Den" which is a place not far from her house in the mountains. A new family moves in the neighborhood and a boy named Beau is about a year older than her. They start to hang out and become good friends and she asks him to come hang out with her at the den one evening. Read on for the rest of this part.       I was almost to the den when I heard something up ahead. Beau said he would meet me here around nine thirty, but it was only eight. Maybe he had come early to surprise me. He knew I loved it up here and probably anticipated me being here long before him.      “Beau? Is that you?” I said, with a hint of a smile on my face. My heart was beating faster than normal, my stomach was doing back flips. I smoothed out my hair and felt my checks turn red. It was in that moment, that I finally realized what that strange feeling I had around him was. I loved him. Or at least, that’s what it seemed to be.       I peered around the tree in the direction where the noise came from.      “Beau are you up here? I-”      I froze in my tracks. What stood before me was  beyond this world, unlike anything I could ever have imagined. Black, horrifying wings spread from its fleshless spine,  its ashen colored bones illuminated in the moonlight. I thought I was facing Death; The Grim Reaper himself. And not the cutesy one they animate in old fashion Disney cartoons.       I began to back away as slowly and quietly as I could, keeping my eye on him. A branch cracked beneath my feet. I covered my mouth to keep myself from screaming out loud. The figure turned at the sound, and stared at me with its empty hollow eyes.       At that moment I figured I had two options: Faint and let Death take me away from this world, or run down the mountain side screaming like the teenage girl I was. I wasn’t so keen on the idea of a young, mysterious death, so I chose the second option.       At this time I also realized that tears may possibly be the most inconvenient bodily function known to man. Particularly when you are running down a mountain in the dark on a cold autumn night with your face towards the wind.  Already blinded by the night, I had to deal with the tears filling in my eyes from the “Near Death Experience”.        I was wiping my eyes with my hoodie when I ran into something hard. I fell backwards and began to  automatically beg for my life from the thing that stood before me.       “Please, please spare me… I didn’t mean to interrupt you, I was just coming to meet my friend and I thought you were-”      “What are you doing?” A familiar voice interrupted, with a hint of humor in his voice.      I opened my eyes to see Beau, looking at me with one eyebrow raised and a blanket in his hand.       “Beau! Beau… I am so glad to see you” I said hysterically, beginning to cry again. I got up and hugged him so hard I practically tackled him. He stumbled a bit before catching himself and hugged me back.       “Its nice to see you too…” he said, still puzzled. “What happened to you? You look like you just saw a ghost.”      “You have no idea how close you are…” I said under my breath, snuggling my head closer to his chest. I have to say, he smelled fantastic…      After about 4 minutes I decided to finally let go of him. I kind of figured he needed to breath when he patted me on the back awkwardly. By then I had stopped crying, but I was still dramatized by the incident.       “How ‘bout we just head back to my car, okay? You can tell me everything when you are nice and warmed up. You’re going to go into shock if you stay out here much longer. Take this blanket, it will keep you warm until we get down to the road.”         Later you find out that either his dad is the grim reaper, his mom is a mythical creature like the grim reaper that shape shifts, and he turns out to be some wicked sweet hybrid or that they have close ties with the grim reaper. Maybe somthing else better (crazy and with a twist) if you have suggestions. Thanks for reading! :)

A broken doll with splintered skin,   As she dances with an aching pose.      A lily white sky of perfect hands,   Did carve her silken thighs of oak.   A perfect figure of the day lit lands,   To wrap her in a paper cloak.      So sweet and small, the ticking tune,   The measuring of her silent heart.   The heart that embraced a fallen moon,   To stitch the earth of sunken art.      Her neck to stretch and yearn for light,   To lean and spy the leather stars.   Her dripping fingers under sleeves so tight,   They tear to cast her wooden scars.      A sugar soaked mouth to drink the sun,   Watching eyes to abandon tears.   Her narrow heels that cannot run,   She hears the tune with pointed ears.

I've also posted this as a movie plot as it would work as a movie too i think, how about as a book?      Ok so it's set in Canada, at a ski/snowboard resort. The main character is a 30yr old snowboard instructor, and he has good friends who are snowboarders and skiers, but he's never had much luck with the ladies. But then one day a gorgeous Californian girl comes along for snowboard lessons, and the guys all want her. She plays the guy hot and cold and basically lots of funny things happen, and there are also some immense snowboarding scenes. I think a good name for it would be Snow Bunny. What do ya think? xxx

20090221054318AALFxsL	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you feel that you'd go crazy if you had to put on a false face to the world all the time?	Telling the truth isn't cutting it. I used to give myself a lot of credit for being honest with people about myself. For example, I'm not happy with how I look, mostly about things that cannot be changed (height, build, baldness). People expect me to be someone who is the exact opposite of who I really am because of my appearance, and when I have told them otherwise, they have generally been rude and dismissive.      Hence, much as I'd like to believe I'm courageous for not pasting on a smile and pretending to feel some way I'm not, "be yourself" is obviously not the greatest advice. Since I cannot alter my appearance, my only other option is to work with it and pretend to be cool with it. Therapy is not going to make me do a whole 180 on my own aesthetics, and I'm pretty much immune to the common pop psychology truisms like "It doesn't matter what you look like if you're beautiful inside", etc., which are mostly designed for children, or people with unquestioning, childlike minds.      For some reason, though, since I cannot change how I look, part of me wants to tell people a variation of "Hey, I can't change this, but at least know that this wasn't my choice. I didn't shave my head because I think it looks good, but because I have no other option, etc., etc." As you can imagine, this does not play well with people, who are either amused or disgusted by my candor.      Hence, being Honest John isn't cutting it. However, I wonder if pretending to like something I don't will be psychologically damaging to me over a long-term basis. I don't know, what do you think?

It doesn't even have to be that interesting I just have to be able to descibe it in a way that the reader can relate to it some how (in the sense that what I have written makes sense and isn't a load of jiberish). my friend wrote about a tropical beach. it was good but i was hoping for something a little more interesting. we were given an example of an a* essay and that was about a journey on the tube. it was amazing because the language was mature. I need something ordinary like that.   thank you so much,   c

The birds and the trees, they saw us gel   together with each other, all so well.      We laughed, we cried, we shared our thoughts and feelings,   we cherished under the sun, our ride on the swings   of life and of wisdom, through which we'd decided to move together,   and stay close to the heart of one another.      For this ever-bonded friendship of love   I pray to god, forever be, divine like a dove.         Please tell me how is it?   Any criticism, compliments or changes are anytime welcome.   Thanks   (btw, i'm 16)

He was standing on a wet concrete patch    at the front edge of the beach,    frantically digging in his shorts.    We stood waist deep in the river water,    our faces gripped and watching.    All at once we roared    through the sand towards him,    grabbing at our crotches.    Bump Nuts was a bad thing,    a very bad thing,    and he was already crying.    We carefully examined our bags,    squirming as we groped ourselves.    Two of us ran home    without saying a word,    and the rest stayed.    Three left now,    secure in our diagnosis    of the matter at hand.   No   Bump Nuts.   We silently gave thanks   and walked down to Beanies   for an ice cream cone.      Years later    I saw that movie,    the one where the boys had leeches    stuck to them in awkward spots,    and I smiled.

The Sonnets of the Portugese  are a collection of poems  written by Elizabeth to her husband-poet Robert Frost.      my favorite is  below     XIV      If thou must love me, let it be for nought    Except for love's sake only. Do not say    I love her for her smile--her look--her way    Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought    That falls in well with mine, and certes brought    A sense of ease on such a day--    For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may    Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,    May be unwrought so. Neither love me for    Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheek dry,--    A creature might forget to weep, who bore    Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!    But love me for love's sake, that evermore    Thou may'st love on, through love's eternity

20090221035329AATscmE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Need help with this story Im writing?	There is a young man in his mid-20's named Jake and whenever he was 5 his parents divorced and is father kidnapped  Jake and leave the mother with their one year old daughter Chelsea. So as it went, the dad got Jake and the mom got Chelsea and shortly afterwards the dad started drinking and abusing Jake  by pushing, punching, throwing him down steps, forcing him to stay locked in a closet for hours, forcing him not to sleep by making him stand in a corner for hours, making him lay in a tub of ice water ect...He started abusing Jake like this whenever Jake was 5 and continued this until Jake was 17 and moved out of his dad's house, leaving Jake emotionally wounded. Jake is 24 now and his dad has passed away and Jake wanted to see his mom and sister (whom he hasnt seen since he was 5) and ask his mom how come she never wanted him (a brainwash his dad done to him). Jake calls his mom and tells her that he wants to see her and Chelsea and whenever he shows up at their house he doesn’t hardly allow them to touch him and he tells them that he was staying at a hotel and they talk him into staying with them and having the guest bedroom. What Jake planned on being a “short stay” ended up being almost a month and in that time Jake’s mom and Chelsea have noticed Jake’s behavior is rather strange. He doesn’t allow them to touch him (whenever they do he usually flinches and asks them to “please don’t touch me”) and he don’t ever smile, laugh or hardly even talk and keeps having nightmares every night that ends with his mom or sister running into the room to wake him up in which he fights them at first until he is fully awake and realizes where he is at. He finally admits to his mom that he had been physically and sexually abused all this time that he has been living with his dad. Chelsea soon finds this out too. One night, Chelsea goes into Jake’s room and wakes him up from a nightmare and tried to hug him but he refuses so she goes and gets him a glass of water instead and asks him if he would like her to stay with him until he goes to sleep which he of course says no, Jake will eventually let his guard down but How can Jake’s mom and sister get him to trust them  and eventually start to smile and laugh again and not be afraid of them touching him? Please remember that this is a story that I am writing for a friend on child abuse everything I have just said is completely fictional and I just need some help on some emotional scenes that you might could think of that could help Jake trust his mom and sister a little more? thanks

20090221034112AAELXvh	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	How common (or uncommon) is the Irish surname, Malia?	My oldest sister told me once that our grandmother's maiden name was Malia (born in Ireland). I found a website of Irish surnames that included this name, but it appears to be very uncommon. Grandma was born in 1892, and she was 6 years old when she and her parents immigrated to the U.S. My sister told me that the surname they used might have been "altered", due to the prejudice in the U.S. against the Irish at the time, and therefore this name have been a made-up version of a more common Irish surname, like O'Malley, for example.        So, my question is two-fold: how common is Malia as a surname in today's Ireland, and could it be an abbreviation for another, more "irish-looking" name?

I help run a Popular Music Choir and we're looking at putting on a charity concert at some point in the future. Most of the songs we perform are fairly recent (Beach Boys, Disney songs, etc) so I assume Royalties must be paid to someone.      Does purchasing the musical score include the right to perform the music and, if not, where in general would I have to look to find who the royalties must go to?

Majority of Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines came from Cebu.   My mother maiden surname is "Antolihao"   I just want to know if we have a chinese ancetry. I never ask my mother about this. But, I noticed that my late grandfather's eyes were very creased and almond shaped. If ever my mother's surname came from Chinese origin, what does it mean. I only understand basic mandarin 'coz I study it for about 3 years. Anyways can you explain why long chinese-like surnames like " Dysanco, Tantoco and Limkaichong" exist. Thanks. I'm waiting for an acurate response.

20090203093834AA0xc40	Arts & Humanities;History	How do you think the L.A. riots would have been different?	If the angry mobs had attacked homes in Universal City, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and other top tier areas of California with major media recognition instead of just remaining in L.A. do you think the political reaction would have been different? I think it might have spawned either quicker political reaction to the area or it would have just charged them to bring out the National Guard troops and steamroll down the charred areas of California cities. I wonder also if the mobs would have attempted to torch the Great Western Forum in their rage if they had spread from Compton to Inglewood back in 1992. I'm actually working on a novel surrounding the riots called Grape Street about a Korean boy who sees his parents killed in their grocery store during the riots and then must piece himself back together emotionally after he is adopted by a loving African-American family. It'll be real dramatic!

20090203092413AAYi5aT	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does God remove,....?	,..your sense of sexual desire from your brain once you die and enter Heaven? Does he force it out of your mind like an enforced lobotomy of hypnosis, like some form of mind control? Some people keep saying you won't have sex in Heaven and that you won't miss it in Heaven, whether you enjoyed it on Earth or you never even had a chance to even try it on Earth but always wanted to. If this is true, then shouldn't people be encouraged to have as much sex as they can on Earth before it's too late, which is after they die and go to Heaven? If their only shot is to do it here on Earth, then that means they need to have as much sex as they can, including casual and premarital sex, before it's too late. If however, if there is sex in heaven, then there'd be no rush, all the sex you've wanted to have here would be waiting for you in Heaven down to the smallest detail from life on Earth.      Or does God just force that part out of your mind in Heaven, thus removing a portion of your freewill in Heaven? How did Lucifer gain a sense of sexual desire if he himself was in Heaven long ago if sexual desire can't be felt there?

20090203094434AArLqER	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is there such a thing as an inalienable right?	Many people are up in arms over what they perceive to be fundamental rights. Some claim health care and education as rights, others claim affordable housing, food, and clothing as rights. My question is, if these things can be taken away, aren't they privileges instead of rights? Additionally, if there is a responsibility attached to them, doesn't that make them privileges all the more?      Do I have a right to food if I'm not willing to work for it? What about housing? The law of nature tells me if I don't put in the effort, I die, so why do some people see this as a right?      Don't get me wrong, I'm an advocate of universal health care, free education, and a fair amount of social policy, but I don't believe we should ever take them for granted. I advocate them because I believe they’re in the best interest of society, not because I believe it’s a crime if they’re not given. I just wanted to get some input on what people thought about what should be considered rights, what should be considered privileges, and where we draw the line.      I take the position that there are no such things as rights because I believe a right is something that is given without the expectation of responsibility. Since I believe nothing is without responsibility, it makes sense that I would believe that all things are ultimately privileges.

20090219170614AAlaTfM	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	'Honey if you love me, would you please please smile?' game. I've run out of ideas. Help?	So, in drama class on Fridays we play this game, "Honey I love you but I just can't smile."      For those of you who don't know the game:      The group sits in a circle facing inward. One member of the group is 'it.' The objective is for this person to make another smile. He goes around the circle, picks a person, kneels, and asks him/her, 'Honey, if you love me, would you please, please smile?' The person must respond with, 'Honey, I love you, but I just can't smile,' without smiling. If he/she smiles, that person becomes 'it', replacing the first. If the person 'it' does not convince a person to smile, he/she must approach another until he/she does. The person 'it' may do any gestures he/she wants to make the person smile (e.g. make funny faces, do a stunt), but cannot touch the person.         Any good ideas with how to make the person smile?

I'm writing a persuasive essay for English on how extremely wrong Ayn Rand's perception of freedom was - as seen in her novel Anthem.    I do NOT agree with Rand's theory that in order to be free, one must live entirely for themselves and no one else. I believe this because if each and every single person were to shove others aside for their own wants and wishes ... wouldn't that destroy freedom?       Freedom needs some kind of limitation otherwise it cannot be achieved - thanks to Man's "ego".      PLEASE share some opinion on this subject.

Please tell me examples of what I should replace and put instead. I really want to get an A on this. Please!!! Help!!!!   The short story, “The Monkey and the Crocodile,” retold by A.K. Ramanujan shows a very clever monkey whose best friend is a dumb crocodile with a sinister wife. These folktales about animals talking have been shown to us many times. From all the stories that I have read so far, this has to be one of the weirdest takes on folktales. There are animals talking and behaving more like humans than themselves. The whole point of the story just doesn’t make sense to me. I wonder they just didn’t use humans to be in the story.   There lived a monkey who had made a rose-apple tree on the banks of Ganges his home. Why that monkey lives alone is never told in the story. The rose-apples were one of the best tasting and there was plenty to share. Then one day, a crocodile came out of the river, and the monkey threw down some rose-apples and told him that these are the best rose apples in the world and taste like nectar. And weird enough, the Crocodile decides to eat the rose-apples that were thrown at him by a monkey. And he likes them! Since when did crocodiles start eating apples? I though crocodiles are pure carnivores; they couldn’t eat anything other than meat. If that wasn’t odd enough, the crocodile and the monkey become friends.    One day, the crocodile decides to take some of the fruit to his wife at home. His wife loves them! I wonder how the two crocodiles happened to get married. The crocodile tells his wife that he made a new friend, which happens to be a generous monkey who throws the rose-apples down for him. Crocodile’s wife tells her husband that a monkey who lives on these delicious fruits must have a heart that tastes like heaven. These are animals we’re talking about, how do they know about heaven? There is no doubt that his wife is jealous. Trying to get this sick idea out of his wife’s head, the crocodile tells her that the monkey is a like a brother to him. The crocodile tries his best to talk her out, but he couldn’t. Wow, its things like this really make me wonder how hard he actually tried to save his friend’s life. And since when did crocodiles begin to think their brother was a monkey? It even says in “Before you read” that “Crocodiles are carnivores, which means they eat meat (including monkey),” so why does this crocodile care so much?   The crocodile goes to the monkey and invites the monkey to go home with him. The monkey hops down onto the crocodile’s back and starts to go to the crocodile’s house. Now, why would a crocodile let a monkey hop onto it’s back? The crocodile’s natural instincts should tell him to kill the monkey and then take it away to his wife. A crocodile eats monkeys, not invite them for dinner! His conscience would not allow him to let his wife kill his friend without at least telling him what he was doing. So the crocodile tells the monkey that his wife wants to eat his heart. At this point, I don’t see any reason why the crocodile would decide to tell the monkey that he was about to die as soon as he gets home. Without hesitation, the monkey tells the crocodile that he leaves his heart in the tree when he comes down. He tells the crocodile to go and back get it. And the crocodile turns around and swims back to the bank! That is the only evidence needed to prove that the monkey also knows the crocodile is dull. Being a carnivore, every crocodile should already know that the monkey couldn’t have taken his out since they have killed monkey so many times. The monkey then saves is life by jumping off the crocodile’s back and climbing up the tree safely. That’s has to be the most bizarre ending I have ever read.   In this story, the animals have been given too much personification with a confusing mixture of their real characteristics. This makes the story even more confusing and foolish to me.
