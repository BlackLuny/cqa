20090307102250AAbnGsb	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	One of my odd moments?	Today, when I went into a Walbaums supermarket store, I saw a huge shiny red apple. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever saw, since I love apples and am an apple freak. The problem was, there was only one left and I wasn't the only who just stepped in the store and laid eyes on it. I ran as fast as I can towards it, I pushed an old lady and her cane(she was using the hook part of the cane to hold me back), jumped over a dog, and caused a pyramid of Campbell soup cans to fall down. I got the apple, and I was happy. Unfortunately at the end, the old lady got back at me and started swinging her hook thin-gee at me. How odd is that What's your story?

CLASS TIME      The class was very noisy just now because there wasn't any teacher, but now everyone suddenly turned quiet. That is because the fiercest teacher in the school had entered the class. Her face is as fierce as a lion which will bite anyone's head off if offended... And if you wanna know more.... follow the lesson.      Students: Good morning, teacher.      Teacher : (shouting) Why is it only good morning? What about afternoon and night?      Students: Good morning, afternoon and night teacher!      Teacher : That is unacceptable! It is too long. Just wish me best regards for my whole day! That is much better as it is easier and full of meaning. And that greeting can also be used for all times.      Students: Best regards teacher!      Teacher : That's better, sit down! Listen today I,m going to test you all on words that have the opposite meaning. When I say a sentence or word, all of you must answer quickly the opposite meaning to the words, understand?      Students: Understood teacher!      Teacher : I do not want any disturbance!

I can't remember the name of either film, so if you know either of them or have an idea, any help would be appreciated =)

I'm very young but I have grow up listening to 50's 60's 70's and some 80's and what is up to date is creeping the hell out of me!! No self talent like it used to be, like Ritchie Valens, Ella Fitzgerald, The Beatles, Holly Buddy, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Bod Dylan, Guess Who, The Mamas and The Papas, Mama Cass, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Fleetwood Mac, The Carpenters, Pink Floyd, Morcheeba, Moloko, Alanis, even the Spice Girls and Hanson was on a tolerable line lol.      The little group we still have is kept in a trunk because this stupid generation of record groups have turn down the music history and is making the music present a shame and ridiculous trade, they now prefer massive selling from immature, superficial and teenagers instead of the real delight that can also sell big and even better than that, So sad and...Can it be reversable?? I ask.      Where are we going to put the best of music now? What is the real music position nowadays? Is fair to let it vanish just like that and let this be converted in just a convinience, fashion and superficial given job offered to our new generation?

When he says 4 that stuff I wrote is not repaeting the something something he really sings "Repeats step 1 through 3"

Lo que recuerdo es muy poco ya que la vi de chico. Una escena que recuerdo es cuando uno de los actores es llevado por medio de una cinta transportadora que en su extremo tiene una especie de palanca castradora!!!! El resto de la pelicula transcurre en una nave espacial creo, donde van atravezando distintos estados de vejez...me resultaba muy gracioso ver el pelo de uno de ellos, que de tan viejo tenia todo el pelo blanco, al estilo que usaban en los 70 los afroamericanos...Espero no haber mezclado dos peliculas distintas...

Mike sat directly across from Terry's wife. Mike dropped a card on the floor and bent down to pick it up. When he looked across the table he saw that Terry's wife had her legs open and no panties on. He sat up and was flushed.      He went into the kitchen to get a drink of water. To his surprise Terry's wife had followed him into the kitchen and said, " Did you like what you saw?" Mike said "Yes I did." She said, Well you can get more than that but it will cost you $500." So Mike thought about this financial situation and said, "O.K." She said, "Come here tomorrow at 2:30 because Terry will be at work then." Mike said, "I'll see you then."      The next day, Mike came over, they had sex, he paid her, then he left. Later, Terry came home and asked, "Has Mike been over here today" She said, thinking she had been caught, "As a matter of fact, he did." Terry said, "Good because that fool came by my job this morning and asked to borrow $500 till this evening, and he said he would leave it with you."

There was lots of water (I think the world may have been flooded, if not the world, part of it was)   Soil was very valuable (It may have ran their economy)   Plants were also valuable   There was something behind people's ears that made them bad/good   There were lots of boats (obviously)   There was this city that had gates seperating it from the water outside (the city still had water on the inside of the gates)   I remember a guy raised above the water in some cage because they thought he was bad or something.   In the end I remember them finding land and there was this home with a couple, dead, in bead (skeletons)      Hope someone can figure this out.      Thanks,      Aaron

I think of SEVENDUST.   One of the most talented drummers in heavy music, fantastic singer (and the interplay of all 3 singers is great) great guitars grooves, and the like.        Yet little exposure and sucess.  PArt of it of course was a manager that milked em dry, and that they were never as Radio-Friendly as say Creed.

I have already got a cute outfit for the baby (includes a shirt, pants, and onesie), a blanket, wipe warmer, and binkies. I just don't feel like this is enough...I don't want to look bad if I only get her something small while everyone else gets her bigger stuff. So I am trying to think of ideas of something else to get her...but I am coming up blank. Any suggestions? Keep in mind, I am a college student, so I don't have tremendous amounts of money to spend.

"Greetings from Death Row"      pardon me, while I destroy your great machine   its nothing personal, its just business   and I will stand for what I believe in   I will stand against this monstrosity.      i will fight till I die, or rather you kill me   I will smile to you, sitting here on death row   "smile, boys, your father is waving"   is what she said to them right before you took me,   slowly      ask not what your country can do for you   ask what you can do for your country   ask not what your country can do for you    ask what your country is doing to you      stand up for what you believe in   together we are strong   sing with me, for what you believe in   sing with me, for they are wrong   (X2) [kind of a war-chant feel]         tell me what you think.

"Sunday" (2004) -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkJy-GyVt...          Sia is a pop singer from Australia. She's in her mid-30s and has released 4 albums (plus a live album) and a few EPs and singles. She has also made some appearances on TV, and on a few songs with the downtempo band Zero 7.      As you can see from the "Buttons" music video, yes, she has a snaggletooth. When she was fourteen, her mother told her she had a choice - she could go to Italy as an exchange student, or she could get braces (they only had money for one or the other). She chose Italy. Now, she says that she has the money to fix it but she doesn't want to anymore, she's grown fond of it. :)      What do you think? Her songs tend to be catchy for me, although after awhile her voice can get to me. I really like the above songs though best of all. I recommend "The Girl You Lost To Cocaine" and "Day Too Soon" as well. She also did a slow cover of Britney Spear's "Gimme More", which was kind of funny if you've ever seen Alanis Morissette covering The Black Eyed Peas' "My Humps".      MQ: If you're a fan, which album do you prefer - Colour the Small One or Some People Have Real Problems? If you're not a fan, which album cover is better? ;)      CTSO -  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...    SPHRP -  http://991.com/newGallery/Sia-Some-Peopl...

20081108130522AA8zUBs	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What do you think of these blonde jokes?	*A brunette and a blonde are walking along in a park one morning.      Suddenly, the brunette notices a dead bird. "Awww, look at the dead birdie," she says sadly.      The blonde stops, looks up into the sky, and says, "Where? Where?"            *Two blondes were recently observed in a parking lot trying to unlock the door of their Mercedes with a coat hanger. Here is their dialogue:      Blonde One: I can't seem to get this door unlocked!      Blonde Two: Well, you'd better hurry up and try harder! it's starting to rain, and the top is down!               *A blonde made several attempts to sell her old car. She was having a lot of problems finding a buyer because the car had 340,000 miles on it. She discussed her problem with a brunette that she worked with at a bar.      The brunette suggested, "There may be a chance to sell that car easier, but it's not going to be legal."      "That doesn't matter at all," replied the blonde. "All that matters it that I am able to sell this car."      "Alright," replied the brunette. In a quiet voice, she told the blonde: "Here is the address of a friend of mine. He owns a car repair shop around here. Tell him I sent you, and he will turn the counter back on your car to 40,000 miles. Then it shouldn't be a problem to sell your car."      The following weekend, the blonde took a trip to the mechanic on the brunette's advice.      About one month after that, the brunette saw the blonde and asked, "Did you sell your car?"      "No!" replied the blonde. "Why should I? It only has 40,000 miles on it."

20081118221711AAiCs6f	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do they release a special edition?	I have always wondered. Cinema shows take a few years before they are released for broadcast on television.      When they are released for broadcast on TV, do they also release a special edition for TV? Do they release a special edition for suited for families and children?      I remembered seeing a movie with a love making scene. In that scene, the actress actually dropped her clothes to the floor. As this was a non X rated movie, her assets were not seen BUT I could see her bare back and a little bit of her butt. There was also a romantic music being played during the scene which was carried over to the next scene.      However, when I saw it again on TV a few years later, the love making scene showed no bare back. It ended with the intense kissing. The irony is that the same romantic music was also played and it was carried over to the next scene.      The television station showing the movie couldn't have edited the scene. Had the television station edited the scene, the music would also be abruptly cut off. But the music did not abruptly cut off but carried over to the new scene.      Do movie producers release special editions of their films for television?

20090120173742AA8EFdK	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you think of the new Resident Evil series?	I heard a series following Leon S, Kennedy is in the works.  The first film will be based on the Resident Evil 2 game, I found an interview with writer/director:      Q: What ‘s the game like compared to the film?   A:  It’ll be very like the game, yet different in  a way.  The film will go into more detail of what’s going on, and explain the characters a little more, for example, Sherry Birkin, we go into a little detail of how she got separated  from her mother in the opening during the outbreak.  Being a fan of the game myself, I’ve always wanted to see film based on the game, but when the Resident Evil films came out, it wasn’t.  It really disappointed me you know?  I believe the fans of the game will really get into this film. I’ve never felt so confident about writing a film, until now.  The fans are really gonna love it, I promise you that.      Q:  What character can we expect to see in this film?   A:  Leon of course, Claire Redfield, Sherry Birkin, William Birkin, Annette Birkin (Sherry’s mother), Ada Wong, just to name a few.  Creatures we can expect are the Tyrant, Slick (Lickers), Alligator,  William Birkin for sure.        Q:  Out of your writing so far, what scene is your favorite?   A:  I’m currently writing the first draft, not much is done yet, but if I had to pick one so far, it would be the subway scene.  You can guess what may happen there, I don’t want to give away to much.      Q:  How different is the game from the film?   A:  It’s different, but it’s not different.  It’s not gonna be one of those films that’s based on a game or book and be completely different.        TBC

20090307105721AA7qWze	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	AVRIL LAVIGNE & LIL WAYNE WORKING 2GETHER!!!?	Did you know Avril will make an apperance in Lil Wayne's ''Rebirth"" album.... wow Avril and Lil Wayne damn...      And he does a pretty good job of it. One cut — about a dude who’s begging his girl not to “walk out the ************* door” — features Prince-inspired guitar, bombastic drums, and, of course, lots of Auto Tuned singing. It could almost soundtrack an ’80s teen movie, though probably not one directed by John Hughes. Another untitled song — on which Wayne addresses haters in an R. Kelly-style rant (”What the **** you looking at me for? If you ************* hate me, get a life”) — is a reimagined skate-punk anthem. Even Avril Lavigne makes a cameo!

Claude is seen being sent to jail but escapes when a attack on police convoy takes place when he is being sent to jail. Claude also escapes with friend named 8-Ball. Claude swears to get back at Catalina for turning on him.      2. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas      Storyline: A man named CJ is seen robbing someones car. After stealing the car CJ gets a phone call from his brother. His brother tells him that that their mom is dead. CJ decides to back home but first must get rid of the car he stoled. CJ ditches the car and takes a taxi cab to the airport. While CJ is taking the cab to the airport CJ is listing to the radio about a bank robbery taking place ( the one from the first GTA movie ) After CJ arrives home in Los Santos,CJ is taken in by a cop named Tenpenny. Tenpenny tells CJ he works for him and if CJ doesn't listen to him,he will put him in jail. CJ agreeds and is set free. CJ makes promise to himself he will get back at Tenpenny and to find out who killed his mom.      3. Grand Theft Auto: Return to Liberty City      Storyline: A man named of Niko Bellic is seen geting off a boat and meeting his cousin named Roman Bellic.

I don't think the person who wins this season is actually going to have a career just because designers aren't going to want a short girl modeling their clothes.  What do you think about this?

He said things don't happen twice, yet he goes on and helps in the end anyways.      Also, the two older siblings wont be returning to Narnia anymore, so does that mean the third film when only follow the two younger siblings? I find that doubtful.

20090307111143AAXhP6l	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I was watching this movie last night and I don't know what it was called?	It's about a white cop who loses his partner in a shootout and he goes to the funeral and everthing.. then he goes out on duty and this black guy is trying to get his keys out of the ignition from the opened window outside the car and the cop pulls up and asks him for his ID and stuff and the guy says no so he trys to arrest him but the black guy is resisting. Then a bee comes and the black guy gets all scared cause he is allergic to bees. So the cop starts trying to hit the bee with his night stick. There is a family buy the car on the other side and they start filming the incident because it looks like the cop is beating the **** out of the black guy. Then the LA police force fires the cop cause they actually thought that he was beating him. Then they find out that there actually was a bee and rehire him. After that the cop and black dude some how become partners to investigate a crime even though they're just mall cops. In their investigation they find out that their captain of the police force is in on the crime. Then they find these kegs that aren't made out of regular metal but metal with a very high melting point from the CIA.(hahaha not central intel. agency but crups something aerospace). The metal was able to be welded and still be as cold as ice. Hahaha then they're in a shootout with one of the captain (the dirty cop)'s guys and the black guy got shot then they went to the white guys girlfriends house to get it healed and it turned out to be a scratch on his leg and it barely grazed him. In the end they get medals and get to be partners in the LAPD. Haha it sounds kind of bloody and bad but its supposed to be funny. Its kind of like burn after reading but with cops. It was on tv on Tnt yesterday(march 6th 2009) do you know what it is
