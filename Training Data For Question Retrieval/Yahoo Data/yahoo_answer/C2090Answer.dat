Go to "My Profile" where you will find a list of all your questions. Select the question and there will be a "vote as best answer" button. You receive 3 points for picking one. You will have 4 days to pick one or it will go to a vote. You can also force the vote to start immediately on the edit (pencil) menu.<br>  <br>  ? For Someone Else's Questions (and your own after 4 days):<br>  You will have to wait 4 days if the asker did not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button. You receive 2 points for voting. You must vote before the vote closes after 2 more days.  You are allowed to vote for your own answer. You just can't answer your own question.

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up.

sObEb6NNaa	I had the same problem as your having for about a week hon. One day I came on and my avatar pic was showing. Its frustrating. You'll get it back though|`|suPD7c3gaa	This seems like it might be different from a recent problem with avatars as the others appeared as a red "X", not the question mark as yours is.  Make sure your image is a jpeg image, and also that it's not starting out too small.  The size of the little box with the question mark leads me to believe there's a problem with the size of your image.  Consider a file with a vertical/portrait orientation rather than horizontal/landscape orientation.  A 'normal' sized image rather that one that is already avatar sized works best.  And an image that is too large with high resolution won't work either.  That is also a common problem with some images not working as avatars.  Again, I don't know anything about the image you're working with, so I'm guessing at some what some possible problems could be.|`|AA10021017	try resizing your pic, then reloading, i believe there is a restriction on size now, and there actually pushing the issue......hey whats for lunch?|`|QnoysJJaaa	Could be the resolution.

AA11408911	Yahoo!

zDQIPFH2aa	When this happens, there are two main reasons:<br>  <br>  1. (least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.<br>  <br>  2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays. Again, if you follow the direction in #1 above, you can sometimes get around it.|`|rfYvOuN2aa	i don't know why some of our questions end up on the board and most don't (at least mine don't).  it's not a big deal except that you don't get as many answers!|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Y!A is weird and does that sometimes.|`|f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	maybe there was some thing in them that they couldn't print and then they got deleted

The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.
6qsTmMQaaa	You cannot add the photo directly to the question. However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|suPD7c3gaa	No one can post an actual pic with their question.  It has to be a link to a question.<br>  <br>  You need to put your image files on a photo storage site like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://photobucket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shutterfly.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://tinypic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://tinypic.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://imageshack.us/" rel="nofollow">http://imageshack.us/</a><br>  <br>  You will be provided with a link for use in forums, emails, etc. Copy the link (beginning with http://) and paste it with your question or answer. If with a question, be sure to paste the link in the space provided for more information. Also keep in mind that if you're posting photos of yourself (or anyone else) to ask people what they think, that's considered a chat violation and often gets reported.|`|6qPFNkyDaa	You just copy and paste the URL of the picture(s) onto the answer or question.|`|BpKh9fMraa	just copy the link on the page that has the pic<br>  <br>  <br>  ex: the link will be like http:// <br>  <br>  somethting like that

The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	It usually takes more than one report of abuse for something to be removed as a violation, so you alone may have trouble getting 'stuff deleted'. As to your own questions being deleted, this would happen for a number of reasons   not all are violations:  ? No answer in 4 days  ? Answered, voters choose "No Best Answer"  ?  Best Answer reported for violation  ?  Reported as violation    If you get no violation notice, it is due to one of the first 3 reasons, none of which are your 'fault' or are 'crooked' in any way. These reasons are given on the site so that people can be aware of them, in the HELP link at the top right of any YA page.    If you DID get things removed as violations, you should have gotten a violation notice. In the notice is usually a link to APPEAL the violation if you did not agree with it. Appeals are reviewed by staff and are often granted, with the material being reposted and points returned. If a violation email does not contain an appeal link, you can appeal using this link:  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|6YvkP2sGaa	Yahoo is a private site, they have the right to.

kFHwzBG7aa	You pretty much answered your own question.  That is the only explanation for such strange behavior.  So Thumbs-Down Fairy is the next step below troll?  I guess so.  Because while there is at least SOME kind of cheap thrill attached to asking a retarded question or saying something mean to the poor girl who just wants to know how babby is formed, I can't imagine how immature one would have to be to get pleasure out of giving thumbs downs to everyone.  I mean, you don't even get to astonish them with your with your grandiose wit or shatter their fragile little egos by calling them "fatty"!  So why?  <br>  Unless it's the only way to effectively give yourself thumbs up?  But then like you said, sometimes *everyone* has thumbs down.  I just can't see how someone could get a kick out of that.<br>  <br>  So yes, Thumbs-Down Fairy is the new Troll-wannabe.  That will be how one troll insults another now ("You're not even a real troll!  You're just a... a... a THUMBS-DOWN FAIRY!!!")<br>  <br>  But at least, on the bright side, when I get thumbs down for an answer I can just tell myself "It's ok, it's just the TD Fairy!

AA10293429	How do I verify my email address?<br>  In order to use an email address for Yahoo! Groups, the address must be verified. The easiest way to set up your account is to use the Membership Wizard. The wizard will show all of the email addresses you currently have available for use in Yahoo! Groups. Any unverified addresses will be listed at the bottom of the second page. Next to the address will be a Verify link. Click on the link to generate a verification email that will be sent to you at that address. Follow the instructions contained in the email to complete the process.<br>  <br>  If the email address you wish to use is not listed, click on the Add new email address link.<br>  <br>  Having difficulty verifying an address? Here are some scenarios and tips:<br>  <br>  The email never arrives<br>  <br>  If you’re not getting the verification email at all, please make sure you’re using a valid email address. If you have tried to verify your alternate email address several times and you still never receive the mail although your address is valid, we recommend asking your ISP if they are blocking any mail from Yahoo!. If you have your mail forwarded, you may not receive the verification email. Also, please note that while the mail will arrive quickly, it is not instantaneous. In some cases, the email may be delayed several hours due to Internet traffic and the email delivery route. If you and your ISP are not blocking any email and if it has been over 24 hours since you've tried to verify your alternate email address, please let us know.

AA11337952	Spring break varies based on your school's preference. In high schools it's often a lot later in the spring, and in colleges, it's usually earlier. Right now, the University of Michigan is already on spring break this week, but other state colleges in Michigan won't go on break for another few weeks.|`|geuF7GsHaa	Depends on where u are.

1YBo8yhOaa	Select a pic that you want to post (presumably you have some real pics of yourself?), and take it to a photography store, Office Max, Staples, or some other office supply store.  Most will scan your pics for a fee, and will give you a CD with the pics on it. <br>  <br>  BTW, there are web cams and cheap digital cameras for approximately $25 or so...  In the long run it's cheaper to get your own camera.

AA11408911	Your question would have been removed for chatting as it is not seen to be seeking knowledgeable and informative answers that would benefit the community, rather opinionated comments posted for a quick and easy two points. <br>  <br>  Sounds like an honest mistake, most violations are, just something to learn from in the future.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Your question was not seeking knowledge or advice.  It is a nonsense question just to fill space.  Read the community guidelines.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	It was chatting.  YA is not to be used as a chat room.  Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.<br>  <br>  Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".<br>  <br>  Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time. <br>  <br>  People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).|`|AA11252878	Chattiness would be the reason why your question was deleted. It was neither knowledge-worthy nor advice-seeking. Keep in mind this is the most-violated rule of the Community Guidelines.

If you ask a more specific question I'd be able to help more.|`|E047GSKdaa	Many Freecycle groups are in yahoo groups.  Got there and search in your area.  Each group has a different page.  You do need to be a member of the group to access the webpage.  You have to be an approved user.|`|HgTmiwYuaa	If you are past of a yahoo group, the group web address is at the bottom of every email.
