SRG5YDAAaa	As an environmentalist, I can't figure out how I'm going to affix a global warming emergency flotation system (GWEFS) to my house.  How am I going to afford all that, plus the solar panels, and my 6.2% mortgage?<br>  <br>  The $6799.99 deep water fording system for my Prious doesn't fit right and I can't go through more than 3 feet of water.

5TKEtXERaa	In your case you have done some good steps already, I would concentrate on reduction before recycling.<br>  <br>    When shopping look for not only value and quality but look at the packaging companies that use less packaging and have equal or better products should be favored. <br>  <br>    Often times saving water is simple and can save energy because when you take a hot shower it takes energy to heat the water so low flow shower heads and aerators are a no brainer. <br>  <br>     If others notice what you have done or complain of electricity or water bills share your sucesses with them. Thus encouraging them to also conserve. <br>  <br>    Programmable thermostats, clean furnace/air conditioner filters, clean coils on the fridge all help along with either led or cfl lighting. <br>  <br>    For the closest recycle place I would go to www.earth911.com and enter my zipcode. You may consider researching and being a proponent of introducing a recycle bin at your building.<br>  <br>     Below is a site with some more ideas, as always any questions feel or anything more specific feel free to e-mail|`|i5MiFhMyaa	Here are some ideas:<br>  <br>  - replace most of your light bulbs with compact florescent or LEDs.<br>  - cancel your newspaper subscriptions. Newspapers are an enormous source of waste. If possible opt out of junk mail.<br>  - shower instead of bath<br>  - try to get products fixed instead of tossing them.<br>  - use less paper products.<br>  - don't buy products with excessive packaging. Does a small item really need to be packaged in a huge hard plastic shell? Does something really need three layers of wrapping<br>  - low flow toilets.|`|0TaFg8KGaa	Eat less meat.

"Going green" is just the latest fad being cashed in on by big business.|`|AA11932246	Get some green paint.|`|0d3d4bb36620597a6b1cbe916b531361aa	1. Use fluorescent light bulbs. Yes, they're more expensive than incandescent light bulbs ($2 vs. $.50), but switch out your incandescent bulb for compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) in your house, and you could save up to 30 percent on your energy bill.<br>  <br>  "According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR program, CFLs use about 75 percent less energy than incandescents and last 10 times longer," says Malten. "This, on average, results in $30 savings for the life of the bulb."<br>  <br>  2. Keep your car in excellent condition. Of course, it's best to walk, bicycle, carpool or use mass transit for your daily commuting, but for those who must use their own vehicles, improving even the most inefficient of cars' fuel mileage is as easy as keeping your tires properly inflated and changing your oil and air filters regularly. And follow those traffic laws — your car burns less fuel when you drive slowly and obey the speed limit on highways.<br>  <br>  3. Make sure your dishwasher and clothes washer and dryer are full before using them. The aforementioned major appliances consume large amounts of energy, so reduce their use as much as possible by only running them with full loads.<br>  <br>  If you're in the market for new appliances or other electronics, look for the ENERGY STAR label to purchase the most energy efficient models available. "These appliances have been certified by a rigorous third-party review," says Malten. "In addition to saving energy and water consumption, they also will save consumers money."<br>  <br>  4. Wash clothes in cold water and line dry. Using cold water rather than hot in the washer saves electricity and works just as well as hot with most clothes. Line drying not only is more environmentally friendly, but it also will keep clothes from shrinking and fading.<br>  <br>  5. Shut down and unplug idle electronics. Your computer might be asleep, but if there's a light on, it's still using energy. Turn off and unplug your computer, printer, television, radio — any electronic device that you're not using.<br>  <br>  6. Skip the bottled water. Sure, water is good for you, but the process of harvesting the raw materials, processing and manufacturing the petroleum-based plastic water bottles and shipping them to market is extremely energy intensive. So filter your own water and fill up your own reusable bottles for water on-the-go.<br>  <br>  7. Supply your own bags and leftover containers. If you're headed to a restaurant that you know serves king-sized portions, bring a small piece of Tupperware along to take home the leftovers, and keep one fewer Styrofoam container from the landfill pile. Going to the supermarket? Opt out of the paper/plastic debate and bring your own canvas tote bags.<br>  <br>  "Although many supermarkets recycle used plastic bags, the process still requires much energy to be used to transport and process the materials," says Malten. "Not only are reusable bags more sustainable, they are also becoming more of the norm, especially as more municipalities around the country are adopting zero-waste goals and banning the use of plastic bags."<br>  <br>  8. Buy items with less packaging, and with packaging that your community recycles. It's convenient to buy snack crackers already divided into even, individual portions in plastic bags, but that creates much more waste packaging than just buying the full box.<br>  <br>  "The old adage of reduce, reuse, recycle remains apropos," says Malten. "We must remind ourselves that the first step is always to reduce our demand of natural resources."<br>  <br>  9. Support local farmers. Food grown or produced halfway around the world didn't just appear in the supermarket — it was shipped by plane, boat, truck or rail, and no matter which method of transportation it took, greenhouse gases were emitted along the way. Pick the apple grown in your state instead of the banana grown in another country.<br>  <br>  10. Plant a tree in your backyard. It seems simple, but just one tree can offset tons of carbon over its lifetime. If planted appropriately, it also will provide shade on a sunny day, perhaps reducing the use of energy for air-conditioning in buildings and homes.<br>  <br>  "While reducing energy will cut our carbon emissions, it also is important to restore more natural 'sinks' that capture carbon," Malten says. "Planting trees and perennials are an easy place to start."<br>  <br>  11. Try used products first. Need a couch? Check newspaper classifieds or craigslist.com to see if you can find an acceptable used option before going to a showroom to buy a new one, which will have required both energy and materials to make and ship.<br>  <br>  12. Ask about green power. Many utility companies offer renewable energy options, which is power generated by wind or solar energy.<br>  <br>  "For those who are unable to install renewable energy equipment on their homes or businesses, many energy utilities offer programs that allow consumers to support the growth of the renewable energy markets in the United States by paying a small price premium," says Ma|`|EZJg0G1kaa	You can make your self greener , COMPOST!

Of course with the colder weather in Canada, the plumbing may be set up differently.  I am not sure if this link helps, but at the bottom it states the pressure is regulated at 500 kPa throughout the network.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center surveyed dozens of peer-reviewed scientific articles from 1965 to 1979 and found that only seven supported global cooling, while 44 predicted warming.  20 others were neutral in their assessments of climate trends.<br>  <br>  Of those studies which predicted cooling, most were based on scenarios which did not come to pass.  For example, a continuing acceleration of human aerosol emissions (for example SO2), which block sunlight.  Clean Air Acts were passed to regulate these emissions, so the scenarios didn't occur, so the cooling didn't occur.<br>  <br>  I predict that if I win the lottery, I'll be a millionaire.  So if I don't win the lottery and if I'm never a millionaire, does that mean my prediction was wrong?<br>  <br>  The reason for perpetrating this myth is the same for any global warming myth.  Deniers don't care about science, facts, or reality.  All they're interested in is maintaining their denial and trying to spread it to others via dishonesty and misinformation.  They know this myth is totally wrong, but they don't care.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Here's a 1975 article in TIME magazine which clearly indicates that global cooling was of concern to the world's scientific community.

Well, that statement is wrong because scientists DID predict it.

So the thought was that all the hydrocarbons from the cars ( it's always the car's fault.) was blocking sunlight from reaching the ground.  The only difference is no one was trying to tax you to death for going about your daily routines. <br>  <br>  Somewhere along way a device called the catalytic converter came out, and what this does is "convert" a car's exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor.  Yes, this is what the government told us to do, so we did.  Ever notice how the government punishes us when we do what they ask?  <br>  <br>  Car companies installed the converters on later models.  Now Environmentalists are complaining that CO2 is causing the Earth to suddenly warm up.  You hear it mostly when the temperature goes up-- in the summer.   Remember, this is what environmentalists wanted.
