Ela operou... ficou um pouco gordinha, mas n?o corre o risco de ficar com cancer e nem de ficar prenhe. Opere a sua. Custa em torno de 200 reais. Mas há lugares que fazem de gra?a.|`|8f3ff33c16b48d20093a48719c90d10eaa	Sim. Dependendo da idade da cadela o ideal seria a castra??o.<br>  Se ela tiver mais de um ano ela corre riscos ainda de desenvolver tumores, mas isso n?o quer dizer que ela terá.<br>  Ou vc castra ou deixar ao natural, mas sem cruzar de jeito nenhum.<br>  Eu estou com uma cadela aqui em casa que já teve cria e está com tumor mamário. Estamos tratando até que chegue a hora de tirar cirurgicamente e castrar.

Quanto a vermes é só observar as fezes quando se vai pegar pra jogar fora  ou quando eles vomitam. ás vezes n?o aparecem nas fezes porque s?o muito pequenos e por causa disso uma vez por ano é bom mandar pro veterinário e laboratório uma amostra. Aí o medico vai saber exatamente que tipo de remedio eles devem tomar.

AA12005596	C U I D A D O <br>  <br>        Desparasita??o <br>  <br>  O mais comum em gatinhos bebês s?o as pulgas que apanharam da m?e gata. Também podem ter carra?as, piolhos, sarna, tinha, parasitas intestinais, etc. Para todos estes parasitas há um tratamento normalíssimo, e que para gatinhos muito pequenos se faz geralmente levando-o ao veterinário que lhe dará um comprimido ou lhe passará um spray e o mandará para casa.<br>  <br>  Os gatinhos só s?o susceptíveis a parasitas internos (p/ex. lombrigas) a partir da 3a semana de idade, quando se lhes pode dar um remédio qualquer para desparasita??o que se compra nas lojas de animais ou farmácias. <br>  <br>  Para pulgas, o mais saudável é tirá-las uma a uma. N?O Dê BANHO AOS GATINHOS!|`|3c52f8abe59cafbe380f724e17da8cc0aa	N?o fa?a isso, eles s?o muito pequenininhos eles podem morrer e a gata também, n?o coloque porque ela está amamentando.<br>  Converse com o veterinário.|`|55008778566b195e253c9737bf46a18aaa	Se tem dúvidas cate ela.

Existe um spray que pode ser usado a partir do terceiro dia de idade, ele mata as pulgas na hora mas é muito caro, custa uns quarenta réis. Importante agora é dar vermífugo: a veterinária m falou -acredite- que muitos vermes vêm da pulga.

Meu conselho é q vc converse com um veterinário para acertar o melhor tratamento pra sua gata e logo q possível, vermifugar a família toda (m?e e filhotes), pois a contamina??o dos filhotes se dá através da placenta, caso a gata esteja contaminada. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Os vermes s?o parasitas internos que infectam o trato gastro-intestinal, podendo acometer gatos de qualquer idade, ra?a ou sexo. Em gatinhos recém nascidos ou muito jovens a mortalidade é alta. Os animais com acesso à rua têm maior chance de se contaminar. O seu veterinário poderá dar orienta??es a respeito do diagnóstico, tratamento e medidas preventivas, inclusive pré-natal, ou seja, antes do acasalamento."<br>  <br>  Boa sorte!

Claro ela precisa de limites e voce deve sempre impor isso a ela, mas daqui a pouco essa fase passará. O jeito é n?o consertar nada até que passe. Deixe pra arrumar depois que ela passar a dolescencia, e virar uma adulta. Seu comportamento vai aos poucos ficando mais calmo. Uma boa dica é cansá-la ao máximo, com longos passeios ou corridas em lugares em que possa soltá-la da coleira sem perigo. Se voce mora em SP, lá para os lados de Pinheiros, existe um Parque fechado, onde se pode soltar os c?es das coleiras, ali eles correm livremente e acabam super cansados.Aí ela vai ficar dormindo por muito tempo, já é um come?o para destruir menos.

Lógico que somente um animal n?o faria falta mas, n?o apenas um e sim, centenas, milhares de animais s?o retirados por ano de nossas matas. Para se ter uma idéia, um caminh?o rotineiramente utilizado no tráfico de animais transporta cerca de 1.000 espécimes (alguns chegam a transportar 3.000 animais). Basta, ent?o, se perguntar: quantos caminh?es est?o rodando pelo país e quantos destes poderiam estar transportando animais silvestres em meio a sua carga? <br>  <br>  A popula??o humana cresceu muito, em 2003 já somos mais de 6 bilh?es de habitantes e, no Brasil, mais de 160 milh?es que exercem uma imensa press?o sobre os habitats naturais e, também, diretamente sobre a fauna. Calcula-se que o tráfico de animais silvestres retire, anualmente, cerca de 12 milh?es de animais de nossas matas; outras estatísticas estimam que o número real esteja em torno de 38 milh?es. Todas estas estimativas, embora pare?am alarmismo e exagero, tomam outra dimens?o quando consideramos o seguinte: <br>  <br>  1. Quantas pessoas você conhece que possui ou já possuiu um animal silvestre (o papagaio da vovó, o pássaro preto do vizinho, o canário do amigo, o coleirinho na gaiola da venda etc);<br>  <br>  2. As estimativas se baseiam, basicamente, no que é apreendido o que, infelizmente é ínfimo frente ao traficado;<br>  <br>  3. Devido as condi??es em que s?o capturados e transportados, a taxa de mortalidade é altíssima;<br>  <br>  4. Finalmente quanto maior for a popula??o, caso n?o mudemos nossos conceitos maior será a press?o sobre os animais.<br>  <br>  Ressalta-se que n?o somente o indivíduo capturado fará falta ao ambiente mas, também, os descendentes que ele deixará de ter. Assim, pode-se perceber o tamanho do impacto que a retirada de animais causa ao meio ambiente. Outro detalhe, muitas vezes esquecido, é que o impacto n?o se restringe à extin??o da espécie capturada. Na natureza as espécies est?o interligadas no que chamamos de teia alimentar, ou seja, os animais comem e s?o comidos por outros animais além de, também, se alimentarem de plantas, realizarem a poliniza??o das mesmas e, muitas vezes, dispersarem suas sementes. <br>  <br>  Se eu retiro do ambiente uma espécie que dispersa a semente de determinada árvore pode ser que esta árvore n?o mais conseguirá se reproduzir e, se suas folhas servem de alimento para determinado tipo de inseto, dentro de alguns anos este também poderá se extinguir. Este inseto podia ser o principal alimento de determinado pássaro que agora também será afetado pela retirada daquela primeira espécie que n?o possuía uma rela??o direta com ele. Estas s?o as implica??es do tráfico na teia ecológica e muitas vezes pode afetar espécies que, a princípio se imaginaria n?o ter nenhuma rela??o com a espécie traficada. <br>  <br>  Considere este "pitoresco" e trágico exemplo de como as espécies podem ser afetadas pelas formas mais improváveis: A Organiza??o Mundial de Saúde (OMS) instituiu um programa de pulveriza??o com DDT (um potente e hoje proibido inseticida) a fim de se eliminar mosquitos na ilha de Bornéu. Entretanto, a pulveriza??o também destruiu as vespas que se alimentavam de lagartas que comiam a arma??o dos tetos das casas. Como as lagartas n?o foram eliminadas, agora sem predadores, os tetos das choupanas come?aram a desabar resultado de um programa aparentemente benéfico de elimina??o de mosquitos. Neste ínterim se iniciou um segundo programa de elimina??o das moscas caseiras. Até ent?o, as moscas eram controladas por lagartixas que habitavam as residências. Com o envenenamento das moscas pelo DDT as lagartixas que as comiam também eram envenenadas. Intoxicadas, as lagartixas caíam dos tetos e eram comidas pelos gatos domésticos que, também, come?aram a morrer. Como conseqüência direta da morte dos gatos ocorreu uma superpopula??o de ratos que, até ent?o, eram controlados pelos mesmos. Os ratos passaram a invadir as casas, consumir alimentos e a transmitir doen?as aos humanos. Finalmente, buscando restaurar o equilíbrio, instituiu-se um programa de atirar gatos (de pára-quedas) nos remotos vilarejos de Bornéu. Observe como as conseqüências de determinada a??o pode se estender além da espécie alvo. <br>  <br>  Para o animal<br>  Seu cachorro n?o pode ser solto. N?o existe mais lugar para o Canis familiaris (espécie do c?o) no mundo natural. Mas os animais do tráfico ainda possuem popula??es que vivem em liberdade e, ainda possuem ambientes nos quais podem viver. Para que sujeitá-los a uma vida em cativeiro?<br>  <br>  Qualquer pessoa que possua um c?o sabe da alegria que o mesmo expressa ao saber que vai sair para passear. Um animal com milhares de anos de domestica??o ainda se sente mais contente livre que dentro de um apartamento ou em uma casa. E um pássaro? Que embora possa voar, será condenado a passar toda sua vida em uma gaiola? Papagaios acorrentados e araras com as asas cortadas, será esta a melhor vida para eles?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Entretanto, o cativeiro n?o é a única tortura a que s?o submetidos os animais do tráfico, é simplesmente a última e perpétua pena. Durante a captura os mesmos s?o feridos, mutilados, além e transportados sem espa?o, água ou comida o que culmina na morte de muitos durante o caminho.<br>  <br>  A sua simples captura também pode resultar em muito sofrimento. O al?ap?o armado, a captura, o animal de debate, se joga contra as grades da gaiola, em v?o. Ele n?o mais escapará, n?o mais será livre. Doravante, a pris?o... a gaiola será sua moradia. O v?o será trocado por monótonos pulos de um poleiro a outro, dia a dia - toda a vida. Entretanto, n?o somente o animal capturado sofrerá; seu filhote continuará no ninho, piando... chamando... esperando, pelo pai, pela m?e, pelo alimento que n?o mais virá.|`|0fc7ba5ba1b4ecb911b818a60cace3c0aa	Deveria ser considerado um Crime grave, pois niguem tem o direito de tirar a liberdade de nada nem ninguem.|`|40965e7f0e461fedcb3938b4102eaf2caa	N?o.

En la perra pre?ada no habrá comportamientos diferentes a los usuales durante los primeros 30 días aproximadamente. <br>  <br>  A partir de la quinta semana, las glándulas mamarias aumentan de tama?o y los pezones se vuelven más rojizos. A la sétima semana el aumento del abdomen ya es visible, sobre todo en la cintura y se nota más tenso. <br>  <br>  A medida que los días avancen es normal que deje de comer, que vomite, que continuamente se lama la vulva y que o bien se aísle del grupo familiar o por el contrario busque el apoyo y la compa?ía de la gente de la casa como pocas veces antes lo habría hecho... Podemos notarla más mimosa con nosotros, y al mismo tiempo más irritable y territorial con los extra?os y también con otros perros. Pero para saberlo con seguridad existen diferentes métodos para diagnosticar la gestación en la perra:<br>  <br>  ·                 Palpación abdominal. <br>  <br>  Puede ser realizada por el Veterinario a los 30 días de gestación. Tiene como ventaja que es fácil y rápida y se puede hacer en la clínica o en casa.

O baú-ber?o de Dioniso era puxado por um asno. <br>  www.salves.com.br<br>  <br>  FáBULA:<br>  Asno e a Raposa tendo feito um acordo de prote??o mútua, entraram na floresta em busca de alimento. <br>  N?o foram muito longe e encontraram um Le?o. <br>  A Raposa, vendo o perigo iminente, aproximou-se do Le?o e prop?s um acordo onde iria ajudá-lo a capturar o Asno, se este desse sua palavra de honra que ele próprio n?o seria molestado. <br>  Diante do compromisso assumido do Le?o, a Raposa atraiu o Asno a uma profunda gruta e o convenceu a entrar lá dentro. <br>  O Le?o vendo que o Asno já estava assegurado, imediatamente agarrou a Raposa e quando achou mais conveniente, também atacou o Asno. <br>  <br>  <br>  Autor: Esopo<br>  Moral da História: <br>  Uma pessoa sem escrúpulos persegue apenas seus interesses. Pouco importa os meios que use para consegui-lo. Assim, ele passará por cima de todos n?o respeitando sequer seus aliados. Por isso mesmo, nunca confie em seus inimigos.  <br>  <br>  <br>  BURRO<br>  Burro, jumento, asno ou jegue s?o nomes vulgares de Equus asinus, um mamífero perissodátilo de tamanho médio, focinho e orelhas compridas, utilizado desde tempos pré-históricos como animal de carga.<br>  A sua origem está ligada a Abissínia, onde era conhecido como onagro ou burro selvagem.<br>  Desde há séculos que é feito o cruzamento entre burro e cavalo, de que resulta um híbrido denominado muar ou mu, com caraterísticas de ambas as ra?as: robustez, capacidade de adapta??o a caminhos acidentados e a meio ambiente adverso, docilidade; pernas mais longas e, portanto, maior velocidade, maior facilidade de treino.<br>  O macho (ou mulo) é o indivíduo do sexo masculino resultante do cruzamento de um burro com uma égua, Equus caballus. O animal fêmea resultante do mesmo cruzamento é chamado mula. Entretanto, o cruzamento das mesmas espécies porém invertidos os sexos (portanto cavalo e jumenta), dá origem a um animal diferente, o bardoto. Estes híbridos s?o quase sempre estéreis devido ao fato do cavalo possuir 64 cromossomos, enquanto que o jumento possui 62, resultando em 63 cromossomos.<br>  O burro é, desde tempos remotos, simultaneamente utilizado no meio rural para auxiliar nas tarefas agrícolas e para transporte.<br>  <br>  ORIGEM<br>  Seu nome veio do latim burrus, que quer dizer vermelho. Acredita-se que foi daí que surgiu a cren?a de que burros s?o pouco inteligentes, pois, antigamente, os dicionário tinham capas vermelhas, dando a idéia de que os burros eram sedentos de saber. Outra história diz que numa moeda antiga tinha a imagem de um rei com uma cabe?a enorme que n?o era esperto, que se associou com a cabe?a resistente do burro. Porém, também pode ter surgido da lenda grega do rei Midas, que foi tolo à ponto de contradizer a irrevogável palavra do deus Apolo, que foi castigado pelo deus, recebendo orelhas de burro.<br>  pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burro<br>  <br>  CURIOSIDADE<br>  Ofensa<br>  No Brasil, tal como em Portugal, chamar burro a alguém é uma ofensa.

Do cruzamento das duas ra?as saem o jumento, o burro, a mula, o jerico, que é tudo a mesma porcaria e forma de xingamento, junto com besta, quadrúpede, etc... O que acontece, às vezes, é falar que a mula é a mulher do burro, mas exite mulo também e burra. O macho é estéril, mas a fêmea pode procriar com um cavalo, o que dá origem a um bardoto.

KegxJHn5aa	1. Are they playful?    Gerbils are playful, and then they aren't. If you get the chance, and if you really follow through with this, then buying the gerbil(s) a large plastic tunnel network with a built in living area would be a necessity. Always include running wheels. They love that stuff for some reason.      2. Do they poop and/or stink alot?    Yes, unfortunately, nearly every animal has to deficate. If you follow these simple instructions though, you'll be giving yourself a hell of a break. It turns out that those wood shavings that they sell in pet stores for flooring is actually quite helpful in this situation. Just dump it into the cage, and cover the floor with about an inch of the wood shavings, and it'll be a ton easier to manage. Clean it out maybe every week or two, wash out the bottom, you know. Simple stuff here.      3. Do i need to buy two or do they like to be alone?    My gerbils enjoyed playing with each other, however they felt like going about it. You should probably get at least two, so one gerbil doesn't die a sad, lonely life in complete confinement.      4. Are you supposed to give them baths?    Yes. Gerbils must be bathed with water and a bit of gerbil soap (if you can find it in a pet store). Using a standard sink is fine, as long as the drain has a cover so they don't slide down it.      5. Do they need bottled water or can they drink tap?    Tap is fine, but bottled is also a good choice. The gerbils in the wild would normally just drink from puddles and stuff, so tap is really all they seriously need.      6. Do they bite or scratch alot?    Each gerbil has it's own personality, despite what you may think. My gerbil enjoyed biting me, but his companion was so sweet and friendly, and climbed all over me playfully. It's really a toss-up here. Just take a gerbil you think will suit you well, and hope for the best.      7. Do they like to crawl through tubes?    **** yes. They love tubes so much. It's not even funny. Like I said in answer one, buy the tunnel system with a separate living area and everything built in. It will make life for them a lot more fun. Now, it doesn't have to be gigantic... just large enough so they don't get bored. Maybe a foot in height, one and a half feet in length, and a half foot in width. That'd do fine.      8. Should i get a male or female?    Probably female, if you can. They're a little more calm then their male counter-parts.      9. Are there any treats gerbils enjoy, like apples, peanut butter etc.    I've never really tried to feed it anything like apples or peanut butter, mostly because I was very cautious about what I fed them. They do fine with standard gerbil kibble, but meh. Ask a specialist.      10. Would you recommend a mouse or a hamster instead, and why?    Hamsters are cool, almost like gerbils. Just a bit fluffier. It depends if you like fluffy or not. Gerbils are faster than hamsters though, so if he gets out, you'd better get him fast or else you're not seeing him again.      Good luck finding your gerbil/hamster/mouse.|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	gerbils need lots of socialization and human attention or they can bite and basically not be fun at all. They do not "play" with people, but if you are gentle you can hold them and pet them. Their cages need cleaning a few times a week or they stink. (they poop all around their cages.) They don't need baths and they can drink tap water. I don't think you can easily tell if a baby gerbil is a boy or girl, so get whatever, but don't get two unless you want lots of babies. (also, they eat their babies, so ick.)    mice are fine too, but hamsters are nocturnal, so sleep all day (boring) and noisy all nite.    good luck!|`|MNLbVQ2kaa	1.  yes they are very playful pets  2.  no, they don't stink  3.  gerbils need to have a gerbil companion.  Do not put stranger gerbils together without careful and gradual introduction; they will fight violently.  Two gerbils separated for more that 24 hours are strangers and must be re-introduced  4.  I think Gerbils can bathe themselves  5.  bottled water would be best  6.  They can bite yes, but they usually don't  7.  yes, they enjoy crawling in tubes  8.  there is no real difference, male smells worse though  9.  cheerios, dried bananas and sunflower seeds in the shell.  10.  I'd go for the gerbil, more playful.|`|QzvEu6Kpaa	google it girl, that's alot of quetions u can easily find the answers to if u jus type it in google|`|mL0BjDQWaa	1. Are they playful? Yes   2. Do they poop and/or stink a lot? if you clean them out its fine  3. Do i need to buy two or do they like to be alone?some will live in pairs or so but some will kill each other so be careful with that  4. Are you supposed to give them baths? no they dont need them but you can give them a shallow one occasionally  5. Do they need bottled water or can they drink tap? tap water or bottle  6. Do they bite or scratch alot?Yeah they bite until they are trained and if there claws are kept down then they dont scratch  7. Do they like to crawl through tubes? Yeah  8. Should i get a male or female? dousnt matter  9. Are there any treats gerbils enjoy, like apples, peanut butter etc. Yeah  10. Would you recommend a mouse or a hamster instead, and why?  well i would hamster if you wanted a calm animal. Mouse are mad but they are kind of hard to train.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	1.

0R0uRNuIaa	No it's not showing that you are weaker than them. When dogs play they use their mouths to play by biting. When one is bitten too hard he/she stops playing and refuses to play for a bit. Your basically showing her you do not want to play, If you consistant her biting should get softer and softer until she doesn't bite anymore.    When she jumps on you, Stick you nose up into the air and ignore her until she get down. Tell her to sit and when she does sit, pet her so she knows she was good.    Yelling only encourages a dog to continue to to what it's doing.|`|F93FZyo1aa	on the jumping part, keep turning your back to them. i was told by a trainer that this will teach them to quit jumping. i have a golden retriever (8 months) and it does work. just keep putting your back to them, also who ever comes over have them do the same.    cant help with the nipping part. we have tried the yell thing too, it does work. i think they just need to outgrow it. always make sure you give them bones/toys to chew on too.|`|Lq4LXs7kaa	are you a packleader??yes the loud screams will show that you are weaker.you have to adress unwanted behavior right away!!make up a sound that you want to use to adress unwanted behavior like shhht loudly every time they do something wrong.its all about energy.make sure you are calm and assertive at all times because if you walk into the front door and you are nervous about ur dog jumping on u or whatever then that energy will rub off of u onto ur dog and ur dog will be nervous and excited if ur excited causing it to jump and nip u.always ignore high energy.if u walk into the front door and ur dog is excited nd jumping all over the place then produce no eye contact and no attention,just ignore him.when he finally settle down then u can give it attention.always do this procedure because u are adressing and telling ur dog that jumping and excitedness is unwanted and wont get attention for that so itll learn not to do that if it wants attention.that is also practicing being a pack leader.when it goes to nip u then say shhht really loudly bringing ur hand close to its neck driving it away from u not to do that.make sure not to be frustrated or anything,u have to be calm and assertive when training or disciplining any dog.never let ur dog out the door before u,because it will show that ur weeker.u always have to go out the door first because ur the pack leader.u have to control ur dog not ur dog controlling u.on walks,keep it on a short lesh right by ur side and whenever it looks the other way tries to go in front of u or isnt focused or pulls the u pull it to ur side every time making that correction.thats called a pack leader.dont let ur dog jump onto ur lap until u call it to do that or anything.by being a pack leader ur dog will be respectful and very obedient to u and others,but u have to have a commitment to it forever that u control and correct the dog in all situations every day!!hope i helpped :)|`|U1chPjvPaa	I don't think your loud yelps will make the dog think he is above you, when he was a pup with mother she would yelp so that he would learn he was nipping too hard.   Try to make a high squeal so he will immediately stop and look at you!  He needs to know this is unacceptable behavior from him.    Any action my dog does ,(she's a 6 month old shepard) that is annoying and doing over and over, I turn my back on her and ignore her until she settles down.  When she has stopped for at least 3 seconds, I will tell her she is a good girl.   She is starting to be calmer.  Although thats always been the goal, I kinda miss the puppy madness !
k2l20XdFaa	First, I would like to say CONGRATULATIONS on your new family member. You will be happy with her and it is a ton of fun watching them grow. Second, I would wait to hold it. I know it will be hard to wait, but it would be a good idea to do so. Let her get settled in to her new home first, then get her out for short periods while she is young and increase the amount of time you hold her as she ages. This will create a well balanced snake that will love your company. Good luck, and again, congratulations.|`|44kEtDvIaa	As you can see, the answers are split.  I don't see a problem in handling, but use some discretion and don't do it for long periods of time right now.  Give it some adjustment time, but it needs your scent and feel to get comfortable with its new owner.  See site below for more info and sites related to care of snakes.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	yeah the more handling the better it will tame it down.

This isnt because shes going to strike at you or anything like that. Its to let the snake adapt and take in its surroundings. The majority of snakes (and reptiles for that matter) are shy, timid creatures that easily stress, which in turn can cause health problems. (Can potentially weaken the immune system or cause regurgatation).    I would give a minumum of 5 days with minimal or no handling. Only opening her cage to change the water in her dish.     Just make the transition as easy as you can for her and hold off for a bit.|`|sWvhJmmvaa	It is ok to hold your baby snake. The more you hold it the tamer it will be. I take my 6 month old RTB out of its cage just about ever day..
BL2NfTafaa	When your puppy was born, he had no teeth. By the time he was 3 weeks old, his baby teeth were already starting to come in. When hed reached 4 months old, he started to loose his baby teeth to be replaced by his permanent ones, which will be the only teeth he has for the rest of his life.    I am not sure the age of your puppy, but the above info should be helpful!
SngOU70Baa	yeah but you have to understand they age at a much faster rate than humans do.    so by the time a dog turns 1, they are at the maturity level of 7. Get it?|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Because dogs and cats age faster than people do. Duh.      So a four year old dog is in the same shape as a middle aged man. In other words, a 4 your old dog is the same physically as a 30 year old human.|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	it helps people understand how to treat a pet and what to expect in terms that are more understandable.    elderly pets have special dietary, exercise, dental and medical needs, and if people think of their pet as "70 years old" instead of "ten years old" they are more likely to set their expectations accordingly.|`|vGCetYmAaa	it's the Chinese zodiac|`|4cWtH7X2aa	Most animals don't live as long as humans. Their bodies age much faster (they say one dog year is the equivalent of 7 human years. That's what is meant by "dog" years.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Stupid people need a way to compare their pet's age to their own.  They can't simply accept that a dog will normally live to around 12 years so they invented "dog years".  The truth is that a year is the time it takes for a planet to orbit its sun.  That's true for every thing,  living or dead,  on that planet.  So unless you and your dog live on different planets a year is exactly the same for both of you.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	Dog years and cat years make the years of life of the animals similar to a human's lifespan. Because dogs only live to be about 15 or 16 usually, a dog year is 7 years, so 7x15 is 105, which is old for a human, so that means the dog is old.|`|ZadOtSlOaa	It's to make the life span of cats and dogs more easily comparable to that of humans.|`|fH6JbBhSaa	It is the way they age according to humans. Obviously a cat or dog is not going to live to 80, so they take the avarage dog or cat lifes span and the avarage humans and divide it to come up with animal years.|`|hVICeFukaa	The purpose of this is to show the age progression of the dog. Most dogs age anywhere between 7 and 10 years each human year. Hope i could help!|`|zXRYDuH4aa	well in people years my dog is ten, and in ppl years ten isnt old so dog years are ppl year times 7 so my dog is 70 in ppl years, which is old, they are pretty much to show you how old they are for animals by making them our age|`|x7zjq0S5aa	both cats and dogs have faster heart rates then humans so bascially it's to say their hearts beat in one year what ours beat in 7. therefore showing that the life expectancy is shorter in our years then in "dog" years|`|TnusF2KUaa	Because dog and cat lifespans do not match our own. The scale is supposed to be 1 year for them equals 7 years for us. It makes it easier for us to understand and relate their age to our own.   Ex: A 12 year old dog may die, and some people think that it doesn't make sense because they were young. Well, do the math:  12x7=84  So in dog years, that would be like an 84 year old person dying, which isn't young at all.    Hope This Clears Things Up A Bit!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It's so people understand how comparatively old their pets are. Like if someone wails "My cat is only 19 years old, she can't be dying already!" You can comfort them by pointing out this is the equivalent of 95 for a human!    Chalice|`|u3opo9oFaa	Well..... dog and cats have shorter life spans. And most dogs die in"human" teen years.     Let's say a dog is 12 in human years, (most) dogs will live only a couple of years after that. So when you multiply it by 7 than it comes out as 84. And not many people live to 84 or any higher(speaking hypothetically) Which means the dog is actually 84.    It's confusing. I like to think dogs are as old as we are though.    Here is something I found from a website:      Lifespan    The old rule-of-thumb that one dog year equals seven years of a human life is not accurate. The ratio is higher with youth and decreases a bit as the dog ages. Depending on breed, a dog experiences the raging hormones of adolescence anywhere from eight months to two years or more. Generally, a dog of six has aged about as much as a 45-year-old human. At 10, she's like a human of 65; at 12, a human of 75; and at 15, a human of 90.     Dog Years      A dog's lifespan is only a fraction of the average human's lifespan, which means that a dog ages more quickly in the same amount of time. This chart shows how a dog's age might be adjusted to compare to a human's age.       Canine Age         Human Age      2 Months      14 Months     6 Months   5 Years     8 Months   9 Years     1 Year   15 Years     2 Years   24 Years     3 Years   28 Years     4 Years   32 Years     5 Years   37 Years     6 Years   42 Years     7 Years   47 Years     8 Years   52 Years     9 Years   57 Years     10 Years   62 Years     11 Years   67 Years     12 Years   72 Years     13 Years   77 Years     14 Years   82 Years   ___________________    Sorry if it's confusing.

7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	hi, i have many chihuahuas so hopefully i can help, but you do need to go into more detail first.  What wont he do, If we go back a step or too when he was growing up, what did you do when he was naughty?, he needs correction and to understand who is in control, at the moment i think he feels you are one of him and he is in control of you. You need to become top dog, when he is wrong, for example barking when he shouldnt you need to use something for a distraction , a tin filled with coins/stone and bottol of water so when he does something say no in a strong voice and shake the tin or spray at him at the same time as you said no. Next time he does the same thing you need to repeat the operation. He will learn that no does mean no. Many chis dont like loud noises so the coins usually work. You must look at yourself to see why he is bad, because if he barks at people when you are out - do you pick him up and cuddle him and say there there its ok they wont hurt you, like many people do, if so this is why he is naughty, because he classes as doing something like barking in public is ok bevause i bark and mum picks me up for a hug, dogs are not silly they learn far quicker than us humans.  I hope this helps, chihuahuas are very bold dogs, very loving and kind, sweet natured dogs, many people confuse them with a baby and dress them up, carry them ever where which is not what they need. Walking is great for them, cuddleing and carry is just asking for problems.If you want to go into more detail which will help a lot of you are more than welcome to contact me via 360 and i can send a personnal email to you, but you need to change your setting to except email.

While you may think its OK to not train your Chihuahua, because you can simply pick him up if he gets out of hand, this is untrue. Your Chihuahua needs the right guidance to grow up into a well liked and even tempered dog. The bottom line is: your dog needs to be socialized and trained. That being the case, you may not feel comfortable brining your Chihuahua to an obedience class, unless of course you intend to make a show dog out of him. It isnt necessary for you to enroll your Chihuahua into an obedience class, but if you choose not to, you will need to perform Chihuahua training yourself. Heres what you need to know in order to train your Chi:     Begin training your dog the very first day you get him. The first training lesson is teaching your Chihuahua to do his business outside. As soon as your Chihuahua is successfully housebroken, you can then begin teaching him other commands.       When teaching your Chihuahua commands you need to do so in an effective manner by:   Teaching him in an area in your home where there are no distractions   Providing him with treats and plenty of praise when he follows your commands to keep him happy and let him know hes pleasing you.   Keeping Chihuahua training sessions short so as not to bore your dog and lose his attention.       When you train you need persistence. This means not letting your guard down for a moment as you train your dog. Your small Chi will try every trick in the book to ignore you, not follow your command or encourage you to play instead of teach. You must show your dog who is boss.   Use one-word commands. Dont confuse your dog when teaching him a command by giving him a phrase or short sentence. For instance, instead of saying Come here, say in a firm, gentle tone Come followed by your dogs name.   Have authority in your voice when giving commands - Your dog needs to know you mean business when giving a command. Therefore, you should give all commands in a firm voice, in a tone that is slightly louder than normal.   Do not aggressively discipline your dog while you are teaching him. If your dog does not follow your instructions, tell him No gently, and do not give him a treat. Then start from the beginning, and take it slower until he understands.   Furthermore, keep in mind that if for instance  you told your dog to Come and he ends up knocking over your plant on the way, do not yell at him or scold him for this action. Praise him for coming to you, because he followed the command. You want your dog to associate the action he has committed as a good thing. He wont understand why you are upset with him for doing what you asked.     After housebreaking, the second command you should begin with is Sit, followed by Stay, Come and Down. Once your dog has successfully mastered all of these basic commands, its then up to you whether or not you would like to teach him more.   Chihuahua training is not for the lazy. All commands you teach your dog must be constantly reinforced until he understands them as easily as he understand when he is hungry. As sweet as your Chi is, you must show him whose boss or hell walk all over you.

The second one, I've never heard of it, and now that I've---I would never want to send my dog (11 year old Chow/Shih-tzu mix that weighs 25 pounds) over there. She would never survive----especially if one of the packs decide to gang up and her and eat her like that website said that some do that. So based on that thought, I would hate to know that my dog died by fighting for her life.|`|zywhvyPqaa	So Sad, They Should Be Shot And Cooked For The Dogs|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	how horrific and sad :o(|`|ofUe4hBkaa	the 1st 1 is so obviously a joke.  this is just sick and wrong|`|P3vZh1ajaa	both make me feel quite sick, cant tell if their real or a complete p1ss take, horible|`|JmD0oq2Naa	anyway who on earth would be stupid enough to do that.|`|o635RSCCaa	Awful.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	Uhh... what kind of gecko?  You're going to have to be more specific than "dwarf or regular."  There aren't such thing as either.  Many gecko species are regularly available at pet stores, others available online through breeder websites, but you'll need to know what species you want first.|`|4I9QWEXHaa	go to pet stores they should have it  and get a leopard gecko very easy to maintain and can handle them very nice    email me if u cant find one in a local petstore then i will tell u some great online places|`|2b96450180ff61ff28b44093fef66e45aa	Reptile stores. Often you can order online, and they even ship by courier. Make sure you know everything about the care of your gecko before you get one. I don't recommend dwarf geckos for a beginner. Anyway young geckos are relatively small.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	My two youngest ferrets tend to be mouth-breathers, and sometimes they sound raspy.  I've noticed that they are sensitive to air conditioners and heaters, so I always have to leave a window *cracked*, so the air doesn't become as dry.  Generally, though, it's nothing to worry about--they just have a stuffy nose :)|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	If it looks like he's struggling to breath, or his breathing is labored, then it's time for a vet appointment. It can be very bad, pneumonia among other things. Get him in as soon as you can, I waited when my ferret was breathing wrong and regret it horribly.    If he's just breathing loud but breathing fine and not struggling, then I wouldn't worry about it. ;)|`|rVnTnuU1aa	I wouldnt worry to much. All three of my ferrets make noises like that at times.

asfWE78daa	I used to be acquainted with an exotic bird breeder.  Sleeping or roosting at the bottom of the cage is normal for young parrots.  Typically, at four to six months they should begin exclusively using the perch.  Anytime after that then it may be a sign of sickness.  There are lots of great yahoo groups for parrot owners that have all sorts of helpful tips from experienced owners.  See link below for the group on African Grey's and congratulations on adopting your new feathered friend.|`|6KxBqnstaa	I say when it comes to birds especially babies it is better to be safe than sorry. I would call avian vet and get apt. Also good to get them used to going to vet at this age. Should be checked once year. There are many things that cannot be used around birds and that birds cannot eat. I would get a good book on these birds as well as they are wonderful but complicated little critters. Good luck and I hope your Grey is fine.|`|vMByDy1raa	African Grey's are very clumsy and when they are babies they do tend to stay on the bottom of the cage. Sometimes they have a hard time climbing up because there head is so heavy.  My grey is 3 months also, but if I had any doubt he was sick I take him immediately to the vet.  He already got a piece of my heart.  MIne is just starting to be able to climb around the cage.  He still squeals some when he had trouble getting around or if a toy starts to move.  Maybe he was too tired to climb up on his perch.  I would call a vet and make sure.  If you are like me the grey already has my heart.|`|jBYxEX8taa	We've got an African Grey and I know that you can't feed them avocado or they'll die. But if he keeps sleeping like that maybe take him to the vet.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I have seen young Africans sitting on the bottom of the cage at pet stores.

UmEMYsyaaa	If you can have someone hold her while you put the harness on, that would be great.  However, since you will most likely do this by yourself, play with her first, get her a little tired out, and then put the harness  one.  She'll squirm and fuss, but you'll just have to hold her tightly.  Another way is to put a drop or two of Linatone or Ferretvite on her tummy for her to lick.  This way, she'll be distracted and it will be easier to put the harness on her.  Make sure the harness is not too tight, or even too loose.  Those little fuzzies know how to slip out of one!  Have fun!|`|y4fhl3Yqaa	Quickly and CAREFULLY!!!|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	y dont u wear gloves and feed her to keep her occupied while u slowly slip on the harness.  If u move too fast its just like any other animal, they think ur out to hurt it so its only natural to go into defesive mode which seems like what ur ferret is doin since its bittin.
qdtU1Q1Laa	The first one has a better jumping style and more experience with jumping. With her you wouldn't have to worry about being fairly placed as she is solid colored unlike the other horse.     You could always go look at them both to see which you like more after riding them.    Hope this helps.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	Yeah the mare would suit hunter jumper better only because you can see her style over a fence. that's not to say that the gelding can't jump these just no evidence to the contrary. go ride them both as the gelding is alot quiter than the mare. good luck|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	The paint is more flashy, he will catch a judges eye quicker than the chestnut.|`|Sv99BNlEaa	the second one is gorgeous! but i think for the style of riding youre looking for the mare seems more of a hunter/jumper horse  =]|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I think you should go with the paint.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	At 10 weeks he is still a baby and he is in a strange place with people he doesn't know, neither does he know the rules.<br>  <br>  Letting him outside on his own won't teach him anything.  You need to take him outside and stay with him until he obliges.  Then you can praise him and make a big fuss of him so he knows he's done what you want him to do.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Its likely that he's going to try to mark his territory in your house a few times, which is different than peeing. However if he pooped then you need to start training him again. (it is likely that the owner just said he was fully potty trained so you would most likely take him.)<br>  <br>  Putting it outside was a bright idea, now just every time he tries to "go" inside, immidiatly make a loud noise to stop him for a few seconds. then put him outside IMMIDIATLY. Then say "go potty" and point at the grass.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Congratulations, you have a puppy.  Get used to it, at 10 weeks old he is not old enough to be reliably house trained.  You can expect the occasional "accident" for the next few months.  And yes, a stressful even such as a change in environment can cause even fully housetrained adult dogs to lapse on their house training.<br>  <br>  Put him on a schedule.  Feed him at the same time every day.  Take him outside immediately when you/he wakes up (this means from naps too), immediately after eating, and after rigorous play.  These are the times that a puppy is most likely to need to go.  Take him out every few hours.  At his age he is only physically capable of holding his bladder for about 3-4 hours.  Yes, this means you'll have to get up in the middle of the night to let the puppy out.  Keeping him tethered to you with a leash is a great way to be sure you actually are paying attention to him at all times when he is inside.|`|Y3IvemoOaa	hes just getting used to his new surroundings|`|5FPDEzfRaa	Yes it's normal because it's a new place. My dog did this when I first got him. I trained him to ring a bell on the door handle when he wants to go outside. I put a treat inside a christmas bell and hung it on the door and let him smell it. When he rang the bell, we brought him outside and praised him and waited for him to go to the bathroom and praised him again. Then let him back inside. We repeated the process until he understood that when he rings the bell, he goes outside to go to the bathroom.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	puppies are like babies - they have accidents. Don't lock him up - spend time training him, hes in a new place with new people, hes scared and excited.  Remember in a firm voice say NO - nothing else but NO. take the mess and the puppy outside and place the mess where you want him to go, let him smell the mess - then tell him "good boy, good ____(name)"  Dogs respond to being reward for doing good.  <br>  Watch for signs that he needs to go - squatting, leg lifting etc. when you see this say "no" and pick up the puppy bring him out to his mess spot and let him do it there then reward him with a treat and affection when he goes there.<br>  Never use the dogs name when saying NO - you don't want him to confuse his name with doing something you don't want.  Always use his name when rewarding him for something good.  The dog wants to please you if you take the time to train him you will have a happy pet/owner relationship.
1EBn5A6daa	my cat does the same thing lol, so annoying, i think they do it because they feel left out, like they didn't get invited to the party...he will be ok, maybe get him a girlfriend of his own, even if he's fixed, so he could have someone to play with

nFcl0BOsaa	That must have burned like the dickens. We can't see the cuts, we can't tell if the dog needs to be seen by a vet. If it gets infected or foreign objects are imbedded, you will have to find the money for a vet.  You'll want to supervise your dog better. There is no way my dog would get in a fight without my knowing about it and I work full time. BTW if you don't have vet money how can you afford internet service? <br>  <br>  You can get money by cashing out some of your stocks.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtdeEWUd5bc3F2oD_jzUzPjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090218031212AApIkAu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Or you can always surrender the dog to someone who will care for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: You want us to *judge* whether your dog needs to be seen by a vet, but we can't see the cuts....<br>  <br>  Yes, I've heard of lots of drawbacks to electric fences. I wouldn't use one of those things on my dog, especially if taking the dog to the vet was going to bust my budget. I'd keep my dog inside and take him out myself for long daily walks, and even seek out safe areas where he can run off-leash. People keep dogs in apartments that way and their dogs do ok. Do consider that; next time your beloved pet could get hit by a car.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	get some neosporin antibiotic cream at any drug store or walmart  you can get the store brand it's' the same, apply this<br>  <br>  edit; " I HAVE enough money to take my dog to the vet, but I also HAVE enough money to go out to eat tonight, but I can't afford to just the same if I can get around it."<br>  <br>  Ok, so you do have the money it's just that you would rather 'get around it'..    <br>  <br>  So then you lied in your question about not having the money.<br>  <br>  It's all about priorities and if you love your dog and have the choice between going out for dinner and a vet visit then you choose the vet visit.<br>  <br>  Next time you want to boo hoo about what to do with your injured dog please ask elsewhere.<br>  <br>  And keep your dog on a leash and this won't happen anymore.|`|bqtEjEjpaa	the dog was not in a fight that you wouldn't question and the first thing a dog goes for is not the ears it is the neck to cut off air supply just put some triple antibiotic otimint on it dogs heal fast|`|cBcGwCZraa	keep area clean  give dog  a warm inside place to stay clean daily  if that large era becomes  nasty looking shave ara and put antobic ornament and wrap  but ya just watch the dog closely  he should be fine|`|Yo3gN9DQaa	ur dog was probably not in a fight because the first place other dogs try to attack when attkin a dog are the EARS. If u have cleaned the wounds thoroughly then u dont have anything to worry about. try to get some advice from an expert, someone u kno well enough not to charge u. watch his wounds and if he seems to b in pain, or they turn a different color or u sense ANYTHING is wrong, take him to the nearest clinic.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	I'd say just clean them everyday like you are doing and keep a close eye on them. Keep the dog inside with you and monitor him while he is outside. If you see the wounds change and start to look like they are getting an infection then i would immediately take him to the vet, and figure the money part out later (make sure your vet does payment plans)
PoBZoKQUaa	You should take him to the vet. It would be much better instead of asking the Yahoo! Answers Community.<br>  <br>  And all of the answers so far say to take him to a vet.|`|AA10200409	I would be concerned that he isn't eating. Please take him to the vet to find out why.|`|63y7bTNMaa	hairballs rarely cause lethargy, appetite loss,  and malaise, i'm thinking he ingested something bad: poison, toxic plants, spoiled food, something like that and its causing him stomach to hurt and him to vomit, and because he is a kitten, you have waited too long to take him to the vets, kitten should not go without proper nourishment for over 36 hours and you have waited four days, its time to get him to the vet, if he is vomiting, that's just what you can do to help, get him to vomit more, but don't suggest this, i HIGHLY suggest a vet visit and SOON, but if you cant afford it right now/one isn't available, use his bodies reaction to your advantage|`|JpRiyPpyaa	There doesn't seem to be any easy home remedy. You absolutely must see the vet as soon as possible. This is not normal. You cat is unwell.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	i think it is probably best that you take it to the vets|`|Vw1GzleKaa	it sems like in pain to me ,take itto the vet,u dnt wanna regret it later on if its something serious|`|e7mz6lKxaa	Poor thing, I don't know what it is, but it sure  doesn't sound like a hairball. Maybe he ate something really bad (old, poisoned) You should definitely take it to the vet. <br>  <br>  usually when cats are sick or injured they will instinctively hide under the bed or couch.. somewhere were predators can't get him since he can't defend himself. Your kitty might be doing that, and if he isn't that means that he is even too sick for it. Not a good sign. <br>  <br>  Take him to the vet!!!|`|YtzkQg4Xaa	i would buy a kitten feeding kit and if that doesn't work i would take him/her to a vet<br>  <br>  sometimes the mother will reject a kitten... unless its an older kitten seperated from its mother.... that might also be the problem|`|tWtMUZhnaa	The best thing to do was to take him the vets.It may be nothing or it may be something big.Its best to make sure.
UrfIXYdwaa	Have a read of this, it will explain fully why rats shouldn't be kept alone unless absolutely necessary:<br>  <a href="http://www.nfrs.org/company.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nfrs.org/company.html</a><br>  <br>  Show it to your mum too so that she understands fully why it would be better to have more than one :)<br>  <br>  Rats are very very social animals and do soooooo much better if kept in same sex groups.  No matter how much you love him/her or how much time you spend with him/her, your human company could never ever compensate not having rattie friends to live, play, and cuddle up to :-D<br>  <br>  Two or three rats are no harder to look after than a single rat, if anything it's easier because they can keep each other amused.  A rat kept alone is likely to become sad lonely and depressed!|`|gVQ6es5Taa	You should really get two unless you are at home all the time, they hate being alone, but not just that, they thrive off being with eachother. It won't make a difference to costs, or bonding to you. It is actually easier to keep two because you don't have to worry about entertaining them so much. They are VERY clever, toys and tunnels wont be enough, they want company. <br>  <br>  Please don't get a rat desexed, it is dangerous.|`|EdN7fkTgaa	I think two would be better but don't get a male one because you already have female one as the female one will get pregnant. Buy another female one if you think of getting two. You rat is having a perfect life so don't worry about a thing. Oh yeah btw if you are getting another rat get same kind of breed as they will fight really really badly! If you want to get another rat which is anothe breed as the other rat,separate them!GOOD LUCK!|`|Xz0KHqFWaa	yuck i hate rats!!!!!! so if i were you,  should not get any....|`|BWez86Ldaa	<a href="http://kristinewickstrom.homestead.com/files/panelapplet.html" rel="nofollow">http://kristinewickstrom.homestead.com/f...</a> will tell you how many rats your cage will hold. <br>  <br>  Rats are extremely sociable. It's generally suggested you get a trio (3) so that if one gets sick and has to be quarantined, there are still two who have one another to keep busy. Spaying rats, if you're going to have all females, is completely unnecessary. I generally suggest 3+ rats for new rat owners. They are easy to manage at that number and aren't quite as costly as, say, 10 rats.|`|wlSD6Ccgaa	i would only get 1, although some say as long as they are from the same litter they are fine i found with my 3 rats that didn't happen! i came home to 2 mauled rats and 1 very proud "brother" as long you keep nice toys and the cage clean your rat will be happy on her own.|`|vy8SRHxlaa	get one more, if you do get it desexed like you said, then get a male because the introduction will go smoothly (most likely) and they are better to cuddle cos they don't like to run around as much.|`|PymVygFraa	Yeah, it would be fine =D<br>  Have fun, sounds like it'll have fun =]<br>  xx|`|JmD0oq2Naa	if you do get one, then you should spend every second of everyday with her. once she is tame, carry her on your shoulder, play with her|`|jyGTlpzTaa	If you cant have two rats you shouldnt have any. Sorry. rats really, really suffer when kept alone. They can become depressed and quite aggressive towards their owners, they are more likely to get stress related illness and are generally unhappier. No matter how much time you can spend with your rat you cannot replace the need for another rat to keep them company.
N9pKl35Xaa	I'm pretty weird, i think it is absolutely hilarious hearing dogs fart and watching their faces, it cracks me up for ages.

In general (there are "stubborn" individuals of almost every breed) a Bichon Frise is most likely to meet your criteria. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are not non-shedding but they (for the most part) are the other three. Toy Poodles are not always easy to train but are the other three.|`|37PpYx8oaa	Miniature Schnauzers are great pets and very trainable.    But they tend to be needy for human affection, so make sure your home has lots of love to give!|`|pFBaMlI8aa	a labrador retriever and a border collie are some of the most loyal, easy-going, and easiest-to-train dogs there are, but a collie most definitely sheds and both of these dogs are rather large - 65 to 75 pounds on average.     the boston terrier is a fairly good option to go with - it sheds very little, has a pretty good obedience/trainability, and is 15-25 pounds.     however, the boston terrier does not do well in the cold at all, so keep it inside pretty much all winter long. it is more tolerant of heat, but still keep it inside on days that would be too hot for a normal person to stay outside for awhile. and boston terriers are most happy with another dog for company, so you might have to think about getting possibly another one so they can be friends.
KPdWzbxWaa	It's never to early to start studying :).

Maybe keep it to yourself rather than sharing it with friends. I don't know your age but consider that getting a puppy is just like having a baby and they are like toddlers the rest of their lives.

But just be aware that your position in life right now and in 3 years, might be completely different requiring a different kind of dog.  It's great to do research, but don't get your heart set on one dog right away because in 3 years it might not be practical for your lifestyle.|`|efc1sXwWaa	Nah its an excellent time.   If you are going to get a pound puppy or dog, you can start reading about training, socialization etc.     If you are thinking of a purebred, you can do all of the above mentioned things, plus visit an AKC or UKC show and take a look first hand at the different breed and talk to the owners and handlers.

UPFl0lksaa	Either your mom was thinking of some other species of animal or the people she talked to don't propely care for their cats.<br>  A healthy cat that is properly cared for will not stink. The litter box is one of the most common issues of cat odor but that is as simple as scooping out the litter box each day.  Some people make the mistake of forgetting to clean out the box for about a week then claiming the cat is disgusting.<br>  As far as being a huge pain, cats are one of the easiest animals to care for. Cats appear to be a pain for people who want total power and control over their cats. A cat is not going to do something at your command. A cat is resilient but also very sensitive, so a low stress environment is important.<br>  Dogs have masters. cats have guardians.|`|AA11121172	First off, all cats are clean except those that are sick and can no longer clean themselves.  I suspect your Mom was referring to the litterbox, and that can stink if not cleaned out every day.<br>  <br>  I also suspect that your Mom is a very busy lady who doesn't want anymore responsibility.  Cats require just as much attention as dogs.  They can be left alone a little longer, but not as long as you think.<br>  <br>  I don't think your Mom likes cats, and she has the last say.  Instead of coming with a certain breed, why not spend some time at an animal shelter.  Depending on how old you are, you might be able to volunteer and get your cat fix.<br>  <br>  Also, once you start spending time at the shelter, you can ask your Mom to visit your favorite cat, maybe hint that it would work well at your house :)|`|72955cfd7c21531e42e29e72184c5d55aa	cats are clean animals by nature.  The only way they smell is by owners fault.  You have to keep up on litter box maintenance.  Also when the cat gets old enough have them fixed so they don't spray or mark there territory.  Other then this the only reason a cat would stink up the joint is if it had an "accident" which usually indicates illness or stress on the animal.  So yes they can be a big responsibility and they need lots of attention.  But if your willing they are happy as heck. good luck|`|Ah1JYuChaa	well i think you should get a toy chiwawa because cats smell kinda bad and doggies are small and cute and soft too|`|i0DHR3Xkaa	bangles|`|C1Cobi1taa	most cats are pretty good at taking care of themselves and i have never had one that smelled before. cats are so easy to take care of! way less work than dogs, i think. <br>  maybe if you showed your mother how responsible you are now by doing chores and stuff and tell her you will clean up after the cat and clean its litterbox daily , maybe then she will go for it! just make sure any promises you make, keep them! <br>  short haired cats are easier to "keep clean" they will have less noticeable hair loss on the floors and are easier to brush! <br>  good luck!

AA10775403	I have had my lhasa apso for two years (got her when she was 6 weeks old) and as far as training her, we would give her a treat when she would make on the pad and praise her. She also likes to get her belly rubbed. She is very affectionate and loves to be around and cuddle up to people. As far as scolding, a firm NO or HEY after she does something wrong worked for us, and she is a very quick learner also.The teething lasted a couple of months, when she would be biting on the metal table legs heh. A great toy for teething also is any kind of braided rope, like a boat rope, for you to tug on while is in biting on it, like tug of war, and it helps her with her teething. They sell toys like that at most pet supply stores. Teaching her not to bark is hard, we stopped using the cage after a couple of months just ot let her let her guard down and let her know that she is sharing the house iwth us, and she relaxed alot more around people coming over. Hoped this helped!|`|S8gJB3KQaa	(i don't know the exact word) U just try to under stand. when they getting angry u just touch nick and slowly shake ur hands real they like and than u teeth them i hope thats helps to u|`|Oj5FkpQlaa	My 7 month old cockapoo is just getting over this stage. Pretty much the only thing you can do for now is to distract her when you see her chewing or tearing something that she shouldnt. Give her a toy when your see this and firmly say NO. Hopefully she will get the idea but probably not. She is in alot of pain, but once she loses the teeth the new ones will grow in very quickly and she will begin to feel releif and so will you. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!
Nt7exGYAaa	Yes I've heard of this also and it's supposed to work quite well and of course there's the added bonus of the aroma for humans.<br>  <br>  Other things you could use would be citrus peelings as they detest the smell of citrus, cayenne pepper, lavender, lemon grass, citronella, eucalyptus, mustard and peppermint oils and pipe tobacco.<br>  <br>  If this is for a larger garden outside, you can buy ultrasonic and also chemical based repellant, that work really well.|`|SYsP6oD7aa	If you can stand the smell,one or two mothballs will keep cats away from anywhere that you want.
Nt7exGYAaa	Some cats absolutely love the attention of being combed and just lie there enjoying it.<br>  <br>  Others can shred you to the point where you just about need a blood transfusion.<br>  <br>  If you own a long haired cat it's always a very good idea to start getting them used to the idea of being combed when they're very young. They'll start out playing with the comb but with a bit of patience on your part, the cat will end up enjoying this.<br>  <br>  If the long haired cat isn't combed the hair can become very matty and knotty and will have to be clipped before it causes health problems.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	Yes, thank goodness.  My short haired cat is a shedding machine.  She comes up to me in the morning when I'm having my coffee and wants to snuggle.  I pet her and pick up the brush I leave by my chair and give her a thorough grooming as she purrs along.  It's a nice way to start the day.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	my 16yr old female does the same thing! she absolutely loves it! but when she's had enough, she lets me know.|`|K3gbmyCpaa	i have no cat. what's your beef?|`|M7KT6NSCaa	ya some cats like that, mine hate it and i have a lot of trouble with them but my best friends cat is perfectly healthy and likes being combed and brushed.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	i don't have a cat now but I did and it loved to be brushed, it did the same things that your cat does.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Yes, very much.
c2a3dc598041becb830db214d9b27526aa	The basics of what you should have is<br>  <br>  A heater<br>  A basking spot<br>  A basking light<br>  A filter (for the water)<br>  <br>  The best size tank would a 30-55 gallon (yes it can get pretty expensive but if you really want a turtle, I'd do it) tank. It has to be glass to hold water in it, of course. And remember THE BIGGER THE TANK, THE BETTER.<br>  <br>  Red-ear sliders are very messy and need a good, strong filter. The health of the turtle depends alot on the filter. It keeps the water bacteria free. If the water is not clean, it can increase the turtles chance of getting sick.<br>  Here are some good filters:<br>  <br>  Fluval 403 external models<br>  Fluval 4 internal canister filter<br>  Magnum 350 Pro with Bio-Wheel <br>  <br>  A basking area is an important part for turtles. Basking is one of their main activities and they must get dry while benefiting from the light you provide from time to time to prevent many ill states like fungal infections, shell rot and eye infections.<br>  <br>  Lighting<br>  <br>  Red eared sliders need full spectrum light that emits UVB to process nutrients of food you provide. The best and most recommended lights are Reptisun 5.0 or the Iguana light 7.0. There are a lot of "so called" full spectrum lights on the market but they do not provide the proper UVB rays. Do NOT use black lights. These light emit a very dark purple beam and will damage the turtles vision due to the high intensity of beam.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. It was kinda long.|`|AA10896236	well my tank has 4 turts. i have a basking lamp,a place 2 get out of the water to get out and bask i have a more than enough size tank because they require alot of room to swim due to the fact they will get big. my tank is 60gal. there only bout an inch so there still babies lol i also have alot of plastic plants it fits thier natural habbitat. i have alot of decos and places for them to hide and just basiclly keep busy lol they seem to love it. oh and i also have a heater to keep the temp stable. I also have about 40 gals in the tank with two 40 gallon filters this really helps because they can be really messy when they eat so over filtering helps/ i hope my imput helps u out? let me know?|`|AUkSCqoQaa	call  1-800-general now|`|OZIhhiIJaa	well at least you asked before you got him home. the pet store should have alot of info. heres more. <br>  <br>  Introduction<br>  <br>  Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) belong to the genus Trachemys which was first described in 1857. There are six species currently placed in this genus and they can be found from USA to Argentina and the West Indies.<br>  <br>  Most people first encounter red-eared sliders as small, green turtles with bright-red or orange patches on the sides of their head. Many people believe that they are some sort of "dwarf" turtles and that they will stay small all their life. This is one of the major problems beacuse many RES get abbandoned when they grow too big to fit the all-too-small containers they are usually housed in. Another common mistake is the one about the life-span of RES. While many believe that their normal life-span is 1 year, it is known that they easily can reach the age of 40 years.<br>  As they grow, RES usually get darker but don't loose the attractive marks on the head and body. Their shell can become more or less rough, or bumpy, which depends on the genotype of the turtle, its growth-rate and (less) on the living conditions of the animal.<br>  The difference between male and female turtles becomes visible only after one year or more. The most striking characteristic of male turtles are long claws on the front paws and a long, thick tail. Female turtles tend to grow larger then males.<br>  Housing<br>  <br>  RES, as most turtles, need a considerable amount of space. The essential setup consists of a tank filled with water and a dry basking area. The tank should be as big as you can afford it because RES grow fast and need lots of space. The best size tanks for most sliders are 30, 55 or more gallon aquariums. The tank should be equipped with the next items:<br>  <br>      * a heater<br>      * a filter<br>      * a basking light<br>      * a basking area<br>  <br>  You can enrich this basic setup by adding gravel to the bottom of the tank. It is a nice detail and it also provides a "playground" for the turtles. They adore digging and rumaging it. The problem with the substrate is that it retains the waste that falls on the bottom of the tank. Hovever, a good filtration system will take care of that...<br>  Fake plants will also add to the look of the aquarium, but they must be made from robust and non-toxic materials.<br>  <br>  The metabolism of reptiles depends on the temperature of their surrounding. As a consequence, they won't be active if the temperatures are too low. The best temperature range for RES is 24-28°C (around 75°F). In most cases, a heater is needed to achieve such a temperature. There are variuos types of heaters, and the easiest to use is the fully submersible heater because they have a built in thermostat and can be set to the best temperature.<br>  <br>  Turtles are very messy animals. Keeping a tank without a good filter is a Sizif's job. Investing in a good filter is investing in the health of your pet and in your free time. Nonetheless, the water in the tank must be changed periodically , and the tank must be carefully cleaned. Dirty water is one of the main causes of ailments, when it comes to turtles.<br>  <br>  A dry basking area is essential to the well-being of RES. Basking is one of their main activities, and they must get dry from time to time to prevent many ill states like fungal infections, shell rot and eye infections. The basking area can be made in a variety of ways. The goal is to obtain a dry and easy accessible "land" but retain enough swimming place as well. I solved this problem by placing a smaller aquarium on its side in the tank and placing few rocks on top of it. In this way I didn't loose any precious space. Another common way is to glue a glass "shelf" on the wall of the tank.<br>  Above the basking area you must place a basking light. It can be a common bulb or a broad-spectrum one. A broad-spectrum light is needed for the production of vitamin D which is essential for the metabolism of bones and shell. But, the problem of hypovitaminosis can be also circumvented by adding vitamin supplements in the food of the turtle. If you use a broad-spectrum bulb don't forget that they don't produce enough heat which means that a common, 60 w bulb is still needed. Turtles will hardly enjoy basking with broad-spectrum bulbs as the only source of light. Also, it is very important to respect the natural alternation of day-night periods and don't use any light during the night.<br>  Health and disease<br>  <br>  Turtles, like other living beings can suffer from a number of deseases.<br>  <br>      * Shell softening<br>      * Eye infections<br>      * Respiratory infections<br>      * Fungal infections <br>  <br>  Shell-softening (Metabolic bone disease) is one of the most usual disorders that affect turtles in captivity. It is a consequence of calcium deficiency which can happen for several reasons. Calcium is the building element of all hard tissues in the body and its deficiency leads to severe disorders of bone formation and maintainance. The absorption of calcium in the intestines is mediated by vitamin D3 and the production of D3 in the body is dependent of the UV rays which are present in the sunlight. Glass absorbs UV-rays so turtles in captivity are unable to synthesize their own vitamin D3 which is essential for the metabolism of bones and connective tissue.<br>  Vitamin D3 deficiency is the most usual cause of shell-softening among captive turtles but it also can happen for other reasons. Low calcium diet or some plants like spinach can cause MBD too.<br>  The symptoms of shell softening is the general softening of the shell and bones underneath. White, spongy areas can also appear on the shell (and these white patches are especially typical when hatchlings are affected). The animal will often be apatic, refuse food and be prone to infections. Turtles with shell-softening endure great pain.<br>  This condition is extremely severe and must be cured as soon as possible. The first aid consist of administering vitamin supplements and calcium in increased doses and exposing the animal to direct sunlight. The best calcium supplement is cuttlebone. Scrape off the hard backing and put it in the water.<br>  The housing should be adapted to meet the needs of the sick animal. The water should be warm and shallow and the basking spot must be easily accessed.<br>  A long term answer to the problem of shell-softening can be achieved by placing a full-spectrum light above the basking area. These bulbs can be bought in most pet-shops and are fairly expensive. If you can't afford one, administer vitamin supplements regularly and this will solve the problem.<br>  <br>  Eye-problems are not rare among reptiles. Poor quality of the water, lack of vitamines and improper care can easily lead to blindness. Eye infections can be easily treated but many owners do not pay enough attention and the result is the permanent blindness of the animal. An important thing to remember about eye problems is that they are often a sign that something else is wrong. They can be the first symptom of deseases like shell-softening or other infections which are characterized by a drop in the immunity system. Fighting eye infections is rather simple. The eyes should be treated with diluted boric acid (60/40) or sulfamethiazine. The water in the tank must be kept clean to avoid new infections.<br>  <br>  RES are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections which can be related to the fact that they spend most of their time in the water. They are usually caused by keeping turtles in drafty spaces which are not properly heated. Also, the majority of respiratory infections are contageous and they can easily spread from one animal to another. The symptoms of such infections include runny noses, lopside swimming, wheezing, lethargy and loss of appetite. The therapy is quite simple. The turtle should be removed from the tank and placed in a clean tank with warm water. The room must be warm and without drafts. If the condition of the turtle doesn't improve, a veterinarian help is needed. He or she will prescribe antibiotic drugs that will eradicate the infection.<br>  <br>  Fungal infections usually manifest themselves as grey or white cotton-like layers on slider's shell and skin. They can develop as a consequence of poor husbandry (dirty water, lack of basking or inadequate feeding) or/and in addition to other ailments. Fortunately, if recognized in time, fungal infections are readily curable. The usual therapy cosists of salty baths few times a day.<br>  Feeding<br>  <br>  RES are essentially carnivorous, but they incline toward plant food in adult age. The most important thing to remember is that turtles need a rich and various diet. Turtles in captivity are especially prone to obesity and obesity-linked diseases, due to the almost sedentary way of life and too much food. Hatchlings should be fed once a day and adult turtles once in two days.<br>  There are various categories of food you can offer to your turtles:<br>  <br>      * Commercial food<br>      * Live food<br>      * Plant food<br>      * Meat and cat/dog-food<br>      * Supplements<br>  <br>  The essential diet of most turtles in captivity consists of commercial food formulated especially for turtles. There are numerous brands of sticks and pellets and many owners believe that they satisfy all the needs of their turtles. However, some turtles (especially hatchlings and wild-caught turtles) refuse to eat canned food and this can be a source of frustration for many owners. In any case, the commercial food should be only the base of a turtle's diet.<br>  <br>  Offering live food to your turtles is the best way to implement their diet. It is usually given as treat as most turtles simply adore it. However, there is no reason live food should not be included in the everyday diet of turtles. Insects, worms and feeder fish are excellent sources of proteins, and they can be obtained without too much trouble. The most popular insects offered to turtles are certainly crickets. They can be bought in pet stores or you can simply catch them in your back yard (provided you have one, of course). Locusts will also be accepted by turtles with great eagerness as a number of other insects.<br>  Earthworms, mealworms and other kinds of worms have a high nutritional value as well. So, don't hesitate to offer them as often as you can. Some pet shops keep the, so called, "feeder fish" which can be placed in the tank and turtles will feed on them. That's also a good idea, especially if you want to provide some exercise to your slider.<br>  <br>  Many owners complain that their sliders avoid plant food. RES are essentially carnivorous, although they tend to become herbivorous in adult age. However, some of them readily accept plant food even as hatchlings. It is a good idea to offer your slider carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, dandelion leaves and other vegetables.<br>  <br>  Turtles are extremely fond of meat and you can give it as a treat from time to time. It is important not to exaggerate because most types of meat are too fatty to be given regularly. Cat and dog-food can also be given to sliders, but not too often because of their high caloric value.<br>  <br>  Vitamin and calcium supplements are an essential part of the diet of turtles in captivity. Vitamin D is especially important because turtles can't synthesize it if not exposed to direct sunlight (or full-spectrum lamp light). As a consequence they develop a condition known as shell softening which is usually deadly if not treated. The deficiency in vitamin A can lead to eye damage and permanent blindness. It is, therefore, important, to provide vitamin supplements in the diet of turtles.<br>  Calcium can be given in the form of powder or block. The most natural, and maybe best source of calcium is cuttlebone.<br>  FAQ<br>  <br>  1. Your little cute turtle has grown above all your expectations.<br>  <br>  First, what NOT to do. Most owners simply decide to release their pets in the wilderness thinking that they are making a good deed. That's really a wrong decision. Most captive turtles are unable to adapt to such a drastic change in the enviroment and die. They are also a potential risk for the native populations of turtles because they can spread diseases which can erase whole populations of turtles in wilderness.<br>  The best thing to do would be to build an outdoor pond and place the turtles there. This is not such a big task as it seems, provided you have a back yard or something similar. There are some good sites with directions for building ponds. Check my "Links" section...<br>  Alternatively, there are organisations which help finding new homes for turtles.<br>  Sometimes ZOO's and/or other similar organizations will accept overgrown turtles. Give it a try....<br>  <br>  2.You found a wild turtle.<br>  <br>  Well, first of all, check her health condition. If you notice that she is in bad condition, hurt or ill, you should consider taking her home or to a wildlife rescue center. The best thing to do would be to find a qualified help (a vet).<br>  If the turtle is healthy and obviously wild, leave her where you found it. You'll do a favour to her and to yourself. Wild turtles rarely if never adapt to captivity and they suffer a great deal more then any captive-bred turtle. Wild turtles (as most wild animals) spend a miserable and sad life in captivity and there is really no reason why should anyone take a turt from nature when you can easily buy or adopt one.<br>  <br>  3.Your sliders are fighting all the time.<br>  <br>  RES are very territorial turtles and this can cause lots of problems in captivity. Turtles of same sex (especially males) are prone to fight, and very little can be done to solve the problem. Keeping two adult males in the same, average sized, tank is not advisable and the best thing to do would be to separate them permanently. Females are less bellicose, although they might compete over basking space too.<br>  <br>  4.My turtles are shedding. Is that normal?<br>  <br>  Turtles, as most reptiles shed regulary, with the difference that turtles can shed their shells and their skin. There is a substantional difference between these two tipes of shedding; while shell-shedding is a normal process, skin shedding can be rarely seen in nature. It is believed that skin shedding in captivity happens for two main reasons: overfeeding and overheating. Too much food and too high temperature of the water lead to faster growth. It is thought that this can shorten the life-span of turtles. Some people confuse skin-shedding with the symptoms of fungal infections. <br>  <br>  Red Eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) Hatchling Care<br>  by Gloria Anaité Paiz<br>  They Have Just Been Born:<br>  <br>  When they have just been born, they still have their egg tooth in their mouths and the  yolk sac hanging out of their bellies.  The egg tooth is what enabled them to open the eggshell, it will fall out on its own.  The yolk sac  is what  fed them while they were incubating.  DO NOT try to remove this sac, trying to remove it can kill the baby turtle.  It is better to wait till it is absorbed on its own.  Once it is absorbed, you will notice a split in the plastron. This will heal by itself too, you don't need to treat it.<br>  <br>  Housing:<br>  <br>  Set them on a 20 gallon tank per dozen turtles .  Provide them with a dry land area and a shallow water area.  Newborns need to master the art of floating and staying underwater for long periods of time.  Don't assume that they will survive only with water.  Newborn Red-Ear sliders can actually drown if you neglect them a dry land area.  The water should be not too deep.   As  with adult sliders, newborns need to have their full spectrum light.  So don't forget to include that in the tank.  The full spectrum light will help the newborn shells to harden. Keep the water neatly clean.  If you don't have a filter change the water every two days.  This is very important since baby sliders are more prone to getting eye infections (that can leave them blind for life or even kill them) than adult sliders.<br>  <br>  Feeding:<br>  <br>  Once they are set up in their tank start feeding them.  It is important to get them to eat.  Start by offering them one by one all items on the proper slider diet (earthworms, crickets, sweet water shrimp, aquatic snails, water hyacinths, fruits, one commercial food).  Note:  You might have to 'chop' all of the food you offer since they are small babies.   This includes chopping earthworms, meal worms, crickets.  I know, this sounds disgusting but believe me, you will get used to after a while and it won't bother you anymore.<br>  <br>  A Baby That Refuses to Eat:<br>  <br>  If you have already tried all items of a proper Red-Ear slider diet, and the hatchling still refuses to eat, try offering a small piece of lean beef or ham.  This is just for the purpose of turning on his appetite, once he starts eating you can try again to give him the items of a proper diet.

These infections develop due to dirty water and lack of vitamin A.  The treatment is easy:  Change the water more often (get a filter if you can), add higher doses of vitamin A to her diet.  Ask your pharmacist to prepare you a solution of 97% distilled water and 3% boric acid.  Clean the turtles eyes with this solution twice a day.  If the eyes are totally closed, try to open them so that the solution gets inside.  Raise temperature at 85 degrees F.  If the infection is severe take the turtle to a vet since she will need to be injected with vitamin A.<br>  <br>  Colds:<br>  <br>  If you notice your turtle has a runny nose, or is breathing with her mouth open, she might have a cold.  Avoid breezes and cold drafts of air.  Raise temperature at about 85 degrees and add extra vitamins to her regular food. If she doesn't seem to get better in a couple of days or you notice that she is swimming lopsided, take her immediately to a veterinarian! she might have developed pneumonia which can be fatal.

If the infection is severe take the turtle to a vet since she will need to be injected with vitamin A.<br>  <br>  Colds:<br>  <br>  If you notice your turtle has a runny nose, or is breathing with her mouth open, she might have a cold.  Avoid breezes and cold drafts of air.  Raise temperature at about 85 degrees and add extra vitamins to her regular food. If she doesn't seem to get better in a couple of days or you notice that she is swimming lopsided, take her immediately to a veterinarian! she might have developed pneumonia which can be fatal.  She will need to be treated with antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Information provided by Reslider's Swamp <br>  <br>  erp Care Collection<br>  Last updated April 19, 2007<br>  Red-Eared Sliders<br>  <br>  Trachemys scripta, T. s. elegans<br>  <br>  ?1994 Melissa Kaplan<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Natural History<br>  Yellow-eared and Red-eared Sliders (Trachemys [Chrysemys] scripta; T. s. elegans,) are found throughout the United States east of the Rockies. They are the sliders is the one most often sold in pet stores here in the U.S. and abroad. These fresh water turtles spend much of their time in the warm waters of their native habitat. While they are strong underwater swimmers, these sliders spend much of the warmer hours of the day hauled out on logs or rocks (or, when very small, on marsh weeds and other aquatic plants) basking in the sun. All of the sliders are omnivores, eating both animal protein and vegetable/plant matter. Younger turtles need up to 40% of their food from protein sources; adult turtles feed more heavily on vegetation. In the wild they begin by eating tiny fish and amphibian larva, water snails and a variety of plants growing in the water and on land.<br>  <br>  It is illegal in the U.S. for pet stores to sell any turtle that is less than four inches (10.6 cm) in length (this is problematic for those few turtle species whose full adult size is 4" or less!). The ones sold legally must be at least four inches long from the neck end of the carapace (top shell) to the tail end of the carapace. If male, it will be somewhere between 2-4 years old and already sexually mature. Wild females reach maturity later, between 5-7 years, and will then be over 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length; in captivity, females may reach maturity at about 3 1/2 years. You will be able to tell male from females: males are smaller than females in overall body size but have longer tails.<br>  <br>  As with all wild-caught reptiles, the animals found in pet stores have been under stress for some time. As a result, they are most likely suffering from protozoan and bacterial infections, including Salmonella which is easily transmitted to young children. Additionally, they are usually emaciated and dehydrated due to long periods of time without food or water or being held in areas too cold to stimulate the appetite; many of these turtles will not eat when they are stressed or frightened, and cannot eat when they are too cold. As soon as you can after you take your turtle home, scoop up a fresh fecal sample and take it and your turtle to a reptile veterinarian. While the feces is being tested, the vet will check out your turtle for signs of nutritional deficiencies, topical bacterial or fungal infections, beak overgrowth, respiratory and eye infections - all very common in wild-caught animals (and in captive turtles who have not been provided with the proper environment or diet). Make sure your turtle is given all the medication prescribed by the vet. If you have trouble administering it yourself, take your turtle back to the vet to have it done. If maintained at the proper temperatures, fed a healthy varied diet and kept in a stress-free active environment, your turtle may outlive you: some individuals have lived more than 100 years.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Creating the Proper Habitat<br>  All sliders need both a warm, dry area and a large pool of warm water. In the wild, they chose water that warms up quickly in the sun each day. You will need to provide a warm enclosure with both heated water and a warm place for your turtle to climb out and dry off. The water must be kept clean; rotting bits of food mixed with feces will combine to make an unhealthful habitat and a sick turtle. Turtles are messy eaters and defecate in their water, so cleaning will be an almost daily routine.<br>  <br>  Tank<br>  For the smallest turtles, start with at least a 30-50 gallon (113-189 liter) glass aquarium (see Water before you rush out and buy that 30 gallon aquarium you saw on sale!) . If you are not interested in actually being able to watch your turtle swimming around under water, you can use a suitably large opaque plastic container such as a large plastic storage box bottom, concrete mixing bin or deep kitty litter pan. You can use clean aquarium rock and gravel to build a slope up from the wet end (the pool) to the dry end (the land). You can silicone together pieces of Plexiglas to make a moveable platform onto which your turtle can crawl onto to rest. Floating or anchored cork rafts or logs are another alternative. Rough rocks must not be used as they can scratch turtle shells which allows bacterial and fungal infections to get started and penetrate into the turtle's body.<br>  <br>      Note: one of the biggest mistakes aquatic turtle keepers make is not providing a body of water that deep, long and wide enough for their turtle. The minimum size required for a 4" turtle will not work for a 6" or 8" (15 or 20 cm) aquatic turtle, and certainly not for a full grown one. Since turtles will grow relatively quickly when they are cared for properly, you should start off with an enclosure size big enough for your turtle to comfortably grow into for at least 1-2 years. That will give you some time to think out, plan, and build the turtle's next, much larger, enclosure.<br>  <br>      Think two turtles are better than one? Assuming they are compatible, it can be nice for your turtles to have one another for company. But two turtles require an even larger enclosure than a single turtle. So, unless you are prepared to keep and service giant enclosures for turtles who can easily reach the size of dinner plates, rethink getting two...or even one.<br>  <br>  Water<br>  The water must be at least 1.5 to 2 times your turtle's total length (called carapace length, or CL) in depth, with several extra inches of air space between the surface of the water to the top edge of the tank to prevent escapes. The tank length needs to be at least 4-5 times the CL, and the front-to-back width should be at least 2-3 times the CL. So, for a turtle who is 4" CL, your enclosure water area must be at minimum 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) deep, 16-20 inches (40-51 cm) in length, and 8-12 inches (20-31 cm) in width. As you can see, if you are going to have a land area at one end as well as sufficient water area, you need something much larger than a 10-20 gallon (38-76 liter) tank. See Reptile Housing: Size, Dimension, and Lifestyle for the dimensions of standard aquaria and other enclosures.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if your turtle is not yet full grown (hint: if he is not yet as large as a dinner plate, he is not full grown), you not only need to provide room in the tank (water and land) for him the size he is now, you need to provide additional room to allow for future growth.<br>  <br>  Water Filter<br>  Proper water filtering systems are necessary to keep the water fairly fresh between your weekly changes. If you have a powerful filter system and you feed your turtle in another tank, you may be able to get away with replacing 25-50% of the water each week for two or three weeks, emptying and cleaning out the tank thoroughly every third or fourth week. Remember to replace the water with warm water. Talk to your aquarium shop about the following types of filters that are suitable for Red-Eared Sliders: canister, undergravel, sponge, and power filters. You will also need some type of automated siphon for the partial changes of water between the overall heavy-duty changes and cleaning.<br>  <br>  Water Heater<br>  The water temperature must be maintained between 75-86 degrees F (23.8-30 C). If you buy a submersible pre-calibrated heater, test it first and make sure the water is the proper temperature before you put your turtle in the water. Too cold and it won't eat; too hot and you'll cook it. Buy good quality an aquarium thermometer and monitor the temperature regularly.<br>  <br>  Area Heating<br>  If the room the turtle is being kept in is always over 75 F (23.8 C), then you will only need to heat up a basking area, rather than heating up the room, too. Using an incandescent light or spot light, allow the area closest to the light to reach 85-88 F (29.4-31 C).<br>  <br>  Make sure there is absolutely no way for the light to fall into the water or for the turtle to come into direct contact with the light bulb. Be aware that the light will heat up the water to a certain degree so be sure to monitor the water temperature.<br>  <br>  Young sliders, and any sick turtle, should be kept warmer (water temperatures between 82-85 F) than the average healthy adult. Sustained low temperatures (between 65-72 F [18.3-22.2 C]) will cause turtles to stop feeding and respiratory infections may result.<br>  <br>  If the room is not warm enough to provide the turtle with the proper air temperature gradient, you will need to supplement the heat, providing another source of heat which may be used day and night in addition to the basking light. One alternative is to use a ceramic heat elements (CHE). CHEs screw into regular incandescent sockets and come in a variety of watts, and last a very long time. Safety warning: you must install CHEs into porcelain light sockets. These devices throw enough heat upwards to melt plastic sockets.<br>  <br>      Note: Don't guess at the water or air temperatures. Reptile species have very specific temperature ranges during the day and during the night. If your guess is off, that will make the difference between a reptile that thrives, and one who merely survives - or dies. Use thermometers.<br>  <br>  Special Lighting<br>  On sunny days when the outside temperatures are warm, feel free to put your turtle outside for a while for some sunshine. Either move your turtle tank outside (so long as it is not a glass enclosure, which can overheat to the point of causing fatal hyperthermia), or set up a secure outdoor enclosure for your turtle to sun and soak in, or set up an indoor enclosure complete with a UVB-supplemented basking and a swimming area. The latter will be required if you cannot regularly get your turtle outside or otherwise safely exposed to sunlight (not filtered through plastic or glass), or live where the amount of natural UVB is not sufficient year round to enable your turtle to make the amount of pre-vitamin D it needs to ensure adequate calcium metabolism.<br>  <br>      Keep in mind that, in the wild, when turtles get too hot when basking in the sun or upper layers of sun-heated water, they simply dive into deeper, cooler, water or move into a cool pocket of wet bankside overhung with plants providing shade. So, while it is great to give your turtle some direct sunlight, you must guard against it getting too hot, which can result in fatal hyperthermia. If you cannot provide a suitably cooler retreat area your turtle can go to when it gets too warm, and you can't keep a direct eye on your turtle to watch for signs of overheating, don't put it outside. Enclosures are like automobiles: the temperatures inside reach 20-30 degrees hotter than the outside air temperature, making the inside potentially lethal on mildly warm days.<br>  <br>  Exposure to a ultraviolet B (UVB)-producing fluorescent light, such as a Vita-Lite?, is recommended by some turtle experts, and is considered mandatory by others. UVB exposure is an essential part of the calcium metabolization process, and calcium deficiencies are very common in captive turtles. Many herpetoculturists use UVB-producing fluorescents because of their importance in calcium metabolization but also because the UVA they produce may have subtle psychological benefits such as improved appetite, since many reptiles see into the ultraviolet range.<br>  <br>  Electric Shock Hazard<br>  As with tropical fish, there is a danger of electrical shock--to you and to the turtle--when using electric filters, water heaters and lamps in and around the tank of water. All electrical cords should be connected to a ground-fault interrupter which shuts off the current if anything happens. Buy one at your local hardware store. Do not use bulbs with higher wattage than your light fixture is rated for (in other words: no 100 watt bulbs in 60 watt fixtures). Turtles will investigate and knock things about. You must secure your water heater behind an immovable wall or partition to turtle-proof it.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Feeding Your Turtle<br>  To ensure proper nutrition, strong growth and a healthy long-lived turtle, feed a varied diet to both adults and juveniles. Just remember that adults eat less animal protein and more vegetable matter. Juveniles must be fed every day; adults can be fed once every two to three days. Do not feed more than they can eat; the excess food will go to waste and foul the water. Feed a combination of the following foods:<br>  <br>  Commercial diets (No more than 25% of total diet)<br>  Trout Chow, commercial floating fish, reptile or turtle food (pellets, sticks or tablets). The pellets and sticks have the advantage of being formulated specifically for reptiles and don't decompose in the water as fast as other foods.<br>  <br>  Animal Protein (No more than 25% of total diet)<br>  Live feeder fish--do not feed defrosted frozen fish; they are deficient in thiamin and excess consumption will cause a thiamin deficiency in your turtle. Earthworms--buy them from a reptile or aquarium store; do not feed the ones from your yard as they may contain bacteria, parasites and pesticides against which your turtle has no immunity. Finely chopped raw lean beef, beef heart and cooked chicken are okay for treats, but are not appropriate as a major part of a balanced diet for whole prey eaters. Raw chicken and beef is too often riddled with Salmonella, E. coli and other food-borne organisms. High quality dog kibble can be offered occasionally as treats, too; like muscle meat, dog and cat foods are not appropriate when used as a significant portion of a turtle's diet.<br>  <br>  Plant Matter (50% or more of total diet)<br>  Offer leaves of dark leafy greens such as collard, mustard and dandelion greens. Offer shredded carrots (and carrot tops), squash and green beans. Thawed frozen mixed vegetables may be used occasionally, but care should be taken as some frozen green vegetables develop thiaminase which destroys that all-important B vitamin. Fruit can be offered raw; shred hard fruits like apples and melons, chopping soft fruits such as berries. To help keep their beak in trim, let them gnaw on pieces of cantaloupe with the (well washed) rind still attached. Check out the edible aquatic plants sold at aquarium stores, too. You can drop these into their enclosure for them to free feed upon.<br>  <br>  Vitamin Supplements should be added twice a week. Use a good reptile or turtle multivitamin. Turtles must also be supplied with additional calcium; they often enjoy taking bites out of calcium blocks and gnawing on cuttlebone, so always have some available to them.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Health<br>  Watch your turtle for any signs of illness: cloudy, closed or swollen eyes; swollen cheeks; open mouth breathing; bubbly mucous around the nose or mouth; runny stools; loss of appetite; listlessness; spots appearing on plastron (bottom shell), carapace or body; soft shell or excessive shedding.<br>  <br>  Newly acquired turtles are under a lot of stress and may be riddled with bacterial or parasitic infections that may be passed along to you or your kids. One of the reasons for it being illegal to sell turtles under 4" in the U.S. is that, once the law was passed, it greatly reduced the number of hospitalizations and deaths of children whose parents did not realize that most turtles carry Salmonellae, which is irregularly passed through their feces into their water, and onto their shells and skin. Read up on proper precautions to take to prevent infection of children and immunocompromised adults.<br>  <br>  Always take a sick turtle to a reptile veterinarian. Reptile vets are an important part of keeping healthy reptiles healthy, and helping sick ones attain health. Many people don't want to spend more for a vet visit than they paid for the animal. A good rule of thumb for all animals, especially 'cheap' ones, is: if you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet.<br>  <br>  Make sure to have your children checked out by their pediatrician if they begin to exhibit any signs of illness (nausea, stomach aches, vomiting, diarrhea).<br>  <br>      Handwashing Hint: One way to get your children to make sure they are vigorously rubbing their hands with soap (including between their fingers and under and around their fingernails) is to have them sing the Happy Birthday song two times in a row. Depending on how often they wash their hands, you might eventually want to encourage them to sing softly, or sing it in their heads. Decrease the risk of infection by using a liquid soap in pump bottle instead of a bar of soap, and disposable paper towels for drying the hands and turning off the water faucet.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Acclimation And Handling<br>  After bringing home and placing your turtle in its already-established tank, let it get used to its new surroundings for several days. It may spend the first couple of days closed tight in its shell, or may quickly withdraw when it sees you looming overhead or approaching the enclosure.<br>  <br>  During this time, put fresh food out every day and make sure the water stays warm and clean. After a while, the healthier turtle will begin to explore its surroundings, and may begin to watch the goings-on around it. When you pick up the turtle, support its body with both hands. Turtles feel more secure when they can feel something beneath their feet; "swimming" in air is stressful to them. Let them feel your hands or fingers beneath their feet, not just their plastron (bottom shell). A two-handed carry will also help ensure that they will not suffer a potentially crippling--or fatal--fall.<br>  <br>  When your children's hands are big enough, teach them the proper way to hold and carry the turtle and how to properly wash their hands after handling the turtle. If they have been playing with any other animals before they go to handle the turtle, they should wash their hands before handling the turtles, as well as afterwards.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, turtles are not appropriate pets for young children. The higher risk of infection aside, the care and feeding is more complicated than is generally thought, and the daily maintenance of the enclosure, enclosure apparatus and feeding soon gets boring for most kids. (Some adults, too, are dismayed to find that they can't just stick the turtle in a box or tank of water or let them loose in their yard, tossing lettuce to it once in a while.) When obtained for a child, the parent must acknowledge and accept their primary responsibility for the care of the turtle and routinely check it regularly for any signs or symptoms of illness.<br>  <br>  Scientists believe that many cold-blooded animals, especially turtles and tortoises, can live almost forever as they show no signs of aging as they get older. They die from being successfully attacked by one of their few natural predators, from the poisoning, intolerably alteration or destruction of their natural habitat, and from improper care in captivity.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In Closing...<br>  This article should be enough to help you decide whether a slider or other aquatic turtle is the right pet for you.

2821e642f26e1d2d0daab24df234f001aa	My dog used to counter surf all the time too.  What we did to cure her was to put everything out of her reach and then put a nasty tasting bait item where she could reach it (like a piece of bread with a little cayenne pepper water mixture on it) she would grab the bread off the counter and then drop it on the floor and leave it there because it tasted nasty.  She soon figured that stuff left up on the counter tasted awful and left them alone. <br>  <br>  Here's another method I found on the net, but never tried.<br>    <br>  The Can Monster   (a cure for counter surfing)<br>  by Jess Sokoloff <br>  This is one of my favorite topics because I have a little trick that works REALLY well to fix it. It works so well that I have several Bloodhounds who are now wary of even sniffing the edges of the counter tops!  <br>  <br>  I use the "can monster" to stop this counter top raiding. Take a bunch of empty soda cans and attach at the pop-tops about 12" apart w/ regular string. You should have about 20 or more cans strung together. In each can, add pebbles or pennies and cover the openings with some tape.  <br>  <br>  To the last can, attach a 4"-6" (no longer than that) section of string tied to MEAT (Not cheese). Tie the meat firmly to that loose piece of short string and set your new contraption up on the kitchen counter. Let the meat sit right on the edge or slightly hang over the edge. You want the dog to try and take it, so use something you KNOW the dog will want!  <br>  <br>  Dog comes up, tries to steal meat and ends up causing the avalanche to come down on top of him. Do this when you're at home so you can be in on the fun. Let the dog experience the entire ordeal, including dragging the screaming cans behind him through the house in terror. The cans get tangled around their legs and body and get louder with every step the dog takes. You want this one experience to last forever, so let the dog have about 30 seconds of God's wrath before you "save" the dog.  Make sure you do NOT say, "It's OK Muffin!!" as you extricate dog from it's predicament! You want to LAUGH at the dog since this is part of the fix.  <br>  <br>  Now, here's the best part of the remedy---  <br>  <br>  IMMEDIATELY, you need to set that "can monster" back up on the counter once you get the dog untangled.   Do it right away and leave the room. Dog won't try it again, but they'll think about it.... let them decide if they want that piece of meat badly enough-- if you let the dog suffer long enough from the first experience, the dog won't try it again.  <br>  <br>  Every so often, I set my "can monster" back up just for sh*ts and giggles. Those tall dogs walk by the counter and really think hard--- the looks on their faces when a new dog tries to make the steal is priceless--- I swear they are all laughing with me! Now that we have tile floors on the entire main level, the noise is even louder and more funny.  <br>  <br>  Give that a shot--- if you do it right, it'll only take one time.|`|62d0a2d55e52807119de7c9274746d4aaa	He wants more attention.|`|00485bb3d9bcae7ceacb305f629580f6aa	You can put one of those mats down in front of the counter.  I think it's called a scat mat.  It gives them a little shock when they step up on it, so it teaches them to stay off.|`|7fa04e30379ac33addf8d2ff7c80ac6baa	my dog who is a boxer does that, when they do it and you catch it say NOOO and like a deep tone, and then the dog will feel ashamed and wont do it as much.  we still push things back to the very back of the counter just incase. for the answer below mine, DO NOT GIVE IT A TREAT!! then he will think he will get rewarded for grabbing food. Use common sense|`|AA11375879	say no, and then pull him down. if he doesn't listen, then ban him from the room. if that doesn't work, then light him on fire, and say "WHO WINS NOW *****!" <br>  <br>  yours truly, <br>  rufus the professional puppy trainer/ignitor|`|AA12375455	Don't hit, because then he'll just do it behind your back.

He might have been fed human food before you got him and thinks it is "his" food. Don't feed him any scraps or human food. When he jumps up proceed popping him but do it on the muzzel hard. It's harsh but it should work. If he contiuniues to do this I would begin searching for a professinal trainer <br>  What breed of dog is he?<br>  My lab has a tendencey to jump up and grab stuff also so whatever he grabs hit him with it. My grandmaw put some red hot pepper on what she chewed on. Try this.<br>  Put hot pepper on something before he grabs it. So, when he does it'll burn him and he'll learn whatever he gets from up there he'll get burnt.<br>  Good Luck and hope this helps!|`|5ce99e67e4974d9172452beadab13ff4aa	I think it sounds mean, but I have a friend that teaches obedience classes that put mouse traps on her dinner table to teach her dog to stay off of it.  She swears by that method and I know wouldn't do anything that would permanently hurt her dogs.|`|8447fcf0b2d155f31848c7c8f78ba61faa	My golden did exactly the same thing when he was a puppy and he even does it every now and then now.  What we did to stop it is we put cookie sheets on the counters so they were just hanging of the end.  Then we put a few spoons on top of the cookie sheets.  Then whenever he jumped on the counter he would knock down the cookie sheets and they would make a load clattering noise.  It didn't hurt him but it taught him that jumping on the counter equals a unpleasant loud noise and it worked!!  Good Luck!!
4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Cats are the most conservative of animals in the animal world.  Believe me, they have no desire to "see" the outside.  They might enjoy exploring the outside world on their own and you are right in having them as indoor cats.<br>  <br>  Don't put your money in an expensive stroller for them.  Buy some window ledges they can lie on and look outside.  Put a bird feeder near the window.

DTOX0yPzaa	You should do your research very carefully! Everyone is going to have their opinion but that does not mean it is the right food for your dog. I just lost my seven year old German Shephard to cancer and that is when I went searching for the cause. I came across a website on the internet that shocked me into disbelief that I probably had poisoned my dog to death and didn't even know it. Most dog foods are loaded with hidden poisons and other obsenities I still have a hard time grasping. I am going to give you the website address so you can read this report and learn what is really in commercial dog foods and you can make an educated decision like I did on which dog food to buy!

I find that their weight gain and coat were excellent. It has no fillers or bi-products and the waste they leave behind is less. I would never feed and food that would be sold in a grocery store or Walmart. The money you will pay for a bag of that stuff equals out to the same amount of a bag of the good stuff. You will feed double of the store brand compared to just feeding the right stuff. The dog will just be alot healthier. Just think of it this way.

If you look at the ingredients and see corn or by products (ground up left overs from the animal) then I would skip it. <br>  <br>  I use Taste of the Wild for two of my dogs, a smooth coated collie and a springer spaniel, and they do great on it. They really like the taste, I find I feed less, their coats are shiny, and the ingredients are great. <br>  <br>  I use Cannidae for my senior dog since taste of the wild does not have a senior formula. I think this is a great dog food. He is a husky/border collie mix and for most of his life the vet has said that he was about ten pounds overweight (on an inferior food). When we switched to Cannidae he lost weight, has a shinier coat, eats better, and over all seems to do great on it. <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend either of these brands. I have heard that Merrick is also great but can sometimes give dogs gas. Innova is also good as is Wellness (although where I live it is $20 more than the Cannidae and Taste of the Wild). <br>  <br>  Here are some websites of the dog food brands.

jLM4Yo32aa	Well its an animal, so you can force them, so just put two different genders in one tank, and it will make progress, thats how most breeding is done. You can put any even number, but there always has to be the same amount of Females and Males. It happens when they want to, you cannot force it.

d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	An ear cleaner designed for pets is the best thing to use.  The only way to determine why her ears are bothering her is to have her evaluated by a doctor.  They can take samples of any debris in her ears & examine it under a microscope, looking for bacteria, yeast, or mites.  There's no reason to treat for mites if none are present.<br>  <br>  The following site as good step-by-step instructions as to how to clean her ears:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2054282_clean-cats-ears.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2054282_clean-ca...</a>|`|AA10091923	mostly sunny-<br>  i use a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and clean the outside and inside of the ear.  you may need to use more than one if the ear is dirty.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)  great question|`|ZBllS2Sdaa	I try to find natural ways to treat myself and my cats.

EUImQeLkaa	I know its hard to let go of pets. I think you should just wait a while before getting a new one. I know collie was a good hamster. (even though she bit me). I'd recommend savin up some money for the hamster and some of the stuff you'll need for it. That way YOU'LL be the one buyin it, so ur mom will let u get it!!! :D|`|0f22d0c7c585cf93dd64ae8c5ca1858aaa	Unless you didn't take care of it, I think you don't have a case, otherwise, save your money and offer to buy it yourself. Or offer to work off the cost by doing chores around the house. When a parent generally says, "I'll think about it" it is just a polite way to shut you up without her really doing anything about it in the hopes that you'll forget. I know. I got a lot of that when I was a kid.|`|AUkSCqoQaa	bring your dead hamster back in the house, and begin too play with it.Mom will then get the picture|`|Pk3HAZPFaa	keep reminding her about how nice your old one is,and how you would really like another to help.tell her that you guys where best friends, and you will make this hampsters life the best.tell her you will be responsible for it.and if you can,tell her you'll pay for it.good luck!<br>  p.s.i know how you feel.so many of my hamsters died.the most reacent one is almost a year ago.his name was marshmellow.he had all this nicknamesi loved him so much|`|f950303685516939f363dacb59949fb6aa	Ask her if she had ever had a pet that had died and if she wanted to get another one and if she says yes, then tell her that is how you feel!! Good luck and sorry about your hamster.|`|StV5Lfskaa	Offer to do something to earn the money and buy the hamster and supplies yourself, like mowing lawns or running errands for people, or somesuch. This may help.<br>  <br>  Also, it would be a good idea to let your mother know how you're feeling about the matter. She may be more understanding, if she knows how you're feeling.
d30s8wq8aa	I am not going to lay into you for irresponsible breeding.  However, I would say that this breeding is not a good pair.  Having such a large male bred to the small female grants a very large possibility of dystocia.  The puppies could easily have very large heads of their fathers (most musculoskeletal characteristics come from the father) which would get stuck in the pelvic canal during birth.  This would mean an emergency C section for your female and a very high cost for you.  This also means a risk of death to all puppies as well as your female.  <br>  <br>  Weigh your options wisely and discuss the breeding with a highly trained and recognized AKC rottweiler breeder, preferably one that shows his/her dogs.|`|p7swtBYzaa	If you that, you are not only dumb as a stump, you are endangering your female's life.<br>  Since you know nothing about breeding, why are you even thinking about doing something as dangerous as that - the heads of the pups will likely be too big to pass through the female's birth canal - dead puppies and a dead female - what a horrible idea.<br>  Forget it, get the poor thing spayed and the male neutered.<br>  You might consider having yourself --- never mind.|`|Bw18seFqaa	no, they wont be good looking.. they will just look awful and akward..  huge heads on small bodies.<br>  <br>  Spay and neuter.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	Who Knows.<br>  <br>  Your breeder mentor should be able to tell you that.

w1lh1INHaa	If you can't find a vet that will work out payment arrangements with you, call a local shelter or branch of the SPCA and simply say, "I'm unemployed right now and need some vet help." <br>  <br>  There could be a number of issues that go along with those symptoms, to worms to bladder/uti issues to things more serious.<br>  <br>  Worms are hard to check for, but they can also cause the same symptoms.  Roundworms will usually mean a puffy, distended belly.  Tapeworms can do the same, but usually they mean weight loss.  Worms require a de-worming treatment, and you can get a general dewormer such as Drontal at the ped med sites and some pet stores.  Do NOT use a dewormer from Walmarts or made by Hartz.<br>  <br>  Check for a bladder/urinary issue by feeling and gently squeezing the underbelly near the back end.  If it feels puffy and/or your cat lets you know it is uncomfortable, you probably have bladder/uti issues.  Most of these can be handled with a series of antibiotics, however there are some home remedies and have included links.  Freshly squeezed cranberry juice (not the Ocean Spray kind with sugars) or cranberry tabs, Apple Cider Vinegar, and/or Baking Soda can frequently offer relief.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.earthclinic.com/Pets/cystitis..." rel="nofollow">http://www.earthclinic.com/Pets/cystitis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.natural-pet-care.com/natural-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-pet-care.com/natural-...</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?What-Are-the-R..." rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?What-Are-the-R...</a><br>  <br>  Sometimes a little maalox or other antacid will help, but, personally, I wouldn't want to try it with a kitten.  I have, however, included a link regarding OTC human antacids and possiible side effects in cats.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=0+1303+1470&aid=1433" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  Frequently, a little burned toast (charred) will help a tummy upset.  You can smear a little butter for palatablility, or scrape some of the burned sections into into the food you are giving him.<br>  <br>  Double check the baby food you are using to make sure there is no, none, nada, zero onion or onion powder.  Onion can cause anemia in cats, period, and a cat that is having eating problems can suffer more.  Also, made sure it is a 80-100% meat, as some vegetables can make stomach upsets worse and are not easily digested.  As for meat, stick to chicken or turkey, as beef or lamb is too rich for a cat with tummy or digestive upsets.<br>  <br>  Frequently a little milk or tuna juice will help get both nutrients and fluids into a cat.  You can also use a little raw or lightly cooked egg yolk (No whites whatsoever) -- I've used it with the burned toast/charcoal, milk and tuna to help settle a tummy.<br>  <br>  However, there are a myriad of things that could be the issue and really need to eye of a vet to be able to identify.  <br>  <br>  As for the cloudy spot, he is a little young for cataracts, but it could be an indication of a nutritional problem.  <br>  <br>  I once again urge to try and find a vet and a way to pay for it.  I have found there is usually a way to find the money, even if it means eating dry cereal for a month.  So, please do what you can to get your cat seen to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  I fully understand financial restraints right now and I am not immune to the high cost of vet bills.  I have no quarrel with your inability to afford vet treatments right now. I also understand and appreciate your desire to help your cat, and I, for one, have no problem with you seeking advice on YA.  Personally, I have found a wealth of information from people at YA that have added to my knowledge.  I would, however, be remiss if I did not urge you to see a vet.<br>  <br>  ADDED 2:  Yay!  The color is probably a result of the baby food, as blood actually in the stool, instead of around, looks black and tarry.   Roundworms frequently are the cause of constipation, and what digested matter can get around the blockage looks like diarrhea.  Blood in stool is also from this kind of constipation.  I just went through this with an older cat.  Get to the pet store tomorrow and get him a deworming treatment and a couple of cans of easy to digest, high protein cat food to help him get back on his feet, and as a treat for being such a brave little fellow.  Your deworming treatment should be over a two-week period with one pill, and another two weeks later -- no sooner ;no later.  Pills are dosed by size/weight of cat, so you will probably only need one pill each dose.|`|inST4SlAaa	people need to stop picking on you for asking this question.  this does not make you a bad pet owner, they need to back off!!!  you obviously care.  you are trying everything you know and now want others to give you suggestions.  since it has already been five days i think you need to take him to the vet because she can not live that much longer with out food and water.  it sounds like there is a blockage in her digestive track.  this is very serious.  only a vet can tell with x rays and with barium which helps show blockages that do not normally show up on a x ray.  <br>  at least for tonight keep giving her water, do not worry aboutfood, she needs water more.  then tommorrow you can call the vet which i think is best<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  a farmers store where they buy supplies for goats, sheep, cows, etc. (farm and fletet) sell antibiotics.  you could try that in case their is an infection but that is taking a huge risk because she might not have the time to spare and if it is a blockage and not an infection then she could die even sooner.  i feel sorry for you and i do not judge you.  all pet owners make mistakes and  learn from them.  if people do not admit them then they are not being truthful with themselves<br>  <br>  im glad to hear she pooped.  that is a very good sign.  i do not have much money like you and cant afford 200 or 300 dollar vet bills either so do not feel bad.  we are still loving pet owners.  keep searching for answers.  i think she will be just fine!!|`|GSkA8wh9aa	The kitten is dying.<br>  When you adopted it you made it your responsibility to care for it.

Don't be so ignorant and take your very sick kitten to the vet unless you don't care that it may die because your broke that's very selfish. Cats can't talk and it's your responsibility to take notice if your cat exhibits any strange behavior at all and take them to the vet ASAP if so.

Everyone has bills that's not an excuse.|`|AaUxhSjWaa	sounds like the cat prolly doesnt have his shots does he? when u say u cant afford a vet, u mean like any cost at all or just a high price? if you can pay an affordable amount,try taking him to a vet thats in a shelter or a humane society by you,normally they are much cheaper than regular vets. perhaps the food you are giving him is not doing to well in his tummy...when cats get to about 3 months, they need to be given solid foods....try kitten kaboodle..thats what i have given all my cats since they were about 2-3 months and they are fine. if he isnt eatingmuch, chances are he wont be pooping cause he has nothing to poop out! its ok that he doesntclean his coat everyday...that is normal because when they eat or poo is mostly when they clean thier coats and if he isnt eating...maybe he feels no need to clean. maybe u can call any non-profit animal organizations around your area and ask if they know any vets or anything who willhelp and willhelp with the costs. im not gonna sugar coat it,it does seem as if somethingis wrong with him but i cant quite tell u cause im not a vet just yet. so,just try mysuggestions....email me if u need more advice or something. good luck dear.
gBycDD9Baa	any size mother or father can "throw"  any size puppies, most breeders will breed a smaller male to a larger female to prevent  larger puppies and to increase the chances of a complication with preg. and birth|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	A combination of both..

You cannot breed a tiny dog to a large dog to get medium dogs, you will get large and tiny dogs.|`|TJNJB01Eaa	It is a combination of both, I sure hope that you didn't breed them...

Luckily we had no complication and smooth delivery. She had four puppies, and every single one of them are male, and every single one came out looking exactly like the father. So it seems to me that since he was so much larger, that his genes took over. Hope that was some help.

En bajo número, este ácaro es parte de la flora normal de la piel del perro y no causa enfermedad clínica. Los ácaros son transmitidos de la madre al cachorro durante la lactancia en las primeras 72 horas después del nacimiento. Los ácaros cumplen su ciclo de vida completo sobre el hospedador y no se considera una enfermedad contagiosa. La patogénesis de la demodicosis es compleja y no esta completamente dilucidada, aunque hay considerable evidencia de que existe una predisposición hereditaria. La inmunosupresión, natural o iatrogénica, puede precipitar la enfermedad en algunos casos.

Therefore both parents need to carry the recessive trait.  Now blue to blue crosses CAN be bad and create pups with color dilution alopecia (meaning they lose hair especially the blue hair).  So you can breed a blue to another dog that carries the blue gene (one parent was blue and that is only a 50% chance of blue).  If the dog has blue, then you have a 50% chance of having blue offspring.<br>  <br>  If you have two dogs from blue parents that aren't blue and they carry blue, then they have a 25% chance of having blue.  Blue comes from black so if you don't have black, you can't have blue.  For example, I bred a black and tan to a black and white.  The had a fawn pup.  While that fawn pup could carry blue, if she were bred to a fawn, you probably wouldn't see blue or chocolate.  So if you want to produce a blue and you can't get one, buy a black dog (solid black, black and tan, black and white) and breed it to a blue if you can find one to breed to.  Then keep one or more pups with black in them and breed to a different blue dog and you should have blue.  Annoying that it takes two generations but if you don't have the recessive trait, you have to get it somehow.|`|bad5b26078d1c601c3421ba38254d7e7aa	its illegal to cross-breed chihuahuas,<br>  e.x. a long haired and a shorted haired...<br>  <br>  well, i'm not too sure if i got your question right, but just a heads up|`|d5ed380d25ddd8cbe2090db6d16c6c52aa	contact --  parrotsandpaws@yahoo.com,<br>  She is pretty well knowledgeable with Chihuahuas along with other dogs and animals.<br>  If nothing else she can steer you the right way.
ef6e5dd5822e86ecc52395794189322caa	Hola mira para conseguir chihuahuas azules como tu los llamas,que en realidad en su estandar figura y se denomuna gris plata,la primera condicion es que algunos de los perros a cruzarse debe ser de ese color,pero tambien tendrias que hacer un estudio de sus pedigrees,como bien te dicen aqui arriba hay que estudiar un poco su ascendencia para lograr cachorros de calidad y saber cuales fueron los resultados de sus progienes y colaterales,la realidad es que nunca se debe criar por color,si bien en los chihuahuas todos los colores estan permitidos incluidos los pintos y atigrados,siempre es preferible no mezclar colores,para no encontrarnos con sorpresas,pues en genetica principalmente en los colores intervienen muchos pares de genes que son extremadamente dificiles de manejar,de ahi que no se debe criar por color,esto dicho a grandes rasgos,ahora bien,para conseguir la mayor cantidad de cahorros azules,o gris plata,en la cruza no deben intervenir,ni los marrones ni los rubios o casta?os que dicho sea de paso son los que prefiere su estandar en colores netos,ni tampoco debe intervenir en la cruza el atigrado,{en el caso de los atigrados siempre siempre se deben cruzar ejemplares atigraos ya que en los estandares siempre figuran como una variedad distinta}ya que  los colores que te mencione son los llamados recesivos y a pesar de ello pueden aparecer en la camada,bueno criar no es tan facil como la gente supone,hablo de criar con calidad,asi que te recomendare que utilizes los grises plata,*****  y ***** fuego como pide su estandar pues son genes dominantes y asi aumentar las posibilidades de obtener cachorros azules,pues si los cruzas con los colores recesivos como te mencione existe la posibilidad que que como son camadas peque?as aveces de hasta un solo cachorro y dependiendo de sus ancestros ese cahorro sea de un color recesivo.buscar dos azules seria la mejor opcion. Espero no haberte complicado demasiado|`|ccd7a8df72349775a4589cc4f509e5c0aa	Si logras alguno me avisas para comprarte uno|`|011025cc23dbdb0248758e7c4ae607f1aa	No creo que te salga una camada entera de chihuahuas azules (no sabía que había de ese color). <br>  Pero para conseguir un color determinado en una camada de perros lo más seguro es que ambos padres sean de ese color, también podés cruzar a padres portadores del gen de ese color (se puede conocer por medio de un estudio genético o en forma menos segura estudiando el pedigree de los padres para ver los colores de sus ancestros).<br>  Existe la posibilidad que aunque ambos padres sean azules no te salgan azules o te nazca solo uno, y la mayoría te salga del color dominante que puede ser el *****.|`|15a044a5cea4dd4eea17f19d25c0e3a2aa	Ni idea!<br>  Pero tan pronto los tengas, me avisas q t lo compraré.|`|22ce8e0f7a489a92cd1c218341bd6f77aa	facil! <br>  en el supermercado venden una pintura para bizcochos y dulces, conforme vayan naciendo le untas unas cuantas gotas del color que quieras<br>  puedes hacerlos de diferentes sabores tambien!<br>  a mi me gustaria uno de pi?a<br>  avisame !|`|bbcab637d840974186b9017ba2df9e28aa	Hola Carlitos:<br>     Siempre que hay una pregunta acerca del estandar de una raza, intento entrar para ver las barbaridades que algunos responden, "pero en realidad la mayor parte de las ocasiones lo hago por que sé que Miriam m. siempre las responde" Soy fan de sus respuestas, soy Médico Veterinario y me da gusto saber que hay personas que saben perfectamente de lo que hablan, me ense?an muchas cosas (que muchas personas piensan que por ser MVZ eres experto en razas de perros con todo y sus estándares técnicos y no es verdad, en cuanto a medicina si, pero al resto no todos) que desconozco, un saludo a Miriamcita, a Aeltag, a Er, Mephisto, a Abrilgpe, (perdón si omito alguno) que son superbuenos en lo que responden.

Take him by the collar and  tell him to stay with you (or use what ever word he understands)  take him out front with you and while holding his collar say that command over & over. You should be able to judge him before you get to the street on whether he will dart off or not. Then let go of his collar and keep saying stay with me over again and again and use a stern voice so he knows you are serious. Be sure to bring a treat or his favorite ball with you just in case he goes farther then your comfortable with or does not come to you when called. If he passes the test be sure to let him know how good he was when you return inside.|`|306a5da7a4bbe9184cd02f0c766e26b8aa	A recall is not reliable unless he will come even if there is a dog walking by or a rabbit runs across the yard.<br>  <br>  It can take a very long time to get to the point where your recall is totally reliable.<br>  <br>  I HATE it when strange dogs come running at us when I am walking my dogs!

If yours runs up to another dog and they fight, you can be sued (and they will win if theirs was onlead) and then your dog could be put down.<br>  <br>  I have been teaching obedience classes for 25 years and my dogs are ALL onlead, why do you think yours shouldn't be?

Those only work if the dog wants the treat or toy more than he wants to do something else. That is the fundamental problem with the current fad of "bribe doggy to listen." <br>  <br>  You have to MAKE him come even when he doesn't want to - and give him a very good reason not to disobey you.<br>  <br>  Would you ALWAYS obey the speed limits if there was no risk of a ticket?? If you wouldn't get arrested, would you grow pot in the backyard if it made a lot of money for you?<br>  <br>  Using treats is silly because one day you will start to forget the treats or not have them or something, and the next time you call her, she'll remember not getting the treat and figure "why bother?" And what happens the day the doggy decides it is more fun to chase the rabbit than come for the treat?<br>  <br>  Clickers are just flat stupid - they are for people who are too dumb to figure out how to quickly say "GOOD DOG" in a happy, excited voice.<br>  <br>  You always have your hands and your voice. Use them<br>  <br>  By the way, many women in particular, but men do it too, have a real problem with voice control, When they get upset or frustrated, their voice go UP. The dog ignores them. In the pack, the boss dog or alpa uses deep tones (rumble in the chest, growl etc) to express displeasure and get compliance from the dogs lower in the pecking order. A dog making a high pitched sound (yapping, yelping etc) is not only not going to get compliance as they are perceived as ineffectual and the not-Alpha, not-the-boss but that it is giving an invitation to play.<br>  <br>  On Equipment:<br>  <br>  Go get a slip/choke. We are talking a strong dog here. Get a 6 ft leash - no more no less.<br>  <br>  I HATE those "gentle leader" things. First, they are one good way to give your dog a case of cervical whiplash. Second, the minute you take it off the dog KNOWS that you have no means of making them obey. Third, , teaching 'come' or anything where the dog is not at your side is impossibleThey are a shortcut to get temporary - and I do mean temporary  - control while walking for people too dumb or too lazy to teach their dog proper manners. I spend a lot of time making house to calls to teach puppy to come , sit, stay, down and heel after the owners paid money for 'obedience classes' with someone for 'training' with those head collar things. <br>  <br>  There is NO REASON to use a pinch collar except as an absolute last ditch resort. They are popular with the public because they work -  they work because they are SEVERE!<br>  <br>  Under the AKC rules it is ILLEGAL to even walk a dog about on the show grounds using a headhalter or funky martingale or pinch collar - and the reason is that the dog is fundementally OUT OF CONTROL and has no idea of how to behave or obey if they have to be moved about by those gadgets.<br>  <br>  In AKC obedience competitions there are only TWO collars permitted:  a flat buckle collar and a slip/choke chain choice of 95% of competitive obedience people.)<br>  <br>  Maybe those who spend the time training and competing their performance dogs know more than the neighbor  or the "trainer" at Petsmart who never sets foot in a competition ring to prove their training skills  against others. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are excerpts from the material I give clients:<br>  <br>  Teaching Come: <br>  <br>  Step 1 Walking next to you nicely<br>  <br>   Hook the leash on the dog's slip collar (see below on how to fit it and why the flat buckle collar is not going to work.). Get the dog on your left side. Hold the end of the leash in your right hand. With your left hand, take up the leash so there is some slack between your hand and the dog's collar - maybe a loop of 6-8 inches on each side.   Learn to use it. You SNAP the collar - NEVER pull or drag. It is a fast jerk/release. Put it on your wrist and have someone try pulling and then snapping on you. You do it to someone else. When it feels like a slight whack or bump when the leash is snapped you have the idea. I always put the slip collar on my student's arm to show them the difference in the movement. Gets the point across real fast. Do NOT keep a steady pull on the collar - snap.release.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Walk off.   Make her stay even with your leg and not pulling forward, dragging behind or leaping sideways.<br>  <br>  Step 2 Starting Come<br>  <br>  Put the leash and collar using a slip collar (see below for how to fit it and put it on) on the dog. Have the leash in front of you and not behind you over the hips. Walk off with her at your side in heel position. Go along for a distance - say 20-40 feet - and then you loosen the lead and run backwards saying "come, come" making the dog turn and come to you. Try to keep going about 15-20 feet in reverse. Make her come all the way to you by gathering in the leash. Lots of praise - pets hugs tummy rubs and voice - NOT treats. (She'll love this! She gets to chase you.)<br>  <br>  Now as you go backwards, lots of excitement in your voice as you encourage her to come, whoop and be silly. (You will keep up the happy excitement every single time she is moving under her own steam - even using the long line as set out below. At the longer distances with the long line, I'll drop to my knees as they move towards me and hold out my arms and let them pile into my lap and we roll about if they like. You won't always have to act that silly - just long enough for her to think 'come' is a great thing and always to be done and never optional.) <br>  <br>  Step 3 Coming at a distance<br>  <br>  Move on to the long line.<br>  <br>  Go to the hardware store. Get 3 lengths of ? inch to 3/8 inch soft nylon line – 20 foot, 50 foot and 100 foot. Get 3 snaps. Tie the snaps on one end and make a loop handle on the other.<br>  <br>  Start with the 20 foot line. Use a CHAIN slip collar that is fitted so there is 3 1/2 - 4 fingers of space between the dog’s neck and the collar. Put the collar on so the ring that slides comes across the back of her neck and directly at you. With a flat buckle collar, you are in a pulling match that you are going to lose with about any dog over 15-20 lbs. Either you can't move the dog effectively or they jerk the leash out of your hands.<br>  <br>  Note: use the CHAIN slip collar because they learn to listen for the rattle of the collar and adjust their behavior before you have to correct them. Nylon slip collars just simply do not work 1/4 as well.<br>  <br>  Hook the line on her collar. Hopefully she knows sit and wait. If not, teach it to her. If she does know sit and wait, put her in a sit, step back 2 or 3 steps and call her. If she doesn’t come, haul her in with the line.<br>  <br>  When she comes over a distance of 5-6 feet, move back to 10-12 feet and call her.<br>  <br>  Repeat this process until she is working on the 100 foot line.<br>  <br>  You can also take her out on the long line and when she is happily distracted, call her and make her come.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS ALWAYS use the dog's name " Muffy - come" The name gets their attention that you mean them and you are not just talking to someone and the word that is the command is being used in conversation. Name first - then command.<br>  <br>  NEVER TAKE HER OUTSIDE WITHOUT A LEASH (6 ft) OR ONE OF THE LONG LINES. NEVER TURN HER LOOSE OFF LEAD AND CALL HER UNTIL SHE COMES 100% OF THE TIME ON THE 100 FOOT LINE WITH ALL KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS, IE: OTHER DOGS, KIDS PLAYING, TOYS BEING THROWN IN HER PATH AS SHE COMES, ETC.<br>  <br>  Once she is 100% on the long line, start dropping it and moving a bit further back but be sure you can cover the distance to pounce on the line.  Later you can start shortening the long line a little at a time. One day it can be as little as 12-18". The dog doesn't measure the line - it just knows it can feel that lightweight snap on its collar and you have always been able to get it if it ignores you.<br>  <br>  When you say “come” and she doesn’t, haul her backside into you using the line repeating “come”, “come”. Use a STERN DEEP voice that brooks no argument about the matter if the dog already knows the command 'come' and is choosing to disobey.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do , don't let your voice slide upwards into high tones unless you are giving praise. When you give a command, used an authoritative voice and sound like you mean it - and not "would you please 'come'-if you happen to feel like it of course."<br>  <br>  <br>  When she gets to you – willingly or unwillingly, praise and pet and make a big fuss and tell her that she is such a good girl.<br>  <br>  Never ever ever call a dog to you to punish or correct them once they get to you. The dog needs to understand that ignoring you and not coming makes you growl at them (the stern voice insisting they obey) just like the boss dog would do; but getting to you (no matter whether voluntarily or involuntary) is a good thing and gets rewarded.|`|AA11789076	not long

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...Common odours that are effective deterrents for cats are:<br>  <br>  Citronella works best for cats as well as citrus scents such as orange or lemon (primarily towards cats), cayenne pepper, coffee grounds, pipe tobacco, lavender oil, lemon grass oil, citronella oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, and mustard oil.<br>  <br>  "Havahart's Cat Repellent" uses capsaicin pepper and oil of mustard as its active ingredients. It repels by both taste and odor, has a lemon scent.<br>  <br>  Every animal responds differently to each of these. Some will not be phased by them and others will be quite revolting.<br>  <br>  For training purposes they are applied on items that are to encourage avoidance behaviours and not for use with a squirt bottle as they could harm the eyes or respiratory system. Test each substance and observe to see which works as a deterrent so that accidental injestion does not occur as some could then be fatal.<br>  <br>  Coleus plants can be effective, but every cat responds differently so it is uncertain without experimenting.<br>  <br>  Many people believe mothballs work, however they are considered toxic and should NOT be used. Here's more information on this:<br>  <a href="http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/ope/enotes/showarticle.cfm?id=89" rel="nofollow">http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/ope/enotes/showa...</a> <br>  MOTHBALLS are toxic to cats which contains the ingredient Naphthalene. Mothballs are approximately twice as toxic as paradichlorobenzene, and cats are especially sensitive to naphthalene. Signs of ingestion of naphthalene mothballs include emesis, weakness, lethargy, brown-colored mucous membranes and collapses. Paradichlorobenzene mothballs may cause GI upset, ataxia, disorientation, and depression. Elevations in liver serum biochemical values may occur within 72 hours of indigestion.|`|3c48d2df76adc73e60ca410c55110c16aa	a fast moving chevy|`|76a5270cf5ed08738f1456edfa7107bfaa	There is a product you can get from the vets its called pissoff, it not only takes the cat ordour away but also makes the area unattractive for the cat.

I would recommend a hydrosol because and animals olfactory is a lot more sensitive then a humans so hydrosol are a lot better. You can maybe find a hydrosol at a health food store or find an aromatherapy store or somewhere in you area that sells essential oils.

A95qI5TGaa	Because turtles eat meat, most any fish you put in there will be at least attacked by the turtle.  Worse, if the fish IS aggressive, you then have two stressed animals in one tank, and a larger fish in with 4 turtles means alot dirtier water. more filtering needed.  Fish's size doesn't matter, as a turtle will possibly 'play' with his tank mate by nibbling off fins, causing pain and eventually death to the fish.  If not this, it is reversed and the fish will toss the turtles around.  <br>  <br>  However - there are cases where, with a rocky set-up as terrain, some fish are able to hide in the rocks and survive.  Some of these type of fish are convict cichlid and various Africans.  However, just because they can survive doesn't mean it's any better for them.  It is best to just not put in fish without expecting them to be turtle food.  If you want fish, buy a second tank, and more than likely you will have a nicer time both cleaning the tanks and watching the animals NOT fighting for food or survival.|`|e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	I tried putting my turtles with my goldfish together and they were douple there size and they still started eating them up from the back, I was actually shocked, now they have there own home in their own tanks<br>  <br>  here are some links about keeping water turtles<br>  <a href="http://www.essaydepot.com/essayme/848" rel="nofollow">http://www.essaydepot.com/essayme/848</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ahc.umn.edu/rar/MNAALAS/H2Otrtl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahc.umn.edu/rar/MNAALAS/H2Otr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lib.duke.edu/bes/reptiles/freshwater_turtles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.duke.edu/bes/reptiles/fre...</a>|`|wVLq7xfaaa	law of battle of the fittest. well, one of the foods eaten by turtles are meat. (includes fishes). thus, there is an indirect proportion or relationship if you would be placing fishes and turtles together. even if the fish would be aggressive enough, it would still be some meat for the turtles. <br>  <br>  better to keep the fishes and turtles in separate tanks. =) <br>  <br>  enjoy|`|QS7j8Lumaa	turtles will eat any fish you put in there.
PBBdapCWaa	The minimum amount I would suggest would be about 160-170 watts, or 3 watts per gallon.

Breeders, rescues, and shelters require an ADULT to purchase/adopt from them.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, there would be way too many kids who think it's ''cool'' to bring home a pet without parental permission, which just results in the pet becoming homeless.<br>  <br>  I can understand your parents wanting you to purchase the cat, but they will have to be the ones on any paperwork that needs to be filled out.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Go to the pound and get a cat that will otherwise be put to sleep by gassing it.|`|q6uyloYdaa	I would suggest trying to adopt. Don't go to a breeder when so many cats get put down every day. Most animal shelters won't let you adopt on your own because of your age, but you can go on craigslist.org and look at the pets on there. Most of them are pets people have to get rid of and are usually cheap or free. I'm sure someone on there would give/sell you a cat as long as they get your parents' permission first.
JfAZttgcaa	Too late now...but for the future or anyone reading this post...<br>  <br>  If your cat (or dog)'s nail is bleeding from being ripped out, or from trimming too close and cutting into the quick (the pinkish/red tissue in the nail) you can stop the bleeding by using a styptic powder. Most vet clinics, pet stores, and even walmart sometimes carries this.<br>  <br>  You dip the nail into some powder (I pour a bit into the lid to do this without spilling) and it will stop the bleeding immediately.<br>  <br>  I also used this on the dog's ear when the cat ate it... rofl. (only a chunk)<br>  <br>  Without treatment, small cuts or the quick of the nail should stop bleeding within 5 minutes. If you think you have a more serious injury, please don't hesitate to call a vet as soon as possible1 :)|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Try bathing it in warm salt water, to soothe and prevent infection until you can get to a vet.
Rw7gi86Naa	Is his litterbox in a really cold place? If anything about the litter box or its location is displeasing to him, it can cause him to want to go somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Litter problems:<br>  There are so many possible reasons for a cat to stop using the litter box that it's hard to cover them all. The first reason you need to rule out is a bladder/urinary tract infection, or constipation. You will need to take kitty to the vet to get checked out. Has the litter box been cleaned properly? Have you moved it to a different location? Have you recently changed anything such as brand of litter, litter box or food? Have you used any new disinfectants in the box? Has someone new come into your house that s/he didn't seem to like? Any new pets? Even new carpets or furniture can cause this. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box.

e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Well some pet stores sell those cat collars that seperate instantly if they get too tight!<br>  <br>  But I don't trust them so I took the collar off my cat!! And she is indoors anyways so she doesn't need one!|`|Y3d6wxsCaa	Yeah something similar happened to my cat. She got it stuck in her mouth and was really freaking out and it took awhile to get it off, but there was no blood. She was kind of choking on it.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Cat collars are not ''dangerous''. It sounds like your cat's collar wasn't sized appropriately. You should be able to put two fingers between the collar & your cat's neck.<br>  <br>  If your cat can get the collar stuck in their mouth, or a paw stuck in the collar....it's too loose.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that you had such a bad incident, and I'm glad your cat is going to be OK.<br>  <br>  Both of my indoor-only cats wear collars with ID tags. Just because they don't go outside, doesn't mean they shouldn't be prepared, just in case.<br>  <br>  Never had an issue with them, and I check the tightness/looseness daily to make sure it's ''just right''.<br>  <br>  I plan on microchipping them in the near future, though.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Could the collar have been on a tad too loose? I've only ever known this to happen on looser collars. Could the collar maybe have been defective? I feel like the collar should have broken if it were under that kind of stress.<br>  <br>  My cats always wear collars with tags, no matter what, and they're indoor cats. I feel this is necessary because they've both gotten out a few times before, and we only found them because the people who got to them saw that the cats had tags.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry this happened to your kitten. I do hope that you consider putting collars on your cats again, but perhaps a different company.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Your collar probably wasn't tight enough.  The collar should be snug so that you can only fit one finger in there.  If you can fit any more in, it is too loose and is dangerous.<br>  <br>  An outside cat can get its collar stuck in a tree and get trapped there for days until it starves if its collar is too loose.  Loose collars are dangerous, collars are not.
00X4m7vjaa	herpes!!! peroxide wont hurt the cat. it is tested on animals! you could try it|`|Nt7exGYAaa	If this is a sore it could be easily infected so it needs to be kept clean. <br>  <br>  As the kitten is moving its had around it's definitely irritating him.<br>  <br>  Check to see if there's any puss in it or around it or if there's a sign of a bite or scratch. If has has a bad odour that's a sign it needs to see a vet.<br>  <br>  It's best to use only products designed for cats as anything else could be too strong and the skin tissue damaged. You can buy ear cleaning solutions from pet stores/supermarkets that are relatively cheap and they last a long time.<br>  <br>  You could also  use warm water or warm olive oil and a soft cloth or cotton ball.<br>  <br>  NEVER use cotton tips in their ears as one wrong movement from the cat could cause the tip to penetrate the ear canal.<br>  <br>  The cat may object to this so always talk calmy to it and reassure it, in need have a second person to hold it (scruffing is a good option) while you clean it out.<br>  <br>  If it still looks sore after a couple of days it may be worthwhile to contact the animal welfare instead of a vet as they're far cheaper.|`|Vq9VGxcraa	If its a rash and something topical, then peroxide should be fine. However, if its oozing puss and discharge, then you may want to take him to the vet. If it turns into an infection, it could cost you a lot more money to take care of.

w1lh1INHaa	Besides using biodegradable litter...I go one step further.  I used to use Feline Pine until I discovered Wood Stove pellets are the same thing.  It saves money and packaging (plastic bags).  I compost as much fecal matter as I can, and while I don't use it for the vegetable garden, it does wonders for the flowers and shrubbery.<br>  <br>  I make most of my own cat food (generally raw).  This saves on cans, cans, cans, and more cans.  In fact, 99% of my cans are cat food cans.  And then, out of the cat food cans, I made a passive solar heater (called a tin can or soda can heater...I don't drink soda but I'm gonna feed the cats...)  While there is an argument for dry food to save on packaging, dry food for cats is the cause of too many serious ailments in cats, urinary issues, diabetes, and kidney issues to name the most common.<br>  <br>  I use oxy to clean.  Hyperthyroidism and resp issues have been anecdotally linked to chemical cleansers, and many of them can be toxic to a cat.  Oxy -- good for cleaning, good for the cat odors and good for the environment. <br>  <br>  As a cat owner (had dogs and horses, but just cats now), I would be interested in natural food choices and home made diets (including BARF, Prey, etc.), particularly home-made foods.  It wasn't until I saw an episode of Mike Rowe's *Dirty Jobs* that it really hit home what went into most commercial cat food -- dying and diseased animals, hooves beaks, intestines, "renderings," the crap scraped off the slaughterhouse floor.  Recycling and using all of an animal is good, but better it be compost and not pet food.<br>  <br>  I  would also be interested in home and homeopathic treatments and remedies.  I have had excellent results with Apple Cider Vinegar, Metamucil, Baking Soda, Squash, Olive Oil, Flax Seed Oil...a whole range of in-the-pantry offerings for aiding health and treatment.  I understand vets want to make a living, but I know my vet would prefer people not running to his office with every little thing that can be handled at home...besides we're pretty rural out here and small animal vets are few and far between.<br>  <br>  Another area of interest to me is vaccinations, or rather, over-vaccinating.  There is a movement to do away with yearly rabies vaccinations and I fully support that.  I've seen a lot of information recently on the problems that vaccinations can cause in an effort to prevent a possible illness.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this is so choppy...I saw your question just as I was about to close down and I have a few cats tapping their paws waiting for me to turn the covers down.  I would be very interested in reading your newsletter, so please let me know the link.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Sounds like a fun and rewarding project.|`|6T3NcrB0aa	One thing we have done in going green is eliminating litter and the litter box.  We have been training our cat to use the toilet.  No more litter in landfills.  No more energy wasted in making litter, packaging it and transporting it.  There are lots of resources for this online and of the shelf products.  You can see our cat in action (still training) at the link below in the practical training section.
M7KT6NSCaa	slowly make the crate be fun for your dog! put treats in the back and have her go in but don't close the door, if she doesn't go in  then she will eventually and maybe she will wait for you to leave, once she is more comfy with the crate then put her in the crate for about 10 seconds and then let her out immediately and work your way up to however much time you need. but please make sure you don't have her in there too long please :)|`|XevKV6XOaa	Unfortunately because it's her first time in a crate, she's bound to be a nuisance and bark. What you can do which is recommended for agility dogs so they get used to their crate during trials, is to play crate games. Get her excited and play with her throwing her toys into the crate so she can retrieve them. Asking her to go to her crate and giving her food through the bars at the back of the crate to reward her for being in it without closing the door. That way she will associate the crate with being fun and being in it means your happy with her. Then eventually close the crate for a second, give her a treat and open the door again to resume playing. Eventually extending the amount of time that the door is closed. When you open the door always be happy and willing to play. Sometimes she may even get in her crate without being asked to get a reward which is the exact behaviour you want.  It may take time, but she will eventually learn to love her crate and she should stop barking. Never ever let her out if she is whining or barking, as you will just say that to get out she has to make noise which is not what you want. Only treat her when she is quiet and waiting and when you get to the door closing stage never open the door when she is making noise. Wait for her to be quiet, treat her, then open the door and throw a toy, get excited. Try looking up Crate Games by Susan Garrett. Maybe there might be a short video on you tube or something that can give you an idea of what im talking about. But that's better than just locking her up and waiting for her to be quiet. It means that she will see the crate as fun and not a bad place to be. In the end she will be a better dog because of it. Hope that helps. Let me know how you go if you do try it.
lFdWmDjGaa	Whay you should do is prove to your dad that you really wnt the cat with out begging. Parents hate it when you do that. Try typing a report about cats to show how much you know about them nd that your fully aware of the responsibility thay YOU will have, Make sure you make that clear :) it helps alot with my parents! Typing a report will show youer dad that you can get what you want in life by working for it and not just expecting it to happen! :) <br>  I hope you get the cat!|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	Tell him how lonely your cat is and that getting another cat would help your cat, also tell him how happy you would be by getting a cat and that you would love him forever and ever! I pulled out that card and I got a bunny rabbit right away ;)|`|lnMsWc1taa	Don't do it.<br>  <br>    Okay, this might work. Figure out a way to feed the cat outdoors until your cat and the new animal become best friends, then start letting teach's kitty in the house.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Uh if you get another cat, Your cat that you already have could get jealous of it and fight! or become very secluded!!!
Rw7gi86Naa	She needs some quiet time to calm down. Don't try to get her to come out; just be patient. Keep checking on her and talk to her in a sweet voice, maybe bring her treats. She will probably come out at night time. It will be ok.|`|inST4SlAaa	she will be fine just give her time.  try to coax her out with cat treats but she will be fine and still love you like she always has|`|dhqQ8kdsaa	I wrote the original question under my b.f.'s name...Thanx to those who responded., but my pinky is still in the bed room!  She still wont come out. She's hiding under the covers most of the time.  Last night, in the middle of the night, she went in her box and ate a little. I thought she would be alot better by today, but she's not. I don't know what to do. Im starting to get really scared and I'm thinking she will never come back to her old self!!  should I take her to the vet?  what would he do for her though?
Wn3LGHTvaa	Hydrogen peroxide is probably the best for cleaning a puncture wound (or any other). You could follow it with an antibiotic ointment.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	are your sure he cut her? sometimes its just alot of drool...but if he did. i wouldnt use peroside that stuff burns animals worse then people...some anti-bacteriol soapy wet cloth is just fine. and once it drys you can put triple antibiotic or neosporn on it. good luck|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	pad it with a warm damp cloth until it's clean, put on an antiseptic, I've tried to cover it and it DOESN'T work, keep her inside and away from the boy cat, wait until heals.<br>  <br>  p.s. do NOT  use peroxide, it will hurt very badly.
I68m0kCraa	LOL he wants his rump scratched!<br>  <br>  It's nothing medically relevant, pugs are just like that... a little bit excitable and most dogs like having their hindquarters scratched.<br>  <br>  I think there's some sort of back-to-the-wild thing about scent glands and wolves and stuff too but all it is really is that he wants a good ol' rub down!<br>  <br>  So the next time he does that, reach down and rub his legs and the top of his tail and I'm sure you'll get some delerious groans of delight and a spiny Pug. :)
dcWN4v6Jaa	I went to Petsmart and got one kitty for $80.00 (fee). Then I got some equipment which costed me around 300-400 dollars. I got him declawed surgery because he was scratching me too much for about 300 dollars.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Free if you know someone whose cat had kittens. Or at an animal shelter you can get one for not much more than the cost of shots and spaying/neutering. Yahoo please fix your stupid servers!|`|OlWtFTrgaa	I got my kitten at my animal shelter (neutered with shots) for 60 dollars.  <br>  It was 80 to declaw him. <br>  Litter, food, and other essentials can vary, depending on which end you want to go.  I go with a medium priced brand of all, and the cost has probably been around 200 and I have had him for a year.  <br>  Overall, not too bad at all :)|`|oVNwd5lGaa	We adopted a 6 week old kitten for $125 and he had all of his first shots & was already neutered.  His annual shots are around $70.  I have an automatic litterbox (he is inside) that cost a lot at first, but only $16.00 for the refills at PetSmart.  One refill lasts almost a month with him.. and his food is $10 a bag and lasts a month or more.|`|tatbIu54aa	Very cheap or even free if you rescue one!|`|D16vgGIJaa	craigslist.com always has free kittens
nFcl0BOsaa	If your son is in any way timid of the dog, that's going to be a problem. In the absence of confident leadership, a dog like that is all too happy to take charge. Every confrontation he wins sets him up to do it again. Having your son participate with Zeus in obedience classes may help. <br>  <br>  Another thing that comes to mind is getting Zeus in a condition where he needs something from your son. The easiest way to do that is through FOOD.  Get Zeus anywhere from 24-36 hours hungry before your son comes over, and have your son hand-feed him, use the kibble for obedience training, or both. The closer you can get to the upper limit of 36 hours the better, and it will not hurt your dog to do that periodically for training. This is only a start. You would want to keep Zeus dependent on your son for the duration of the visits:<br>  <br>  An article you might be interested in:<br>  <br>  <br>  "...Therefore, the individual who is having the most difficulty with the dog should become the main provider for everything the dog needs food, water, exercise, praise, affection, and all play activity. This person must be able to train the dog to obey basic obedience commands of sit, stay, come, and down. He will probably need a lot of help with the down command (which puts the animal in a submissive position) so he doesn't get bitten.<br>  <br>  All other family members must totally ignore the dog no play, food, or affection. The dog must look on that one person as its sole provider of everything.<br>  <br>  The dog must be rewarded for any signs of submissive behavior such as ears back, looking away (avoiding eye contact), rolling over, licking, crouching, or lowering the head when being reached for. Any dominant gestures that the dog will tolerate should be used frequently and the dog must be praised and given occasional food rewards for submitting. The dog must earn everything.<br>  <br>  Once a dog starts to respond, then counter-conditioning can be started, but this should only be done with a qualified behaviorist-trainer. Counter-conditioning includes working with a dog that doesn't like its feet or hindquarters handled; it is also referred to as desensitizing the dog to certain stimuli or conditions...<br>  <br>  Aggressive dogs can be retrained under the right circumstances. Keep in mind, however, before anyone starts a program to correct an aggressive dog, he must realize that the dog may never be trustworthy around other people or children and may bite if provoked. Owners should always be given the cold, hard facts: they should never feel guilty for having an aggressive dog euthanized, but they should also realize that, if they are likely to make the same mistakes with another dog, they should not get another dog..."<br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/aggres1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/aggres1.ht...</a>
bj1qKTYuaa	my dog used to do the same, even though he was spotlessly clean! id just try to take him to go to the toilet as much as i can...even if he didnt seem to need it, id find alot of the times he would eventually wee, and he could go back to sleep and we'd tend not to wake up in a puddle! you could always take her to a vet just to be on the safe side!!!
ZH4N6Xdtaa	wow you have made yourself sound really clever.|`|6UeGyxNcaa	hmmm, sounds like a pothead to me! first, get a camera on his cage and leave.

qEp9fxU9aa	It is wrong to not provide animals the proper environment for them to live a long full life.  You should have Mollies and Bumblebee Gobies in extremly hard or brackish water.  Orange/Red Chromides are actually fresh water fish in a large portion of Asia.  They are found in brackish water in some areas though the majority of their range is fresh.  There are several other chromides you may be talking about so the latin name would be helpfull.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Depends on the exact fish.    Some like Mollies do perfectly OK in pure fresh water, or full marine, or anywhere in between. So they would be fine.    Others are specifially adapted to brackish water and are prone to disease or premature death if keep in fresh water too long. So not a good choice.    Ian|`|SZOMVGBRaa	You can but some are better out of their element than others. It also depends where they are wild caught or not. As with most fish though. You think any mollies you find in a pet store have ever seen brackish water ? they have been tank breed for generations in fresh water with some salt added. Not true brackish water. They are used to it.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	If fish can thrive better in one situation than that is how they should be kept.    ~I knew you wouldn't.|`|fYupEegGaa	I think its alright if you do it gradually. Like keep adding less salt and less salt in your water changes. I have a molly in a fresh water tank with platys and a betta. I usually add a pinch or two of aquarium salt to my tank with every water change!  EDIT: Like Lanab said it depends on the fish!
HiqdNysdaa	I have had many guinea pigs all my life. I always like to decorate the cages with toilet paper tubes and i like to cut slits in them for footholes and tie it to the side of the cage so it can climb in them.    I also like to Get a regular plastic clip, tie a string to it, and tie it to the top of the cage. I put some lettuce or kale in the clip and your pet will look up and stretch to eat it. They like to reach and find things like treats.    Also you can put little wooden balls with a wallnut in the middle ( you can buy them in local petstores) and put it in there. They chew through the wood and get to the wallnut. Then they break open the wallnut and they have a fun time with opening it also.    Make sure they have one of those plastic igloos because they feel protected in them and they sleep in them.    I hope this helps!!!!  thanks   ~Gina~|`|ziO0A8A7aa	My guinea pigs food and house were on the same side of the cage and his litter box on the other, which he used more frequently than not. That eliminated A LOT of unnecessary litter changing.|`|bELqEsdOaa	Make sure they have something to hide under. Guinea pigs like to feel protected and my experiences with one they love plastic igloo's. To be honest they usually arrange it the way they want it. When they become comfortable in their surroundings, they will move the food dish around and the other things that aren't nailed down. They're very accepting.|`|85c8e22ecdcbf3707f252046422d367baa	i raise guinea pigs and i try and keep there living quarters and there exercise re.play area separate which calls for two ajoining cages.this works out well if you have more than one female in the cage because they will have plenty of room to build there nests.i discourage them from building nests in the play area by not putting any nesting materials in there.that way i can have multiple spin wheels and tunnals for them to play.i have recently added a third cage on top with a ladder access and put in more nesting because they seem to mutiply faster than i can sell them.this also works well for having plenty of space for food and water.hope this helps and good luck
eDySIDPQaa	Cassie, hello    You can do both, I did for years....    1--You can breed/show/hanlder all of it    2--You can rescue and help deliver dogs to new owners....you have to make sure you screen the new owners very well, then its up to you if they get the dog or not.    3--You do not have to own a rescue or house the dogs, just help pick them up, deliver them, and get them great new homes.    I go all over transporting Akitas to new homes, I am very selective as to whom gets one of the dogs I rescue....I pickup from the original home and deliever to the new homes, or I get called or emailed and will meet other rescuers half way or more and finish the trip...    you can do it all and have the great feeling while saving dogs, you are fulfliing your life dream of showing as well    good luck, I know you can do it......|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	This is surely one for Iggy's Hole In the Wall Gang.....My thought is......be a Rescuer, and talk to Iggy....    She does that and she is very experienced in that field!!  I will contact her, or star this for her to see.   Actually, I see she already answered, as I was typing this.  She is your gal to contact.  Believe me, she's saved some very special dogs, and they have all gone to excellent homes.  Some stories brought tears to my eyes.  She is a gentle soul with a BIG doggie heart!   Just adore her and all her dogs, too!!|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	I just read an article about the large amount of registered dogs shelters receive. Online animal rescue sites will lead you in the right direction.     Also there are shows, competitions and awards for mixed breed dogs.        Start your rescue efforts by dropping of bags of food, bleach,  old blankets and cat litter at a local shelter.        I have 4 rescue dogs and 3 cats.  Please encourage others not to buy pets. Check online at how horrible these "puppy-mills" are.    I hope you follow your dreams.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Haha.  Hop on over to my boat.  We've got the same goals.      For me, my major thing is rescue.  Showing will take a backseat to that.  I want to actually run the rescue- I decide which dogs to take in, who to administer what type of vet care to, what to feed, what to train, who to adopt out to.      I can tell you now that being a dog trainer and groomer is not going to get you this type of income.  I am a grooming assistant- I work with a quite a few groomers who average a little bit above poverty level annually.  Granted, we work for a large corporation, but that means that if there is no business we still get paid.      Your best bet is to find something else dog related that you can do.  For me, I love to write- I am looking at becomming a journalist for a dog magazine.  Of course, I will groom and train on the side (as well as run my rescue, own and show dogs, maybe breed).    ....I'm going to go ask the Higher Power to put a few more hours into the day.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Many good breeders also do rescue for their breed. Usually their own dogs are show & rescue ones. Since they take back any of their pups, they must have the ability to place returned dogs.  But I think you are taking a bit too much, wait til you start before adding other titles & jobs.|`|AA10029366	I've rescued for almost as long as I've been "in" my breed -- certainly longer than I've been showing or breeding.    I think it is very possible to do both. You just have to decide how much of your resources (time, energy, and money) you want to devote to which. I used to take in many rescues...but it got to the point that I had a hard time managing my kennel, and my show/running dogs weren't getting what I thought they deserved. So I scaled back as time passed. At this point, I take in "special case" rescues, but also devote a lot of space on my website to advertising rescues in foster homes. I pay to spay/neuter rescues in my area when they come into foster, and I donate to my National Parent Club's rescue program. I transport rescues to/from foster and forever homes, and do home checks for other rescue groups.     So I consider myself still very involved in rescue, even if I don't have a house full of them.    Yes, you can rescue without *running* a rescue! :)    ADD: I agree with Animal_Artwork...having a career outside of dogs tends to go a lot further toward paying for your dogs! Unfortunately, training and grooming can be difficult fields to make money in.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	OK with all you want to do there is no way to do it all at once.   1. Get your main priority schools out of the way.  If it were me I would start with grooming school and training.  That would give you income. Which is a good thing    Grooming-- after school you will need to apprentice for one year. if you are doing it the right way which is school not just learning from someone.   It took me 2 years at a shop to get in a comfortable no sweet the bills salary range. You will need to have a client base before you go out on your own,Trust me!!  You want good clients not the once a year shave downs that aren't touched until the next year, but you can make good money on them.   After I opened my own business it was almost 5 years to clear the loans, pay everything monthly and acually bring home some bacon. You want to be able to start picking up some show dogs to groom, which is hard as most people do it themselves, but there are some that will want you to do it.    Training-- you will need to apprentice also-- that also took me about 2 years, its allot of word of mouth. I groomed all day and had training classes 3 nights a week, at that time I had a hb to help with my guys at home. No rescues but I had 8 assorted animals.    You will need help a bather and someone to help with training for the difficult people.    When you are making some money and living, then start with the bred/show which is the most expensive thing you can do.    Add: Keep in mind it has been 28 years since I started. I am in no way rich, but I ditched the hb and I don't worry about bills on my own, with some help from allimony. I have some land and a comfortable house.    If I had to do it over in todays economy, I don't think I could. I would go to college, make some money, then maybe show/breed/rescue|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Um yes it is i know a lady who owns the father of my dog kira. I went to work at her kennel and help her with shows in exchange she help me more with showing, and she was the first person in weims to give me the light of day so to speak. And guess what now everyone is aware of my talent and are willing to help.     We she runs the weimaraner rescue for the whole new england area or at  least for a part of new england. She is also a breeder and handler, she keeps them out in her kennel with her boarders. Its a boarding and rescue kennel with some of her dogs out there too.     Its not a farfetched idea at all i know plenty more breeders that help out with rescue or run rescue. Most do BSR, lots take the pure breds out of shelters and put them in BSR.    I plan on doing the same when i get my own place, and get a job as a veterinarian.     Trust me to run a business and show it takes alot of very hard work and money. I saw how she ran it and it was amazing. Would i go back there too her maybe not because i kindof didnt like how she talked to so to speak i really dont want to go into detail on that.    You may not want to take on too much at once. Behaviorists is a job that takes up time.     I mean if you are really passionate about it im sure you could do it.|`|iXijnCxOaa	I've found that a job outside of "dogs" is the best way to support my dog habits.    I believe that people, if they are going to breed, should rescue.  I worked rescue for my breed long before I started breeding.  I believe its given me a unique perspective on what traits the breed cannot do without.    Income really depends on how bad your "habit" is... there have been times when I've gone months without showing because its too expensive and other times when I've spent thousands.|`|2wyDALHgaa	There is no need for you to all of this right off the bat or relatively quickly.  Why not do what you love out of all of this, like perhaps be a trainer and groomer.  While doing that you can have all the hands on subjects you can handle as you worth towards being a behaviorist as well.  Eventually, as you work through this you can do some rescue work or perhaps volunteer with a local rescue already in operation.  They can always use extra hands and again, you will have your fill of rescue and test subjects for your behaviour training.    Eventually, once you get enough time and enough money you can work towards breeding and showing dogs if you wish.  You have your whole life ahead of you and you need to take things on in a way where you can do them all well as your time and life allow rather then be overwhelmed and do a whole lot of things half a$$ed.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Many of the breeders I know are also actively involved in rescue (mostly with breed rescues)  Its quite feasible to do both, on smaller scales|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Someone very wise told me a while ago, "Pick one thing, and do it well".  She was right.  If you do not concentrate on one or two things, you won't do any of them right.  You also won't be paying your bills on time.     You have the opportunity to shadow a judge - do that while the opportunity exists, and if you want to do things that reinforce that knowledge, that's great.  Look at the opportunities you have, and figure out which ones will always be there, and which ones you can get the most out of now.      But first, pay your bills.  You can't do any of these things without being gainfully employed, and most things having to do with dogs do not pay enough to support the rest.  In addition, what happens down the road if you were disbled in any way, or the economy got bad enough that the show dogs were thinning out?  You'd still need to eat.      I strongly suggest you figure out another career in addition to the dogs, something realistic that you love enough to do most of the week, and save the rest for intense fun.  You'll always have to eat, but if you rack up a knee, you're not going to be doing anything in a ring except stewarding, and that might get you lunch, if you're lucky.
TrEDiWR7aa	its About right.. always plan for more so you dont run out!! i reccomend the Hartz water bottle(:|`|HiqdNysdaa	R U AN IDIOT!!!!  dont use a rubbermaid bin!!!!!   buy a regular hamster crittertrail cage!!!!  itas way more safe than buying a plastic bin!!!!!!!    Wow if u didnt know that than maybe you shouldnt but a hamster!!!!|`|AA11514398	Yeah i heard the bins were better because the cages they sell at stores are too small. So for that girl who said she shouldn't have a hamster, maybe u shouldn't have one because you're uneducated. Anyways, the prices look about right, but i'd bring and extra 10 dollars for taxes or if something costs a little more.|`|fi85yw8Kaa	i think those prices are right. that's around where they are where i live.|`|40IUKsC2aa	yup i think you are about right.just make sure you bring a bit more money just in case you decide on getting a extra toy or taxes.  with the bin cage make sure you drill holes on the bin and the lid.  i have never heard of a wooden wheel for a hamster/other pet.i only heard about plastic and wire.if there is a wooden wheel i will say get a plastic easy to clean and not dangerous to your hamster.a wooden wheel can stink with all the pee and every thing.and a wire wheel your hamster could get hurt by its paw getting stuck or could get bumble foot.  also a water bottle you could use for a bin cage is   http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...|`|XrMMH5tZaa	not being a ***** but cages with wire walls give them more fresh air breathe. u should look into it|`|1hS1pQz5aa	You r pretty close!  Hamster = $5-10  Bedding= $6  U don't need a hut = use toilet paper rolls instead (they luv 'em)  wheel = $5-10  water bottle= $6  You can feed 'em pretzels and crackers 2!!!!!  Great cage is a 10 gallon aquarium!   1, It's easier to clean!  2. Hamster cant get out  3. You can see 'em 24-7  Good luck!|`|nPuZVGFRaa	The hamster is actually only about $10.. that's a good thing though!  Are you forgetting the cage? Or do you already have one?
YnCUyvK7aa	Even though you didn't know about what you needed when you bought the fish, at least you're trying to learn, and that's more than some people will do. <br>  <br>  The pH is related to the carbonate hardness [kH].  Carbonates add alkalinity, and this helps to neutralize mild acids, so it keeps the pH from dropding as quickly if an acid is added.  And even though you probably don't plan to add any acid to the tank, the carbon dioxide given off when the fish breathe and their wastes does make the water mildly acidic.  That's 1 of the reasons why it's better to do small frequent water changes [25% of the tank volume each week] than to wait and do a large change less often.  The pH will fluctuate more.  <br>  <br>  You don't say how low your pH and hardness levels are, but unless the pH is regularly falling below 6, I wouldn't try to adjust it.  If it is lower, adding some crushed coral [sold in bags for saltwater tanks] or some cichlid sand added to your gravel, or put in a small mesh bag in your filter will help to raise it [and the hardness as well].  Both of these substances are made of calcium carbonate, and will slowly dissolve in the tank.  It makes a much more stable environment than trying to change the pH using liquid buffers which will do a quick pH change, then slowly drift back to the original level.<br>  <br>  A 20 gallon is a little on the smaller side, but it could be doable if you have good filtration and are meticulous with your water changes.  You don't want to miss changes too often, or if you need to miss on a scheduled day, make up the change as soon as you can.  And instead of 25% changes, you might do 30 or 35% instead.  It also could make a difference if the tank is a 20 gallon long [30 inches long] as opposed to a 20 tall [24 inches long] because the added length will give you more surface area for oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange and will have more horizontal room for your fish to swim.<br>  <br>  And yes, if you pay attention to the ammonia and nitrite levels and do changes whenever the levels start to approach 1 ppm, your fish can survive the cycling process.  Goldfish are pretty hardy if you make an effort to keep their conditions livable for them.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Would you be willing to return them to the store while you get everything in order for them? It really would be best for them.<br>  <br>  pH and hardness- Yes they are related. Is your ph low, and your water soft? Are you on well water?<br>  <br>  Thirty gallons is the minimum for two fancy goldfish. They grow 6-8 inches, and produce a lot of waste. <br>  <br>  While the fish may survive the cycling process, it's best not to subject them to it. Goldfish will produce a lot of ammonia, and in a cycling tank, there is nothing to break it down (same as a bowl) and the waste will build up and cause ammonia burns and poisoning.
RPTwjyjIaa	You keep asking this question and you keep getting the same response...It is not a good idea. Are you trying to find someone who will actually say "yes get him! That will be a great idea!"? Well it is not. You need to have lots of horse experience to train a stallion....they are NOT for the beginner. You could get hurt and you could do some serious damage to this horse by being inexperienced. What would happen to him if he became uncontrollable because of you being so Inexperienced? You need more than a "bond" and reading information to train a horse. Especially a stallion. At six years old he should already be able to be ridden, even if he was used for breeding. It is best for you AND him if you found a horse that is more suited for your level of experience. Good luck in finding the RIGHT horse for you.|`|cLtzGveRaa	    I know what you're looking for is somebody to tell you to take this stallion, but those saying don't are right.  Here is my experience:    I am an adult with kids your age.  I grew up with horses... lived on horseback... and spent much time tuning in my friends' horses.  I rode our greenbroke horses.  I preferred our greenbroke horses as I preferred their unpredictability to what I saw as the robotic and mindless movements of a well broke horse.    Fast forward to today.  I haven't done any serious riding for better than 20 years.  I decided a couple of years ago that my kids needed well broke, been there done that, cheap trail mounts.  While I also wanted a horse, my needs were more specific.  I needed a straight egyptian arabian.  Nothing else would do.  But they are expensive.  So I decided I could wait.    While looking for a horse for my kids, I saw an ad... straight egyptian sheykh obeyd colt... at a price I could afford!  It was a colt, and I had no intentions of buying a stallion... but I went to see this little guy.  His sire was, with the exception of our stallion when I was young, the most spectacular animal I had ever seen!  I had to own a little piece of him.  Given the rarity of his bloodlines, I couldn't see my way clear to taking him out of the gene pool.  Besides... my experience was old, but I was very experienced with horses.    Well a year later, I now own this little fella... and he is still a stallion.  But I will tell you, he has tested everything I ever knew growing up and then some.  There have been times when I have felt like I was scrambling to keep up with him.    He and I are working closely with a trainer who not only loves stallions, but specializes in rehabilitating problem horses.  Last spring I had the opportunity to buy a property where I could keep my horse with me.  I chose not to.  I know what I'm doing and have some great advice for others, but even with having grown up on horseback... literally... I never got off all summer.  Even with my skills.  Even with my knowledge.  If I tried to manage this little man without some expert help I would run the very real risk of having an unmanageable hellion.  And I could not afford to own this home and keep Ali where he stands the best chance at a bright future.    So... if I, with my skills and experience, am in that position, what chance do you... a youth with no experience with horses... stand at successfully managing and training an unbroke stallion?    Stallions are amazing.  They possess that extra "something" in their carriage and mannerisms that is just missing in mares and geldings.  But they are NOT for youths and people with no horse experience.    If you must own this horse... geld him and get help training him.|`|2O58btqxaa	id say no it takes alot of time to break a horse the correct way and with you being so young it wouldn't be a good idea sorry|`|nPuZVGFRaa	I am 13 and have been riding horse since I was 5.. Its very hard to believe but my horse that I've had is and has been 24 hands high and I was able to ride him. I think you should except the horse.|`|8qECRiuMaa	ok i have been riding on and off since i was about 2 and love horses. in my opinion male horses are better tempered and sweeter. this may sound crazy but all you need to do is spend time with him, talk to him(this is the crazy part), make sure to get the right gear, get books, lead him around with a lead rope saying commands so he can learn them, have the farrier look at the horse he can tell you almost anything you need to know, if you are boarding the horse then the owner of the stable can help, when you feel conferable around him and that he is able to be ridden ONLY then try to ride him, a better choose would be to get your moms friend to do it. So yes accept the horse because horses are the best pet you can own.|`|RloOJ43haa	No matter how many times you ask this question, the answer is not going to change. No, you should not get this horse.     A stallion is not an appropriate first horse. It does not matter how much you read or research. A stallion needs an experienced handler.     An unbroke horse is not an appropriate first horse. It does not matter how much you read or research. An unbroke horse needs an experienced handler.     If you cannot afford a trainer, then you cannot afford a horse - especially as a first time horse owner. You will need help. If you do not get it, you probably will get hurt. The only reason you feel confident that you can train him is because you have no idea what you are in for.     A much better option for you would be to take riding lessons for a year or two and learn the skills you will need for horse ownership. Then, get a horse.    EDIT - SAMMY C - 24 hands is 8 feet. You did not ride an 8 foot tall horse.|`|yDgYSHvaaa	You can't learn experience from books, hun. I know it sucks to hear, but it's true. Don't do it; it'll only cause you and the poor horse lots of pain, grief, and frustration. Wait a little while until you can afford a trainer. Is it possible to ask your mother's friend for lessons? If she owns a stallion /she'd/ better be experienced enough to teach you a few lessons.  If you don't take my advice, I beg you to at least geld the animal.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Well if you get a real trainer (like a person, not just a book/ internet) then maby.    Beginner riders should NEVER get green/unbroke horses especially not a Stallion.    He is 6 and never been ridden that is not good even for an experienced trainer.    I would not get him if I were you.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I Agree with the first post, this sounds like you are rushing into a situation that could be dangerous.  Just because you have known a Stallion, none the less, for a week doesn't mean he is gonna be sweet.  A stallion that has no training at the age of 6 has no business with a beginner.    Stallions should be handled by someone who has been around horses for quite a while.  While reading books is good research, that doesn't mean your a horse whisperer (I Know your gonna hate me).      Maybe the lady that "owns" these horses can give you lessons on the mare for a while.  I wouldn't take them as your ownership.  Please take lessons first.|`|AA12048299	Sure.. get him. Hope your health insurance is up to date.     Honestly, are you NOT going to get him because a bunch of strangers here on YA say not to?     I'm going out on a limb, and predicting this won't end well, though. It sounds as mom's friend is unloading two unwanted horses to some eager kids. Horses she's (up 'till now) neglected to be trained. Don't be suprised if the mare's preggers either.    Seriously, I'd run away from this situation FAST.|`|YOvTRbC7aa	This sounds like a very bad idea, not only for you, but the horse as well. There is a reason that 98% of male horses are gelded. It's not just to prevent breeding, but stallions are extremely unpredictable and can be very dangerous. He may be good around you now, but if you introduce a mare in heat to him, he can change into a very completely uncontrollable animal in seconds (especially for a person that has no horse experience).  Quite frankly, I think it is very irresponsible that your parents and the seller (give-awayers) are even considering giving this animal to you as an option.   There are a lot of horses out there that are well broke ready to ride for free. Heck you can go to your local auction and probably pick up an older broke ranch horse that has been around the block and has a lot of miles under his belt for under $100. You could save an awesome broke horse at auction from being shipped to slaughter. Since the economy is in the tank, people are losing their jobs left and right. They can't afford their horses anymore and are dumping them for mere pennies.  Please do some research on what's out there before commiting to this horse. You will have so much more fun galloping through the country side on a horse that is broke and trustworthy.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	First of all congratulations on finding your passion for horses! While horses can be a lot of fun they also require a great deal of responsibility and know how. I would start by finding out if the horse has been gelded or not. Also, what kind of breed is he?( would not recommend thoroughbreds, warm bloods, appendix quarter horses because of their size ) Have these horses been handled a lot over the years? Just because the horse has not been ride able does not necessarily mean that it has no training at all.  Now then, assuming that the horse has been gelded, he is a breed that generally is mild mannered and not too big in size and has been handled a lot though out his life ( such as grooming, being tied, loaded into trailers, etc.) I would say it is a huge project but not impossible.  If you decide to go through with this make sure you  have someone with experience there to give you guidance and keep you safe. Horses are generally smart and gentle creatures but any mistakes made by you could create some potentially dangerous situations. Although asking questions and doing research is a wonderful way to learn about things it does not replace actual experience. Always remember your safety as well as the horse's is you top priority!|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Not... nuf said...|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I would spend some time riding the mare or getting saddle experience at least somewhere.  I would suggest just getting to know the stallion for a while; making friends with him, working on halter training if he hasn't already had it (also work on brushing and body handling).  All the while I would be working on riding skills and keep on reading!  After you feel confident in the saddle and feel confident controlling horses you ride, you can work on getting a little closer to the horse you are wanting to train.  I'm sure you've read enough that I don't have to tell you much more.    BTW, my dad brought home a 2 yr old welsh pony cross for me when I was 12, she belonged to my uncle and he had never even had a halter on her before.  I ended up training her to be a great horse and could do anything with her.  It will take time, but you can get there.      P.S.  Gelding the stallion might not be a bad idea if you can!  (unless he is extra sweet in nature!)|`|OIaYI5Mqaa	a beginner rider should never mount a stallion.   especially one with little to no training.     im 16 and ive ridden a stallion once and i have 10 years experience.   also if there is a mare around the stallion can become very excitable and will dismount you with ease.|`|0G78RWldaa	NNNOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Stallions are unpredictable, and no horse should be broken by somone who is inexperianced.  It's dangerous for both you and the horse.  No matter how great your ground relationship is it dosent mean that you will have the same relationship in the saddle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oYazZKhbaa	i have only been riding for 6 months and i am 14. being only 14 even tho i have little riding experience i would not buy an unbroke horse. breaking a horse takes a long time. it can take a few years and u must go through many stages of breaking before the horse is fully broke. with u being 15, i would not recomend u take the stallion unless you can get a trainer. tell your mom you will do extra chores or something if she pays for the trainer.|`|zX6BuGS7aa	Im sorry, but even me (who has been riding horses for the past 5 years)  have a hard time riding a green horse. I have trained my horse to switch from english to western. It took some time. You might have more time then i do but still. I wouldn't trust myself with a stallion.  If I was you, and you really want him I would invest in getting him gelded. Then you wouldn't have to worry about him acting like a stallion, as in being very gentle one minute and aggressive the next.  It is just an idea. He would be a lot more easier to train gelded.

tY3hKEFkaa	German Shepherds are NATURALLY protective. If from good bloodlines, and properly trained, they will easily know when to go into "Protection" mode vs. "Happy Goofy Dog" mode. I was raised around German Shepherd Dogs, Dobermans, and Pit Bulls. All were friendly to a fault, yet very very protective of us kids growing up. Toby the GSD was a total baby. He'd let us kids follow him around all day, play with him, brush him. Never snapped or snarled. If a stranger came in the yard, that was another story. If he could sense we were un easy about something/someone he knew what to do. Schutzhund is probably what you are looking for. You do not want the dog attacking everyone. Good way to lose the dog and have her euthanized. A well bred shepherd will easily learn schutzhund, and know when it is ok to be "protective" like in training, and when its ok to be a happy friendly dog. Do not do it yourself. They do not use cruel methods in Schutzhund, and MOST train their dogs in a different language. That way your friends cant just screw around and try and make the dog "Attack" for no reason.Where I live there is a schutzhund trainer down the street. He has 2 imported GSD's ( A Black Sable, and a Red Sable) Both beautiful dogs, both very well mannered, stable, and friendly, but both trained in Schutzhund. He trains his dogs in another language and the dogs although trained in schutzhund are also trained and are certified therapy dogs that visit the childrens hospital, and do seminars with him on training. Please do research, pick a reputable trainer in Schutzhund (Preferably is in an organization or club for Schutzhund) and have great reviews from people that have used them for training their dogs. I do plan on having 2 or 3 GSD's when I'm more settled in life, and will happily be training them in Schutzhund.     Just remember you want a stable dog that knows when to protect and when to be friendly, vs the a-typical "mean" junk yard dog.    The dog trainer in my area actually has trained Neopolatin Mastifs, Fila Brasilos, Cane Corsos, Dogo Argentinos, and many many other "protective breeds" with out an issue. A good trainer wil not make your dog mean, she will learn to obey you and will only "turn into protect mode" when you tell her to. Again you don't want a "mean junk yard dog" attitude. An Unstable GSD is a curse to the ones that properly train and raise theirs. They're already on the BSL list in many areas. We need to get them off of it.    Also remember most of the dogs in Schutzhund are trained and shown in the sport of it. I know many around my area that have dogs trained in protection (schutzhund ) training that are stable happy dogs. Again only GSD's from proper breeders should go to them.     And to the person that said they breed for that. I found a breeder explained I'd eventually in a few years like to get a pup from working lines for schutzhund training. They were happy to tell me they had no issues with novice's training a dog. They find a pup with the right work ethics you want, and then match you up depending on your preferance ( Color, sex, ect). They knew I would be using the dog for protection and probably a family setting with other animals and even found me puppies currently available and offered if anything doesn't work out they will do their best to match me to the right dog. (IE puppy has TOO MUCH work drive, they would re-place the dog, if I need, and make me a better match) they adopt out to family situations and have never had a "Devil Dog" attack ect. The dogs are all "German Bred" and not a single one have that American bred slant show dog back. You need the right breeding to do protection training, and the dog needs refresher training to keep their manners up.     Most dogs that are responsible for attacks (Pits, GSDs, Rotties, ect) were trained the WRONG WAY. They were trained to be aggressive and mean. They were not trained by a skilled trainer, and most are very unsocialized and mis-trained by owners that wanted that "junk yard dog" look. Most dogs trained are for the "status" accompanying them. For us regular folks that want a dog for PROTECTION we have all rights to get a dog or train our dog to do so. It does not make the dog psycho ect.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	You cant; if she wasn't bred for PP(personal protection) work and then trained with a qualified PP trainer she will never be able to reliable attack on command, and more importantly, come off a bite on command.    If she came from a reputable working breeder and was a PP prospect, believe me you would know it!(as such a breeder would never put a dog like that in the hands of a novice, and would screen you thuroughly; though they would probably keep the best PP prospects for themselves unless you had specifically discussed otherwise) If she does bite anyone its out of fear and not protection and nothing you can rely on except a lawsuit. You can never rely on a fear biter for protection.      ETA: to the person who suggested Schutzhund, that is NOT personal protection work, it is a SPORT. A large majority of those dogs could never do PP work.|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	Get someone to hurt you ( say a friend ). Ask them to push you down and pretend your dead ( make sure this is ALL happening in front of your dog ).. Cry in pain and hopefully the dog understands your in pain.|`|KPdWzbxWaa	With the breed you own, if someone were to go after you, the dog would guard you in a heart beat - with or without training. But if you would like to have it on command, talk to a schutzhund group in your area. They will be able to help you train your dog correctly. The breed you own is a really smart breed so he/she should catch onto it very fast.    Don't train attacking/guarding without a professional trainer. Because if you try training with someone inexperienced your dog, you, or your friend can get hurt. Its best to keep everyone safe :)    I hope this helps you and I wish you the best with your dog.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	I don't like the question, and that's why I'm answering - I care about dogs and am concerned that you're going to try to do this to a dog.    Only professional trainers who are actually going to be working their dogs have business doing this. As a pet owner, you have no right. Learn some responsibility    By the way, you know those 'devil dogs' you read about in newspapers that always seem lovely until they killed a baby? It's your sort that own them.    Chalice|`|VaYjl71Laa	Well you can take it to a professional and have it trained (very expensive).  This dog will become a threat to society so its best not to help ruin a breed.  What's the point?  Think you're gonna get attacked then gee I dunno, get a gun... people like you are retarded...|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Your animal naturally has a defense mode, there is no need to teach her to activate it on command. The dangers of a command like this are far too immense to even begin to detail them properly.    This breed of dog is naturally protective of its owners, any type of hormone jump that indicates panic will have the dog in the "defense mode".     Perhaps you should look into Schutzhund training, its a sport, but it can give you an idea of if your animal is capable of doing what you want it to do:  http://www.germanshepherddog.com/|`|zywhvyPqaa	Its people like you that give breeds a bad rep.  looks like most the answers on here agree with me,  i feel very strongly about this because of people like you who train these dogs to hurt people ,that why breed's are getting band,|`|4ZmHOQVVaa	Don't. If not trained professionally, even often if so, your dog WILL become aggressive constantly. It's not worth it... If you're ever really in danger, she'll act on her own, provided you've treated her well enough for her to love you.

I would have fed him dry dog food and once in a while give him a can of dog food. But if you want to cook your dogs food that would be great. Chicken is good to feed your dog. I am sure most meats would be fine. But don't go frying up the food or anything or that would be to fatty. I would prolly bake it or maybe even try to feed raw.  I never really thought about this before so maybe see what other people say.

WIFKeDBgaa	Angelica brings up an interesting point. Great Danes & Mastiffs rarely live past 7-8 years old....but toy breeds often live into the 20's. 5 years for a male would be absolutely ridiculous. You won't know if he's a good producer until he's at least 4, when his progeny begin accomplishing (or not) things. Someone that is breeding to "better the breed" (as is supposed to be the goal of a breeder), don't know what kind of stud they have until he's 4 or 5 years old....thus, that's the beginning of his career. All too many breeders will breed a "non-producing" champion until he can't mount anymore...when he should've been retired at 4-5. Once it is obvious that a dog is not a producer of excellent offspring, 200 more breedings will not justify him if 2 or 3 flukes come out. I don't really agree with artificial breeding if the stud does not have the drive to breed. There are breeders that will AI a "champion" dog because he won't breed on his own....THAT is definitely wrong, and the dog should be neutered. On the other hand, if we had frozen semen from 30-35 years ago from some of the dogs that WERE good producers, some breeds could be brought back from the brink of total disaster ( I'm speaking mainly about rotties here).<br>  <br>  So, to shorten it a bit...I'd say if the stud is producing "REAL QUALITY" (and of course ALL breeders think they have "quality"), breed him as long as he's able. If he's producing EXCELLENT, PROVEN, SUPERIOR QUALITY...continue with frozen semen until something better comes along.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Its 5 years for a bitchh. I do believe 10-12 years old is fine for a stud. Its the bitchh that is to worry about.

Males like human men can go for much longer since there is little stress on them when it comes to breeding. There is also the fact that many OLDER studs have semen that is in frozen storage that was collected at an earlier date.<br>  <br>  And when using an older male reputable breeder will still do a full battery test on the quality and motility of their sperm prior to breeding.<br>  <br>  ADD: As for age if the male is healthy and has a good sperm count with active and motile sperm I see nothing wrong with the actual breeding of an older male past the age of 5.|`|GaL66jbQaa	It depends on the breed larger breeds have shorter lives and thus shorter viability period.
gJzkKqxwaa	Russian blue kitties are very playful and get along with basically any animal and with children, and the same goes for Ragdolls... I would go for it. Of course that depends on how your cat responds to newcomers because I know that my cat would never get along.

C1eHfhrHaa	Those are great ideas.  Usually best in show and conformation are the same thing.  I would suggest a pets who look like their owners contest and a costume contest.  Also check into obedience and maybe offering Canine Good Citizen tests. That way you could have tons of mixed breed dogs too, which obviously can't compete in conformation because there is no breed standard for them.  You could also have categories like best kisser, longest drool, etc...|`|ixOE0onnaa	dog Freestyle that's cool.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Ground dog trials  Agility course  Something like the wiener dog races|`|hT7BhNamaa	Nikki, you will laugh at this, but years ago we had a radio announcer.

Idunjsxjaa	The advice I was given is NO ALFALFA....they get all the alfalfa they need in their pellets...too much is not good for them even as babies.  As a baby your suppose to feed your bunny as much pellets and timothy hay as they can eat.  Mine is four months and i make sure there is always pellets in his bowl and timothy hay in the cage....water too! :)  I'd stick to green veggies...no head lettuce.....romaine is what I give mine.  Bunnies pretty much get everything they need from just the pellets and timothy hay!  At 6 months your suppose to limit the amount of pellets....timothy hay is given to them all the time...as much as they can eat at any age!

pLv0Ejt9aa	Excelent idea! Clicker training is probably the best positive reinforcement dog training method around. The power of the clicker lies there in that the dog must receive a treat for every click, even if your timing was wrong. So the dog learns to work for the click, so he can be treated. A very effective way to train a dog. People fail in using clicker training because they do not understand how it works and they don't use it correctly. Please read on my web site more about clicker training and there are articles explaining step by step how to teach your dog certain things.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Clickers are good. I am buying one to train my puppy. They have awesome reviews.|`|stMcVPCMaa	The clicker is awesome!  I don't use it often myself but it has worked wonders for my Jack Russell Terrier.

With a clicker I had her paying attention to me in less than an hour!  Now any time she has a hard time getting the hang of something new I want to teach her, the clicker cuts her learning time to nothing at all.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	i think the clicker is a good idea, especially if it's proving to be a success for you.<br>  <br>  if you are having problems in some areas, there are many websites on dog training, with free advice.

It helps teach the dog to think for himself, and while learning can be "slower" due to them offering tons of behaviors to figure out what you want, they retain the information better!<br>  <br>  www.clickersolutions.com <--this place is your friend xD!|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Yes this is a very effective way to train your puppy.Just remember to be consistent.do not confuse your puppy.Good Luck.|`|9wuz8PJmaa	its good as its a quick sharp noise the puppy will hear it more clearly and wont get distracted....i used it on my boxer it worked great

Almost the same as the Alsatian.<br>  But if you hadn't of said that, I would definitely say part Alsatian because of the coat colouring and markings.<br>  And then because of the curled up tail, and rather broad chest and larger head as well as the pointy up ears I would definitely consider an Akita.

7cm4dZVaaa	Stand slightly in your stirrups.  If you are not showing you can rest you hand on the horn for balance.  If you are showing, usually the most that would be called for is "extended jog," which you are expected to learn to sit to.|`|AA10986942	You are having a hard time sitting your trot because you are probably bracing yourself and are too stiff.  Keep your shoulders back, sit straight, push down on your heels (make sure your stirups are not too short) and let your hips move with the motion of the horse.  your hips will absorb the motion and your wont bounce.  Remember not to sit stiff!  If you are more comfortable posting when your are just riding around your ranch or training your horse go ahead and do it!  Just remember you should be up when the horses outside leg is forward (rise and fall with the leg on the wall.... that is how to remember your diagonals when you are riding in a ring)  A diagonal is when you should be up or down.    I ride western and english and post when training at a trot in my western saddle.  No big deal.  You just cant do it if you are in a show.|`|Sv99BNlEaa	i don't ride western but i didn't know you were supposed to post. try making sure your stirrups are the correct length and make sure your horses pace is also steady and energetic but not as if he was going to break into a canter (or lope) at any second  =] good luck!    ps- posting does look kind of funny naturally. but its jusy moving with the horses natural gait, and its pretty comfortable at the right pace|`|NlyEmrO1aa	You are supposed to post when trotting. however if you are moving correctly with the movement of your horse, it shouldn't look wierd. If you are riding western you might want to loosen up your stirrups a little. And trotting in any discipline looks kind of funny, it's cantering when you start to look like a bamf :)|`|VyXYcCXtaa	you are NOT aloud to post while riding western.. you will probably get points taken off|`|AA11570905	What do you care if you look "weird".  I'd be more concerned about my horses comfort than what others might or might not percieve as "weird".  I ride western and post to the trot, if people think it looks weird, so be it.    When showing western pleasure you are supposed to sit the "jog" it is not an actual trot and when the gait is done correctly it is very easy to sit.  You don't post to a "western jog".|`|X3bu0B8faa	To post, when the outside foreleg is coming forward, you should be coming out of the saddle. It isn't a straight up motion, more of a rocking of the pelvis. If you are doing WP, and the judge asks for an extended trot, you will have to sit it. You can't post. Try to find a gear that your horse has that is faster then his slow jog, but doesn't jar your teeth out.|`|oYazZKhbaa	dont post in westen.  i ride english and i kno that you do NOT post in western|`|zX6BuGS7aa	When I am just riding around for fun or training i post, western or english. I DO show western pleasure. In the show you can't post no mater how fast your horse is going.   But like I said just around the ranch, or on trails, I don't think it maters much.
7149XmBqaa	Apologize.  Things happen.  Your rat should be fine.|`|2opWeKQBaa	Take the baby's foot and put some pressure on it with your fingers to see if he's not using it because it's painful.

He should be fine from the sound of it.
MKdR8MIUaa	Hi, My name is Tucker and I'm an Australian Shepherd.  Dogs can be cross-eyed.  I met a sled dog last winter who was extremely cross-eyed, but it did not seem to affect his ability as a sled dog at all.  The owner did note that some other dogs picked on him - they seemed to know that there was something different about him.  The first site below has some good information about this condition.  The second two are my website and my blog - just for more information about me.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	Yes puppies can be cross eyed...Sometimes the eyes will straighten out with age, sometimes not... They can do surgery to fix it, but i really do not see the point unless it is seriously bad.|`|Yo3gN9DQaa	i hv never seen a puppy thts cross-eyed, but yes i do think its possible, go to ur local clinic and get it checked out|`|bqtEjEjpaa	it will go away the pups eye muscles are still weak|`|JmD0oq2Naa	my puppy once looked cross eyed on a photo my mam took of her, but she is fine|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	i have seen a cross eyed adult dog(husky)<br>  wait and see how the puppy turns out:the litter should be with their mom until 8weeks old.<br>  you have a 5-6week old pup?<br>  other option:post a picture?<br>  if you are very concerned,show him to a vet.<br>  im trying to picture this:they seem to hang on the sides-what?<br>  the eyes hang at the sides?this is hard to imagine.<br>  what breed is this puppy?
sdEvcpKwaa	Dogs are smarter than you think! Your dog will learn whatever you want him/her to learn if you are the leader and you are consistent. If you learn their language, not ONLY would you be rich, but you wouldn't be the leader I'd imagine! <br>  <br>  Sit down with your dog and do the following:<br>  <br>  Take him by the snout (gently) and look into his eyes. It's a game for you! First one to look away loses! But to them it is serious business. You have to stare him down and he will eventually look away, and viola! You win. If you do this every few weeks or so, or when he refuses to listen, you will eventually gain his obedience. DON'T be mean to him. You can teach your dog with out abuse. If you remain the leader, your dog will naturally listen to you.<br>  <br>  There is no dog language. Dogs respond to sound yes, but also tone, pitch, and body language like mentioned above. You could teach your dog to follow sign language only if you wanted! Dogs are a hellauva lot smarter than people give them credit for.|`|AA12200761	Every bark means "Hey!"|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Bark bark bark bark bark bark bark...... bark.  Bark!<br>  <br>  Bark bark,<br>  Bark<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What do you think a dog will say in "dog language?" Maybe your dog is saying, "Please give me some food!" Dogs bark. People talk. Figure out what all the barking means and you're probably going to be rich.   If I knew what all that barking meant I wouldn't just tell you for free. I would be making some money from it.|`|m5Q8hJUHaa	I talk to my dog and we have our own language. If I tell them to sit,  they know what it means, If I say stand, they know what that means, they know when I'm serious, they know when I'm playing, they knows when I'm happy, they know when I'm sad. I know when they want something, whether it's water or to use the bathroom, or just to play. there are more than one way to communicate then just "verbal language".|`|zEZF5ITMaa	Dogs interact with body language and tones too.<br>  <br>  Be the leader of the pack. <br>  <br>  Use positive reinforcement training techniques.<br>  <br>  Your dog can understand at LEAST 100+ human words depending on his age and breed.<br>  <br>  :)|`|xe0wGpz5aa	Just speak to the dog they will under stand you keep saying whatever out dinner down they are Intelligent animals.|`|bLwAgnkeaa	You don't need to talk to your dog in 'dog language'. Trust me, I'm a dog expert. Just talk to your dog in a slight 'baby voice' or just normally if you prefer, and he/she will understand. They get the gist.
BfBMRlNNaa	In general, it's a matter of standing your ground. If you go through the gate first, stand close to the gate as the horse comes through, the horse should be able to turn around, while you are still at the gate. At this point you should be blocking the second horse from coming through. Stand your ground and tell the second horse to get back. If you are unable to do this, my suggestion would be to tie your pony to the fence close to the gate. Take out the horse you plan on riding, then from the "other" side of the fence, untie your pony.|`|qnL2JYihaa	Take the pony out first and tie him up somewhere, then take out the horse and tie it up.   After that you put the pony back in the field and shut the gate before you let him go.
Tg8tS59Aaa	Well I don't know what to say about the eating of tampons but I can help you with house training.<br>  <br>  Ok first things first. Never rub your dog's nose in it's waste because believe it or not this actually motivates them to pee or poop inside the house more.<br>  <br>  An excellent  way to house train your dog is diapers. Yes human diapers. You simply put them on and only take off when you go outside or when you want your dog to use the restroom.  I know this sounds crazy but it really works.<br>  <br>  Dogs hate this method ( it doesn't cause them pain it just annoys them a LOT) so this motivates them to not pee in the house.<br>  <br>  After about 2 weeks ( or whenever you feel your dog is ready) take off the diaper. If the peeing and pooping consists simply repeat method.<br>  <br>  Believe me it works.
RlmeHs4Uaa	I have seen them just lick sand up before. Many people have kept their geckos on sand and not had problem while some have had them become impacted. Your gecko is more at risk as a baby. You should be ok with what you are doing even if you do see him lick up sand every now and then.  A little sand is actually good because it is used as like a grit to help them digest.  As long as it not too much it will just pass right through them without a problem.|`|Tipi8BSkaa	if the gecko is a baby its better not to use any type of sand at all because every now and then they will like their flooring(its is unknown why they do this) so if its a baby try using reptile carpet it very safe but it can get a bit expensive so just simply use paper towels. But if you have an adult its less risky to use sand. But if i were you i would use paper towel anyway. It may not look the nicest but its really safe.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	Your Gecko may eat some of the sand because of the calcium content. You can put a small dish of a reptile calcium supplement in the cage, this way he can have all the calcium he needs. Make sure you use a very fine sand. Playground sand is good to use. You can buy it at Home depot. If it seems too coarse, you can run it through a  flour sifter. He may try to eat more sand if you use Calci-sand. It has more calcium, but it is really not any more digestible.<br>  Good luck!|`|sUN7TVtzaa	no, sand isn't the issue, feeding him only mealworms is. you cannot feed him only mealworms! he has to have crickets as a staple diet!!!!!!!! mealworms have very little nutrition in them if you can't afford to feed him crickets then you shouldn't keep him. you need to feed him dusted crickets every 2- 3 days. you can give him some type of worm about once a week for a meal but not as a staple diet!!!!|`|AA11239388	well, if you're feeding it staples, the sand won't really matter.
wLgGD63raa	Leopard Geckos also absorb heat through their bellies, which is also essential to digestion for them. A UTH would be a good investment, because rarely, if ever, will you have to replace the heating pad, so you won't be paying like $30 dollars every couple of months.<br>  <br>  If you were to go with a lamp you would have to use a red bulb (they cant see), otherwise the light will damage their eyes. Just be sure when you're using a lamp your temperatures are where they need to be (82-88)|`|RlmeHs4Uaa	The heat lamp will heat up the substrate creating belly heat. Your gecko doesnt need an uth and a new incandescent bulb every month or two isnt going to make you go bankrupt. I would recomend using a red one though so you can leave it on at night and keep your leo's temps up at night.|`|LPFGUjFAaa	that's weird, mine wasn't expensive, oh well, yea it should be fine.  put a thermometer in a place where the gecko may go often and see if the temp is correct.  i don't use the under tank thermometer often anyway.|`|AA11239388	yeah, it'll work fine. if he looks like he's getting cold, put him in the microwave on medium for 15-20 seconds, and he'l;l warm right up!!!|`|sUN7TVtzaa	yes but they tend to like the belly heat more then the heat lamp but it is ok as long as the cage temperature is between 70 - 88 degrees. make sure you know everything and have it set up BEFORE you get the new leo home. here are some sites to help you:<br>  <a href="http://leopardgecko.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgecko.com</a><br>  <a href="http://leopardgeckopunk.com" rel="nofollow">http://leopardgeckopunk.com</a><br>  <a href="http://drgecko.com" rel="nofollow">http://drgecko.com</a><br>  hope these help! good luck!!!
boOi7xJJaa	It is sort of like people.... Some die young and some live to a ripe old age.

Eug52iQDaa	While I applaud that Rachael is doing for pets, her food, in my opinion, falls far short of a premium, healthy food.  Below, I have listed the ingredients, copied from her site, for the chicken based food.  You will notice that corn and soy are contained in the food, in large quantity.  This would not be a food that I would feed, since I recommend only foods that are without corn, soy or wheat ingredients.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	I think it's good. Plus, she donates ALL proceeds to help homeless animals. I'd try it, but I don't want to switch my dog from Blue Buffalo, since she does so well on it.    EDIT: Ok, I didn't realize it had all that corn and soy in it. I wouldn't use it. I'd stick with Blue Buffalo. That's what I use now and it's great.    Why all the thumbs down??|`|VPycXVIlaa	It sounded pretty good on the commercial but I haven't researched it. Depending on what I find out I might get it for my new puppy.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	she gets paid , thats what i think. any celebrity can use thier name to sell a product. i guess nobody was buying rachel ray steaks?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It's not great. It starts with good stuff but quickly goes to corn & soy products & beet pulp - all which are fillers.  You can click on this link to see for yourself.    http://www.rachaelray.com/pets/nutrish.p...    Not what I would be feeding my dogs.|`|br1Ixdxkaa	just becuase she's racheal ray doesn't mean you should try her food for dogs. commercial dog food isnt very good for your pets.i'll stick to blue buffalo.some clebrities only help animals and people to bring theirselves more popularity and to appealto different types of people.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Nothing good comes from a grocery store.

LAXxaxAZaa	I would suggest long lining him first. That way you can get him used to turning and stopping before you actually get on him. The last thing you want is to be sitting on a 17.2 shire who doesn't listen to your hands.|`|1kSRPadaaa	try a happy mouth or rubber snaffle. yea i think it is going to be hard. i suggest you be very patient|`|WPBYP2ilaa	HI my friend has broken in horses for years and last year i watched her do a 14 year old 14.2 cob mare. She always said the older they get the harder it is because they are set in their ways. So it can be done but i would pay someone how knows what they are doing. I have had  a go at long reining some of hers and it is not as easy as it look. She always uses a breaking bit and breaking harness.  Hope this helps and good luck.    just to let you know the 14 year old had been sat and played with.

qnL2JYihaa	It might be worth trying another vet.  I know that pills exist to stimulate a cat's appetite - my vet gave me some when my cat was having kidney trouble.  He told me at the time that if they did not work, then it was probably the end.  Fortunately they worked, and the cat started eating again after only a few days on the pills.|`|bxlYleZkaa	She has lost her sense of taste and possibly smell as well. Try to tempt her with foods which are brighter in colour or hand feeding with something soft like meaty baby food..|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Firstly i'd suggest a change of vet!!! Why is someone so uncaring in a profession that requires care and understanding? Secondly, consider her age in our years - she's extremely old and, as with us humans, once we reach our dotage our taste buds go up the wall ha ha. I'm not saying that we'd all plump for sardines on toast when theres jam already on it but i think you get my drift! Whats happening to your old girl happened to my cat when she reached 19! She passed over when she was 23 so i had plenty of time to get used to her new, fussy ways. Things she adored all her life were left in her bowl and she wanted new taste's, new textures etc etc, got on my wick to be totally honest because she'd eat a new tin of food one day, muggings here would think i'd stumbled on the solution and so stock pile her cupboard only for her to refuse it the next day!!! As long as she's healthy in all other aspects then her taste buds have just aged! Don't, as i did, go out and buy lots of her new favourites because they'll be wasted but do offer her everything she previously deemed disgusting - you'll get a surprise ha ha. She may also prefer to be hand fed - their eyes give out but she won't want you to know that - so if she won't go near her bowl at all it may be because she can't see it so clearly as she used to! You've been doing something right for the last 16 years which convinces me she'll live for many, many years to come, God willing, but you should give yourself a pat on the back, or have an extra pint for caring and loving her so well that she's lived 'till this great age, well done!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Take her to another vet if you're not happy with the advice of the first one. 'Force feeding' is a harsh term, it really only means putting food in her mouth with a spoon or syringe, it does not necessarily mean shoving food down her throat. This would only have been part of the care the vet advised, it would not have been a solution or cure.    The cat is old, and there will be a reason for why she's not eating, which needs to be uncovered. Most vets would offer blood tests. Up to you how much investigation, if any you want to do. It could be as simple as her having rotten teeth and hence a sore mouth, tho presumably this would have been one of the first things the vet checked. At her age, there are any number of things that are more likely to be wrong.    Chalice|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Well, 16 is really not that old.  I might look for another vet, since a response to force her is not really a solution.  One needs to explore if there are health reasons.  Tooth problems could be a reason.  After all, cats are experts at hiding problems.    For instance, if she is a bit under the weather and cannot smell her food, she won't eat.  A solution for that is stronger smelling food, or adding some baby food (not with onions or garlic) to give it a stronger scent.|`|4TX26viFaa	If she has a clogged nose or is loosing her sense of smell, that would be enough to make a cat not eat.  Consider that her age may have done this to her just recently.    Or she may have the start of a nasal infection from a cat cold. When a cat can't smell food, they don't recognise it as food, quite often.    Try enticing her with something stronger smelling--a can of EVO has a strong smell.  Or baked chicken (no coating or bones though).      On the other hand, if it's a case of a broken or cracked tooth, a mouth ulcer, or a growth in the throat, the cat won't eat because it's painful to do so.  Going with an extremely soft food like meat baby food in those little jars may help.    You should have her looked at with a checkup at the vets, with a lot of attention paid to the mouth in case it's issues there.  They can also check her other senses to see if eyesight and hearing loss are progressing as well.|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	like sue said go to vet and giver those pills as presribed by the vet if that doesnt work take to vet to place a tube in her stomach. if hse doesnt eat she can die of hapatitc lipdosis.

I hope she eats soon
4yt4D3vMaa	I've seen this with my rabbit once or twice when he hasn't seen me approach the cage and gets a fright-it is quite scary to see as they really look like they will hurt themselves! It was probably worse with your rabbit as you haven't had him long but it sounds like he's calmed down now-just remember in future to talk loudly in future before you get near his cage in case he's asleep or doesn't see you.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	he's probably frightened. It's only been a week you said, so he's still getting used to you and his cage. Rabbits do very weird things when they are scared, mine squeals like crazy. The first week, rabbits aren't that fun because they don't cuddle with you or show affection, but after a couple weeks, they warm up to you and begin to love you, we've had mine for about a month and she now licks my face and burrows into my hooded sweatshirt, she is awesome!|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	Sounds to me like he has figured out that you let him out when your around and he running away because he knows you want to lock him away.. rabbits are very clever and pick up on little routines like this.    My rabbits do similar things especially the boy, Roger.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	It's a fear response.  Your rabbit is for some reason absolutely terrified of you or something else.  I've seen this before with feral strays I've worked with through my rescue work and outdoor housed rabbits when there is a predator outside their cage they are trying to escape from.  Find your bunny's closeness threshold and work from there.  How close can you get before he runs?  Then toss treats to him.  Slowly get closer and closer to him.  Sit on the floor, at his level, it is less confrontational.  Don't pick him up, and don't restrain him when it isn't totally necessary (like nail trimming).  With time, he will not panic at your approach, but will welcome it as an opportunity for treats and pets.|`|XI2iylR4aa	It really sounds to me like he was scared.  Rabbits do crazy things when they're scared.      Maybe you startled your bun when you walked into the living room?  If you came in quietly, he might not have heard you.    He has only been with you a week, I'm sure that once he gets used to you, this behavior will stop, or at least slow down.  We have had our bunny for about three months...when she first came to live with us, whenever she heard a noise, she thumped her back leg, and darted off.  Now she's much more laid-back, and she runs TO us, not away from us.    It really sounds like he was just scared.  In the future, when you're approaching him, make sure you talk to him, in a gentle, but loud enough voice.  If you can, spend a lot of time in the same room with him.  When you're on the phone, be in the same room, watch TV with him, and eventually he'll get used to you.    Good luck with your bun!

ekb5oSsZaa	I would have to say a teddy bear hamster would be the best. They can live in a small wire cage and don't smell bad unless you don't clean their cage once a week. And they only pee in one corner. If you don't want them loud at night i would suggest getting them a wheel that doesn't make a lot of noise other then that the only other time they are loud is when they nibble on the bars cause they want to get out. And you could Absolutely keep it in your room. Also make sure you buy chew sticks for it if you decide on a teddy bear hamster their teeth grow pretty fast and you have to make sure they don't get too long or they won't be able to eat or drink. good luck!|`|ner3pemNaa	I know its hard for people to get but cause they have a bad reputation but birds actually do make pets and you can make them very cuddly cockatiels are probably about the cheapest decent one but conures which start for about $200 and can go up to the low $1000's are also very good.

They are very clean animals - you can even bath and brush them if you want although you don't have to. They aren't loud at night - although if they decide to have a drink or something during the night that could wake you. They are very cuddly and friendly. =]
n4pNNcGfaa	I presume because they use a different explosive than is commonly used in bombs.  Dogs aren't taught to generalize "explosive."  They don't even know they are sniffing explosives.  They are taught to find specific scents and to signal when they do find them.  So the trainer has to teach the dog the scent for each kind of explosive he'd like the dog to detect.

XI2iylR4aa	In my experience, when they've gotta go, they've gotta go.  My rabbit is very reliably litter trained, so we make sure that she always has access to a litterbox.  We let our bun run around the house but she always runs back to her cage (and her litterbox) to go.  She never pees or poops outside of the cage, but I bet if we blocked off access to her cage for more than a few minutes, she might, and it would really be our fault, not hers.<br>  <br>  If you want to hold the bunny in your room or something, away from the cage, you can always bring the litterbox with you, to make sure the bun has access to it.  I've had bunnies pee on my bed before, which is not something I'd like to relive, haha.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your litter training!|`|mItsW20naa	I've has many rabbits and i didn't really "train" them, but like two of them would only go when in the cage and would hold it until they were in there, and a few of the ones i've had would go anywhere, anytime! So I think it depends on the bunny..

IuYekkPVaa	Cats often groom each other as a sign of affection, and this is what your kitten is doing when she licks you. Some kittens grow out of this habit, but other continue to do it even when they are fully grown.<br>  <br>  Don't use your hands as toys when you play with her, otherwise she will grow up thinking your flesh is fair game at any time.  Use toys that dangle off the end of a wandstick, so that she can be as aggressive as she likes with the toy, but you don't get hurt.  When she does bite, simply tell her "no" or hiss (this reawakens memories of the mother cat's discipline).  If she doesn't back off immediately, tell her "no" or hiss again, gently move her aside and walk away ignoring her until she calms down.  This will teach her that rough behaviour won't be tolerated and that the fun stops when she bites.  <br>  <br>  She's also at an age where her adult teeth are coming through, and kittens often bite to relieve the pain.  You can offer her soft rubber toys to chew or take a clean face cloth, knot it, dampen it with water and put it in the freezer to chill.  (Biting on something cool can help relieve the pain of inflamed gums.)<br>  <br>  All cats are individual, so it's not possible to predict how much her personality will change as she gets older.  If you are patient and always treat her with respect, the more rewarding your relationship will be with her.  The Messybeast web site is one of the best ones out there and has lots of interesting information about cats and their behaviour, which you might enjoy reading.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/catarchive.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/catarchive.htm</a><br>  <br>  I've not tried nail caps, so can't offer you any advice on that subject.  Make sure that your kitten has lots of items that she is allowed to scratch, and if necessary trim the ends of her claws to blunt them a little.  These links have helpful advice on how to do this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  Some cats are perfectly content not to go outside. So if seems like she's not enjoying going for walks, then it's probably best not to continue.  The web site below has a very helpful article with lots of ideas and suggestions on ways to keep an indoor cat happy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/frameset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  It's said that catnip has no effect on cats under the age of 6 months and only 30% of adult cats react to it.   Interestingly, it's only cats which originate from countries where catnip grows who react to it. Oriental and Asian breeds of cat don't possess the necessary gene because catnip doesn't grow there.  Other alternatives you can try when she's a little older, are honeysuckle, which comes in a spray version or Valerian tea bags inside an old sock. <br>  <br>  All cats have mad half-hours when they run around as if being chased by an invisible creature and use the furniture as an obstacle course.  Because they spend so much of the day time sleeping, it's just a release of pent up energy in one concentrated burst.<br>  <br>  This link has lots of leaflets on cat care, which you may find helpful now and in the future as she grows older.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutpets.org.uk/Pet-Leaflets-and-Articles/Leaflets.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutpets.org.uk/Pet-Leafl...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you and your kitten have many happy years together ahead of you.|`|aUmqiSOlaa	your kitty seems quite normal, the licking i think is more about being female and wanting to mother.<br>  i have never used soft claws, i just clip|`|1wHuhyPFaa	1. It could just be a stage. However, we thought this about out 9 month old kitten Twiggy as well. Every morning when you wake up she meows & cries out you until you just look her way. Once she has your attention she charges at you & stretches up & clings to your shoulders. It's literally a cat hug. We find it adorable, so we never discourage her. It's when she bites the nose that we say "No." Just because she can really startle someone like that, even if it's a love bite.<br>  <br>  2. Well, all of my cats after hitting a year & a half or so have stopped attacking your hand with bites & scratches. Especially after being fixed, I've found that if you go to their belly they just push away your hand with their paws. When Tigger has a kitten, he really cut my hand up badly though, so deciding whats too rough for you & then disciplining her with a firm "No." will be a good way to teach her she can't get TOO rough.<br>  <br>  3. Typical kitten, really. Their personality's don't change all too much, they just lose all of that energy, or at least most of it.<br>  <br>  4. No response, sorry :).<br>  <br>  5. Eep! The idea of walking a cat has always scared me. Do you have a backyard? It'd probably be best to keep walking her on a leash & harness in an enclosed place. Just because she seems to be secure in it, you never know. Cats are good at wriggling out of things & if she gets too squirmy you could lose her.<br>  <br>  6. Most cats don't experience catnip's effects until they're 6 to 9 months old.<br>  <br>  7. Thats not feral behavior :)! Thats a way for her to scratch on something, stretch out or just be a silly kitten.<br>  <br>  8. Yes, make sure she gets fixed! It's very important. A cat in heat is NO fun at all. Do you know what else isn't fun? How smart they are when their in heat. She'll pick up very quickly on doors opening & chances are she WILL get out to mate. Even if she doesn't her being in heat can attract your local tom cats to your property. It'd be a constant meowing & groaning party for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck :D.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	1. Cats groom each other out of love, and to help each other out. Cat's can't reach certain areas very well, that's why you see them lick their paws, and then swipe them over their head and face. Cats spend so much time grooming that it's as natural as walking for them. Our cats "groom" us for the same reasons. It's normal, and there's nothing to worry about.<br>  2. You need to discourage her from biting people, but encourage her to play rough with toys. Kittens teethe just like humans, so she needs something to chew on like a stuffed animal, or other toys. Make sure any dangerous pieces are removed (like eyes on a stuffed animal, because they can come loose and can be ingested.)<br>  - Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>  - Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>  - Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>  - In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>  - Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>  - If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.<br>  <a href="http://www.catcatcat.com/behav3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catcatcat.com/behav3.html</a><br>  3. It is normal for kittens to go from being full of energy, bouncing off the walls playing, to snoozing and cuddling. It's normal for kittens to be FULL of energy. Play with her lots to burn some of that energy. Remember, playing is not just fun and games. Kittens learn by playing. Stalking, pouncing and attacking are all things they practice on toys, and are skills that they use throughout their lives. So make sure she has a nice variety of things to play with, because kittens can get bored quickly.<br>  4. I have never used soft paws because I have never needed them. A cat needs to scratch, that's natural behavior and should not be punished at all!  Sometimes though, this behavior can interfere with our lifestyle and we don't want our best sofa or newly fitted carpet being used as a scratching ground.  Cats scratch to keep their claws in good shape.  Layers of the claws are shed and underneath sits a new and sharp nail which provides the best protection possible for self-defense.  Scratching is also a form of territory marking.  Every time a cat scratches, it leaves its personal scent behind.  Small glands between the toes make that possible.  You can watch how a cat stretches itself while scratching.  This helps to keep the muscles in its legs, back and paws in good health.  The claws act as a sort of anchor, and are buried into the surface of the scratched item. If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> <br>  5. Cats can be perfectly happy staying indoors all the time. Some cats do enjoy walking on a leash, but if she seems scared or unsure, don’t push her. Cats are not like dogs, and most don't like being on a leash. <br>  6. You are correct. Young kittens sometimes don't react to catnip at all--but some full grown cats don't either. My cat Fluffy did not show any interest in catnip until one day I had an idea to make catnip tea. I put a little in a shallow dish and he sniffed it, drank some, then plopped onto the dish rolling around like many cats do.<br>  7. Cats of all ages can do some strange and silly things that we don't understand. It sounds like she's just playing.<br>  8. I didn't see any information about a vet? Have you taken her to get a check-up? You definitely need to do that and get her first shots if that has not already been done.
N9pKl35Xaa	I think in the heat of the moment circumstances alot of people would risk their own life for their dog, like running on to thin ice to save it. But sometimes i think its just in peoples nature to put other people and other things before themselves just because they mean more than anything in the world to them. Like im only 18 so i dont have my own family of kids and a husband to worry about (yeah im aware i have other family!) but i would risk my own life to save my dogs life, even running into a burning house just out of heat of the moment thinking.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it is wrong to think about how you would save your dog over your own life, but i do think its wrong and odd the extent some people go to to save their dog. Like trying to wrestle a crocodile that has its jaws around it with limited to no chance of survival for the dog at that time. That kind of extent is a tad bizarre and a little too much push come to shove.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	it is odd as then who would take care of these pets that you love so much, value so much?<br>  <br>  most people don't think of these things and there would never be a reason for you to have to choose your death to preserve your pets life<br>  <br>  get some help|`|OWGBAiXtaa	Yes, it is odd and maybe even morally wrong that you would die for your pets.

The hole was there because there was a swift tidal current being channeled under a bridge.  My dog was in danger of being swept under the ice if she couldn't pull herself out.  I was frantic but knew I could die if I tried to save her.  The ice was too thin to support me, and there were no other people around to help me.  I made a conscious decision  to stay on shore and not risk my life for my dog.  She managed to claw her way out somehow and was hardly shaken by the whole ordeal.|`|kKgf6itqaa	It's not wrong but it is slightly odd because if you died to save your pets then you wouldn't be around to love or care for them so there wouldnt be much of a point.

Any good quality dog or cat foods can be a temporary fix, but really isn't good for hamsters in the long run like it is for rats (only specific cat foods can be used as a staple for rats). Plain cereals will also work. Things like plain Cheerios, Rice or Wheat Chex, plain CornFlakes etc.. Nothing with added sugars (frosted cereals or fruit flavored).<br>  <br>  Any of these and even combinations can be used for a temporary fix for hamsters. They're hardy animals and won't freak out too badly about a sudden diet change for a couple of days.

Most contain a few things that shouldn't rule out a good breeder (like having more than one breed - I know plenty of people who show & breed more than one breed of dog).<br>  <br>  My #1 question that sorts out the backyard breeders from the good ones?<br>  <br>  "Are you an active member of your national and/or local club?"<br>  <br>  Someone who is an active member of their national breed club and/or local breed club is a person who cares for the breed.  <br>  <br>  Anyone who says "no" is not a person I want to deal with.<br>  <br>  Remember, some breeds (chesapeake bay retriever jumps to mind) do not have local clubs, only a national club.  In some areas of the country there is no local club.  Make suitable allowances.  But if they say the club is too political, yadda yadda yadda, write them off and look for a better breeder!<br>  <br>  Remember, some national and local club breeding lists have requirements that occasional, but responsible breeders cannot meet (like two litters every 5 years).  Just because they aren't on the breeders' list does not make them a bad breeder.  Or they can't handle the number of inquiries being so easily available brings.  Simply ask why they aren't on the breeders' list.<br>  <br>  But every good breeder IS a member of their national club.  And I want them to be an ACTIVE member!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	My Goodness where do l start?Firstly after  you have done your initial search for a reputable Breeder that is registered then comes the hard part,how do you know they are either reuputable,honest or have the irght puppy for you.It is all important to tread carefully with a Breeder but certain questions you are entitled to know which are Have they the sire and dam of the puppy so you can see them?If not the sire as they may have used an outside dog to get new blood lines l can assure you they will have a pedigree and photos to show you.Ask them in a polite way how long they h ave been breeding dobermans as you are very concerned about getting a puppy suitable for y our needs that is temperament tested ,has clear health certificates ie HD,VVB etc.if they do not, avoid them as they are not a proper registerd Breeder as they must comply with the AKC or their Country's Code of Ethics which is usually to test for genetic diseases.Ask about the age of the puppies.Inoculations,microchipping,wormi... or rabies shots if applicable.Obviously you want to know what achievements they have gained either in the Show Ring or Obedeience as some people get pretty sick of the Show ring after awhile.Of coursee if both parents are multiple champions you h ave a good start.<br>  Listen to them as they excplain what THEY are looking for in a puppy owner as a lot of people are not suited to dobermans as they are highly intelligent animals,wonderful companions and family dogs but very very powerful,wilfull and need Obedience ttraining.You will be asked whether you have fences,time to exercise your dog,go to Obedience,follow their diet plan and the list goes on.it is all very well you knowing what to ask anyone can do that but until you get past this first hurdle and see a few litters and Breeders you will then be able to ask the relevant questions although most  Breeders will tell you volunrtarily the history of their breed,what they h ave achieved and what the dogs have achieved so it works both ways<br>  Avoid fancy websites as that is packaging and nothing else look carefully at the litters they have produced and what they have achieved plus the usual immunization,health tests and of course are they registered as do not even think of touching someone who is not a registered breeder,having said that not all registered breeders are honest or test or would actually fall into the category of good breeders that is up to you to decide after talking to them,visiting them and looking carefully at not only the puppies but the surroundings ie is it clean,does it look like they are mere kennel dogs or are house dogs as well.of course if you are a Breeder and have 20 dogs not all can come in the house but all of us have house dogs.Watch out for any aggression towards you or even them.Avoid timid pups<br>  Do not worry about the barking of the adults that is natural as they are a super guard dog but with one flick of a hand they should stop their noise.<br>  All important ,see if they work on a contract system where you have rights and so do they.This means you are allowed time to have the puppy vet checked,have a return policy and refund,de-sexing policy,inoculation history of both parent and offspring.Registereed papers for pups<br>    The most important thing you have to remember is not to buy the first puppy you see and if they are prepared to sell to you on the spot without you having brought a crate to transport a puppy home,organized your house for a puppy they are only after money and not proper breeders.<br>  You may find you have to go far and wide to find what you want but do it as it is worth it in the long run as you will get a well socialized puppy,inoculated,well cared for,vet checked,health checked,wormed and temperament tested.You cannot afford to make a mistake as it is your money and many many years of fun and enjoyment you wish to have with the puppy you buy.If the Breeder hands you a puppy and says this is for you,do not take it unless you trust the Breeder that they understand your family,lifestyle and needs.Sure some pups will not be avail to you as they m ay be show potential pups and not to be sold to a pet home.<br>     l am sure you have heard enough from me but as l used to breed dobermans l normally do the grilliing not the buyer and even the breed l have now very few get past me without answeing MY questions too so it works both ways does it not.?if they are not interested in YOU and what you are after forget thenm and move on to another Breeder.<br>    Just to give you a case in point.l had puppies for sale and got an e-mail asking me what did l mean by the term'manipulative',you do not need a dictionary to look this up you can do it on the Internet.same person asked,do l deliver and how much are the puppies.l am very very rarely rude to people but could not resist saying this is not a

Rw7gi86Naa	That would be like a guy saying to his wife, "Well, we already have four kids... what's the big deal if we have another?" It may not seem like a big deal, but once you add up the extra doctor bills, food expenses, sibling rivalrys... it can make a LOT of difference. It may not seem like a huge difference at first, but it will change how every other cat feels and acts. It may be too overwhelming, it may not. It all depends on the other cats' dispositions. If you have plenty of room, plenty of litter boxes, and you budget allows, then it's up to you and your family. If any of your cats are elderly or weak I would say it's not a good idea to get another.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to adopt the fifth cat, here's some advice:<br>  <br>  If you haven't brought the kitten into your home yet, when you see it next wipe him/her down with a towel and bring it home with you.  Set it very casually on the floor, and let your cats approach it, (don't bring your cats to the towel like you're showing them, let them find it on their own).  If you have plenty of time in advance, then leave the towel around for several days, and even bring more towels with the kittens’ scent.  Place them several places in the house, in the same way you “planted” the first one.  It may also be helpful to rub each of your cats down with separate towels and bring them to the kitten.<br>  <br>  When it’s time for the kitten to come home for the first time, as you are distracting your resident cats, have a friend, (someone who doesn’t live with you) bring the kitten in and place him or her in a room with the door closed.  Also ask your friend to get the food and water dishes and the litter box set up in the closed room.  Include toys and a bed, (or just a box with towels).  The litter box should be in the opposite side of the room from the food, water and bed.  DO NOT set up the kittens room before you bring him home.  This will only confuse your cats.  The point is to make your older cats think that the kitten suddenly, (and magically!) appeared, without your knowledge.<br>  <br>  Your cats will approach the door and pick up on the scent of the kitten.  Don’t get discouraged or worried if you hear some hissing and growling, as this is very common.  For the first couple days, spend a limited time in the room with the kitten and make sure to give your resident cats plenty of affection, even more than usual. Another helpful thing to try is to attach two toys with a string, and leave them on opposite sides of the door, so the cats can play together. <br>  <br>  Cats are very territorial animals, and this is why you don’t want them to see the kitten as an intruder that YOU brought home and shoved in their faces.  Cats are very much creatures of habit and routine, so when their routine is disrupted, don’t be surprised if they become very angry.  You must be the judge of when they should meet face-to-face, but don’t push things too quickly, it may take a few days of sniffing each other under the door before they have settled down.  When you believe they have calmed down and are ready, casually open the door a few inches.  Remember, you are being nonchalant about this; do not force them on each other.  You should pick a time after both the kitten and your resident cats have just eaten; feed them a treat that you know they will love, (like some of their favorite cooked meat).  They will be content and their bellies will be full, so they’re less likely to want to exert a lot of energy in a cat fight.  Supervise them and don’t be surprised if one of the older cats swats at or fights with the kitten.  Don’t step in and separate them unless someone’s getting hurt worse than just a scratch on the nose. The kitten will probably retreat into his room at which time you should close the door.  Increase the time you allow them to interact each day.  Don’t leave them together unattended until you are confident that they comfortable with each other.  Be patient.  It may take a few weeks or even a few months, but if all goes well they will soon become the best of friends.<br>  <br>  Extra tip: to ease the initial tension of introduction, rub each cat down with brewer's yeast powder. Brewer's yeast is available in natural food stores. It's all natural, full of vitamin B, and will actually go good for the cats to lick it off. The smell of the brewers yeast helps disguise the foreign odors and each cat will basically smell the same. Don't use anything like baby powder because the talc isn't good for the cat to breathe or ingest. You should use the same grooming tools (combs, brushes, towels, mitts) on both cats to transfer their scents to one another.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11589437	We have 5 because we sort of couldn't do otehrwise, we rescued her when she was hit by a car and now she won't go away, so we kept her. It is still acceptable and livable. It is not so different than having 4, but 4 is a crowd already. 2-3 is the perfect situation,  they are still easy to transport all together etc. 5 is a bit much. So my advice is: do adopt a 5th cat if she is in real need of a home and you can't do othwerwise, but don't try to adopt a 5th cat just because you liek cats. Keep an opening for when you will find a kitty who really needs a home. If this is the case, take it.|`|V8rV38yfaa	Get the fifth cat and introduce it well.

Just because they split into pairs doesnt mean theyll oblige in that way, theyll each have their own personalities and will fit with some cats better than others.|`|1wHuhyPFaa	Well, I've never had 5 cats, but when we had 4, it sounded like a lot, but never seemed like a lot. Just recently, our Tigger passed away. Having 3 is a big shock. The house is a lot more quiet & it feels as if we don't see the cats as much.<br>  <br>  My aunt has 5. In a one bedroom apartment, mind you. And her cats are all very different. One hides a lot, one hangs out on the refrigerator a lot & the other 3 are the ones who tend to roam. She never feels overwhelmed by it. She has a dog too.<br>  <br>  But, you can have all the space in the world. The real matter is, do you have the money to take on a 5th cat? It may be easy to assume you'll never have to take more than one cat to the vet in a 3 month interval, but sometimes, it happens that way. One could get sick & give it to the rest. Things like worms & fleas all would require treatments that aren't too cheap. <br>  <br>  If you feel you can financially handle a 5th cat, then start to think, do you feel you have enough space for each cat to have it's own "place"? Are any of your cats bonded very well? If so, the 5th may feel like an outsider & cause trouble. This is what happened with my cat Lui. He was the third cat & hated that he wasn't being accepted, so he chased our cats all over until one day he got put in his place by the alpha, Tigger & then he kind of became a one man cat, lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you figure it out.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	If you can afford it, go for it.|`|inST4SlAaa	if you have the room and the time then go for it!!<br>  <br>  you already have the love for a fifth cat
45N6tmWraa	Sorry, Samantha, lots of people will be uneasy about talking with you because of the fear of attracting attention from animal activist groups, who may not always be the most moderate and reasonable in their views.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you can find some information supporting the use of animals in scientific research at this site:  <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=guidelinespolicies_animalsinresearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=gu...</a><br>  <br>  Consider that EVERY medical advance in the past 100 years or so has involved some type of animal testing, and consider if that is important.  Has anyone you know ended up in the hospital recently?  If so, and they survived, thank an animal, AND a research scientist.  Scientific research involving mammals and birds is very closely regulated, with layers of rules and laws and inspections from local to federal.<br>  <br>  You may not agree with the whole premise.  That's the American privilege.  But objectors should be consistent--if you don't ever support any type of animal use, don't eat meat, don't wear leather, don't take medications or have surgery, etc.
jyGTlpzTaa	I hope you're not planning on putting male and female in the same cage...you do realise that hamsters can have 20 babies, fall pregnant straight after mating and those 20 babies can have 20 babies six weeks after? When you take into account the fact that dwarves are very hard to sex at a young age, you can quite soon have 1000's (literally) of hamsters within a year.<br>  <br>  As regards the OVO, unless you have the OVO loft it is cruelly small. I wont knock it otherwise, I find it a total pain to take apart to clean, but if you can put up with that, its up to you, but the Ovo pads and Suites are similar to locking a human in a single room for their whole life and only letting them out for an hour or so a day. The Loft is cool though, if you add that its definitely big enough.<br>  <br>  As for tunnels, you will need to replace your vertical tunnels with the OVO mini tubes, these are designed for dwarf hamsters and mice, normal tunnels that run vertical can be quite dangerous for these hammies as they can fall top to bottom. Also, when they get older it is best to orientate the cage horizontally (so the hams dont have to climb up and down tubes, just walk along them), as they get less mobile as they get older and are more likely to fall.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the essay!<br>  <br>  Edit: If your hamsters are not the size of syrians, they are regarded as dwarves. Winter whites are a dwarf species.|`|EdN7fkTgaa	Yea your hamster WOULD be able to climb the tunnels.

By nature dogs are curious and sentient beings; see that she has enough mental and physical stimulation to minimize the impulse to dig and chew.<br>  <br>  Here's how to treat this problem <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=630723410022738360393161368473" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=630723410022...</a>|`|dKyi5MLKaa	1. tell her off<br>  2. buy her some toys that are hers and if she chews your house tell her to chew her toys<br>  3. if you have a spare room let her go in there to play till you come home<br>  4. take her to the vets to be checked over<br>  5. give her a treat when she doesnt<br>  <br>  please  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AofmaWNCtlxqj_6korbNt6bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225010254AAUi7so">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yUkFvtudaa	Crate training works great.  Not only to prevent from chewing on items but to save her life if she got ahold of an electrical cord or choked on something.
tT256JQRaa	the tree bark wouldnt be a problem, but sand doesnt hold humidity or burrows very well at all, so this could cause some problems for your scorpions - i'd skip it for emperor scorpions.<br>  <br>  however, desert hairy scorpions, sand boas and bearded dragons live very happily in desert themed terrariums :)
hpeCvV6Caa	euuuhhh you looked at your cats anus! thats sick!|`|UNFxjNHkaa	sounds like a tapeworm!  Get your little one to the vet - they'll give you what you need|`|3QtO3SpFaa	My cat had the same problem. I was told by my vet that you have to continue the de-worming. It's not just a one time deal. As for contracting a disease, I have no idea. However, I don't see how you could.|`|bdc0b0f0724a4bf1ba102444af8d0705aa	a cat should be dewormed twice.  please take your kitten to the vet.  keep your hands washed, you will be okay.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	This is an easy question - same thing happened to mine, although he cried first, which is why I checked him over. I used a paper towel to get a sample for the vet. Tapeworms. There is now a topical treatment for tapeworms as there is for fleas. Very easy - one dose (based on kitty's weight) on the shoulders and the worms will be dead. What I learned is that the same wormer that kills round worms does not kill tapes. It is a separate wormer. My vet let me have the wormer without bringing kitty in. Within about 24 hours the worms will be dead and the  "bodies" are passed out in kitty's stood. Don't worry - it's a very simple fix.  If in any doubt, just use several layers to get a worm sample to show your vet. Much cheaper than an office call.  Gross, yes, but sometimes we have to do what we have to do for our beloved pets.
