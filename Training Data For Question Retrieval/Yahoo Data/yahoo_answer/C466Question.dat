I don't know how to better describe the noise coming from our toilet, but it sounds like it is about to flush and then that's it's.  Just makes a small noise, but it is doing it more and more often now.  Sometimes 3 or 4 times in a minute and without us doing anything to it.        Since it was becoming more often I was able to take off the tank cover and actually catch the noise as it happened and witnessed what was causing the noise.  Bubbles are coming up from the bottom of the pipes in the tank...I looked on line and I think that is called the water control assembly.  But I can't find online what would cause these bubbles to occur.  I hope I make sense at describing what I saw in the tank.      Any help would be greatly appreciated.  This noise is driving us crazy and I'm sure it's affecting our water bill.

20090129080707AA87pGu	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Cold spots inside of house?	Was wondering if anybody could help me out with this. My house has central heat and air, the windows in my living room and dining room are fairly new. For some reason my living room and dining room are really cold. I can't find any air leaks around the windows, I've put caulking around the door in my living room so no cold air is coming through, and the windows in the living room don't leak, I have heavy duty blackout blinds in the living room. My walls have insulation in them, and outside around the windows are caulked. Is there anything else that I can do to make these rooms feel warmer? I don't know what R value the insulation has. I do have a partial unfinished basement and a crawlspace under the rest of the first floor. I don't have an attic, my house is 1 and 1/2 stories

I am new to the whole plant growing thing and have started a few bhut jolokia pepper plants. The plants are sitting in a window that gets more than enough sun light during the day. I have a t8 fluorescent grow light which by timmer comes on at 6pm and off at 6am when the sun begins to rise. Is this too much light for my pepper plant? Also, I have the pepper plants about 5 inches away from the light and have checked to see if there is too much heat, which there is not. (I believe?) Do the plants need to be further away from the light? Thanks everyone!
