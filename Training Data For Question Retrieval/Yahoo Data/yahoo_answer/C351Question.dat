I hope so because I am so sick of the woman always living at the end, especially when she acts so unpleasant that you wish she'd die along with most of the others in the movie. If I could have the woman die and one of the guys live at the end as the sole survivor, that'd be great.      I'm 28 years old and I'm a guy and I've watched so many of those movies and have gotten so sick of the seeing the sole survivor be the woman a long time ago. (Black Christmas, 2004 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th movies, Nightmare on Elm Street Movies, The Wishmaster movies, and the list goes on and on.)      I hate seeing the guy die and the woman live in the movies, especially when it's all the time. DOES ANYONE AGREE WITH ME?

Through The Fire And The Flames      On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light   In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight   When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right   The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight      Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore   The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores   On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go   In fire and pain, and once again we know      So now we fly ever free   We're free before the thunderstorm   On towards the wilderness our quest carries on   Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight   Deep inside our hearts and all our souls      So far away we wait for the day   For the light source so wasted and gone   We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days   Through the fire and the flames we carry on      As the red day is dawning   And the lightning cracks the sky   They'll raise their hands to the heavens above   With resentment in their eyes   Running back from the mid-morning light   There's a burning in my heart   We're banished from a time in a fallen land   To a life beyond the stars      In your darkest dreams see to believe   Our destiny is time   And endlessly we'll all be free tonight      And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality   All alone in desperation, now the time has gone   Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind   Day after day this misery must go on      Now here we stand with their blood on our hands   We fought so hard now can we understand   I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can   For freedom of every man

I never know what to say, what to do   I might just be caught up in you   Possibly caught up in you   With everything you do   I am caught up in you         To me, your everything I dreamed of   Honestly i never want you to leave   You looked at me,   I looked at you   In my mind i was smiling   The bell rung, and i walked up to you   I had something to say   I looked in your eyes   And everything came out         Its not a secret anymore   That im in love with you   You know i love who i am   when im around you   Now im just a bit caught up in you   You said it to   'i love you'

20090128150102AAKhi5J	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	What is there to like about Rap/hip hop, rock, country etc?	I used to listen to a little bit of rap/hip hop until i found metal but i want to know why others would prefer rap/hip hop or maybe any other genre.   why i like metal: some of my favorite bands incorporate so much into their songs its just unbelievable. the stereotype of "satan worshiping, wrist cutting screamers"  is dispelled immediately  when listening to the bands i listen to. While they do "growl" they also sing and have very nice clean vocals. and when i listen to music im not listening to it for the "vocals" or the "lyrics" im listening to it for the guitar, bass guitar, drums etc. some bands have very skilled guitarists and vocalists however and i do appreciate the vocals but its not all about the voice. to me its being able to speak through the drums and guitars to give you that feeling whether it be anger, calm (yes there actually is a lot of calm in metal), sadness or whatever. metal isn't just about a bunch of headbanging yahoos (hah). heres a link to one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands. and please be descriptive and elaborate in your answers!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88WJlsqcc...

"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"   "The Dark Knight"   "Iron Man"      Not a surprise that the two arguably most successful films from last summer get this recognition for all that flashy stuff. Of course w/ "Benjamin Button," u get a visual spectacle, u'no, like the moving backwards stuff, that makes "Iron Man" look as innovative as "Fantastic Four" or a Jason Statham movie. I'd pick either "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" or "The Dark Knight."      So which film's visual effects impressed u the most? The 81st Oscars take place February 22 on ABC.

20090128160255AAf518c	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	"Hit it like you like it" Song lyrics ... what is the title?	Help please...i heard this song on the radio. It was kind of like a funky rock/blues song with a catchy chorus that is sung by a male singer with backup vocals(?) saying something like: "hit it like you like it".    If its any help it had a very rememberable guitar riff throughout the song and it also included the word "newspaper" in the lyrics (its all i can remember)         #Also is this helps at all, it sounds like a very Rolling Stones-influenced song or might actually be by the Rolling Stones(but i doubt that),    And also its not "It's only rock and roll but I like it" by the Rolling Stones, but it does sound similar to it.      If anyone can help me out with this it would be appreciated! thanx!

All of them were very well in fact. I was just confused a bit, and wanted to know your opinions...      Rhona Mitra acts as the main character in the 3rd, yet Kate Beckinsale's character in the first 2 are different than Sonja (in the first two it's Selene).       So, because the setting of the third movie takes place before the other 2 (kind of like Star Wars :P), who is Selene in the first 2 UnderWorlds? At first I thought she was the daughter of Sonja, but she died before her baby was born :|

20090128172456AA9LmQM	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Why are nearly all superheroes either based or in New York?	Don't get me wrong I've been a comicbook fan for years but,as I gotten older I always wondered why comic characters are always in Newyork?I mean I guess **** doesn't happen in Chicago,Detroit,LA,Baltimore,Houston,eve... DC.Its funny to me because you never catch Thor or Superman in the ghettos of South Central. The point I'm trying to make here is that crime is everywhere and not in one location.I'm a comicbook artist myself and to me its kind of lame.With my material I basically have numerous charcaters in diffrent cities and in diffrent states.The reason for this is how they hell could you have all these people running around in one major city I mean come on NY is big but not that big.I think its better to be a little more diverse I think the reason why this happens is that alot of the writers and creators can only relate to their neck of the woods hopefully I can change that.

Okay, change the format, but at least have the common DECENCY to put it in the details of the show and/or commercial! It would be like you tuning into a show about weightloss only to find out it's about the host's hemorroids.    Bait and switch baby!      I really like Tyra Banks, but my love for her show is diminishing, since she is making it about her and leading her fans on about what the show is about and then totally taking half of it and doing something stupid and off the wall.    Your thoughts?

20090128185927AAPpbDf	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should I tell or stay quiet?	I live in the dorms on a dry (that is, no alcohol allowed) campus.      I am 19, and I don't drink. My suitemates (with whom I share a bathroom) are both 18 and they do drink. I don't really care that they do, except that they keep all their empty bottles in our shared bathroom.      About once a month, there is a fire drill and the RAs go into everyone's room and bathroom to make sure no one is in there during the drill. These bottles are displayed prominently within the bathroom, so I know the RA would see it when she went in.      Even though the bottles are all on my suitemates' side of the bathroom, it is still my bathroom and I can clearly see the bottles every time I go in there, which means it is my problem too.      I don't know what to do... if my RA finds the bottles, I would have to share the blame with my suitemates and we would all get referred to the dean's office and also possibly get cited for Minors in Possession.      If I tell my RA, then I will not be punished by the university or by the law, but my suitemates will know I said something and they will be extra mean to me... they are already very passive-aggressive and I don't think I have it in me to deal with any more hostility from them.      So what should I do?

Okay, so my voice teacher is WICKED intimidating and plays favourites, so whenever i have to sing in front of just him, i choke. I'm actually a pretty decent singer and can harmonize with my friends very well.       Its just the nerves of auditioning that messes with my voice! I forget when to breath, i crack, i freak out and i fail miserably. That has happened every audition since i joined the choral group! I just wish my voice teacher would have a better opinion of me, because the only time he ever hears me sing alone is for auditions.      So does anyone know how i can redeem myself? Also, how can i stop my nerves from destroying my chances at auditions?

20090128193311AAuEDpL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	Songs about faking and pretending?	ok, here's the deal. I just happen to be crazy for the biggest most ugliest douche in the world. cupid is stupid, we all know that. and, ok, lemme explain it in shakespeare language. you don't understand, your problem.   How happy o'er other some can be!   Through Athens I am thought as fair as she!   But what of that   Demetrius thinks not so.   He will not know what all but he do know.   And as he eres, doting on Hermia's eyes,   So I, admiring of his "qualitities",   things base and vile, holding no quantity.   Love can transpose to form and dignity.   Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,   and therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.   Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste   Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste   And therefore is love said to be a child   Because in choice he is so oft beguiled   As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,   So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.   For 'ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne.   He hailed down oaths that he was only mine!   But when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,   So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.   I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight,   then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her   And for this intelligence, if I have thanks,   it is a dear expense.   But herein mean I to enrich my pain   to have his sight thither and back again.       ok, get it? so basically this girl steals him away from me, and my love for him is an obsession, so I want to kill her. Not kidding. but then I move past that. But school is a total ***** with those two around, and it's really derailing my life, and then I get offered the chance to switch schools. My mom made me promise not to tell anyone, and if I did, she'd take it all away. So, a week ago, I thought I got in, and so I thought that I'd just disappear, not tell anyone.  So, have you ever wondered how people would act if you died? Well, I had the chance to do just that. I was planning on faking my suicide, And I've had a history of suicide attempts, so they'd believe it. So on Friday, I'm setting the whole thing up, saying all these heartfelt goodbyes to everyone, you know, making them wonder...uhhh...?? I'm acting like I'm really gonna kill myself Monday night. So I thought, well, how about fixing all of my problems? So I got up to "Hermia" and tell her that I'm sorry for what I did (I did a LOT of ****, tons of myspace hate mail, I'd egg her house, give her death threats to her face, call her names, throw various disgusting liquids on her from the second floor, the works.) and she, (she's in special ed, so I think something's wired in her brain that she is just so nice and agrees with everyone that she's a million faced and doesn't have an opinion of her own) and so her retarded head forgives me immediately, and now thinks we're friends again. I mean, when we were both not going out with him, I tried to be her "friend" just to get back at him, and so I told her everything, so she knew how much I loved him, and then she goes out with him, and then the NERVE of her to think that we were still friends. So I just had to be really mean to her to make her get the picture and so she wouldn't be kissing my *** all this time. So now she thinks we're friends again, and is hugging me everywhere, and inside i'm like, "get away from me! I still hate you! that apology meant jack! don't you get it, u stupid *****!" and i just can't stand to look at her and even think of her as a friend, when all this time, I've been fantasizing about smashing her dumb little head against the wall, so yeah, just A LOT of resent towards her, which is actually hate that I don't know what to do with. And also, while she was immediately hanging out with me while we were waiting for our parents to pick us up, i'm like, "he really does love you, doesn't he?" and she's like "ehhh, no, i don't think so. I dumped him, we broke up. he's a jerk." i could not have agreed more with her there. well, actually i could, but that's just an expression. And so, the whole reason why I wanted to change schools in the first place is gone, and killing myself wouldn't make that much sense now. Oh yeah, did I tell you, I didn't get in the school, so i'm stuck back here, with A LOT of awkward turtles roaming around. So I'm thinking, well, as long as I have to deal with it, I might as well pretend. So, given that sitch, could you provide me with some songs about that? about pretending? pretending to be friends? lies? how fun it is? faking it?   something along of the lines of "Friend of Mine" by Lily Allen, or that "everyone lies, nobody minds, everyone lies" by Morissey. And please provide me just with songs, none of your opinion, cuz I didn't ask. Yes, i admit i'm a mean *****. there.   THANK YOUU!!!!   :)   and I don't want you guys to tell me any of your input on me and what I should do,

20090128193543AASJ4hf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Can you please help me remeber a movie from my childhood?	So the movie continues the story after snow white was over. It goes like this:      It starts out where the prince and snow white are going to get married, but snow white's evil step-mother's brother(who has magic powers, note: he is more powerful then his sister because he can change into an animal or do anything with magic) finds out that his sister has died so he tries to get back at snow white. As the movie goes along, she is separated from the prince and she finds a house with 7 little people(dwarfs) which are girls and are related to the 7 dwarfs(the men ones). The end of the story is that the evil brother tries to turn snow white into stone forever, but it fails and he is turned into stone himself.      Tips to help you find the title of the film:   1. This is a cartoon, not done with real people.   2.If I am correct, it is not a Disney film, but I can't be sure of that.   and 3. I wish you the best of luck and thank you to all that help!

20090128210635AArGHcH	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Dr. Manhattan or the Spectre?	Dr. Manhattan or The Spectre at his peak power level when he was "grafted" onto the spirit/body of Jim Corrigan as the ultimate "spirit of vengence".(during the 70's run of Action Comics,..if anyone remembers), or the "Beyonder", or the conceptual entity from Marvel comics known as "The Living Tribunal"(Spectre and he were put on equal footing during the "Marvel VS DC" series).? Who do you think is the most powerful? Here's one out of left field;(what about Thanos(or Warlock) with the infinity gems(glove), Darkseid? Curious to see your answers or opinions. I personally am going with Warlock. Dr. Manhattan would be hard pressed to take on any of these characters that I have mentioned. Does anyone think that there is a DC/Marvel character that could ACTUALLY beat Dr. Manhattan?...again...Warlock with the Infinity Gems is my personal favorite.

I THINK. lol   And insults. haha      Say what you will about the Ten Commandments, you must always come back to the pleasant fact that there are only ten of them.      Love your enemies. It makes them so damned mad.      Fat ppl are harder to kidnap.      Never under estimate fat ppl in large groups.      What's that ugly thing growing out of your neck...... oh.... it's your head.      I called your boyfriend gay and he hit me with his purse!!!!      There are some stupid people in this world. You just helped me realize it.       God made mountains, god made trees, god made you but we all make mistakes.       Everyone is entitled to be stupid, but you abuse the privilege.       Hey, Remember that time I told you I thought you were cool? I LIED.       If you're gonna act like a dick you should wear a condom on your head so you can at least look like one !!!

Right now I'm sitting here looking at you trying to see things from your point of view but I can't get my head that far up my ***.        Yo Mama's so fat, when she stepped onto the scale it said "to infinity and beyond.      So, a thought crossed your mind? Must have been a long and lonely journey.      We can always tell when you are lying. Your lips move.       Don't you need a license to be that ugly?      If you had another brain, it would be lonely.       There are several people in this world that I find obnoxious and you are all of them.       You have a good family tree, but the crop is a failure.      After hearing you talk, I now know that the dead do contact us.      I would ask you how old you are, but I know you can't count that high.       WHICH ONE DO U LIKE BEST???????????

I'm looking for guidance and song suggestions for fun and danceable songs that are appropriate for 6 year old girls.  Obviously need to avoid bad language or adult content (sexual, violent, etc.).  I let my daughter listen to some songs that have mild adult content, but I don't want to offend any of the other parents that will be at the party.  For instance, she hears "I kissed a girl" on the radio, but I'm not sure it would be appropriate to play at her party.  Thoughts?      I'm a little out of touch with the younger pop songs.  Should I focus on Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana, High School Musical/Camp Rock, Jonas Brothers, etc?  Would it be ok to mix in some Britney Spears, Hillary Duff, Pussycat, Christina, Beyonce, Sarina Paris, Pink, etc?  She likes some songs from all of them.      Lastly, are there any pop songs that refer to a birthday girl?  I know the Beatles one, but something more current?        Thanks!

20090225154827AAVhxX2	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why do celebrities live in big houses?	Why do they HAVE to live in huge houses?  Why not just be normal?  First off, if you're an actor you shouldn't be making that much money, secondly if you have enough money to afford a mansion then for god sakes spend it on your community instead of luxuries.  For instance Brad and Angelina, the #@%^ are they doing living in a house that big and if I'm not mistaken I believe they have several.  It's crap like that, that makes me angry.  I think everyone should make enough money to be comfortable, not overly or uncomfortable.
